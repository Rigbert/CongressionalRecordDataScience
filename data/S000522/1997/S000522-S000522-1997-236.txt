The State Department has notified the House International Relations Committee of the President's intention to invoke the national security waiver clause of the Humanitarian Aid Corridor Act. That law bars U.S. assistance to any country which prohibits or restricts the transport or delivery of U.S. humanitarian assistance to other countries. The national security clause allows the President to waive the implementation of the law on the grounds of U.S. national security interests.  The beneficiary of the administration's munificence is Turkey, which has refused since 1993 to let United States humanitarian aid transit its territory to Armenia. Referring to Turkey's ethnic kinship to Azerbaijan, which has been locked in conflict with Armenia over Nagorno-Karabakh since 1988, and to the occupation of Azerbaijani territory by Nargorno-Karabakh Armenians, Ankara has closed all land routes to Armenia. The opening of an air corridor in 1995 has in no way mitigated the impact of this decision, which forces United States aid to transit Georgia.  Last year, President Clinton also invoked the national security waiver clause of the Humanitarian Aid Corridor Act, without bothering to inform Congress in advance. We learned of the administration's decision post facto, from Turkey's Foreign Minister, who announced it at a May 21, 1995, press conference. The waiver had actually been signed on May 16. This year, President Clinton, having learned his lesson and seeking to blunt criticism, at least gave Congress advance notification.  President Clinton's graciousness in 1997 does not, however, compensate for maintaining a bad policy. The arguments in the administration's memorandum of justification for the waiver, neither individually or collectively, can explain away turning a blind eye to Ankara's flouting of basic principles of civilized behavior in the international community. True, Turkey has ethnic ties to Azerbaijan, and is a NATO ally, and the United States cooperates with Turkey on a spectrum of issues. But as I said when I introduced the Humanitarian Aid Corridor Act in February 1995, it should be an obvious and unobjectionable principle of U.S. assistance that countries keeping U.S. humanitarian aid from reaching third countries should not receive U.S. aid. Nothing has happened in the intervening 2 years to change my view on this subject. However close Turkey may be to Azerbaijan, Turkey is not a party to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. There is simply no reason for Ankara to block the delivery of United States humanitarian aid to Armenia. Moreover, as a member of the OSCE, Turkey has certain commitments: the 1991 Moscow Document calls on participating states to ``cooperate fully to enable humanitarian relief operations to be undertaken speedily and effectively; to take all necessary steps to facilitate speedy and unhindered access for such relief operations; [and to] make the necessary arrangements for those relief operations to be carried out.''  The administration's memorandum of justification is a poor attempt to defend the indefensible. Turkey is impeding the delivery of our humanitarian aid to refugees. That policy is unacceptable. So is the administration's policy of refusing to confront Ankara on this fundamental issue.                          ____________________
