 In Arizona, over the years, hundreds of people have died because they lack the ability to stay cool in the summer.  This legislation is supported by the AARP because they understand, the largest senior group in America, what will happen to older Americans if it is not passed.  This legislation is supported by the National Governors Association because they know the financial problems facing States and the need for the Federal Government to act. This legislation is supported by the Southern Governors Association because they know what hot weather does to peoples' health, especially the old and the sick when they cannot stay cool.  What we are dealing with is literally a life-and-death situation. People in the hot-weather States will die when temperatures get to be 115 degrees, and they cannot afford the electricity to stay cool with air-conditioning.  People will die in the Northern tier when the weather gets 20 below zero, and they cannot afford the high cost of home heating oil or gas.
