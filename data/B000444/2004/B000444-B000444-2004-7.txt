 President, today the Senate considered a protocol to the current tax convention between the United States and the Kingdom of the Netherlands. There is substantial trade and cross-border investment between our two countries; the tax convention provides an important basis for facilitating this economic relationship. The original convention was concluded in the early 1990s, and there have been several developments in U.S. tax treaty policy in the intervening years that the protocol seeks to address. It contains several significant provisions, including a revised provision designed to ensure that the treaty cannot be used for inappropriate purposes--a so-called antitreaty-shopping provision. I commend Chairman Lugar for his diligence in bringing the protocol before the Senate.  During the Foreign Relations Committee's review of the protocol, I raised a concern about a provision in the current treaty that is not addressed by the protocol. Article 24(1) of the current treaty permits the United States to tax former citizens for a period of 10 years after they lose their citizenship, if the loss of their citizenship has as one of its principal purposes the avoidance of income tax. With one exception, this provision in the treaty is consistent with U.S. law--specifically, section 877 of the Internal Revenue Code--as it existed at the time the treaty was concluded. The exception is this: the treaty does not allow the United States to tax former citizens who become nationals of the Netherlands. Such an exclusion for nationals of the treaty partner is unique in our tax treaty practice; it is not found in any other treaty, nor is it contained in our model treaty.  The protocol before the Senate does not close this gap. Consistent with statutory amendments made by Congress in 1996, it does extend the taxation authority of the United States to former long-term residents who leave the United States to avoid taxation. But the exclusion for nationals of the Netherlands remains.  Maintaining this exclusion for nationals of the Netherlands is unwarranted, and raises two concerns. First, I wanted to be sure that retaining the exclusion would not serve as a precedent in future tax treaty negotiations. The Treasury Department has noted that such an exclusion for nationals of the treaty partner has not been included in over two dozen tax treaties negotiated since the treaty with the Netherlands entered into force. More important, the Treasury has committed in writing that it does not intend the provision in the Netherlands treaty to serve as a precedent in the future.  Second, I was concerned that maintaining the exclusion might subvert the purpose of section 877 of the Internal Revenue Code. Based on the information we have received from the Treasury, and after consultation with the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation, it seems unlikely that the provision in the treaty will, in practice, undermine the operation of section 877. The reasons for this are set forth in detail in the materials that I will seek to include in the Record.  Finally, it is worth noting that Congress amended section 877 in section 804 of The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, also known as the FSC/ETI bill, which was enacted last month. The primary purpose of the provision remains: to continue to tax people who expatriate in order to avoid tax. But the test under the revised section 877 is a more objective test--one based on income levels--than had been applied under the prior law. A question therefore arises about the relationship between the revised language in section 877 and the provision in the U.S.-Netherlands treaty, which uses a more subjective test of whether a ``principal purpose'' of the expatriating act is to avoid taxation. In a letter that I will insert in the Record, the Treasury has set forth information about its intentions for applying the treaty provision in light of the revisions to section 877.  The committee on Foreign Relations held a hearing on the protocol on September 24, 2004. The committee did not vote on the protocol, however, and therefore there is no committee report. So that may colleagues and the public will have a better understanding of the issues I have described, I will ask consent to include two sets of documents in the Record. The first is a series of questions for the record that I submitted after the hearing, and the responses from the Treasury witness at the hearing, Barbara Angus, who serves as the international tax counsel at the Department. It should be noted that these questions and answers for the record were written before enactment of the revisions to section 877 of the Internal Revenue Code in the FSC/ETI bill. The second set of documents is an exchange of letters between myself and Ms. Angus on November 15, 2004, which elaborates on the issues that I have discussed, including the Department's intentions for interpreting the revisions to section 877.  Accordingly, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the materials I have described.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Treasury Department Response to Question for the Record From Senator  Biden to Barbara Angus, With Respect to the Proposed Protocol to the Income Tax Convention Between the United States and the Kingdom of the                       Netherlands--October 6, 2004                                Question       Section 877 of the Internal Revenue Code provides for      continued taxation of former citizens and long-term residents      of the United States if one of the principal purposes of the      loss of U.S. citizenship or change of residence status is the      avoidance of taxes.       When Congress amended Section 877 in 1996 to extend this      provision to former long-term residents, the conference      report on the legislation stated that ``it is intended that      the purpose of the expatriation tax provisions, as amended,      not be defeated by any treaty provision. The Treasury      Department is expected to review all outstanding treaties to      determine whether the expatriation tax provisions, as      revised, potentially conflict with treaty provisions and to      eliminate any such potential conflicts through renegotiation      of the affected treaties as necessary. Beginning on the tenth      anniversary of the enactment of the House bill, any      conflicting treaty provisions that remain in force would take      precedence over the expatriation tax provisions as revised.''      (Conf. Rept. on the Health Insurance Portability and      Accountability Act of 1996, H. Rept. 104-736, at 329). The      Internal Revenue Service subsequently issued guidance stating      that it ``will interpret section 877 as consistent with U.S.      income tax treaties. To the extent that there is a conflict,      however, all provisions of section 877, as amended, prevail      over treaty provisions in effect on August 21, 1996.''      (Internal Revenue Bulletin 1997-10, Mar. 10, 1997, at 48.)      Presumably, however, the effect of this guidance expires in      2006, as set forth in the above-quoted conference report.       Article 6 of the protocol pending before the Committee      extends Article 24(1) and its authority over residents and      nationals to former long-term residents, but retains an      exclusion for nationals of the Netherlands, whether or not      they are former citizens or former long-term residents. Thus,      rather than follow the 1996 directive urging the elimination      of any potential conflicts between a tax treaty and Section      877, the protocol appears to preserve an existing conflict      (for former citizens who are Dutch nationals) and create a      new one (for former long-term residents who are Dutch      nationals). This exclusion of the treaty partner's nationals      also departs from the U.S. model tax treaty.       Please answer the following questions:       a. Is the exclusion in Article 24(1) for nationals of the      Netherlands found in any other U.S. tax treaty? If not, why      is it contained in the U.S.-Netherlands treaty?       b. Was the exclusion for nationals of the Netherlands in      Article 24(l) of the underlying treaty discussed in the      negotiations of the Protocol? Did the United States propose      amending this provision? Please elaborate.       c. Why was the exclusion for nationals of the Netherlands      in Article 24(1) extended to former long-term residents?       d. What is the estimated fiscal effect of (1) retaining the      exclusion for nationals of the Netherlands who were formerly      U.S. citizens; and (2) extending the exclusion to nationals      of the Netherlands who were formerly long-term residents?                                Response       Section 877 of the Internal Revenue Code, which has been      part of the U.S. tax law since 1966, provides for special tax      treatment of former U.S. citizens who gave up their      citizenship to avoid U.S. tax. Amendments enacted in 1996      strengthened these tax rules and extended the special tax      treatment to apply also to certain former long-term U.S.      permanent residents who gave up such status to avoid U.S.      tax.       Under section 877, former U.S. citizens and certain former      long-term U.S. residents are subject to special rules that      impose U.S. tax on certain categories of income that have a      connection to the United States; these special tax rules are      applicable for the 10-year period following the individual's      relinquishment of U.S. citizenship or long-term resident      status. The special tax rules apply only to individuals who      relinquish U.S. citizenship or long-term resident status for      a principal purpose of avoiding U.S. income or estate and      gift taxes. For this purpose, a presumption of tax avoidance      motive applies in the case of certain individuals whose net      worth or average annual net income tax liability exceeds      specified thresholds; this presumption does not apply,      however, to individuals who meet specified criteria.       Section 877 provides that the presumption of tax-avoidance      motive (which otherwise would apply if the individual's net      worth or average tax liability exceeds the specified      thresholds) does not apply to former U.S. citizens who fall      into one of the following classes and who submit a ruling      request to the Internal Revenue Service:       (i) former U.S. citizens who were dual citizens at birth      and who have remained citizens of the other country;       (ii) former U.S. citizens who become citizens of their      country of birth, their spouse's country of birth, or one of      their parents' countries of birth;       (iii) former U.S. citizens who for the 10 years prior to      expatriation were present in the United States for no more      than 30 days in any year; and       (iv) former U.S. citizens who gave up their U.S.      citizenship before age 18\1/2\. Analogous exceptions apply in      the case of former long-term U.S. residents.       The special tax rules of section 877 apply only when there      is a tax-avoidance purpose for an individual's relinquishment      of U.S. citizenship or U.S. long-term resident status. These      exceptions to the presumption of tax-avoidance motive      recognize that individuals who have close personal ties to      another country are likely to have non-tax reasons for a      decision to give up U.S. citizenship or long-term resident      status.       The U.S.-Netherlands treaty sets forth specific guidance      regarding how each country is to tax individuals who are      resident in the other country. Although the treaty, like all      other U.S. tax treaties, generally limits each country's      ability to tax residents of the other country, the treaty      contains specific rules that permit the United States to      apply its domestic tax rules to U.S. citizens who are      resident in the Netherlands. The treaty further provides a      rule under which the United States may apply its domestic tax      rules to former U.S. citizens who are resident in the      Netherlands and who are not Netherlands nationals. The      proposed protocol would add to the treaty a rule that extends      this same treatment to former U.S. long-term residents who      are resident in the Netherlands and who are not Netherlands      nationals.       The provision in Article 24(1) of the U.S.-Netherlands      income tax treaty that limits the imposition of the special      U.S. tax rules under section 877 when applied to Netherlands      nationals is unique among U.S. tax treaties. However, this      exception for Netherlands nationals is not qualitatively      different from the underlying approach reflected in section      877 as amended in 1996. As described above, section 877      provides several exceptions to the tax-avoidance presumption,      including exceptions for individuals who are (or become)      citizens of the country in which they (or certain family      members) were born or who have very limited links to the      United States. These exceptions in section 877 are in several      cases broader than the exception for Netherlands nationals in      the U.S.-Netherlands treaty.       The provision in the U.S.-Netherlands treaty is not      expected to produce significantly different results than      would be provided under section 877 in practice. As described      above, the special tax treatment provided in section 877      applies only in the case of individuals whose relinquishment      of U.S. citizenship or long-term resident status had a      principal purpose of tax avoidance. Because the Netherlands      imposes substantial tax on individuals who are resident there      (and only resident individuals who are subject to Netherlands      tax are eligible for the benefits of the U.S.-Netherlands tax      treaty, including the provision that limits the imposition of      U.S. tax), individuals who are trying to avoid tax are      unlikely to become residents of the Netherlands. Indeed,      pursuant to section 877, the Internal Revenue Service has      issued rulings in cases involving Netherlands nationals who      relinquished U.S. citizenship or long-term resident status in      order to return to the Netherlands, concluding that the      individuals did not have a principal motive of tax avoidance      and therefore were not subject to the special tax rules      provided in section 877. Moreover, because section 877      requires the United States to provide a credit against U.S.      tax for tax paid in the country of residence, the application      of section 877 to a resident of the Netherlands is unlikely      to result in significant U.S. tax (given the substantial tax      imposed by the Netherlands on the income of individuals who      are resident there).       Although the Netherlands agreed to the application of the      special rules of section 877 to residents of the Netherlands      who are former U.S. citizens or long-term residents, for a      period of 10 years when loss of U.S. citizenship or long-term      resident status had as one of its principal purposes the      avoidance of U.S. income tax, the exception for Netherlands      nationals contained in the 1993 treaty     (and continued in the proposed protocol) was important to the      Netherlands. This position reflects the underlying view that      the special tax rules applicable in the case of tax-avoidance      motivated changes in citizenship or residence should not be      applicable in cases where the move is to go home. As noted      above, the rules of section 877 and the exceptions contained      therein reflect a similar perspective.       In light of the limited potential impact of the exception      for Netherlands nationals, it was determined that      continuation of the exception in the proposed protocol was      not inappropriate, particularly given the narrow scope of the      proposed protocol. The focus of the proposed protocol is on      the withholding tax treatment of dividends and the limitation      on benefits provisions. Both countries were interested in the      prompt conclusion of a protocol to address these important      issues. For the United States in particular, it was a matter      of priority to secure improvements to the limitation on      benefits provisions in order to prevent the potential for      inappropriate use of the treaty through treaty shopping. It      is important that the ground-breaking changes to the      limitation on benefits provision reflected in the proposed      protocol enter into force as soon as possible. In addition,      there also were significant benefits to the United States in      having the new limitation on benefits rules contained in the      proposed protocol become public as soon as possible in order      to establish a precedent in terms of strengthened anti-     treaty-shopping provisions for other ongoing treaty      negotiations. In order to achieve these goals, at the start      of negotiations both countries agreed that this protocol      would not address other issues where there were differences      between the two countries that could slow the process and      jeopardize an important agreement.       While this protocol did not revisit the agreement reached      in 1993 regarding the treatment of Netherlands nationals      under the special rules applicable to former U.S. citizens,      the proposed protocol does include a straightforward      extension of these special rules regarding U.S. taxing      jurisdiction of Netherlands residents contained in the      current treaty to provide for coverage of former U.S. long-     term residents to the same extent as former U.S. citizens.      The current treaty does not contain special rules providing      for U.S. taxing jurisdiction over former long-term residents.      In addition, other significant 1996 changes strengthening      section 877, such as the inclusion of new categories of      income subject to the special tax rules, are applicable under      the treaty.                                  ____                                                      U.S. Senate,                               Committee on Foreign Relations,                                Washington, DC, November 15, 2004.     Ms. Barbara Angus,     International Tax Counsel, Department of the Treasury,          Washington, DC.       Dear Ms. Angus: I write regarding the protocol to the U.S.-     Netherlands tax treaty now pending before the Senate.       As you know, I have been concerned about the continuation      of the exclusion from U.S. taxation authority for nationals      of the Netherlands set forth in Article 24(1) of the current      U.S.-Netherlands tax treaty. Such an exclusion is unique to      the Netherlands treaty, and is not contained in the U.S.      model treaty. I am therefore concerned that this provision      not serve as a precedent in future tax convention      negotiations, and would be grateful for any assurances you      can provide in this regard.       Since the Committee's hearing on the protocol, the Congress      has approved and the President has signed into law a measure      that modifies section 877 of the Internal Revenue Code (Sec.      804 of The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, Pub. Law 108-     357); that provision of law, as you know, provides for      special tax treatment of former U.S. citizens and long-term      nationals who expatriate. The revised section 877 sets forth      an objective test with regard to such individuals, replacing      the prior version, which focused on whether the expatriating      individual had as a principal purpose the avoidance of U.S.      taxation.       In previous exchanges between the Department and the      Committee, Department officials have asserted to the      Committee that the exclusion in Article 24 for nationals of      the Netherlands would not produce a significantly different      result in practice than would be provided under section 877.      I would appreciate the Department's views on whether that      remains the case under the revised section 877.       Finally, a question arises about the interaction between      Article 24 and revised section 877. As noted, the latter now      contains an objective test; the former provides for continued      taxation for 10 years of former U.S. nationals and long-term      U.S. residents--provided they are not nationals of the      Netherlands--in cases where the loss of such status ``has as      one of its principal purposes the avoidance of income tax.''      I am interested in knowing the Department's views on how it      will interpret and apply these provisions, not only under the      U.S.-Netherlands treaty but also in the case of similar      bilateral tax treaties currently in force.       I appreciate your attention to this matter. I expect that      the Senate will consider the protocol to the U.S.-Netherlands      treaty during this week's session, and I would therefore be      grateful for a prompt response to the issues that I have      raised.           Sincerely,                                             Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,     Ranking Minority Member.                                  ____                                   Department of the Treasury,                                Washington, DC, November 15, 2004.     Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,     Ranking Member, Committee on Foreign Relations, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Biden: I am writing in response to your letter      of November 15, 2004, regarding the pending protocol amending      the existing tax treaty with the Netherlands. Your letter      focuses on the particular provisions in the U.S.-Netherlands      treaty and protocol relating to the tax treatment of certain      former U.S. citizens and former U.S. long-term residents. You      also asked about the interaction of the provisions in this      treaty, and in other treaties, with the provisions of section      377 of the Internal Revenue Code as amended by the American      Jobs Creation Act enacted last month.       The U.S.-Netherlands treaty includes a provision under      which the United States may apply its domestic tax rules to      former U.S. citizens who are resident in the Netherlands and      who are not Netherlands nationals. The pending protocol would      add to the treaty a rule that extends this same treatment to      former U.S. long-term residents. The provision in the U.S.-     Netherlands treaty that limits the imposition of the special      U.S. tax rules under section 877 when applied to individuals      who are Netherlands nationals is unique among U.S. tax      treaties. This special rule with respect to nationals was      incorporated in the U.S.-Netherlands tax treaty in 1993 and      has not been included in any other treaties since that time.      None of the twenty-seven agreements that have entered into      force since the Netherlands treaty entered into force      includes such a rule for nationals. This special rule in the      U.S.-Netherlands treaty has not served as a precedent for      other treaties and we do not intend for it to serve as a      precedent going forward.       In my response to your questions for the record, I      explained why we believed that the continuation of the      special rule for Netherlands nationals in the U.S.-     Netherlands treaty would not produce significantly different      results than would be produced under U.S. domestic law in      practice. We continue to believe that will be the case      following the recent amendments to section 877. Although the      test in section 377 has been modified to make it more      objective, key considerations underlying our view regarding      the practical result were the fact that the Netherlands      imposes substantial taxes on individuals and the fact that      section 877 provides for a credit that reduces the U.S. tax      otherwise due by the tax paid in the country of residence.      There has been no change with respect to this factual      background.       More generally, you asked about our intentions regarding      the interpretation of the treaty language which preserves      U.S. taxing jurisdiction over former U.S. citizens and former      U.S. long-term residents where the individual's      relinquishment of citizenship or resident status has ``as one      of its principal purposes the avoidance of tax''. The quoted      language regarding principal purpose has long been included      in the U.S. Model Income Tax Convention and thus appears in      many U.S. tax treaties. This treaty language was intended to      be read consistently with section 877. Following the      modification of section 877 in 1996 to add objective tests,      we have taken the position that those objective tests      represent the administrative means by which the United States      determines whether a taxpayer has a tax avoidance purpose.      The recently-enacted changes represent a further step in this      direction and are intended to facilitate the administration      of the special tax rules of section 877 by making the rules      more objective; however, the underlying purpose of section      877 has not changed. Accordingly, we intend to continue to      take the position, in interpreting the ``principal purpose''      language in the U.S.-Netherlands treaty and other existing      treaties, that the objective tests in section 877 as recently      amended represent the means by which the United States      detemines tax avoidance purpose.       We appreciate your interest in this issue. The pending      protocol to the U.S.-Netherlands tax treaty will      substantially improve a long-standing U.S. treaty      relationship and we believe it is in the interest of the      United States to bring this agreement into force as soon as      possible.           Sincerely yours,                                                 Barbara M. Angus,     International Tax Counsel.                          ____________________
