Speaker, I would like to clarify my vote on H.R. 3009, Enforce the Law for Sanctuary Cities Act (ROLL CALL 466). I was on the floor and inserted my voting card to record a ``YES'' vote for H.R. 3009. Unfortunately my vote failed to register. On the recorded final total tally, I am listed as having ``NOT VOTED'' even though I intended and attempted to vote in favor of the bill. Immediately prior to vote on final passage, my vote against the Democratic Motion to Recommit is recorded. I also spoke in favor of H.R. 3009 on the House Floor.                          ____________________
