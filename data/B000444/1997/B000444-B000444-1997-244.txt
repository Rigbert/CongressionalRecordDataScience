 President, we now turn to the last condition that I am seeking to strike which will require the President, before he deposits the instrument of ratification, to certify that the Chemical Weapons Convention has been amended by striking article X and article XI in several respects.  Mr. President, I apologize for the shorthand, because it does not do justice to the arguments of my friends who oppose this, but this is what we call in the trade a killer amendment. Were this to pass, there is no treaty. I will speak to that later.  With permission of the chairman of the committee, I yield to the Senator from Arizona, Senator McCain, who, as the old saying goes, has forgotten more about this treaty than most people know. I yield such time as he consumes.  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, failure to approve the amendment proposed by the Senator from Delaware would require the United States to delay ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention until we obtain the agreement of other CWC parties to delete one of the treaty's articles and significantly alter another.  I believe the issue of technology transfer is a serious one because it is the one argument that seeks to demonstrate that ratifying the CWC will actually harm the United States national security.
