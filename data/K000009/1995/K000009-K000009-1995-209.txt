It is my privilege to join him and to thank him so very much for cosponsoring the special resolution of inquiry that was filed today here in the House of Representatives asking the President of the United States to submit information to this House within the next 2 weeks answering questions that we cannot answer for the American people simply because the executive branch chose to take a unilateral action without a vote of the Congress of the United States. Congressman Taylor has outlined the amount of money that is on the line initially, money that is flowing out of our Treasury, not just in the form of loan guarantees, although we cannot get specifics on this, but we understand direct loans as well. We do not know for what duration, we do not know what the terms are. We do not know exactly what the purpose is. But we know that part of the money is being used to help Mexico refinance what are called pesobonos, the bonds that she holds, that creditors hold against her that she has to refinance. Approximately 10 billion to 16 billion dollars' worth of those are owed to U.S. investors.  I would just ask our colleagues and people around the country to be aware that this resolution of inquiry asks very specific questions of the administration asking them to give us the assured source of repayment to our country for any of the short, intermediate or long-term credit facilities that were designed by the administration and made available to Mexico, to give us any documents--we are just asking for facts here--concerning the net worth of Pemex, the state-owned oil company, the historical annual revenues of Pemex and as Congressman Taylor mentioned, to what other purposes those revenues have already been dedicated, which means that the collateral really is not worth anything.  As one of our colleagues over in the other body said, we may have to send in the 82d Airborne to collect on the oil collateral because it has been so overpledged.  We are asking for other information concerning what criteria the administration used in deciding to make loans from this fund to Mexico when in fact it has refused so many other countries around the world access to funds through that particular credit facility. So why should this situation be different and why should the Executive go around the Congress of the United States?  We are also very interested in knowing what additional replenishment of funds will be required in the International Monetary Fund and Bank of International Settlements, because they have now been drawn into this agreement and the United States does provide some of their working capital. What are the nature of those arrangements and what additional amounts of taxpayer dollars will be required to replenish those funds?  In any case, there are over seven pages of questions here, and this particular resolution was today referred to the Banking Committee. The Banking Committee under the rules of the House has 14 days in which to respond.  If I just might take 2 extra minutes here, I want to say something very important tonight that we did not talk about during the day today. That is, as a result of press clips today in the Washington Post, the New York Times, and other newspapers, the President of Mexico evidently yesterday effectively declared an end to that Government's peace efforts in that country to try to keep the lid on the uprisings that are occurring, particularly in the southern part of Mexico, and I want to say something about this, because it cuts to the quick of what is happening in relations between our two nations.  It is not enough for just the President of the United States to be friends with the President of Mexico or the biggest banks in America to be friends with the biggest banks in Mexico. Good relations between our countries depend on the people of the United States being friends with the people of Mexico. As we watch the people of Mexico stream across our borders, stream across our borders because they are hungry, our response as a nation is, well, we have to close the borders, because the exodus is so huge.  But let me say this: That all the interests on Wall Street that are watching what we do here, and I will call some of them by name, Citibank, Chase Manhattan Bank, the Fidelity mutual funds. Over there in Illinois, Archer-Daniel-Midland, you sell a lot of grain down in Mexico, but I will say this tonight: There is not one share of your stock that is worth the life of one Mexican peasant fighting for enough to eat off their land that they are being divested of. And we have to speak out for those people here in the Congress of the United States. It is not reported in the press, it is not reported on television, it is hardly reported in the newspapers. In fact one of the newspapers says today, many investors in America here have said that continuing political instability in Mexico is the main reason that they are withdrawing their money from Mexico. They have been withdrawing their money from Mexico in recent months.  It is very interesting that they are worried about the political instability. Yet you do not hear one call for democracy building in Mexico.                              {time}  1640  We do not hear one call out of Wall Street for human rights. We do not hear one call of sympathy for the farmers in Chiapas who literally plant coffee with their hands on the hillsides, and as a result of this NAFTA agreement are being thrown off of their land, and they call it in the paper, they call them rebels, and call them insurrectionists, and make them seem like they are traitors. Well, they are not traitors to the ordinary people of that land, and frankly, I think they had the real true belief in democracy in their hearts.  I would hope that our country would listen to the Catholic prelates who spoke out this morning in the New York Times, Bishop Samuel Ruiz Garcia, who said that this is a very, very serious situation. It is pointing to a solution of war, and it breaks the process of dialog.  This is not a situation that will be solved with guns or with the President of Mexico sending in the federal police. We can take a lot more lives, and I would hate to see the biggest financial interests in this country part and party to killing the common people of Mexico. That will not build friendships over the years.  But the biggest interests in this country, political and economic, ought to be for democracy-building south of our border, because only when the people there have a right to have a decent wage and to own a piece of property and have enough to eat will there be political stability and economic stability in that country and four our own country.  I felt compelled to speak out. I am very worried about what could happen over this weekend when Congress goes home with that cease-fire having been lifted, and at least I wanted to put something on record about my deep concerns, and also that those who have their monied interests at heart would also put to heart the interests of the people of Mexico and be a voice for them.
