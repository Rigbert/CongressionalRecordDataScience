President, the police chief of the District of Columbia, Cathy Lanier, testified before the House of Representatives and said this bill, which Senator Hutchison is trying to impose on the District of Columbia, would make it far more difficult for the policemen in the District of Columbia and Federal agencies ``to ensure safety and security in the Nation's capital,'' and she cited particular concerns about providing security for the thousands of dignitaries, motorcades, and special events that occur in our Nation's capital.  I wish to listen to those who are in uniform risking their lives in Washington, DC, to keep it safe for the people who live and visit here. They should be given the opportunity to make sure the laws that are written are written in a way to be consistent with the Supreme Court decision, consistent with the individual right to bear arms but also consistent with the standards that Justice Scalia mentioned.  The Childers bill that Senator Hutchison would say must be the law of the District of Columbia would repeal the District of Columbia's prohibition of carrying guns in public. That runs directly counter to the language of Justice Scalia, who said that States and cities could impose laws ``forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places.'' Does that mean we would be prohibited from searching people coming into the Capitol complex and taking their guns away under the Hutchison provision? I am not sure I know the answer to that question, but I think it is worth thinking about carefully before we consider imposing this gun ordinance from the House.  I am also concerned about the fact that this bill would repeal the right of Washington, DC, to regulate gun sales. I don't want guns to end up in the hands of the mentally ill and those with a history of felonies, violent felonies. Does that make you feel safer?  My State of Illinois, similar to the State of Virginia, recently went through this tragic episode, where someone brought a gun into college last year at Northern Illinois University, killing innocent people. It also happened across the river at Virginia Tech.  Do I think in Illinois and in Virginia we want to make sure on college campuses and other sensitive places that people do not carry firearms? Of course, I do. If I am going to send a child of mine or grandchild to a university, the first thing I want is for them to come home alive. If it means putting reasonable standards so people cannot carry guns into those surroundings, we should do it. Why would we create a different circumstance for the District of Columbia? I went to school at Georgetown University. If Georgetown wants to make certain that students do not carry guns on to certain elements of the campus, I stand behind them and I will fight for them. It is consistent with the Supreme Court decision.  I wish to tell you something, the Childers bill that Senator Hutchison would impose on Washington repeals Washington's right to prohibit the carrying of guns in public. That goes too far. To take this provision that has been written by the gun lobby and impose it on the District of Columbia and on all the people who live here is wrong.  The Senator is right; in the past, Congress has done just about anything you can think imaginable when it comes to imposing laws on the District of Columbia. Many Members of Congress who never served as mayors get their chance to pick on this city right here, to write Federal legislation that they would never think of introducing back home for their own hometowns. Let's do it for Washington; let's go ahead and try a little experiment. That is not fair, it is not just, and it is not American.  These people in this town deserve a voice in their own future, to elect people who speak for them and represent them, as we do all across America, to have a chance, as Delegate Norton has asked for, only 6 months to implement this new Supreme Court decision is not unreasonable. I know there are those who want it done today, and I am anxious to see it done, too, but I am not going to try to impose a law on the District of Columbia that is unfair, that creates insecurity where we have been warned by the police chief that it makes it less safe for visitors to the Nation's capital. That is irresponsible.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter, dated September 22, 2008, to our majority leader from some of my colleagues expressing concern about this legislation.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                               Washington, DC, September 22, 2008.     Hon. Harry Reid,     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate.     Washington, DC.       Dear Leader Reid: We are writing to express our concern      about H.R. 6842, the ``National Capital Security and Safety      Act,'' which would override the laws of the District of      Columbia on the ownership of firearms in the District. The      bill passed the House of Representatives on Wednesday,      September 17, and we understand it will be placed on the      Senate calendar without being referred to the Homeland      Security and Governmental Affairs Committee or the Judiciary      Committee.       This legislation would have a considerable impact on safety      and security in the nation's capital. In addition, we      understand that it makes at least one significant change to      federal criminal law. As a result, we are concerned about      proceeding to this bill without hearing from local and      federal law enforcement officials and other interested      parties. We also believe there should be an opportunity to      offer and debate amendments to this bill.       In short, this legislation is too important to consider      according to a truncated process. Thank you for your      attention to this matter.           Sincerely,         Frank R. Lautenberg, Dianne Feinstein, Robert Menendez,            Barbara A. Mikulski, Daniel K. Akaka, Jack Reed, Ted            Kennedy, John F. Kerry, Chris Dodd, Hillary Rodham            Clinton, Ben Cardin.
