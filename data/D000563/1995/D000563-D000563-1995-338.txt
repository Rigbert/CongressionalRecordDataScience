Speaker, I am sure the people who are following these proceedings are really at a loss to figure out which side of this aisle is telling the truth. I am not sure my 5 minutes here will convince anyone one way or the other.  I would like to lay out a few of the facts which my friends on the Republican side just do not want to point to. The fact is if you took the time to go speak to a local school principal in your hometown or perhaps one of the people who runs the local school lunch program, they would tell you, as we have all heard on the Democratic side of the aisle, that the Republican idea is a very, very bad idea  You would think, if the Republican position was so good and was going to give this authority to the local school districts and to the States, these people would be jumping up and down, and they are not. And do you know why? Because fundamentally what the Republicans are offering them is not enough money to do the job.  The Republican plan, yes, does provide additional funds in years to come. Let us concede that point. They just do not provide enough money, because we [[Page H3533]] know as sure as God made green apples that each year the cost of food is going to go up a little bit in each of our school lunch programs. We know there will be more kids enrolled in school, and we know, God forbid, if we have a recession, there will be more families that will be eligible for school lunch.  The Republicans do not build any of those possibilities into their block grant scheme. They assume none of that is ever going to occur. They think the cost of food, the increased number of kids, and the possibility of recession, the most that could ever increase the program in any given year is 4\1/2\ percent. That is it.  Then they say to the school districts, ``Listen, If that is not enough, you find a way to economize. You finds a way to cut costs.''  Do you know what principals tell me at these schools they are going to have to do? They are either going to have to cut the money that they put into classrooms, teachers, computers and microscopes and the like or basically are going to have cut kids off the school lunch program.  That really gets to the bottom line here. Is it not curious when the Republicans finally got in the majority, the first place they turned to start cutting was not waste, fraud, and abuse? The were, in fact, on the floor of the House just a couple of weeks ago asking us for $40 billion more for Star Wars, $40 billion for that loony idea under President Reagan that might have made some sense when the Soviet Union was a powerful missile threat to the United States, but does not make sense anymore. They wanted $40 billion more for Star Wars. They lost it, thank goodness. Then they turned around and said, ``We will tell you how we will save some money. We will cut school lunches.'' School lunches? Do you remember reading, I sure do not, about scandals and waste and abuse in school lunches? You do not hear about it. The reason you do not is it is being run by your local school districts, your local principals, the folks who work for them in the cafeteria. It is a good program. It is a program that most of us saw when we were growing up as a way to have a good meal each day when we went to school, and unfortunately for a lot of kids today, it is the best meal of the day. We even offer a little breakfast to the school lunch program, and the Republicans are willing to cut that, too. They think it is unnecessary. Maybe it is a frill they can do away with.  You ought to see some of the kids I have seen. You ought to talk to some of the teachers about kids who get to school who do not get enough to eat and what their school day starts out like. It is not very pretty.  My friends on the Republican side turn first to school lunch programs, which I think frankly has been a big embarrassment to them to try to explain across America. They you ask the bottom line, surely, there must be something critically important they would cut America's school lunches for, it really must be the highest possible priority.  Well, what is it the Republicans want to cut school lunches for? Why do they want to cut the food available to kids in schools? So they can pay for a tax cut, a tax cut for these same families? Well, a little bit of it, sure. But the most of the money that goes in that tax cut goes to the wealthiest people in this country. The privileged few will get the break from the Republican tax cuts. It is the kids of working families, it is the kids of middle-class families that will find their school lunches being cut.  I went into Quincy, IL, and sat down with a group of mothers and their kids and talked about the Republican plan. Mothers came forward to me and said, ``Congressman, let me tell you my story. I am not on welfare.'' This mother said, ``I am working for a living.'' One of them said, ``I am working two jobs.'' Another works 45 hours a week at fast food. They had their kids in day care. They are doing their darndest to stay off welfare. We gave them a little helping hand. You know what it is? We help pay for the meal at the day care home which the Republicans would cut.  Now, is that the way to end welfare in America, to heap more expenses on working families who are struggling every single day to make ends meet? I do not think so.  Let me offer a helping hand, whether it is the WIC program for the new mother, whether it is the day care center lunch or the school lunch, and make sure those struggling families, those working families trying to make ends meet get a helping hand to stay off of welfare and move in the right direction, the right family values, the right kind of personal responsibility.  We have to resist the Republican plan. It does nothing but cut the most vulnerable people in America. You cannot have a strong America without strong kids and strong families.                          ____________________
