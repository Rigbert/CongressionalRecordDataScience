 President, this may be a very well-intentioned amendment. It is very appropriate to bring up these educational issues. But it is not appropriate on a bipartisan tax reduction bill that this Senate requested in the budget resolution adopted 2 weeks ago. I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment.  The Kennedy amendment finances the increase in Pell grants by delaying marginal rate reductions if the Secretary of Education determines that Pell grants are not fully funded.  So this is not germane. I raise this point then: The amendment is not germane because it should not be on a reconciliation measure. The point of order against the amendment is under section 305(b)(2) of the Budget Act.
