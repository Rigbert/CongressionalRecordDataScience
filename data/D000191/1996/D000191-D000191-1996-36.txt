Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  The gentleman should read the amendment before he rises with such extraordinary charges that the amendment will be responsible for the collapse of American democracy and the final victory of the totalitarian Soviet state, which I think was part of the statement there.  It has exceptions for human health and safety. It has exceptions for endangered or threatened species. The endangered, threatened species are often dealt with in a better manner by fishand wildlife, who has a line item in their budget. All this does is eliminate a subsidy for a ridiculous anachronistic program first implemented in 1931 that has no discernible impact.  It has had an impact, and it is inadvertent, against nontarget species, poisoning of nontarget species, the destruction of predators which, like coyotes, in many cases prey on rodents or on groundhogs and gophers and things which cause problems with pastures and with horses breaking their legs. So the gentleman, by killing coyotes, is responsible for people whose horses have put their legs in gopher holes, broken them, fallen and then been killed.  I will not make that charge, but his charges were equally irresponsible.  This is an absurd subsidy to a selected few, a very small percentage of privileged western livestock producers. It is something that if they need, they can contract for themselves without a subsidy from the U.S. taxpayers to continue this ineffective and indiscriminate program.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
