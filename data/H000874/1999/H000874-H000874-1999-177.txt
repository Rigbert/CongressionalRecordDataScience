Chairman, I appreciate his action, I know the chairman does as well, and I look forward to his joining with the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Davis) and ourselves in working on this issue.  I know from having talked to Commissioner Kelley that he shares our concerns. As my colleagues know, he is relatively new as the commissioner, but he is going to, I am sure, vigorously pursue this, and working together I think we will get at this problem and make sure that we resolve it.  Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for his efforts and for his interest.
