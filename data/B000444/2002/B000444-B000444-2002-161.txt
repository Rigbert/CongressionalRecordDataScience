 President, there are times, it seems, when we celebrate ``small-town America'' as an idea, either in nostalgic longing or as an homage to traditional values and a spirit of community that seem elusive in the rush of modern life.  But the values and spirit of our small towns is more than just an idea; it is real, it is alive, it not only endures but thrives, to the benefit of us all, in places across this country, and certainly in towns up and down my home State of Delaware.  The Town of Selbyville, in Sussex County, the southernmost part of our State, is one such place. And it gives me great pleasure to pay tribute to Selbyville, as we celebrate the 100th anniversary of its incorporation.  The history of the Town goes back much further than 1902, to the late 1770s, when Benjamin Long, Arthur McCabe, John Murray, Reuben Stevens and Elijah Campbell bought a 250-acre tract at the head of the St. Martin's River, where a gristmill and sawmill operated.  The tract had been known as Sandy Branch, but about 50 years after the purchase, a country store owner named Sampson Selby began to mark packages for delivery ``Selby-Ville.''  In 1872, the Frankford and Breakwater Railroad reached the Town, so that its strawberries could be shipped to more distant markets. By 1918, Selbyville was the East Coast's main supplier of strawberries, and strawberries remained an important commercial base for the Town through the late 1930s.  Agriculture is still important to Selbyville, although now it's poultry and pork, corn and soybeans that occupy most of the farmers. And the Town has grown beyond its original business center, reaching out to US 113 with service industries and a shopping center.  The highway has become more important than the railroad, Selbyville has grown, but it is still a small Town a place of living history, a place driven by the values that grow from long-time association and the work ethic of an agricultural community, a place that feels like home.  We neighbors of Selbyville congratulate Mayor Clifton C. Murray; Town Council members Jay C. Murray, C. Frank Smith, III, Clarence W. Tingle, Jr., and Richard A. Duncan, Sr.; and all the citizens and friends of the Town, as they look forward to their official 100th anniversary celebration on May 25th.                          ____________________
