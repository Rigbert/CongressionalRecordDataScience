Madam Speaker, today we honor one of the most accomplished scientists of the twentieth century; a man who would not be deterred by racial bias. Today we honor the life and research of Dr. Percy Julian.  Dr. Julian worked tirelessly, and won acclaim for his work in organic chemistry. A brilliant chemist, Dr. Julian developed a treatment for glaucoma, a new process to produce cortisone, and a fire retardant used by the US Navy, which saved countless American lives during World War II. Throughout his distinguished career Dr. Julian was awarded an impressive 105 patents. His many scientific accomplishments led to his election as a member of the prestigious National Academy of Sciences in 1973.  Dr. Percy's contribution to the study of science is remarkable, yet we cannot forget the racial barriers that Dr. Julian was able to overcome. Born the grandson of Alabama slaves, Dr. Julian was a civil rights pioneer. Dr. Julian was forced to fight through racial prejudice and intimidation to establish himself as a pre-eminent chemist. Let us not forget, as the first African-American family to live in the Chicago suburb of Oak Park, the Julian house was fire-bombed in 1950. And again, on June 12, 1951, the Julian house was attacked, this time with dynamite. Yet, through it all, we should not forget the courage he displayed and his perseverance.  We, as a nation, owe much to Percy Julian and it is a privilege to honor him today.                          ____________________
