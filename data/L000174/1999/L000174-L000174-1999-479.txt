President, I do not oppose this amendment. I think it is, as drafted, extremely complicated and can create a great deal of problems with some States to the extent it overrides their ability to make determinations of who they go after and how. I understand what the Senator from Pennsylvania wants. I encourage that we accept the amendment.  Of course, he is entitled to a vote if he wishes, and between now and conference we might work more on the language to see if there are areas of unnecessary complication that could be removed.  I do not oppose the amendment. I yield back the time on this side.
