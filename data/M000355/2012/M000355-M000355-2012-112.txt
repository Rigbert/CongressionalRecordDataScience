 President, I rise to pay tribute to an honored Kentuckian and veteran of World War II, Mr. Ned Moore. Mr. Moore visited the Nation's capital several months ago with Honor Flight, the group that helps bring veterans to Washington, D.C., to see the memorials that were built in their honor. Mr. Moore was able to see the World War II Memorial that he and his fellow sailors inspired.  Ned's grandson, Mr. Tres Watson, is a good friend of mine, and when he made me aware of his grandfather's visit, I thought it worth a moment to share Ned's story with my colleagues. Ned Moore was born in Marydell, MS, on February 27, 1927. He joined the Navy in Jackson, MS, on August 1, 1944, at the age of 16, without his mother's consent. He was assigned to the USS Coronis, a landing-craft repair ship, on Christmas Day 1944.  While Ned was aboard the Coronis, it saw action throughout the Pacific Theater, including acting as a support ship during the battle of Okinawa.  In 1945, Ned was assigned to the United Nations, where among his duties he served as personal driver for UN delegates including Eleanor Roosevelt, who was a UN delegate at the time. She presented Ned with a Roosevelt dime after making his acquaintance.  In March 1946, Ned was assigned to the USS Wright, a Saipan-class light aircraft carrier, where he served as an aircraft mechanic. While the Wright was stationed in Pensacola, FL, functioning as a training ship, Ned married Margaret Daly in 1948.  In October 1952, Ned was assigned to the USS Bennington, an Essex-class aircraft carrier that had beenrecomissioned as an attack carrier. While the Bennington was stationed in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in February 1953, then-U.S. Senator John F. Kennedy obtained leave for Ned to return to the United States for the birth of his first child.  In 1958, Ned was assigned to the USS Wasp in Boston after it had been overhauled to become the hub of a special anti-submarine group of the Sixth Fleet. While aboard the Wasp, Ned sailed through the Mediterranean and participated in Operation Blue Bat, a U.S. military intervention into Lebanon. The Wasp was responsible for transporting sick and injured Marines from Lebanon so they could receive care.  In 1960, Ned was transferred to NAS, Naval Air Station Memphis. While in Memphis, Ned established the Naval Air Maintenance Training Group Library. He was also a courier between Memphis and Washington, carrying plans for jets under design.  He retired from the Navy in Memphis on December 31, 1964, as a senior chief petty officer.  After leaving the Navy, Ned and his family moved to Mayfield, KY, where he worked as a maintenance manager at the General Tire manufacturing facility. There, he raised three children, Debbie, Richy, and Mike. After retiring from General Tire in 1983, Ned and his wife kept their house in Mayfield while traveling the country in a motor home in the spring, summer, and fall and wintering in Florida. They travelled to all 50 States. They moved to Lillian, AL, in 2005.  At this time I ask my U.S. Senate colleagues to join me in honoring Mr. Ned Moore for his service to country and his devotion to the defense of freedom. When World War II ended, he laid down his arms to become a productive, successful member of the community who was admired by his family, neighbors, and State. He has been a role model to Tres Watson and many other Kentuckians. I wish him all the best in his retirement and a happy future.                          ____________________
