 President, yesterday, by unanimous vote, the Senate passed the Newborns and Mothers Health Protection Act as an amendment to the VA-HUD appropriations bill. There is no more important issue before this Congress than the health of mothers and their newborns, and so I applaud the Senate. This amendment is vital. I want to express my pride in being a cosponsor, and my thanks to Senator Bradley and Senator Frist for all of their hard work.  This amendment will require health insurers to allow moms and their newborns to stay in the hospital for a minimum of 48 hours after a normal delivery and 96 hours after a cesarean section, unless the mother and her attending health care provider decide a shorter stay is in the child's best interest.  I sent a letter, along with Senator Snowe of Maine, to Senator Dole back on May 1 of this year, asking for a vote on this bill. That letter was signed by all the women Senators, from both parties. I am glad we have finally had a debate and approved this language.  This amendment has many cosponsors from both sides of the aisle, and has the support of numerous organizations from around the country. These organizations represent the broad range of health care providers that work with mothers, newborns, and the full range of their health concerns. There are experts from every corner of the country who will attest to the importance of this amendment, and as Senator Bradley has noted, more than 80,000 Americans have sent in letters asking us to pass this legislation, because they know it can mean the difference between life and death for a loved one.  Protecting mothers and their infants is the right thing to do, and is overdue. Many States already provide these protections, and hospitals such as Tacoma General in my State are already allowing these decisions to be made by the mother and her care provider, which is the way it should be.  We know from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that hospital stays for new mothers decreased by almost half between 1970 and 1992--from 3.9 days to 2.1 days. We know the length of stay has continued to decrease, and is now about 24 hours after normal delivery. We know there can be serious health complications within the first 48 hours even after a normal delivery. Most important, we know these decisions should be in the hands of the mother and her attending health care provider.  I am glad the Senate has taken this action, and I think it is a good first step toward improving the health of infants and other children in this country.  We need to give all newborns every advantage possible. In my mind, a healthy start on life is a good start on life.                          ____________________
