 President, there are three additional amendments that have been cleared which we would like to act on individually.  There is a Craig amendment regarding reforestation in Afghanistan. I commend Senator Craig for recognizing a problem that we solved while we were in Afghanistan 2 weeks ago, which is the country has stripped a huge percentage of its trees. As a result of that, there is enormous erosion that they would not have otherwise had.  Senator Craig knows a good deal about reforestation. He jumped on that and has offered this very worthwhile amendment which would appropriate $5 million for a reforestation program in Afghanistan. I know Senator Craig is hoping this fund will be something like a challenge grant in which corporations and individuals in America and foundations in America that have an interest in reforestation would contribute knowing that at least up to $5 million of that money will be matched by the these USAID funds.  It is a very worthwhile project. I commend Senator Craig for recognizing this and coming up with a way to begin to deal with a huge problem related to the rebuilding of Afghanistan.  I send the Craig amendment to the desk.
