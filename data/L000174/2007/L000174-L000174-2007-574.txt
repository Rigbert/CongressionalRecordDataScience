President, when I first came to the Senate, I had the great privilege of serving with Senator Frank Church of Idaho. Marcelle and I were also privileged to spend time with both Frank and his wonderful wife Bethine. The two of them were extraordinarily helpful to this 34-year-old Senator from Vermont.  Frank Church was a Senator in the very best sense of the word. He thought of the Senate as a place where one should, first and foremost, stand for our country and make it a better place. Certainly his brilliance, conscience, and patriotism made his service here one that benefited not only the Senate, but the Nation.  Last year, the Idaho Statesman published an article that so reflected Bethine Church that I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record so that those in the Senate who served with Senator Church and knew him and Bethine, as well as those who did not have the opportunity to know them, can have this glimpse into their lives.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:              [From the IdahoStatesman.com, Oct. 13, 2006]       Bethine Church is the widow of four-term U.S. Sen. Frank      Church. Get a narrated tour of her life and times as she      describes collected photographs from the couple's public and      private lives. See photos of Castro, Brando, Jackie Kennedy      and more.       In a game room in Boise's East End, the walls really do      talk.       Bethine Church, the widow of four-term U.S. Sen. Frank      Church, has collected photographs from the couple's public      and private lives. Every image has a story--of world travel      on behalf of the government, of encounters with celebrities,      of heads of state and high political drama, of love and loss      and family, of home in the Idaho mountains.       Frank Church was the most influential Idaho politician      ever. He served 24 years in the U.S. Senate, the lone Idaho      Democrat to win more than one term. He chaired the Senate      Foreign Relations Committee. In 1976 he was a serious      candidate for president, looking briefly like the only man      able to deny Jimmy Carter the Democratic nomination. He      helped pass the Wilderness Act in 1964. He was an early      critic of the Vietnam War, and investigated CIA and FBI      abuses, forcing reforms that some now question in the post-9/     11 era.       I'd seen the pictures over the years, when Church hosted      events for Democratic luminaries like Tipper Gore. The walls      are chockablock with presidents (FDR, JFK and LBJ), prime      ministers (Golda Meir of Israel), kings (Juan Carlos of      Spain), dictators (Fidel Castro of Cuba and Deng Xiaoping of      China) and celebrities (Jimmy Durante, Marlon Brando, John      Wayne). There are family snaps of the Robinson Bar Ranch, the      Middle Fork Salmon River and the grand home at 109 W. Idaho      St., where Bethine lived when her father, Chase Clark, was      governor in the 1940s.       But I hadn't heard her inimitable narration. I finally got      the chance when my editor asked me to gather string for an      obituary on the grandame of Idaho politics. Church, 83,      happily gave the E Ticket tour to me and photographer Darin      Oswald. No waiting lines, but the ride took four hours.       Several days later, she called, saying, ``I'd so like to      see what you're up to. Do we really have to wait until I'm      dead?'' My editors chewed on that, deciding she was right:      There was no good reason to delay. Today, at      IdahoStatesman.com, Church brings the pictures to life in an      audio-visual presentation designed by Oswald's colleague,      Chris Butler. We chose today because at 11:45 a.m., the U.S.      Forest Service is holding a renaming ceremony at the Galena      Overlook in the Sawtooth National Recreation Area. The      viewpoint is one of Idaho's great vistas. From today on, it      will honor Bethine and Frank Church, both of whom had the      vision to protect the Sawtooths.       Driving to Robinson Bar over Galena Summit more than 30      years ago, the Churches looked down on a subdivision. ``This      can't happen,'' said Sen. Church. Working with his Republican      colleagues, Sen. Len Jordan and Reps. Jim McClure and Orval      Hansen, Church got the bill creating the Sawtooth National      Recreation Area through Congress in 1972. Had they failed,      the Sawtooth valley would be dotted with vacation mansions.       Frank Church has been out of office 25 years, dead 22.      Bethine contemplated suicide while watching him die of      cancer, but he told her she had responsibilities. He was      right. She founded the Sawtooth Society, which has led      private conservation efforts in the SNRA; her support of Rep.      Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, has aided his push to expand SNRA      wilderness into the Boulder and White Cloud mountains; she      helped create the Frank Church Institute at BSU that supports      a scholar and hosts a world-class annual conference.       Church took a fall recently that put her in the hospital      one night. But she still entertains, negotiating her kitchen      in a cane and sitting on a step stool to cook. She lustily      talks of a life devoted to making Idaho and the world better.       Bethine grew up in Mackay and Idaho Falls, where her lawyer      father represented copper mining companies and criminal      defendants.       From her parents she learned a novel way of speaking,      including her mother's strongest curse, ``It just freezes my      preserves,'' and her Pop's putdown, ``He's as worthless as      teats on a boar.''       From there she went to the salons of Washington, D.C., and      the far reaches of the globe. But they didn't take the Idaho      out of Bethine. After a reception for French President      Charles De Gaulle, the Churches gathered at the home of a      Senate colleague, Joe Clark, with Adlai Stevenson, the U.N.      Ambassador, a former governor and the Democratic presidential      nominee in 1952 and 1956.       Stevenson's intellectual heft was legend; he was mocked by      Richard Nixon as an ``egghead,'' and voters twice chose      Dwight Eisenhower. But Bethine showed no reluctance to say      what was on her champagne-sparkled mind: She discussed the      relative preponderance of outhouses in Idaho and West      Virginia. ``I guess I sounded like I sound now,'' she said,      laughing. ``I said exactly what came into my head and somehow      Frank survived it.''       Bethine Church was a true partner to her politician      husband, not simply a prop. She has a knack for remembering      names, something she learned from her dad. ``Pop taught me      that everybody, from the waitress to the people working in      the kitchen, is as important as the people sitting on the      dais.''       She often prompted the senator's memory, and was his most      valued confidant. Had Church won his last-minute race for      president in 1976 in the wake of Watergate, Bethine would      have been an involved First     Lady. ``If there had been tapes,'' she crowed, ``I would have      been on them!''                          ____________________
