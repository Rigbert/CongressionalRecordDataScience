Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the House voting to extend permanently MFN for Romania, H.R. 3161. Romania has just completed, after three rounds, its election of local officials throughout the country, and national elections are now set for early November. I strongly believe that the House should consider the legislation before us only after Romania's national elections.  There are a number of issues, from freedom of the media and rights of the minorities to democratic reform, which remain unresolved. Romania enjoys all the benefits of MFN under the current semiannual review process, and granting permanent MFN now will remove this important review of these remaining issues of concern and the conduct of the upcoming elections. Mr. Speaker, we all know that within a democratic system, the political will to address outstanding problems is always greater during an election season. Let the 105th Congress consider this issue after Romania's national elections.  The current MFN review process has served as a helpful opportunity to gauge Romania's democratic reform and their respect for human rights. Freedom of the media, for example, continues to be a concern. Under Romanian law, individuals who are convicted of insulting or defaming public officials can be subjected to prison terms. The Romanian Senate recently passed legislation which would increase these criminal penalties if the insults are committed in the written or audiovisual press. This type of potential liability, in my opinion, has a chilling effect on the media.  Mr. Speaker, the Government of Romania should ensure absolutely the freedom of the media--at all times--but particularly during the heat of election campaigns. Unfavorable commentary by the media regarding government officials should not be viewed as a threat to national security and result in calls for restrictions on those who dare to criticize. I was dismayed by the reaction of the chairman of the ruling party in Romania to critical news reports filed by the local BBC correspondent during the recent local election campaign. Chairman Adrian Nastase, who is also President of the Romanian Chamber of Deputies, attacked the BBC for its critical reporting and called on the national licensing agency to review that respected international news organization's right to rebroadcast on local Romanian radio stations.  Minority rights continue to be of concern. Ethnic minorities face certain restrictions to their receiving, at the higher levels in particular, instruction in their native language, and a law was passed which now limits the taking of college entrance exams solely in Romanian. This law was not implemented this year but the law remains on the books. And official obstacles remain which prevent the restoration of the Hungarian university in Cluj.  Human rights are best protected by governments which must answer to their electorate. As with any fledgling democracy, the campaign season for the just completed local elections and the conduct of the national elections in the fall are particularly important tests for Romania's commitment to freedom of the press, their conduct of orderly, free, and fair elections, and their provision for domestic observers for the national elections. Reports from objective election observers clearly indicate that the conduct of the local elections did not allay the potential problems which had been raised by NGO's. The most serious concerns included widespread, gross inaccuracy of the voter lists; significant logistical problems which arise when campaign periods are truncated; and uneven interpretation of the election law by local officials with no central election bureau to serve as arbiter, which contributed to inconsistencies around the country and even a lack of trust in the system.  In my view, Mr. Speaker, projecting a vote in the U.S. Congress on the political landscape of Romania would certainly be seen as a congressional judgment on Romania's current political leaders. The vote tallies of the recently held local elections indicate strong, grassroots support for the opposition parties. In fact, the ruling Party of Social Democracy in Romania and the opposition Democratic Convention of Romania [CDR] received about equal percentages of the vote in the mayors' races. The CDR and other opposition parties, including representatives of the Hungarian minority, significantly out-polled the ruling party in country, city, and mayoral races in many regions. Mr. Speaker, this is a political environment in which every issue, especially closely watched foreign policy issues such as Romania's MFN status with the United States, affects the voters' perception of the effectiveness of the ruling party.  Mr. Speaker, there are a number of areas in which the Romanian Government could take timely and constructive steps to ensure that the national elections are conducted in a way which garners confidence in the electoral process. I hope and expect that the Government of Romania will make every effort to ensure that the national elections in November are conducted on the basis of up-to-date, accurate voting lists in each locality, backed up by consistent and uniform interpretation of the election law by local officials. In my view, the establishment of a permanent, professional election bureau would ensure such consistency and accuracy, and go a long way toward enhancing voter confidence in the system.  Finally, it is unclear at this time whether domestic election observers will be permitted at the polling stations in November. A one-time provision for local observers was made during the 1992 national elections, however this authorization has not been renewed. Mr. Speaker, in my view domestic as well as international observers are crucial to ensuring the conduct of free and fair elections. Domestic observers play a positive role in enhancing public confidence in the electoral process and the experience of election monitoring gives ordinary Romanian citizens an opportunity to develop skills and experience applicable to other aspects of democratic citizenship.  I am hopeful and expectant that Romania's next leaders will be chosen through elections which will be free, fair and representative, and that the protection of human rights will continue to improve under the newly elected government. I urge my colleagues to vote against H.R. 3161 today. The people of Romania have had the benefits of MFN since 1992. Making the judgement about the transition to permanent status should be undertaken only after these critical elections are completed in November.                          ____________________
