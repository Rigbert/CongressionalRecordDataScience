Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, in my opening statement I forgot to mention that the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. Dingell] and myself have worked many, many years on refuge legislation. We watched the support for refuges grow in this country because we wanted to leave a legacy of hunting and fishing, the heritage of this country, to our young people. We were able to do that through our actions in the past and this is just an attempt to make sure that continues. I urge a strong aye vote on this legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Tennessee [Mr. Tanner].
