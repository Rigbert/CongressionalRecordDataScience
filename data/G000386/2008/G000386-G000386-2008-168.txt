 I first began this inquiry by examining payments to individuals who served on FDA's Advisory Boards. More recently, I began looking at payments from drug companies to professors at our nation's medical schools and more specifically at the payments from Astra Zeneca to a professor of psychiatry at the University of Cincinnati.  I then moved on to look at several psychiatrists at Harvard and Mass General Hospital. These physicians are some of the top psychiatrists in the country, and their research is some of the most important in the field. They have also taken millions of dollars from the drug companies and failed to report those payments accurately to Harvard and Mass General.  For instance, in 2000 the National Institutes of Health awarded one Harvard physician a grant to study atomoxetine in children. At that time, this physician disclosed that he received less than $10,000 in payments from Eli Lilly which makes Straterra, a brand name of atomoxetine. But Eli Lilly reported that it paid this same physician more than $14,000 for advisory services that year--a difference of at least $4,000.  I would now like to report what I have found out about another researcher--Dr. Alan Schatzberg at Stanford. In the late nineties, Dr. Schatzberg helped to start a company called Corcept Therapeutics--Dr. Schatzberg is a copatent owner on a drug developed by Corcept. That company applied to the Food and Drug Administration for approval to market Mifepristone for psychotic depression.  Dr. Schatzberg is a well-known psychiatrist and has received several grants from the National Institutes of Health to study Mifepristone. While Dr. Schatzberg has reported some of his income from Corcept Therapeutics to Stanford, he did not report a profit of $109,179 from the sale of 15,597 shares of Corcept stock on August 15, 2005 because he was not required to do that under Stanford's rules.  But if it is not required by Stanford, I submit to you that it should be. Why? Because in his Stanford disclosures, Dr. Schatzberg only had to report whether he had more than $100,000 of stock in Corcept Therapeutics. However, his filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission show that he has control of 2,738,749 shares of Corcept stock worth over $6 million.  In addition, in 2002 Dr. Schatzberg did not report any income from Johnson & Johnson, but the company reported to me that it paid Dr. Schatzberg $22,000 that year. And in 2004, Dr. Schatzberg reported receiving between $10,000-$50,000 from Eli Lilly. But Eli Lilly reported to me that they paid Dr. Schaztberg over $52,000 that year.  Before closing, I would like to say that Stanford has been very cooperative in this investigation, as have been many of the drug companies. I ask unanimous consent to have my letter to Stanford printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                      U.S. Senate,                                         Committee on Finance,                                    Washington, DC, June 23, 2008.     Dr. John L. Hennessy,     President, Stanford University, Office of the President,          Stanford, CA       Dear Dr. Hennessy: First, I would like to thank you again      for working with me to lower student tuition at Stanford      University (Stanford/University). It was a great leap forward      in the effort to help students afford a quality education.      Next, I would like to bring several other issues to your      attention regarding Stanford, its conflict of interest      policies, and a particular faculty member at your University.       As you know, the United States Senate Committee on Finance      (Committee) has jurisdiction over the Medicare and Medicaid      programs and, accordingly, a responsibility to the more than      80 million Americans who receive health care coverage under      these programs. As Ranking Member of the Committee, I have a      duty to protect the health of     Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries and safeguard taxpayer      dollars appropriated for these programs. The actions taken by      thought leaders, like those at Stanford, often have a      profound impact upon the decisions made by taxpayer funded      programs like Medicare and Medicaid and the way that patients      are treated and taxpayer funds expended.       Moreover, and as has been detailed in several studies and      news reports, funding by pharmaceutical companies can      influence scientific studies, continuing medical education,      and the prescribing patterns of doctors. Because I am      concerned that there has been little transparency on this      matter, I have sent letters to almost two dozen research      universities across the United States regarding about 30      physicians. In these letters, I asked questions about the      conflict of interest disclosure forms signed by some of their      faculty. As you know universities like Stanford require      doctors to report their related outside income. But I am      concerned that these requirements are sometimes disregarded.       I have also been taking a keen interest in the almost $24      billion annually appropriated to the National Institutes of      Health (NIH) to fund grants at various institutions such as      Stanford. Institutions are required to manage a grantee's      conflicts of interest. However, I am learning that this task      is made difficult because physicians do not consistently      report all the payments received from drug companies.       To bring some greater transparency to this issue, Senator      Kohl and I introduced the Physician Payments Sunshine Act      (Act). This Act will require drug companies to report      publicly any payments that they make to doctors, within      certain parameters.       I am also writing to assess the implementation of financial      disclosure policies at Stanford University. In response to my      letter of October 25, 2007, Stanford provided me with copies      of the financial disclosure reports that Dr. Alan Schatzberg      filed during the period of January 2000 through June 2007.       My staff investigators carefully reviewed each of Dr.      Schatzberg's disclosure forms and detailed the payments      disclosed. Subsequently, I asked that Stanford confirm the      accuracy of the information. In March 2008, Stanford's Vice      Provost and Dean of Research provided clarifications and      additional information from Dr. Schatzberg pursuant to my      inquiry.       In addition to obtaining information from Stanford, I also      contacted executives at several major pharmaceutical and      device companies and asked them to list the payments that      they made to Dr. Schatzberg during the years 2000 through      2007. These companies voluntarily and cooperatively reported      additional payments that do not appear to have been disclosed      to Stanford by Dr. Schatzberg. For instance, in 2002 Dr.      Schatzberg did not report any income from Johnson & Johnson,      but the company reported to me that it paid Dr. Schatzberg      $22,000 that year. And in 2004, Dr. Schatzberg reported      receiving between $10,000-$50,000 from Eli Lilly. But Eli      Lilly reported to me that they paid Dr. Schatzberg over      $52,000 that year.       Because these disclosures do not match, I am attaching a      chart intended to provide to Stanford a few examples of the      data reported to me. This chart contains columns showing the      payments disclosed in the forms Dr. Schatzberg filed with      Stanford and the amounts reported by several drug and device      companies.       The lack of consistency between what Dr. Schatzberg      reported to Stanford and what several drug companies reported      to me seems to follow a pattern of behavior. More      specifically, I have uncovered inconsistent reporting      patterns at the University of Cincinnati, and at Harvard      University and Mass General Hospital.                     Institutional and NIH Policies       Let me now turn to another matter that is of concern.      Stanford requires every faculty member to make an annual      disclosure related to both conflict of commitment (where no      financial information is requested), and conflict of      interest. As noted to me in your letter dated March 14, 2008,      ``It is our obligation to avoid bias in research, including      that conducted with federal funds.''       Based upon the information provided to me to date, Stanford      has a zero dollar threshold for disclosures for research      involving human subjects. Faculty members are required to      disclose a range of amounts received from outside      relationships that are related to a faculty member's research      activities (such as participation on advisory boards or      boards of directors, or consulting). In most instances, the      University's standard for a significant financial interest is      whether the faculty member received $10,000 or more in      income, holds $10,000 or more in equity for publicly traded      companies, or has any equity in the company in the event the      company is privately held.       Further, federal regulations place several requirements on      a university/hospital when its researchers apply for NIH      grants. These regulations are intended to ensure a level of      objectivity in publicly funded research, and state in      pertinent part that NIH investigators must disclose to their      institution any ``significant financial interest'' may appear      to affect the results of a study. NIH interprets      ``significant financial interest'' to mean at least $10,000      in value or 5 percent ownership in a single entity.       Again based upon the information provided to me, it appears      that Stanford takes failures to report outside income quite      seriously. As noted in your correspondence dated March 14,      2008, ``It is our obligation to avoid bias in research,      including that conducted with federal funds.'' You then      described a Stanford investigation conducted in 2006      regarding a researcher who failed to report gifts, meals and      trips from a device company. That faculty member was later      terminated.       Based upon information available to me, it appears that Dr.      Schatzberg received numerous NIH grants to conduct studies      involving Mifepristone for treating depression. Corcept      Therapeutics, a publicly traded company, has applied to the      Food and Drug Administration for approval to market      Mifepristone for psychotic depression. These grants funded      studies during the years 2000 through 2007 that examined the      treatment of psychotic major depression using Mifepristone.      During these years, Dr. Schatzberg, consistent with      Stanford's conflict policy, disclosed to Stanford a financial      relationship with Corcept Therapeutics (Corcept) including      stock ownership of over $100,000 and payments for activities      including its Board of Directors, Advisory Board Membership,      consulting, licensing agreements, and royalties. According to      his disclosures, these payments were between $50,000 to      $100,000 in the years 2003 through 2005, and between $10,000      to $50,000 in the years 2001, 2002, 2006, and 2007.       However, it appears based upon the information available,      Dr. Schatzberg did not and was not required to report a      profit of $109,179 from the sale of 15,597 shares of Corcept      stock on August 15, 2005. This transaction is found in his      publicly available filings with the U.S. Securities and      Exchange Commission (SEC). Earlier that year, Dr. Schatzberg      began enrolling an estimated 100 patients for a clinical      trial, sponsored by the NIH, to evaluate Mifepristone to      treat psychotic depression.       Further, while Dr. Schatzberg appropriately disclosed to      Stanford that his stock shares were valued at over $100,000,      I am not certain that this number captures the stocks' true      value. Dr. Schatzberg carries an equity interest in Corcept      with over 2 million shares of stock. For instance, as of      January 31, 2008, he reported to the SEC that he held      2,438,749 shares of Corcept stock, with sole voting power      for 2,738,749 shares. On June 12, 2008, Corcept stock      closed at $2.24 a share, meaning that his stock is      potentially worth over $6 million. Obviously, $6 million      is a dramatically higher number than $100,000 and I am      concerned that Stanford may not have been able to      adequately monitor the degree of Dr. Schatzberg's      conflicts of interest with its current disclosure policies      and submit to you that these policies should be re-     examined.       In light of the information set forth above, I ask your      continued cooperation in examining conflicts of interest. In      my opinion, institutions across the United States must be      able to rely on the representations of its faculty to ensure      the integrity of medicine, academia, and the grant-making      process. And the NIH must rely on strong institutional      conflict of interest policies to ensure the integrity of the      grant making process. At the same time, should the Physician      Payments Sunshine Act become law, institutions like yours      will be able to access a database that will set forth the      payments made to all doctors, including your faculty members.       Accordingly, I request that Stanford respond to the      following questions and requests for information. For each      response, please repeat the enumerated request and follow      with the appropriate answer.       1. For each of the NIH grants received by Dr. Schatzberg,      please confirm that he reported to Stanford University's      designated official ``the existence of [a] conflicting      interest.'' Please provide separate responses for each grant      received for the period from January 1, 2000 to the present,      and provide any supporting documentation for each grant      identified.       2. For each grant identified above, please explain how      Stanford ensured ``that the interest has been managed,      reduced, or eliminated.'' Please provide an individual      response for each grant that Dr. Schatzberg received from      January 2000 to the present, and provide any documentation      supporting each claim.       3. Did Dr. Schatzberg violate any federal or Stanford      policies by not revealing his stock sale in 2005? If not, why      not?       4. Is Stanford considering any changes in its disclosure      policies to more fully capture the degree of a conflict when      a faculty member owns shares in a company that are in excess      of $100,000?       5. Please report on the status of any possible reviews of      research misconduct and/or discrepancies in disclosures by      Dr. Schatzberg, including what action if any will be      considered.       6. Please report if a determination can be made as to      whether or not Dr. Schatzberg violated guidelines governing      clinical trials and the need to report conflicts of interest      to an institutional review board (IRB). Please respond by      naming each clinical trial for which the doctor was the      principal investigator, along with confirmation that      conflicts of interest were reported, if possible.       7. Please provide a total dollar figure for all NIH monies      received annually by Stanford University. This request covers      the period of 2000 through 2007.       8. Please provide a list of all NIH grants received by      Stanford University. This request covers the period of 2000      through 2007. For each grant please provide the following:       a. Primary Investigator;       b. Grant Title;       c. Grant number;       d. Brief description; and       e. Amount of Award.       Thank you again for your continued cooperation and      assistance in this matter. As you know, in cooperating with      the Committee's review, no documents, records, data or      information related to these matters shall be destroyed,      modified, removed or otherwise made inaccessible to the      Committee.       I look forward to hearing from you by no later than July      xx, 2008. All documents responsive to this request should be      sent electronically in PDF format to [email protected]rep.senate.gov. If you have any questions, please do not      hesitate to contact Paul Thacker at (202) 224-4515.           Sincerely,                                              Charles E. Grassley,                                                   Ranking Member. SELECTED DISCLOSURES BY DR.
