President, I am an original cosponsor of this amendment, and I strongly support it. I will not take a great deal of time. But Senator Byrd and Senator Kennedy, two senior Members of the Senate--actually the two most senior Members of this Senate--have been such resolute voices of reason and caution concerning our actions in Iraq. Senator Kennedy and Senator Byrd have done a thorough job of explaining what this amendment does and why it is important.
