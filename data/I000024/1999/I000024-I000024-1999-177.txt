President, for too long, economic development in Indian country has been hindered by antiquated rules and regulations, many dating back to before the turn of the century. Many American Indians continue to struggle, denied by bureaucracy the opportunity to take steps to improve their position. I am proposing legislation today that would reverse one of these situations.  Under current law, Indian lands owned by more than one person require the consent of 100 percent of the owners before mineral development can goforward. Oftentimes, this fractionated property is owned by over one hundred people; it is difficult, if not impossible, to locate all the owners. Once found, developers must obtain their unanimous consent. As you can imagine, this creates a significant and often insurmountable obstacle for leasing or other development. Last year, Congress lowered this requirement for the Three Affiliated Tribes of the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation to a majority, which more closely resembles regulations for non-Indian land. By loosening the consent requirements, these tribes have found the right balance between economic progress and protection of landowners' rights.  I am proposing to extend last year's legislation to seven Oklahoma tribes: the Comanche, Kiowa, Apache, Fort Sill Apache, Delaware, and the Wichita and Affiliated Tribes. Oil and gas are the cornerstone of Oklahoma's economy, but these tribes have by and large been left out of this industry because of the stringent consent statutes. Increased access to their own land would greatly facilitate mineral development, bringing increased economic opportunity. These tribes and their members will now be able to undertake oil and gas exploration which was previously not possible. This will represent a significant advance toward greater economic empowerment, breaking out of the constraints now imposed on these tribes.  Common sense dictates that the first step of self-sufficiency is being allowed to use the resources you already own. This proposal will be equitable and beneficial to all parties involved. I look forward to working with my colleagues on this and other such legislation that would help American Indians achieve greater economic independence.                                 ______                                       By
