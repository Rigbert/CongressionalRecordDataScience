 Mr. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, the gentleman is 100 percent right. The local community would make this decision itself. The county and city commissions that get these moneys would make this decision. They would have advisory groups that we set up that would have to advise them, which would include local prosecutors, local police, local school system representative, somebody from the courts, so the drug courts can be protected, and so on. I think you would find the community would much prefer it, because you are right, they could get the weed-and-seed money they would want.
