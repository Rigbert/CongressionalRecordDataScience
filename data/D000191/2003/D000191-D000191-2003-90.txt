  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, the way Congress and the President could best commemorate the terrorist attack, the tragedy of 9/11, and the loss of thousands of innocent lives would be to ensure that we have done all in our power both here and abroad, that Americans are as safe as possible against another assault.  Unfortunately, as a member of the Committee on Homeland Security and a senior member of the Subcommittee on Aviation, I can say with confidence that we have fallen far short of that mark. Significant portions of the Aviation Security Act have not been implemented. Our first responders, those who responded so selflessly on that tragic day, still lack basic resources and help from the Federal Government, even as Congress is considering the President's request for another $87 billion for Iraq.  On this day, Congress should resolve to remember by redoubling its efforts, avoiding dangerous distractions, and providing all the funds necessary so we can say with confidence, never again.                          ____________________
