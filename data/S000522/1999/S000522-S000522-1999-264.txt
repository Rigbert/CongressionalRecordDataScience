Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to bring to the attention of my colleagues recent positive developments on religious freedom in Azerbaijan. Members of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, which I chair, raised last week our concern over the raids of the Baptist and Lutheran churches in Baku, the threatened deportation of foreigners associated with these churches, and the firing of a number of Jehovah's Witnesses from their jobs because of their religious affiliation. In a letter to President Haidar Aliev on November 3, referencing Azerbaijan's OSCE commitments to religious liberty, we raised the recent incidents that violate religious liberty and asked Azerbaijan to register religious groups that have not been able to gain legal status.  On Monday, November 8, in a meeting with U.S. Ambassador Stanley Escudero, President Aliev publicly reaffirmed Azerbaijan's commitment to religious freedom, pledged to redress recent problems faced by minority religious groups, and gave assurances there would be no further religious liberty violations in Azerbaijan. In a statement that was carried by the government-controlled media, President Aliev said, ``I have vigorously warned administrative bodies of the fact that arbitrariness on such issues is inconceivable. One cannot restrict freedom of conscience and creed.'' Our Embassy in Baku reports that the courts have set aside the deportation orders for the foreign Christians, and the Garadag Gas Plant has reinstated the jobs of the Jehovah's Witnesses.  Mr. Speaker, I commend Ambassador Stanley Escudero for persistently raising these issues with Azeri authorities. I also commend the work of Political Officer Michael Speckhard who has been a tireless advocate for religious freedom.  I am hopeful that President Aliev's remarks signal a new dawn in Azerbaijan and that his country will become the region's beacon for religious freedom. The prompt response of President Aliev to these recent events is encouraging, and I am hopeful that religious group that previously have not been able to obtain legal status will now be registered and will be free to practice their faith.                          ____________________
