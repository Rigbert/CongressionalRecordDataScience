President, I commend Senator Dodd for his leadership on this issue, not just today but for many days, along with Senator DeWine and others, and to say how precisely, accurately, and eloquently he has characterized the terrible situation in Haiti. It is one that requires a plan, requires purpose, and requires commitment by the United States. I hope we can carry this amendment.  I yield the floor.
