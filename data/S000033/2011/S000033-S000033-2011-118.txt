 President, today I wish to share the powerful words of 12 Vermont students. As I toured the schools of Vermont, I encouraged students to write me focusing on issues of concern to young people and to recommend short- and long-term priorities for the President. I received more than 225 State of the Union essays about the declining middle class, climate change, and health care reform. These students truly answered, what is the state of our Union?  It is important to remember that part of our jobs is to represent the young people of our States and not just their parents. We all know that what happens in Washington, DC, impacts every American and all of us, including young people, should be thinking about these issues. Although Vermont is doing a better job than most States, there is certainly a legitimate concern that young people are not learning enough about civics. I think these essays demonstrate that students do understand the role they can play in American democracy.  As President Barack Obama presents his State of the Union Address to a joint session of Congress tonight, I think it is appropriate that the top dozen essays are printed in the Record, so that the entire country can see the excellent work that Vermont students are doing. I also want to thank the teachers--Jennie Gartner from Rutland High School; Elizabeth Lebrun, of Poultney High School; Joe Maley of South Burlington High School; and Terri Vest of Twinfield Union High School in Plainfield--who helped me select these essays.  Keenan Villani-Holland from Vermont Commons School was the teachers' top choice. In addition to Keenan, the other finalists, in alphabetical order, are: Iain Axworthy, Essex High School; Emily Berk, South Royalton School; Molly Burke, Champlain Valley Union High School; Jonah Cantor, Champlain Valley Union High School; Molly Cantore, St. Johnsbury Academy; Kristen Donaldson, Champlain Valley Union High School; Susannah Johnson, Vermont Commons School; Ingrid Klinkenberg, Edmunds Middle School; Ezra Mount-Finette, Champlain Valley Union High School; Lisa Ogorzalek of Rutland High School; and Bryn Philibert, Champlain Valley Union High School.  I am pleased the students of Vermont are thinking about these complex issues, which are of critical importance to not only our State but indeed the Nation. The decisions that we make on the Senate floor today will impact generations of Americans to come. That is why I would like to share with you what these students' wrote. I ask that they be printed in the Record.  The material follows.             Keenan Villani-Holland, Vermont Commons School       The world is changing, and the United States has the      opportunity to lead that change. Oil is running out, global      warming is reaching or has already passed a significant      tipping point and tensions with North Korea and Iran are      escalating. On the home front, the middle class is rapidly      disappearing due to an economic crisis that has been      festering for years, we are losing out in education to China      and our people have completely lost touch with the government      and vice versa.       In older times, nations would go through major catastrophes      often: devastating wars, plagues, bloody revolutions, etc.      often enough to keep them new. In this day and age, these      enormous crises are largely averted in the western world.      Make no mistake, this is a great thing. However, it means we      need to take it upon ourselves to renew our Nation, rather      than waiting for a catastrophe that won't come.       We need to change quickly on three main fronts: The      environment, the economy, and education. It is time to      realize that fighting to save the environment is not in the      least altruistic. The planet doesn't care about global      warming or melting ice caps. We, on the other hand, should.      Our current economic model is failing all but the richest of      our Nation, as it slowly squeezes the middle class dry to      supply the rich. Finally, our educational system clearly      isn't working when China is easily surpassing us in education      and our students feel more overworked and overstressed every      day.       Let me first talk about the environmental front. Once we      realize that it is no longer a fight to save polar bears, and      that it is a fight to save ourselves, it will be easy.      However, that realization will not come quickly. We need a      huge-scale public awareness campaign to bring that point home      to American people. After that, we need to start with large      scale energy reform, focusing on renewables and following a      European model.       On the economy, we need to throw away our preconceptions      about the free market and start over. Heavy regulation to      ensure the economic safety of the American people, and      measures to start moving wealth back down the ladder to the      middle and lower classes are essential.       Finally, our educational system needs deep reforms to focus      on actually teaching children, rather than preparing them to      do well on tests. Children want to learn. That's what they      are supposed to be doing at that point in their life. It's      just a matter of taking the time for each individual and      giving them the attention they need and actually being      invested in them learning new material.       All of these ideas are fluid and adaptable, as any part of      government should be. We should never be afraid to change the      course we are taking in favor one that may be more      beneficial. The past decade was one about ``Staying the      course.'' This next one will be known as the one when we      ``Changed the course.''                    Iain Axworthy, Essex High School       Our Nation faces many challenges entering into the new      year. A recession has about 9.4 percent of our population out      of work, we have a government deficit that must be paid off,      and a tarnished image of America abroad must be mended.      Though these challenges are great they present us with what I      see as an opportunity unparalleled in recent history. Our      role as a world leader has come into question as of late and      good times provide little opportunity to change that view.      When times are hard real leaders take it upon themselves to      set the tone of the moment and show others how to react. It      is time for America to lead once again.       Our troubles at home and our troubles abroad are      tremendous. Our economy is in a weak phase of recovery, our      federal deficit is larger than it ever has been, and our      armed forces are engaged in a costly war. Relations have      become strained between the United States and much of the      world. The policies we enact in the coming months and years,      both domestically and overseas, must be exemplary. The US has      been the center of world commerce and culture for so long      that we almost seem to fear up-and-comers. Instead viewing      the coming shift of power as a loss we must view it as a win.      In the wake of World War II the US helped set up a system of      commerce that allowed many countries to develop into world      powers. The fact that countries other than ours are realizing      their potential should be seen as a great victory.       As we watch new world powers emerge we must see too that      they will look to us as a role model. It is our duty and our      privilege to set the right example in all areas, both in and      out of the government. The private sector must become more      responsible for its actions and create shared value within      its partner communities. Our consumers must spend and save      responsibly. Finally the people who represent us in Congress      and our state legislatures must depolarize and find the      mutual respect that has lately been non-existent. Once the      correct tone is set and our leaders act as they would have us      act, then we can look forward to a better tomorrow.       While our Nation sets an example on the world stage,      Vermont has the ability to set an example on a national      level. Vermont has powered though this recession with some of      the lowest unemployment figures in the Union, and though we      face our own issues we must acknowledge that we are much      better off than many other states. As such, we ought to make      concessions in Congress to aid those states hit hardest by      the recession. Though Vermonters may be few in number we can      show the rest of the country how citizens ought to act and      put the good of the nation before our own comfort.                   Emily Berk, South Royalton School       Growing up in rural, Middle Class America in the 21st      century hasn't impacted my life or my immediate family's      life. The current state of the union is coming out of a      recession. Personally, I've been very lucky. Both of my      parents are educated professionals that have stable jobs,      which they were able to keep through this economic downfall.      But it didn't mean that we weren't using more of our      disposable income to afford our basic needs, such as food,      health insurance, medications, fuel, oil, and utilities.      Meaning, we weren't able to go on as many vacations, but we      weren't losing our house. But I have family and friends that      have been affected by the economic downfall. With the      relations that I have with the people whom I know that are      being affected by this, I believe that the Presidents      ultimate goal should be to stabilize the economy, and support      our own.       I believe that in order for the economy to become      stabilized, a short-term goal should be that more jobs become      available. Jobs will stimulate the economy and let people who      are on unemployment to go back to work and earn more money.      And to allow people under employed to have better employment      for their education and ability. I believe by creating more      jobs, people will make more money, and more money will then      be spent, going to the government to start getting us more      and more out the recession. ``Creating jobs in the United      States     and ensuring a return to sustainable economic growth is the      top priority for my Administration,'' Barrack Obama said in      an Executive Order last March on his National Export      Initiative. With little short-term goals such as more jobs,      it will help start to stabilize the economy.       Another priority that I believe that should be on the      Presidents list is to support military families. Families      with family members in the military struggle with every day      life. I personally have a family being affected by it. My      cousin's father is in the war. He is on his second tour. He      has missed his children grow up, with a daughter who is now      15 and a 10 year old son. His wife is forced to be a single      parent. With support through programs, financial support and      counseling we could help the families being affected by war.      With programs set up for single parents with their partner in      the war nobody can understand better then another parent with      their partner in war. They would be able to share stories and      understand how one and another copes with them gone. And more      appreciation for those serving our country. They're fighting      for their lives, causing their families live's to become      difficult and change the way they live. Another priority      should be Student Loan Reforms.       Student Loan Reforms are important because the change will      eliminate private banks, the ``middlemen'' in the loan      process and will save the US government about $68 billion      dollars over a span of 11 years, according to the White      House. Because fewer fees will be paid to the local banks and      more money will be available to lend to students because the      money's coming directly from the government. The banks also      charge the government money for each loan because they're not      going to give students money for free. But for students, the      loans will look relatively the same--same terms, same fees,      same interest rates. The loans will most likely become more      accessible to students as well.       These are some of the short-term goals I believe should be      considered to help our country. I believe that this economic      downfall, can, with work, be fixed. If we really want      something we can achieve it. If people in our Nation come      together and act as one, we can do it. I hope that I was able      to give you good ideas about what goals I believe can help      our nation. Even though I am just a 15 year-old girl living      in a small town in Vermont, I still have a voice, and it will      be up to my generation to keep us out of another depression.            Molly Burke, Champlain Valley Union High School       Fellow Americans,       I'm writing to inform you of the current state of the      Nation and concerns I feel must be addressed in 2011.       The overuse of fossil fuels and its impact on the      environment is an issue I feel should be more extensively      addressed. The United States of America needs to end its      dependency on foreign oil and begin looking into alternative      energy sources. Wind energy, and solar energy are infinite      commodities that will steer the nation towards self-     dependency, sustainability and a cleaner environmental      future. The development of alternative energy sources may      also create jobs.       Since June 2009, the United States has been slowly      recovering from a severe economic recession. With an      unemployment rate greater than 9 percent, it is clear we must      focus our energies on job creation. Generating jobs in the      environmental field and re-building our nations      infrastructure including roads, bridges, and rail networks,      which are deteriorating, will provide job opportunities. In      order to meet many of these objectives, we need to take a      look at our current educational system to ensure we are      providing the necessary tools and training for the youth of      this country and accurately preparing them for the work      force. In particular, we must stress the importance of math      and science to remain at the forefront of innovation and      technology.       The United States has a $1.4 trillion deficit. This issue      relates directly to the amount of overspending in this      country. The proposal by the Republican Party, requesting to      keep the Bush-era tax rates to aid job creation instead of      placing higher taxes on affluent citizens is not enough to      reduce the national debt. Raising taxes on the wealthiest      people in this country will help decrease the national      deficit without severely impacting their financial situation.      We need to make hard choices, we need to cut spending and      raise taxes in order to reduce the deficit.       Healthcare is a benefit that should be given to each      citizen of the United States. In the Declaration of      independence, each person was guaranteed the unalienable      right to ``Life.'' This right should be protected by      universal healthcare, which provides citizens with the      medical care and treatment necessary for their survival and      well-being. Universal healthcare is a basic right for each      citizen.       The United States needs to continue to be a world leader,      however it no longer has the resources to be the ``worlds      policeman.''The United States needs to work more effectively      with other emerging superpowers like China, and Russia to      solve large global issues. Collectively, we have a      responsibility and duty to solve global problems.       To accomplish these goals and create a more effective      government, there needs to be a more civil discourse between      the Democratic and Republican Parties. As the leader of this      Nation, I strive to make positive progress towards these      goals however this can only be achieved if both parties are      willing to make compromises. Working together as one Nation      will strengthen the union. Thank you. God bless you. And God      bless the United States of America.            Jonah Cantor, Champlain Valley Union High School       My fellow Americans, today I will address issues you and I      are facing as a country. Our country's trade deficit with      foreign nations, the flaws of our education system, and the      need for healthcare reform are the problems I will present      and propose solutions for. It is important to attend to these      issues so we can resolve them efficiently as a country.       There is an obvious issue with how disproportionate the      amount our country imports compared to exports. It is time      for America to not only supply itself with a sufficient      amount of goods, but also foreign countries. Of course, this      increase in exports will require more factories to operate.      This increase in factories will affect the economy in      positive ways, mainly through the creation of jobs. More jobs      leads to less poverty and more money flowing throughout the      country. A healthy economy needs money and power distributed      among its citizens.       A successful democracy is dependent on a well-informed and      educated public. The education system in this country has      been slipping in recent years, letting down the citizens. It      is time to give children and young adults opportunities to      experience an excellent education program. More money will be      invested in the educational system, the overall quality of      the education being received will be higher, the equipment in      the classrooms will be up-to-date, and lastly, public      colleges and universities will become affordable. An educated      public leads to more politically-active citizens and a      healthier society. It is critical to give every citizen an      education that will help lead him or her and our country to      success.       There are millions of Americans who currently don't have      healthcare and millions more who are under insured. In the      long run, this fact costs everyone money. These people with      inadequate or no healthcare do not tend to take care of      themselves. Going to see a doctor costs money that they don't      have, so many simply don't go at all. But when one of these      people needs care because of an emergency, everyone pays for      it.       These are all large problems, but they are not      surmountable. We will need to be determined to put in hard      work to accomplish these goals, but the rewards we will have      earned will be great. I hope we can work as a country to      achieve our goals to make a more perfect society.                  Molly Cantore, St. Johnsbury Academy       Each year, the president of the United States addresses      issues the people want to be addressed. While the president      tackles many topics in the State of the Union Address, an      important question arises about one topic in particular      within the economy. Should reducing unemployment become a      short-term goal as the national deficit grows, to be dealt      with on a long-term basis, or vice versa? Another important      topic of discussion and worthy of being addressed is the      encouragement of civic responsibility.       The economy encompasses two closely related topics of much      debate: unemployment and the national deficit. Two points are      more than clear, however. People remain unemployed and the      Nation remains in trillions of dollars in debt. Which concern      takes priority? While creating jobs is excellent for the      economy, it is also hurtful. In order to fight unemployment,      we are dragged further into debt, as the government provides      stimulus money to create more jobs. As the national debt      continues to grow, its triple-A credit rating is at risk of      dropping, which could hinder the U.S.'s ability to borrow      money to finance the deficit. However, if the government      focuses on lessening the deficit, unemployment will increase.      While climbing out of debt pleases the government, the      shrinking job pool displeases the people. The president,      elected by the people, does everything in his power to please      the people, in order to get reelected. Creating more jobs may      put the U.S. in jeopardy of losing its ability to borrow      money in order to finance its deficit, and focusing on      lessening the deficit cuts jobs which displeases the people,      who play a very important role in the democratic government.      Thus, this growing debate should be focused on in the State      of the Union Address.       The people are pertinent to a democratic government. They      have responsibilities as citizens to play that role, called      civic responsibility. In order to participate in and take      action in the government, a citizen must first be informed of      the issues, problems, and challenges that face the country. A      very important part of civic responsibility is voting. People      have a right to vote, and voters, especially young and new      voters, are responsible for being informed of the candidate's      stances and goals. An informed voter will elect the candidate      best fit for guiding the United States to recovery and      prosperity. As the article, ``Mr Obama's unpromising year''      in The Economist states, young and first time voters, ``who      in 2008 were electrified by his person rather than his      policies'' should have instead been informed and should have      voted for President Obama because of his stances and      policies. Therefore, encouragement of civic responsibility,      especially being an informed voter, is a very important issue      that should be addressed in the State of the Union Address.       The State of the Union Address is an important opportunity      in which the voices of the people can be heard. Two important      topics that should be addressed include the encouragement of      civic responsibility and the ever-growing debate of      unemployment versus the deficit.         Kristen Donaldson, Champlain Valley Union High School       My fellow Americans, our history as a country has had its      ups and downs. We've seen hardships like most nations have      never seen before, but also we've seen prosperity that most      nations do not even deem possible. At this point, our Nation      is struggling in one of these ``lows''. However, because of      our proud ``high'' moments that we have in this country, I      know that change is possible with just a few alterations.       Although the unemployment rate has dropped from 10.6      percent to 9.3 percent, that still means 21,830,360 Americans      are unemployed. No way to pay their rent that is riding over      their heads, not sure if they will make it through the      winter, and still have a house to their name. That is the      reality for almost 1 in 10 Americans. We need to create more      jobs, so we can continue to see that percentage decrease. One      way is to create new jobs by initiating a clean energy start.      Hundreds of thousands of jobs lie on the creation and      innovation of clean energy. Why not reduce our unemployment      rate, while leading the world on a new, greener path.       Outsourcing is the second main reason for unemployment      rates. As a country, we need to put our priorities first, and      make sure that we hold onto our jobs. We need to step back up      to the plate again, and continue our stronghold on the title      of the world's powerhouse.       Now, along with instability in jobs, comes the concern of      our overriding deficit. This deficit is like the elephant in      the room. Everyone knows it's there, but no one is doing      anything about it. Our country is in over 14 trillion dollars      of debt. The only viable fix is to cut all of the programs      that simply aren't working. We need to re-think our      approaches, and decide what is needed and what isn't.       Finally, the issue of the rising education costs is      plaguing our Nation, holding children back from their full      potential. If students are able to go to school, \2/3\ of      them will be stuck under student loans once they graduate.      Colleges and universities need to cut their costs, because if      they do so, more students will have a chance at education.      More of these educated citizens will be able to contribute to      our nation.       Ladies and gentlemen, America's history has been a      rollercoaster of ups and downs. We've seen it all, and we      know how to recover from it. By addressing the most prevalent      problems, America will have the opportunity to possibly not      see a ``down'' for a long time.                Susannah Johnson, Vermont Commons School       We Will Not be Perfect, But We Will Be Better       I try to use the word ``perfect'' seldom. In my short life      I've worked with lots of different people in many different      places. And I have come to the sad conclusion that the world      will never be perfect.       The United States, like every country, has problems deeply      concerning to young people. Yet our voices are rarely heard.      Here's my voice.       In my opinion the priority issues are those that involve      the overall wellbeing of people: the economy, renewable      energy, and health care.       The Economy--Since the Recession began in 2008 the economy      has splintered. Thousands of people lost their jobs, lost      their homes, and found themselves struggling to pay for      things like housing, college tuitions, even food on their      tables. In response to the recession, President Obama created      the Recovery Act which helped create three million jobs. The      law helped avoid another Great Depression. But it is      important for the President to face all aspects of the      economic crisis and create a new plan for a ``new era of      responsibility'' (his words). The plan needs to include the      creation of more jobs, a strategy to keep families in their      homes, and finally a plan to get credit flowing again so that      small businesses can reform and hire workers so families are      able to pay for their children to go to college.       Energy--Renewable energy is another long-term goal      President Obama needs to focus on. So far the President's      programs have helped provide short-term relief to families      who struggle to pay for gas at the pump, produce one million      Plug-In Hybrid cars which get up to 150 miles per gallon, and      has told America that by 2012 10 percent of our electricity      must come from renewable sources. These actions have helped      lead the country in the right direction. But more steps need      to be taken. It is important for us to reduce our dependence      on foreign oil. The U.S. should also become the world leader      on climate change. The more people that are aware of the      issue and its effects, the more ideas people will have about      how to resolve it. Creating jobs that are ``green'' is also a      strategy that would be beneficial.       Health Care--More and more Americans have lost their health      insurance over time. They just can't afford good medical      care. There should be no debate whether health care reform is      necessary--it is. Period. Nearly 46 million Americans have no      insurance, and this needs to change. It would be beneficial      to create a health insurance program that would be an option      for all Americans. It's very unfair that there are people who      don't qualify for health insurance because of ``pre-     existing'' health conditions. A program needs to be created      in which nobody is discriminated against, regardless of their      health history. To create a program that does these things      will be expensive, so the President needs to be creative and      figure out where this money will come from. He's smart, he      can do it.               Ingrid Klinkenberg, Edmunds Middle School       The state of our Union can be addressed in many topics; the      economy, education, achievements, failures, and so much more.      There are many things that have happened in the past year, we      have achieved some of our goals, but we have fallen short on      some of our goals as well. A couple of years ago, our country      was in a severe economic decline. Since then our economy has      been improving and looking promising. This is a step in the      right direction. In the other direction, this year our      poverty rates went up by 10.3 percent. If we can do something      to lower the poverty rate in coming years that would be      beneficial. The state of our Union is stronger today than it      was last year, and it can be stronger next year if we stay      focused.       Poverty in the United States is a big problem. Right now      about 13 percent, or nearly 40 million people, are living in      poverty. Many of these people live without a roof over their      head, food on the table, and many work multiple jobs just to      survive.       It would be beneficial to make the opportunity of education      more accessible, education provides opportunities. When more      people have the opportunity of education, more people are      able to have better paying jobs, which will allow them to      better support themselves. Even though education would offer      a brighter future for many, there still will be poverty. It      is an unsolved problem the whole world is faced with. It has      existed in the past, it exists now, and it will exist in the      future. What we can do to make a difference is to decrease      poverty in the future. Better education and more      opportunities will be one of the keys.       In the past few years the U.S. has been recovering from a      devastating economic crisis, which impacted the whole country      and most of the world. Financial institutions collapsed, the      stock markets fell, people's retirement savings were reduced,      and people became more conservative in their spending. Many      jobs were lost, resulting in people not being able to pay for      their homes and the real estate market weakened. The future      for many Americans continues to be uncertain. This past year      our economy has been getting more healthy and promising. The      credit markets have begun to unfreeze allowing companies to      borrow the money they need to expand. Company profits have      improved, which has allowed the stock markets to go up,      benefiting investors. 2010 has been a year that we have been      able to make our economy stronger and healthier.       One sentence to describe this past year, and the change in      the U.S., I would say, ``We are headed in the right      direction, we just need to make a little more change      happen.'' Overall our economy has improved, and if we keep it      at a steady rate like it is now, we will be in a better      position in a couple of years. The poverty rates went up      which told us that we need to work harder on that aspect of      our Union. That is what better and more affordable education      will do in the United States. There were defiantly postitives      and negitives about the state of our Union this past year,      and I think it was a good step in the right direction for a      better future in our Union.         Ezra Mount-Finette, Champlain Valley Union High School       Mr. Speaker, Vice president Biden, Members of the Congress,      distinguished guests and fellow American citizens.       I am here before you today, to full fill one of my      constitutional responsibilities to address congress on the      current state of union. My speech tonight is not meant just      for the hundred and twelfth congress but also to the citizens      concerned in the condition of our country.       Half way through my presidential term, we have brought our      country out of a recession, passed a health care bill that      delivered healthcare to every single United State citizen,      constructed loan programs helping students pay for college,      and cut taxes for everyone. Yet we still have a growing 14.5      trillion dollar debt, 9.4 percent of the country is out of      work and we have troops stationed in Afghanistan and Iraq.       We have work to do, and I am first going to address the      subject of partisanship, not just in Congress but also      throughout the country. We might be Muslim, Jewish,      Christian, old, young, African-American, Mexican-American,      Caucasian, democrat or republican but there is one thing we      all are; citizen of this great country. I want to remind      Congress that their duty is to represent the United States      and what is in the country's best interest. That there are no      two sides of an issue just two opinions; both with there own      reasoning behind them. Your job as Congressmen is to create      the optimal legislation that benefits the citizens of the      country, not legislation that is beneficial to a party, a      company or yourself, but to the three hundred million other      people that live in the United States of America. Take those      two ideas and work together to compromise. Look past the D or      R that is by your name     and look at your passport, your license and tax forms and      stare at the word ``America'' that is printed on them.       Our economy is not on the brink of collapse, but on the      brink of success. As I stood hear last year, banks were in      trouble and weren't loaning out money. The stock market was      plummeting and everyone was panicking. People were wondering      how they would make it through the next year. Now the banks      are stabilized and have started to give out more loans, the      stock market is gaining point and people are feeling more      comfortable about their future. With Unemployment still at      one of its highest levels in the past century I am looking      forward to working with my fellow colleagues in drafting      legislation that will bring jobs back into the economy. We      have almost recovered from this current recession. By the      time my term in office is complete I promise that I will      bring our economy out of the trouble that the previous      administration created for us.       I look forward to working and helping with the new Senate      and House of representatives in restoring this country to the      greatness it deserves.       Thank you, God bless you and God Bless the United States of      America. Thank you                 1Lisa Ogorzalek of Rutland High School       Dear Mr. Speaker, Vice President Biden, Members of      Congress, distinguished guests, and fellow Americans:       During the terms you all have been in office, the United      States has gone through many changes. Many changes have been      for the benefit of our economy, and many have created      problems for the people of America. This country has many      issues that need to be resolved if we want to make this      generation stronger than the ones that came before it. By      having a specific short-term goal, such as having healthcare      for all, and having a specific long-term goal, such as      reducing the national deficit, I think the young people of      this Nation will have the opportunity to thrive.       First, a short-term goal that I think would benefit America      right now is having healthcare for all. Many young people's      families in this country cannot afford healthcare, and their      wellness is suffering with each day. To make healthcare      available to all, I propose to have health insurance      companies share a percent of their revenue with the      government, based on their yearly income. With this money,      the government can then fund designated hospitals to provide      healthcare for the people who cannot afford it. This way, the      people who receive healthcare through their jobs can keep it,      and young people who are not fortunate enough to have it can      get it through government aid.       Next, a longer-term goal that would benefit America's youth      would be to decrease the national deficit. Our Nation's      budget is complex and divided into many parts, and as a      result of these components, we are in trillions of dollars of      debt. Although it would be difficult to significantly reduce      our debt in the next few years, there are some arrangements      that would help lower the amount of debt we hold. For      example, we could raise taxes for people who make at least      half a million dollars a year. This would create an increase      in tax revenue. If we could keep this increase steady and not      spend more than the rate of inflation, or Nation's debt would      be significantly reduced. As a result, we would be less      dependent on foreign countries, such as China. Since they      hold 11 percent of our debt, we could reduce this number to      let our nation's money go to other important matters, such as      poverty and research for illness.       Overall, this Nation has gone through many changes in the      past few decades. If we could make healthcare available to      all, especially young people, and reduce the national      deficit, then this generation has the opportunity to really      succeed. These changes would also help improve our economy,      global position, and overall wellness of the young people in      America.           Bryn Philibert, Champlain Valley Union High School       My fellow Americans,       This year our country has risen out of a recession that      threatened the economic stability of many Americans. We have      taken great strides to restore the hope and promise America      has always stood for. In 2010 we have made great progress but      there is still much more to do moving forward, which is why I      am taking this opportunity to address you. I am addressing      you all to call to all esteemed members of Congress to step      up and help me once again put the United States back on top      as a world leader in democracy and peace.       Two years after the recession devastated our people, we      finished this past year with an unemployment rate of 9.4      percent, down 0.6 percent from the end of 2009. Consumer and      business confidence is on the rise and we have finally come      to a bipartisan agreement on new tax-cut legislation. We      reached a compromise to improve economic growth, help the      struggling middle-class families, and business development.      We have also made historic steps towards the promise of      equality for all with the repealing of the ban on open      homosexual service men and women in our armed forces.       This year's Health Care Reform Bill set forth legislation      to expand coverage to 32 million currently uninsured      Americans. Along with this, the bill allowed health care to      became less expensive for people to purchase and starting in      2014 insurance companies will no longer be able to deny      coverage to anyone based on pre-existing conditions. This      marks the turning point that great Americans, like the late      Senator Ted Kennedy, worked their entire lives for.       By August of this past year we had shrunk the number of      troops in Iraq to 50,000 down from 110,000 a year ago, and we      have ended all U.S. combat missions in Iraq. By the end of      2011 all American troops will be withdrawn from Iraq. There      is still much to be done around the world to ensure a terror      free future, but we have made substantial steps towards that      goal in the past year.       America has faced challenges this year such as the oil      spill in the Gulf. We have learned from this environmental      crisis and we are moving forward with new knowledge on how to      respond to the economic impacts of a crisis like this.       It is a known fact of American politics that U.S.      politicians rarely agree in issues across the board, but I      know that all of us in this room can agree that we come here      every day to ensure that all American people get the      opportunity to live in our great country. Now more than ever      bipartisanship is going to be imperative to the achievements      of the upcoming year. I urge you all, Democrats and      Republicans, to work together to live up to the promise of      America as our forefathers have.       Thank you.                          ____________________
