Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mark Kozak from Kodiak, Alaska. After 30 years of work with the City of Kodiak Public Works Department, Mark is retiring on May 18, 2018.   Mark was born and raised in Kodiak. Following high school, he learned to fly and for ten years worked as a commercial bush pilot in Kodiak, operating single and twin-engine aircraft. He was well known for flying the Grumman Goose and transporting fishermen, hunters and villagers to all points on the island.   In 1988, Mark began working for the City of Kodiak as a Utility Worker in the Public Works Department. He was quickly promoted to Equipment Operator and from there became the Maintenance Supervisor. In 2002, Mark was asked to serve as the Public Works Director.   The 27 employees of the Public Works Department have many responsibilities that directly impact the health and safety of the community. These include street, building and equipment maintenance and repair, operation and maintenance of the municipal airport and float-plane facilities, building permits and inspections, a water treatment and distribution system designed for up to ten million gallons per day, wastewater treatment and collection, a United States Council Certified compost facility, and nine regulated dams with a total holding capacity of 1.0 billion gallons of water. Kodiak is one of the top fishing ports in the nation and it is vital that the water system be reliable and of sufficient quantity for processing the millions of pounds of seafood each year.   Throughout his career, Mark has held to the highest standards, and his dedication and commitment to the taxpayers of Kodiak is well known. With his leadership the Public Works Department has accomplished numerous achievements for the community. Major projects have included extensive water, sewer and road renovation and replacement, an ultraviolet plant for the water treatment facility, the planning and building of a compost facility, and a new pump house at the Monashka Dam.   Following retirement, Mark and his wife, Linda, plan to remain in Kodiak where they enjoy boating, sport fishing, hiking, and photography.   Mr. Speaker, I am honored to recognize Mark Kozak for his many years of selfless service for the people of his community and for the City of Kodiak. Please join me in congratulating Mark on his retirement and to wish him our best.                          ____________________
