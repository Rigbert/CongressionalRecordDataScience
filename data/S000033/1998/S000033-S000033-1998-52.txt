 Chairman, the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Frank) took the words out of my mouth. I appreciate his yielding.  Here is the point: The gentleman asks what might have happened. He does not know what might have happened, I do not know what might have happened. But this I do know; that the so-called global economy, of which the ESF is an integral part, has helped lower the standard of living of workers in the United States, lowered the standard of living of Mexican workers, lowered the standard of living of the people in Canada, has been disastrous.
