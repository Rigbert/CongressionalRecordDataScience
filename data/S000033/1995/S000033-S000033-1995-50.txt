 Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, my friend, the gentleman from Illinois, just used the expression, he said ``the genius of what is happening.'' I think that is what he said. I am a little confused.  My understanding is that what is happening in the economy today is that the real wages of American workers are plummeting. Real wages have gone down by 16 percent since 1973. My understanding of what is going on in the economy today is that the new jobs that are being created are low-wage jobs, part-time jobs, temporary jobs, often without benefits. My understanding of what is going on in the economy today is that while corporate profits are soaring, and the incomes of the chief executive officers are now 150 times what the workers are making, more and more companies are taking our jobs to Mexico and to China.  I would like to ask my friend, the gentleman from Illinois, tell me, what is the genius of all of that?
