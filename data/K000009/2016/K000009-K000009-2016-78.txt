 Mr. Chair, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee has been absolutely unrelenting in her representation of Houston and of the serious situation that is faced there by the citizenry and leaders because of the flooding. What a tremendous voice she is for the people whom she represents. There isn't a time that I see her in the elevators or walking around that she doesn't ask me about this bill and about wanting to come down and amend it to make sure that it is sensitive to the needs of Houston. I just wanted to put that on the record.
