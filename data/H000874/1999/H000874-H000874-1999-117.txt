Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise to join the gentleman from New York (Mr. Gilman), the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Taylor), and others who cosponsored this resolution and the gentleman from California (Mr. Thomas), the chairman of the House Committee on Administration, in support of House Resolution 172.                              {time}  1430  This action, hopefully, will help both historians, researchers and, most of all, loved ones of missing American servicemen in Southeast Asia; and we should strive, when at all possible, for a policy of openness with respect to the records of loved ones who fought overseas on behalf of our country.  Simply put, this resolution would declassify the records of the House Select Committee on Missing Persons. It would authorize and direct the archivist of the United States to make these records available to the public.  In the 1970s, Mr. Speaker, the Select Committee investigated and tried to determine whether American servicemen had, in fact, been left behind in Southeast Asia after the Vietnam War. As has been explained, House rules mandated when the Select Committee was dissolved that its records be kept secret for 50 years. Similar rules governed the records of the Senate Select Committee that studied the same issue.  However, several years ago, Mr. Speaker, the Senate agreed to reduce the period of secrecy to 20 years and, thus, directed all its committee files be declassified. We should do the same thing, and we should do it for two principle reasons:  First, the families and loved ones of missing servicemen in Southeast Asia deserve and ought to know what the House Select Committee uncovered, and they should not have to wait even another day. These families should not have to fight their government on the release of these files, particularly since many of their loved ones fought so valiantly, so bravely, on behalf of our government, our people, and our commitment to democracy.  Finally, Mr. Speaker, I believe that secrecy only fuels suspicion. While there are, of course, secrets the government must keep for national security reasons, this is not the case in this instance. As the Senate Select Committee stated in its final report, and I quote, ``Nothing has done more to fuel suspicion about the government's handling of the POW-MIA issue than the fact that so many documents related to those efforts have remained classified for so long.''  Mr. Speaker, today we have an opportunity to end that suspicion, and we certainly should do it. I commend the gentleman from New York (Mr. Gilman) and the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Taylor), the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Talent), and the gentleman from California (Mr. Rohrabacher), who introduced this resolution, and I am pleased to rise on behalf of its immediate passage.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
