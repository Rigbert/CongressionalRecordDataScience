Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the Pombo amendment because I truly do not believe that this is a matter for our Committee on Appropriations.  I am opposed to the amendment of the gentleman from California that redesignates Galt, CA, as an urban community rather than a rural community.  I remain concerned about the purpose of this language and the unintended consequences that may result. The town council of Galt has not voted to ask the Congress for repeal of its eligibility for rural housing assistance. There is no official resolution asking us to do this. And in fact even if they had, the appropriations bill is not the proper place in order to consider this.  In addition, Mr. Chairman, the current Federal statutes do not force any town to take rural housing assistance. It is optional if they wish to seek it. So why would any Member wish to lift this designation from their town?  Finally, it is our understanding that many low-income families seeking to invest their own sweat equity in helping to build their own homes will lose that opportunity in Galt as a result of this amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I have continued to strongly oppose this amendment. This addresses a local matter in which this Congress, certainly the Committee on Appropriations, should not intervene. Why should the Federal Government set a separate policy affecting one community that sets a terrible precedent for other communities to appeal to the Committee on Appropriations for special treatment to resolve their local issues. It is simply not our job to do that.  Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy], the ranking member on the Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity, and urge a ``no'' vote on the Pombo amendment.
