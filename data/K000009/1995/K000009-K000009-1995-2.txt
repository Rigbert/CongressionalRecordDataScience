Speaker, I rise to call attention to the sanctimonious advertisements in favor of the Gingrich budget that have been taken out in major newspapers across our country signed by some of the richest, most powerful chief executive officers in this Nation representing large multinational corporations like Boeing, IBM, Eastman Kodak, Zenith, Sarah Lee, and General Motors.  Did you ever stop to wonder why these corporations are spending a small fortune lobbying for the Gingrich budget? In fact it costs $60,000--double the salary of an average worker in my district--just to buy one page, much less two, in major dailies like the Washington Post, USA Today, the Wall Street Journal, and many of the other ones in which they have been advertising. In fact, they spent over a half a million dollars just in four of these papers over the last couple days.  Now do you believe what they say in the ads, that they really have a common concern for America's future? You know, I was trying to put this together as I was reading various articles, and I came upon the Time magazine special, the Christmas issue.                              {time}  1800  It talks a lot about Speaker Gingrich in this issue. I turned to page 65 of the Christmas issue of Time. I read down here where it says, ``The Speaker invited a small group of chief executive officers'' from these very same companies to meetings here in the Capitol on the first floor, and it names names: Jack Welch of General Electric, Jack Smith of General Motors, Business Round Table, Chairman John Snow of CSX, who by the way has a very large signature in this ad, and they talked about how they could work together on this problem. I thought to myself, ``Why would the Speaker invite them, but he does not invite people from my district?'' In fact, the senior citizens of this country did not even get 1 day of hearings on the Medicare changes that are proposed.  Mr. Speaker, how did they get that much access? Bingo: money. For example, CSX Corp.--one of the organizers, chief organizers of this advertising effort, and part of the group calling itself the Business Round Table--contributed nearly $100,000--to the Republican Party in the first 6 months of this year alone. Another signatory, Prudential, contributed over $90,000; AT&T over $150,000; Chevron contributed over $125,000. Listen to these numbers. This is not a new few pennies, this is not a hundred dollars, these are not a thousand dollars, these are hundreds of thousands of dollars by these very same interests.  You might ask yourself, what did these corporations get in this access with the Speaker for all of their money? How about this: The Gingrich budget includes a $64 billion set of tax breaks for wealthy individuals like these very same CEO's, many of whom make up to $12 million a year. They include a $36 billion capital gains tax cut which they will all benefit from, a $16 billion cut in the corporate alternative minimum tax, $12 billion in other tax cuts, such as estate tax exemptions, which of course they personally are all interested in.  It used to be in 1945, not so many years ago, that corporations paid about a third of the taxes that flowed into the Government of the United States. Today they pay about 10 percent. So we hear them crying these crocodile tears when their profits and Wall Street, the profits are going through the roof, and Wall Street has never been happier. At the same time as we see this, we see the Gingrich budget allowing these very same companies to withdraw over $20 billion of our workers' money from their pension funds to use it any way they well please.  Mr. Speaker, we see pharmaceutical companies like Abbott Laboratories, American Home Products, by the way, they are listed in this very same ad, Baxter International, Johnson & Johnson enjoy multimillion dollar tax breaks through the 936 program, a subsidy that is included in the Gingrich budget; energy corporations like Amoco, Exxon, Chevron, benefit from provisions in the Gingrich budget that allow them to extract oil and gas from the Gulf of Mexico without paying any royalty to the public coffers for that privilege, making their profits at the expense of the United States of America and its people; companies like AT&T, Exxon, Ford Motor, and GTE have enjoyed millions of dollars of foreign sales assistance through the Overseas Private Investment Corporation [OPIC], and those benefits are retained in the Gingrich budget.  What is interesting is these very same companies that want all these benefits and are paying all this money for access here in Washington have not created a single job in this country for the last decade and a half. For the Record, Mr. Speaker, I submit some of these names, like IBM, that has laid off over 23,000 workers in this country just over the last few years.  I would like to say to Mr. Fisher, their CEO, what a merry Christmas you have given to the American people.  Mr. Speaker, I include for the Record the following:  Without a Balanced Budget, the Party's Over--No Matter Which Party                                You're in       A bipartisan appeal from business leaders to the President      of the United States Bill Clinton, House Speaker Newt      Gingrich, Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, Senate Minority      Leader Tom Daschle, House Majority Leader Dick Armey, House      Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, and all Members of Congress:       There are moments in history when a single choice can mean      the difference between vastly differing futures--one bright,      the other dark. We believe that you, the political leaders of      this country, are now confronting such a choice in your      deliberations over a plan to balance the federal budget.       We are convinced that the health of our economy rests on      your ability to avoid political gridlock and give the      American people what leaders of both parties say they favor      and, indeed, have agreed to--a credible plan to balance the      budget. By ``credible'' we mean that such a plan should:       Use realistic projections that assume the fiscal and      economic scenario developed by the Congressional Budget      Office and reviewed by objective third parties;       Take no longer than seven years as the maximum time period      by which a balanced budget would be achieved;       Ensure that the process of deficit reduction is achieved in      roughly equal steps throughout these seven years, rather than      ``backloading'' the politically difficult decisions into the      next century; and       Have everything on the table, including long-term      entitlement programs as well as the size and shape of any tax      cuts.       Included among us are Democrats and Republicans, Liberals      and Conservatives. What unites us in this appeal is our      common concern for America's future.       All of us are leaders of institutions keenly sensitive to      interest rates and the short- and long-term outlook for the      U.S. economy. We believe that the recent decline in long-term      interest rates and much of the boom in the stock market is      directly predicated on the financial markets' expectation      that a successful bipartisan budget-balancing compromise will      be reached quickly, and that a credible long-term plan will      be put in place in short order.       Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan recently      observed: ``If there is a shattering of expectations that      leads to the conclusion that there is indeed an inability to      ultimately redress the corrosive forces of deficit, I think      the reaction would be quite negative--that is, a sharp      increase in long-term interest rates . . . I think we would      find that with mortgage rates higher and other related rates      moving up, interest-sensitive areas of the economy would      begin to run into trouble.''       As you continue your negotiations, we ask you to reflect on      the full consequences of success or failure. However      Americans ultimately resolve our honest and principled      disagreements over the size and scope of government, America      must begin to live within it means.       The time for good economics as well as good politics is      NOW.       America is waiting.           Respectfully yours,         Paul Allaire, Chairman and CEO, Xerox Corp.; Richard H.
