 We are.  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, earlier today the Senate voted to invoke cloture on the bipartisan Rockefeller-Bond bill. It was not a close vote. Rather, it was a strong bipartisan show of support for this important piece of legislation.  The Protect America Act expires at the end of this week. That is Saturday, February 16.  Twenty-one House Democrats have written to Speaker Pelosi saying they ``fully support'' the Rockefeller-Bond bill if it is not changed substantially--and it was not changed--and they urge her, the Speaker, to ``quickly consider'' the bill in order ``to get a bill signed into law before the Protect America Act expires in February.''  I have a copy of the letter signed by 21 Democrats, so-called Blue Dog Democrats, in the House. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                Congress of the United States,                                 Washington, DC, January 28, 2008.       Dear Madam Speaker: Legislation reforming the Foreign      Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) is currently being      considered by the Senate. Following the Senate's passage of a      FISA bill, it will be necessary for the House to quickly      consider FISA legislation     to get a bill to the President before the Protect America Act      expires in February.       It is our belief that such legislation should include the      following provisions: Require individualized warrants for      surveillance of U.S. citizens living or traveling abroad;      Clarify that no court order is required to conduct      surveillance of foreign-to-foreign communications that are      routed through the United States; Provide enhanced oversight      by Congress of surveillance laws and procedures; Compel      compliance by private sector partners; Review by FISA Court      of minimization procedures; Targeted immunity for carriers      that participated in anti-terrorism surveillance programs.       The Rockefeller-Bond FISA legislation contains satisfactory      language addressing all these issues and we would fully      support that measure should it reach the House floor without      substantial change. We believe these components will ensure a      strong national security apparatus that can thwart terrorism      across the globe and save American lives here in our country.       It is also critical that we update the FISA laws in a      timely manner. To pass a long-term extension of the Protect      America Act, as some may suggest, would leave in place a      limited, stopgap measure that does not fully address critical      surveillance issues. We have it within our ability to replace      the expiring Protect America Act by passing strong,      bipartisan FISA modernization legislation that can be signed      into law and we should do so--the consequences of not passing      such a measure could place our national security at undue      risk.           Sincerely,         Leonard L. Boswell, ------, Mike Ross, Bud Cramer, Heath            Shuler, Allen Boyd, Dan Boren, Jim Matheson, Lincoln            Davis, Tim Holden, Dennis Moore, Earl Pomeroy, Melissa            L. Bean, John Barrow, Joe Baca, John Tanner, Jim            Cooper, Zachary T. Space, Brad Ellsworth, Charlie            Melancon, Christopher P. Carney.  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, it is clear that not only does the Rockefeller-Bond bill enjoy bipartisan majority support in the Senate, it also enjoys bipartisan majority support in the House. It is a tribute to the fine work of the Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Rockefeller, and the Senator from Missouri, Mr. Bond, in pulling this complex piece of legislation together and getting extraordinary support across the aisle.  This bill protects the country. It is a bill that will be signed by the President of the United States, so we are making a law here. We need to focus on completing action on this legislation and get it to the President before the Protect America Act expires.  As to further delays: Back in August, our Democratic colleagues said an additional 6 months was needed to get this right. In the fall, they said: We need a little more time. Last month, they said: Give us another 15 days and we can wrap it up. At this point, no Member of this body can reasonably state this piece of legislation was hastily or unfairly considered. It has been the product of 6 months' work, intense work on behalf of Senator Rockefeller and Senator Bond.  We do not need yet another extension, yet another delay. We need to focus on getting our work done. I am confident that with the help of our friends on the other side of the aisle, we can get a second bipartisan accomplishment to the President in as many weeks. Tomorrow, he will sign the stimulus package--an important bipartisan accomplishment. Later in the week, he could conceivably be in a position to sign this important piece of bipartisan legislation.  I encourage my colleagues in the House and the Senate to redouble their efforts toward this end. That would show the American people that Congress can indeed function on a bipartisan basis on important issues before the country.  I am among those proud of the fine work done by Senator Rockefeller and Senator Bond. This is a terrific, important piece of legislation. I know it will pass the Senate shortly, overwhelmingly.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
