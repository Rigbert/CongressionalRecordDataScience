 The Acting CHAIR (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen). The gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 minutes.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Madam Chair, I agree that regulations often need scrutiny and revision and sometimes elimination, but this bill undertakes a good deal of streamlining, both in the environmental area and in other processes.  So, if we were to go down the road of a study looking at these programs, I would say a study that is a little broader, which would look at both the costs and benefits of regulation, would be useful. I don't think this one-sided study would be particularly useful.  If we want to understand the purchasing power of our highway dollars, we only need to look at the fact that Congress has failed to increase the gas tax since 1993, during which time the purchasing power, due to inflation and construction costs, has diminished by a good 40 percent or more. Whether or not we will be allowed to take action on significant revenues under this bill is still being deliberated upstairs in the Rules Committee with amendments that might or might not be allowed to be offered.  I urge opposition to the amendment.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New Hampshire (Mr. Guinta).  The amendment was rejected.                 Amendment No. 12 Offered by Mr. Hanna  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 12 printed in part B of House Report 114-325.
