 It is my hope that some time will be yielded back, allowing us to proceed to a vote earlier in the afternoon. We have had full debate on this nomination. We all appreciate the orderly fashion in which we have conducted the debate.  Again, Senators are reminded to gather at 8:30 this evening in the Senate Chamber. The Senate will proceed as a body promptly at 8:40 tonight and to the Hall of the House of Representatives for the President's 9 p.m. address.                          ____________________
