  With the passage of this bill, Yosemite, Manzanar, and Golden Gate National Parks will receive the Federal support needed to continue to offer a broad range of services to the millions of tourists and Californians who visit these national treasures each year.  This bill meets four distinct needs in these parks: it authorizes the Interior Secretary to designate Federal emergency funds to small schools in Yosemite National Park, allows the Yosemite Area Regional Transportation System, YARTS, to continue operating and extends the Manzanar and Golden Gate National Recreational Area, GGNRA, Advisory Commissions for ten more years.  The first component of this bill provides critical funds to three small schools nestled in the heart of Yosemite National Park.  Approximately 126 children of park service employees are taught in the quaint one-room buildings of Wawoma, El Portal, and Yosemite Valley elementary schools. The remote location of these schools, along with their small sizes and California's unique method for funding education, have all contributed to the schools amassing a combined deficit of $241,000. In their efforts to continue to provide basic educational services to students, the schools have had to cut supplemental instruction that would normally be available to students taught outside of the Park.  In light of these facts, this bill allows the Interior Secretary to assist these schools if their combined state funding falls below $75,000. It also clarifies how funds will be used by limiting allocations to providing general upkeep, maintenance, and classroom instruction.  Furthermore, this legislation allows the Park Service to allot federal funds for the continuing operation of the Yosemite Area Regional Transportation System, YARTS.  YARTS is a bus service that gives visitors the option of taking a free shuttle through Yosemite National Park instead of driving on their own. Since it began operating in 2000, this service has played a crucial role in improving visitor accessibility to the Park's attractions, alleviating traffic congestion on access roads and reducing the amount of air pollution emitted by incoming cars.  The Federally funded demonstration project that allowed YARTS to offer services on a temporary basis expired in May and since then, YARTS has leveraged local funds to ensure that services were not discontinued.  Both the Park Service and YARTS are supportive of continuing their mutually beneficial agreement. This legislation would do just that by taking the burden off local entities and providing the necessary assistance that this service needs.  The last component of this bill will extend the advisory commissions of the Manzanar Historic Site and Golden Gate National Recreation Area for ten more years.  Both of these commissions have active committees that represent a wide range of user groups from bicyclists to bird watchers to outdoor enthusiasts. They provide a vital communications link between the Park Service and the surrounding communities that enjoy the attractions that these national sites have to offer. Without these commissions, the Park Service would be hard pressed to provide the same level of service and attention to the broad interests and diverse communities that they serve.  I continue to be a strong advocate for public involvement in Park Service decisions. I believe that these commissions have been essential in ensuring that the Park Service upholds its commitment to allow community participation in its decision making process, particularly when it comes to contentious issues.  California's national parks are truly invaluable, each one of the parks that this bill supports offers an opportunity for visitors and residents to enjoy unique national habitats and open spaces. This legislation mark the beginning of a process that I hope will result in the Park Service and the community working together not only to protect the environment, but also the interests of the nearby communities. I invite my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.                                 ______                                       By
