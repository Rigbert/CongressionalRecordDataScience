I read this resolution, and it is hard to argue with a resolution that is praising marriage and the married. I think we are all for that. Anything in the law of this land, whether tax law or otherwise, which detracts from that institution, should be examined and seriously considered.  But I keep wondering--I am not an expert on tax law, but there are some situations where marriage actually reduces the tax burden; where, in fact, if you have one of the spouses who has a high income and marries someone with a much lower income, it could reduce the tax rate. I certainly hope there is nothing in this sense-of-the-Senate resolution which suggests we should change that. I think we want to try to encourage people, and when the Tax Code rewards those who are married, we should continue doing that.  What I am told is there are two sides to the story. As there are those who are losers and are penalized by the Tax Code by marriage, there are those who are benefited by the Tax Code.
