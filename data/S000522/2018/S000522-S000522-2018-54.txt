Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Jody B. Hice), who is co-chair of the Values Action Team. It is worth noting that he is part of the team back home that has now been ranked number 8 by Americans United for Life in what they call the ``Life List'' because of the legislation and the policies that have come forward in Georgia to protect life.  He was a pastor before coming to Congress and has been a leader for religious liberty as well in the House.
