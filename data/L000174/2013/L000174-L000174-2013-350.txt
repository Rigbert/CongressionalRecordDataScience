President, today the Senate will confirm Judge Charles Breyer, Rachel Barkow, and Judge William Pryor to the U.S. Sentencing Commission. While it is good that the Senate is acting to confirm Judge Pryor and Rachel Barkow following their unanimous approval by the Judiciary Committee 2 weeks ago, it is wrong that Senate Republicans forced Judge Breyer to wait so long for confirmation. Judge Breyer was first reported unanimously last July, nearly 11 months ago. Despite that unanimous support, Senate Republicans, as they have done so many times, refused to act on his nomination on the floor and forced the President to renominate him this year for no good reason.  Judge Breyer has an outstanding record in public service, and has served as a U.S. District Judge for the Northern District of California since 1998, assuming senior status last year. He hasalso worked in private practice and as a prosecutor--both in the San Francisco District Attorney's office and on the Watergate Special Prosecution Force. After graduating from law school he served as a law clerk to Chief Judge Oliver J. Carter of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Additionally, from 1969 to 1973, Judge Breyer was a Captain in the U.S. Army's Judge Advocate General's Corps. Judge Breyer will be an outstanding addition to the Sentencing Commission.  Rachel Barkow has been a law professor at the New York University School of Law for the past 11 years. She previously worked as an associate in private practice at Kellogg Huber Hansen Todd & Evans, P.L.L.C. in Washington, D.C. In 2001, she took leave from private practice to serve as the John M. Olin Fellow in Law at Georgetown University Law Center. Following law school, Professor Barkow served as a law clerk for D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Laurence H. Silberman and Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.  William Pryor is currently a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, a position to which he was confirmed in 2005. Prior to becoming a judge, he served as the Attorney General of Alabama from 1997 to 2004, where he led the effort to create Alabama's sentencing commission.  I thank the Chair.
