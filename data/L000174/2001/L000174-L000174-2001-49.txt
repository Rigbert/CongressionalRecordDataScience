President, I rise to introduce the Terrorist Bombing Convention Implementation Act of 2001 and the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism Convention Implementation Act of 2001. This bill would bring the United States into indisputable and immediate compliance with two important international conventions, which were signed by the United States and transmitted to the U.S. Senate for ratification by President Clinton. Both Conventions were entered into after the terrorist bombings at the United States embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. The bill also contains a provision which would enhance the ability of law enforcement authorities to work with their foreign counterparts in fighting sophisticated international criminal organizations by sharing wiretap information when appropriate.  The International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings, ``Bombing Convention'', was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in December 1997 and signed by the United States in January 1998. In September 1999, it was transmitted to the Senate by President Clinton for ratification.  The International Convention for the Suppression of Financing Terrorism, ``Financing Convention'', was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in December 1999 and signed by the United States in January 2000. In October 2000, it was transmitted to the Senate by President Clinton for ratification.  Under the chairmanship of Senator Biden, the Foreign Relations Committee has moved expeditiously to report these conventions to the full Senate. Once ratified, they should be swiftly implemented. The passage of the proposed implementing legislation which I introduce today would ensure that the United States is in immediate compliance with these international obligations relating to terrorism.  Both conventions require signatory nations to adopt criminal laws prohibiting specified terrorist activities in order to create a regime of universal jurisdiction over certain crimes. Articles 2 and 4 of the Bombing Convention require signatory countries to criminalize the delivery, placement, discharge or detonation of explosives and other lethal devices, ``in, into, or against'' various defined public places with the intent to kill, cause serious bodily injury, or extensively damage such public places. The Bombing Convention also requires that signatories criminalize aiding and abetting, attempting, or conspiring to commit such crimes.  Articles 2 and 4 of the Financing Convention require signatory countries tocriminalize willfully ``providing or collecting'' funds, directly or indirectly, with knowledge that they are to be used to carry out acts which either 1. violate nine enumerated existing treaties, or 2. are aimed at killing or injuring civilians with the purpose of intimidating a population or compelling a government to do any act. The Financing Convention also requires that signatories criminalize aiding and abetting, attempting, or conspiring to commit such crimes. Signatories must criminalize such acts under Article 2 whether or not ``the funds were actually used to carry out'' such an offense.  Both conventions require that signatory nations exercise limited extraterritorial jurisdiction and extradite or prosecute those who commit such crimes when found inside their borders. The conventions also require that signatories ensure that, under their domestic laws, political, religious, ideological, racial or other similar considerations are not a justification for committing the enumerated crimes. Thus, signatory nations will not be able to assert such bases to deny an extradition request for a covered crime. Finally, Article 4 of each convention requires that signatory states make the covered offenses ``punishable by appropriate penalties which take into account the grave nature of [the] offenses.''  This proposed implementation legislation, consistent with the House version of this bill, H.R. 3275, creates two new crimes, one for bombings and another for financing terrorist acts, that would track precisely the language in the treaties, and bring the United States into undisputed compliance. The bill would also provide extraterritorial jurisdiction as required by the conventions. Furthermore the bill would create domestic jurisdiction for these crimes in limited situations where a national interest is implicated, while excluding jurisdiction over acts where the convention does not require such jurisdiction and there is no distinct federal interest served.  The bill, again consistent with the H.R. 3275, also contains ``ancillary provisions'' that would make the two new crimes predicates for money laundering charges, wiretaps, RICO charges, an 8-year statute of limitations, include them as ``federal crimes of terrorism,'' and make civil asset forfeiture available for the new terrorism financing crime. Existing laws which relate to similar crimes are predicates for each of these tools, and providing law enforcement with these ancillary provisions is both consistent and appropriate.  Neither international convention requires a death penalty provision for any covered crime, and the Department of Justice has provided a memorandum to Congress, in response to a request for its views, that such a provision would not be required to bring the United States into compliance. This should come as no surprise, given international sentiment opposing the United States' use of the death penalty in other contexts. Indeed, the inclusion of a death penalty provision in the implementing legislation for these conventions could lead to complications in extraditing individuals to the United States from countries that do not employ the death penalty. Therefore, unlike the House version of the implementing legislation, the Senate version contains no new death penalty provision.  Unlike H.R. 3275, the bill does not contain a third crime for ``concealment'' of material support for terrorists. The Department of Justice has conceded in the memorandum which it provided to Congress that this provision is not necessary to bring the United States into compliance with the conventions. Indeed, in the wake of the passage of similar provisions in the USA Patriot Act, P.L. No. 107-56, such legislation is not needed. Furthermore, although a similar provision is currently set forth in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2339A, the House bill provides a lower mens rea requirement than that law; an important change which was not highlighted in the Administration materials provided explaining the proposal.  Finally, the Senate bill contains an important new tool for international cooperation between law enforcement which is not included in H.R. 3275. Currently, there is no clear statutory authority which allows domestic law enforcement agents to share Title III wiretap information with foreign law enforcement counterparts. This may create problems when, for example, the DEA wants to alert Colombian authorities that a cocaine shipment is about to leave a Colombian port but the information is derived from a Title III wiretap.  This bill would clarify the authority for sharing wiretap derived information, specifically in the Title III context. The bill provides a clear mechanism through which law enforcement may share wiretap information with foreign law enforcement, while at the same time ensuring that there are appropriate safeguards to protect this sensitive information against misuse. It adds a subsection to 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2517, that permits disclosure of wiretap information to foreign officials (1) with judicial approval, (2) in such a manner and under such conditions as a court may direct, and (3) consistent with Attorney General guidelines on how the information may be used to protect confidentiality. This clarification will provide an additional tool to investigate international criminal enterprises and to seek the assistance of foreign law enforcement in our efforts.  For all of these reasons, I am pleased to introduce this legislation and I urge its swift enactment into law.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record, along with the sectional analysis.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1770       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,               TITLE I--SUPPRESSION OF TERRORIST BOMBINGS     SEC. 101.

In making any application under this      subsection, the attorney for the government shall certify      that the official or officials for whom an order permitting      disclosure is sought, have been informed that they may only      make use of the information provided under this subsection      consistent with such guidelines as the Attorney General shall      issue to protect confidentiality.''.                                       ____ Anti-Terrorism Conventions Implementation--Section-by-Section Analysis               TITLE I Suppression of Terrorist Bombings       Title I of this bill implements the International      Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings, which      was signed by the United States on January 12, 1998, and was      transmitted to the Senate for its advice and consent to      ratification on September 8, 1999. Twenty-eight States are      currently party to the Convention, which entered into force      internationally on May 23, 2001. The Convention requires      State Parties to combat terrorism by criminalizing certain      attacks on public places committed with explosives or other      lethal devices, including biological, chemical and      radiological devices. The Convention also requires that State      Parties criminalize aiding and abetting, conspiring and      attempting to undertake such terrorist attacks.                        Section 101. Short Title       Section 101 provides that title I may be cited as ``The      Terrorist Bombings Convention Implementation Act of 2001.''                      Section 102. Bombing Statute       Section 102 adds a new section to the Federal criminal      code, to be codified at 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2332f and entitled      ``Bombings of places of public use, government facilities,      public transportation systems and infrastructure      facilities,'' which makes terrorist acts covered by the      Convention a crime. New section 2332f supplements and does      not supplant existing Federal and State laws, and contains      five subsections, which are described below.       Subsection (a) makes it a crime to unlawfully place or      detonate an explosive in certain public places and facilities      with the intent to cause death or serious bodily injury, or      with the intent to cause extensive destruction, where such      destruction results in, or is likely to result in, major      economic loss. Conspiracies and attempts to commit such      crimes are also criminalized. This provision implements      Article 2, paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of the Convention.       Inclusion of the term ``unlawfully'' in subsection (a),      which is mirrored in Article 2 of the Convention defining the      offenses, is intended to allow what would be considered under      U.S. law as common law defenses. For purposes of subsection      (a), whether a person acts ``unlawfully'' will depend on      whether he is acting within the scope of authority recognized      under and consistent with existing U.S. law, which reflects      international law principles, such as self defense or lawful      use of force by police authorities. This language is not to      be construed as permitting the assertion, as a defense to      prosecution under new section 2332f, that a person      purportedly acted under authority conveyed by any particular      foreign government or official. Such a construction, which      would exempt State-sponsored terrorism, would be clearly at      odds with the purpose of the Convention and this implementing      legislation.       With respect to the mens rea provision of subsection (a),      it is sufficient if the intent is to significantly damage the      targeted public place or facility. Further, for the purpose      of subsection (a), when determining whether the act resulted      in, or was likely to result, major economic loss, the      physical damage to the targeted place or facility may be      considered, as well as other types of economic loss      including, but not limited to, the monetary loss or other      adverse effects resulting from the interruption of its      activities. The adverse effects on non-targeted entities and      individuals, the economy and the government may also be      considered in this determination insofar as they are due to      the destruction caused by the unlawful act.       Subsection (b) establishes the jurisdictional bases for the      covered offenses and includes jurisdiction over perpetrators      of offenses abroad who are subsequently found within the      United States. This provision implements a crucial element of      the Convention (Article 8(1)), which requires all State      Parties to either extradite or prosecute perpetrators of      offenses covered by the Convention who are found within the      jurisdiction of a State Party. While current Federal or     State criminal laws encompass all the activity prohibited by      the Convention that occurs within the United States,      subsection (b)(1) ensures Federal jurisdiction where there is      a unique Federal interest e.g., a foreign government is the      victim of the crime or the offense is committed in an attempt      to compel the United States to do or abstain from doing any      act.       Subsection (c) establishes the penalties for committing the      covered crimes at any term of years or life. This provision      differs from the Administration proposal, which sought to add      a new death penalty provision for this crime, despite the      fact that such a provision is not required for compliance      under the Convention and may create hurdles in seeking      extradition to the United States under this statute.       Subsection (d) sets forth certain exemptions to      jurisdiction as provided by the Convention. Specifically, the      subsection exempts from jurisdiction activities of armed      forces during an armed conflict and activities undertaken by      military forces of a State in the exercise of their official      duties.       Subsection (e) contains definitions of twelve terms that      are used in the new law. Six of those definitions (``State or      government facility,'' ``infrastructure facility,'' ``place      of public use,'' ``public transportation system,'' ``other      lethal device,'' and ``military forces of a State'') are the      same definitions used in the Convention. Four additional      definitions (``serious bodily injury,'' ``explosive,''      ``national of the United States,'' and ``intergovernmental      organization'') are definitions that already exist in other      U.S. statutes. One of those definitions (``armed conflict'')      is defined consistent with an international instrument      relating to the law of war, and a U.S. Understanding to the      Convention that is recommended to be made at the time of U.S.      ratification. The final term (``State'') has the same meaning      as that term has under international law.                      Section 103. Effective Date       Since the purpose of Title I is to implement the      Convention, section 103 provides that the new criminal      offense created in Section 102 will not become effective      until the date that the Convention enters into force in the      United States. This will ensure immediate compliance of the      United States with its obligations under the Convention.          Title II. Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism       Title II implements the International Convention for the      Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, which was signed      by the United States on January 10, 2000, and was transmitted      to the Senate for its advice and consent to ratification on      October 12, 2000. The Convention is not yet in force      internationally, but will enter into force 30 days after the      deposit of the 22nd instrument of ratification with the U.N.      Secretary-General. Once in force, the Convention requires      State Parties to combat terrorism by criminalizing certain      financial transactions made in furtherance of various      terrorist activities. The Convention also requires that State      Parties criminalize conspiracies and attempts to undertake      such financing.                        Section 201. Short title       Section 201 provides that title II may be cited as ``The      Suppression of Financing of Terrorism Convention      Implementation Act of 2001.''                Section 202. Terrorism Financing Statute       Section 202(a) adds a new section to the Federal criminal      code, to be codified at 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2339C and entitled      ``Prohibitions against the financing of terrorism,'' which      makes financial acts covered by the Convention a crime. New      section 2339C supplements and does not supplant existing      Federal and State laws, and contains five subsections, which      are described below.       Subsection (a) makes it a crime to provide or collect funds      with the intention or knowledge that such funds are to be      used to carry out certain terrorist acts. Conspiracies and      attempts to commit these crimes are also criminalized. This      subsection implements Article 2, paragraphs 1, 3, 4 and 5 of      the Convention.       Subsection (b) establishes the jurisdictional bases for the      covered offenses under section 2339C(a) and includes      jurisdiction over perpetrators of offenses abroad who are      subsequently found within the United States. This provision      implements a crucial element of the Convention (Article 10),      which requires all State Parties to either extradite or      prosecute perpetrators of offenses covered by the Convention      who are found within the territory of a State Party. The      structure of this provision is designed to accommodate the      structure of the Convention, which sets forth both mandatory      and permissive bases of jurisdiction, and excludes certain      offenses that lack an international nexus. Some portions of      this provision go beyond the jurisdictional bases required or      expressly permitted under the Convention, however, where      expanded jurisdiction is desirable from a policy perspective      because a unique Federal interest is implicated and is      consistent with the Constitution.       Subsection (c) established the penalties for committing the      covered crimes at imprisonment for not more than 20 years, a      fine under title 18, United States Code, or both. This      penalty is consistent with the current penalties for money      laundering offenses. See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1956.       Subsection (d) contains 13 definitions of terms that are      used in the new law. Two of those definitions (``government      facility,'' and ``proceeds'') are the same definitions used      in the Convention. The definition for ``funds'' is identical      to that contained in the Convention with the exception that      coins and currency are expressly mentioned as money. The      definitions for ``provides'' and ``collects'' reflect the      broad scope of the Convention. The definition for ``predicate      acts'' specifies the activity for which the funds were being      provided or collected. These are the acts referred to in      subparagraphs (A) and (B) of section 2339C(a)(1). The      definition of ``treaty'' sets forth the nine international      conventions dealing with counter-terrorism found in the Annex      to the Convention. The term ``intergovernmental      organization,'' which is used in the Convention, is      specifically defined to make clear that it contains within      its ambit existing international organizations. The      definitions for ``international organization,'' ``serious      bodily injury.'' and ``national of the United States''      incorporate definitions for those terms that already exist in      other U.S. statues. One of the definitions (``armed      conflict'') is defined consistent with international      instruments relating to the law of war. The final term      (``State'') has the same meaning as that term has under      international law.       Subsection (e) creates a civil penalty of at least $10,000      payable to the United States, against any legal entity in the      United States, if any person responsible for the management      or control of that legal entity has, in that capacity,      committed an offense set forth in subsection (a) of the new      section 2339C. This civil penalty may be imposed regardless      of whether there is a conviction of such person under      subsection (a), and is in addition to any other criminal,      civil, or administrative liability or penalty allowable under      United States law. Subsection (e) fulfills Article 5 of the      Convention.                      Section 203. Effective Date       Section 203 provides that those provisions of the Act that      may be implemented immediately shall become effective upon      enactment. However, two jurisdictional provisions will not      become effective until the Financing Convention enters into      force for the United States. Those provisions are the new 18      U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 2339C(b)(1)(D) and (2)(B). In addition, new      18 U.S.C. Sec. 2339C(d)(7)(1), which is a definitional      section specifically linked to the Bombing Convention, will      not become effective until that Convention enters into      effect.                     TITLE III. Ancillary Measures       Title III, which is not required by the International      Conventions but will assist in federal enforcement, adds the      new 18 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 2332f and 2339C to several existing      provisions of law.                    Section 301. Ancillary Measures       Sections 2332f and 2339C are made predicates under the      wiretap statute (18 U.S.C. Sec. 2516(1)(q)) and under the      statute relating to the provision of material support to      terrorists (18 U.S.C. Sec. 2339A). Sections 2332f and 2339C      are also added to those offenses defined as a ``Federal crime      of terrorism'' under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2332b(g)(5)(B), as      amended by the USA PATRIOT Act. P.L. No. 107-56. In addition,      a provision is added to the civil asset forfeiture statute      that makes this tool available in the case of a violation of      18 U.S.C. Sec. 2339C. These provisions are consistent with      the treatment of similar Federal crimes already in existence.           TITLE IV. Foreign Disclosure of Wiretap Intercepts       This provision, which is not required by the International      Conventions, clarifies that Federal law enforcement      authorities may disclose otherwise confidential wiretap      information to their foreign counterparts with appropriate      judicial approval. This provision is intended to ensure      effective cooperation between domestic and foreign law      enforcement in the investigation and prosecution of      international criminal organizations.                        Section 401. Short Title       Section 401 provides that title IV may be cited as ``The      Foreign Law Enforcement Cooperation Act of 2001.''               Section 402. Amendment to Wiretap Statute       Section 402 adds a new subsection to 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2517      that governs the disclosure of otherwise confidential      information gathered pursuant to a Title III wiretap. This      provision clarifies the authority of domestic law enforcement      officers to disclose such information as may show a violation      of either domestic or foreign criminal law to foreign law      enforcement officials. The provision requires a court order      prior to making such a disclosure and sets the standards for      the issuance of such an order. It is intended to allow      foreign disclosure only to enforce the criminal laws of      either the United States or the foreign nation. It also      requires that an attorney for the government certify that the      foreign officials who are to receive the wiretap information      have been informed of the Attorney General's guidelines      protecting confidentiality. This provision is intended to      enhance the ability of domestic law enforcement to work with      their foreign counterparts to investigate international      criminal activity at the same time as protecting against      improper use of such wiretap information.                                 ______                                       By
