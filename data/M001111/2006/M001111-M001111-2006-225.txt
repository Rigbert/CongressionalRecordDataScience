 President, as I stated earlier on the floor, all of our colleagues need to understand that we have worked very hard to put together a balanced bill under the direction of the chairman and the ranking member on this side, Senator Byrd. This amendment will essentially cut Border Patrol agents, transportation security, Coast Guard operations, Secret Service, Office of Domestic Preparedness, FEMA disaster relief, and FEMA operations.  I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment in order to keep a balanced bill.
