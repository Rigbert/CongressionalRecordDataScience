President, there are some things, however, that are getting through. The Senate, in one of its final votes before adjourning for Christmas, passed legislation aimed at more than doubling the assistance that my State and others will have in hand to help victims of domestic crime and terrorism.  I mention this, Mr. President, because I think of the years I spent as a prosecutor and I remember so many times we spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to prosecute a perpetrator, especially of a violent crime, both in the prosecution and in the incarceration, but the victim was usually the forgotten person. The victim got no assistance, the victim got no help, the victim was left to fend for himself or herself.  What we have done now is raise to half a million dollars in a special victims fund for Vermont, under the Victims of Crime Act and under an amendment that I propose, that will help these people. I think this makes a great deal of sense because the money comes not from the taxpayers, the money comes from the criminals. The assessments and the fines to the criminal will go into this fund.  Again, as a former prosecutor, I believe we should bring strong and effective prosecution as quickly as possible in these serious crimes. We have seen what happened in places like Oklahoma City. Let us not forget the victims. When we are setting out the punishment for the perpetrator of the crime, when we add fines and assessments, the money which can go to help victims all the better. In my experience, the victim is usually the person forgotten. All attention is on the criminal. This way, we will keep the attention on those convicted of violent crimes, but we will make them pay into a fund to help the victims.  I think it is much better. I think victims must be treated with dignity and assisted and compensated for their suffering. Who better to pay for the restitution than the perpetrators of those crimes themselves? I thank the Members of the Senate who have joined with that.                          ____________________
