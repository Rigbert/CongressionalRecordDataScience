President, when the distinguished Senator from Illinois first talked about this amendment, I was telling him I thought he had a winner on his hands. I could not imagine anybody opposing it. I was delighted to see the distinguished senior Senator from Utah has also adopted the same idea of the Senator from Illinois. I think it is an excellent piece of legislation.  I suspect it will pass unanimously. I realize that is one of the reasons why it is brought up as a bed-check vote at 8 o'clock at night tonight, because everyone knows the Senator from Illinois has a good idea and the Senator from Utah has a good idea. Those are the kind that we use for bed-check votes.  I should tell the American people, though, notwithstanding that, it is a very valuable piece of legislation and I am delighted to see it and I am going to be very happy to vote for it.
