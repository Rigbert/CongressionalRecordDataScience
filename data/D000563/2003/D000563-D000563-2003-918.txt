 There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         Department of Justice, Office of Legislative and            Intergovernmental Affairs,                                  Washington, DC, August 24, 1987.     Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee,     Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Biden: This responds further to your August      10th letter requesting certain documents relating to the      nomination of Judge Robert Bork to the Supreme Court.      Specifically, this sets forth the status of our search for      responsive documents and the method and scope of review by      the Committee.       As we have previously informed you in our letter of August      18, the search for requested documents has required massive      expenditures of resources and time by the Executive Branch.      We have nonetheless, with a few exceptions discussed below,      completed a thorough review of all sources referenced in your      request that were in any way reasonably likely to produce      potentially responsive documents. The results of this effort      are as follows:       In response to your requests numbered 1-3, we have      conducted an extensive search for documents generated during      the period 1972-1974 and relating to the so-called Watergate      affair. We have followed the same procedure, in response to      request number 4, for all documents relating to consideration      of Robert Bork for the Supreme Court by President Nixon or      his subordinates. We have completed our search and relevant      Department of Justice and White House files for documents      responsive to these requests. The Federal Bureau of      Investigation also has completed its search for responsive      documents, focusing on the period October-December 1973 and      on references to Robert Bork generally.       Most of the documents responsive to requests numbered 1-4      are in the possession of the National Archives and Records      Administration, which has custody of the Nixon Presidential      materials and the files of the Watergate Special Prosecution      Force. The Archives staff supervised and participated in the      search of the opened files of the Nixon Presidential      materials and the files of the Watergate Special Prosecution      Force, which was directed to those files which the Archives      staff deemed reasonably likely to contain potentially      responsive documents.       Pursuant to a request by this Department under 36 C.F.R.      1275, the Archives staff also examined relevant unopened      files of the Nixon Presidential materials, and, as required      under the pertinent regulations, submitted the responsive      documents thus located for review by counsel for former      President Nixon. Mr. Nixon's counsel, R. Stan Mortenson,      interposed no objection to release of those submitted      documents that (a) reference, directly or indirectly, Robert      Bork, or (b) were received by or disseminated to persons      outside the Nixon White House. Mr. Mortenson on behalf of Mr.      Nixon objected to production of the documents which are      described in the attached appendix. Mr. Mortenson represents      that these documents constitute purely internal      communications within the White House and contain no direct      or indirect reference to Robert Bork.       Mr. Mortenson also objected on the same grounds to      production of unopened portions of two documents produced in      incomplete form from the opened files of the Nixon      Presidential materials:       1. First page and redacted portion of fifth page of      handwritten note of John D. Ehrlichman dated December 11,      1972.       2. All pages other than the first page of memorandum from      Geoff Shepard to Ken Cole dated June 19, 1973.       Mr. James J. Hastings, Acting Director of the Nixon      Presidential Materials Project, has reviewed these two      documents and has advised us that the unopened portions of      neither document contain any direct or indirect reference to      Judge Bork.       Our search has not yielded a copy of the document      referenced in paragraph ``a'' of your request numbered 3,      which, as you correctly note, is printed at pages 287-288 of      the Judiciary Committee's 1973 ``Special Prosecutor''      hearings.       Among the documents collected by the Department are certain      documents generated in the defense of Halperin. v. Kissinger,      Civil Action No. 73-1187 (D. D.C.), a suit filed against      several federal officials in their individual capacity, which      remains pending. The Department has an ongoing attorney-     client relationship with the defendants in Halperin, which      precludes us from releasing certain documents containing      client confidences and litigation strategy, without their      consent. 28 C.F.R. 50.156(a)(3).       All documents responsive to request number 5, concerning      the pocket veto, have been assembled.       All documents responsive to request number 6 have been      assembled. The exhibits filed by counsel for Edward S. Miller      on July 12, 1978 and referred to in your August 10 letter,      remain under seal by order of the United States District      Court for the District of Columbia. However, a list of the      thirteen documents has been unsealed. We have supplied      copies of eleven of these documents, including redacted      versions of two of the documents (a few sentences of      classified material have been deleted). We have supplied      unclassified versions of two of these eleven documents, as      small portions of them remain classified. We are precluded      by Rule 6(e) of the Rules of Criminal Procedure from      giving you access to two other exhibits--classified      excerpts of grand jury transcripts--filed on July 12,      1978. We also searched the files of several civil cases      related to the Felt and Miller criminal prosecution, as      well as the documents generated during the consideration      of the pardon for Felt and Miller.       With respect to request number 7, Judge Bork has previously      provided to the Committee a number of his speeches, which we      have not sought to duplicate. We have sought and supplied any      additional speeches, press conferences or interviews by Mr.      Bork, as well as any contemporaneous documents which tend to      identify a date or event where he gave a speech or press      interview during his tenure at the Department.       On request number 8, there are no documents in which      President Reagan has set forth the criteria he used to select      Supreme Court nominees, or their application to Judge Bork,      other than the public pronouncements and speeches we have      assembled.       Our search for documents responsive to request number 9 has      been time-consuming and very difficult, and is not at this      time entirely complete. In order to conduct as broad a search      as possible, we requested the files in every case handled by      the Civil Rights Division or Civil Division, between 1969-77,      which concerned desegregation of public education. Although      most of these case files have been retrieved, several remain      unaccounted for and perhaps have been lost. We expect to have      accounted for the remaining files (which may or may not      contain responsive documents) in the next few days. We have      also assembled some responsive documents obtained from other      Department files. The Department of Education is nearing      completion of its search of its files, and those of its      predecessor agency, HEW.       We have assembled case files for the cases referred to in      question 10, with the exception of Hill v. Stone, for which      there is no file. We have no record of the participation of      the United States in Hill v. Stone, or consideration by the      Solicitor General's office of whether to participate in that      case.       A few general searches of certain front office files are      still underway, and we expect those searches to be concluded      in the next few days. We will promptly notify you should any      further responsive documents come into our possession.       As you know, the vast majority of the documents you have      requested reflect or disclose purely internal deliberations      within the Executive Branch, the work product of attorneys in      connection with government litigation or confidential legal      advice received from or provided to client agencies within      the Executive Branch. The disclosure of such sensitive and      confidential documents seriously impairs the deliberative      process within the Executive Branch, our ability to represent      the government in litigation and our relationship with other      entities. For these reasons, the Justice Department and other      executive agencies have consistently taken the position, in      response to the Freedom of Information Act and other      requests, that it is not at liberty to disclose materials      that would compromise the confidentiality of any such      deliberative or otherwise privileged communications.       On the other hand, we also wish to cooperate to the fullest      extent possible with the Committee and to expedite Judge      Bork's confirmation process. Accordingly, we have decided to      take the exceptional step of providing the Committee with      access to responsive materials we currently possess, except      those privileged documents specifically described above and      in the attached appendix. Of course, our decision to produce      these documents does not constitute a waiver of any future      claims of privilege concerning other documents that the      Committee requests or a waiver of any claim over these      documents with respect to entities or persons other than the      Judiciary Committee.       As I have previously discussed with Diana Huffman, the      other documents will be made available in a room at the      Justice Department. Particularly in light of the voluminous      and privileged nature of these documents, copies of      identified documents will be produced, upon request, only to      members of the Judiciary Committee and their staff and only      on the understanding that they will not be shown or disclosed      to any other persons. Please have your staff contact me to      arrange a mutually convenient time for inspection of the      documents.       As I stressed in my previous letter, if the Committee is or      becomes aware of any documents it believes are potentially      responsive but have not been produced, please alert us as      soon as possible and we will attempt to locate them.       Should you have any questions or comments, please contact      me as soon as possible. Thank you for your cooperation.           Sincerely,                                                  Laura Nelson                                              (For John R.

Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Biden: This letter requests that the      Committee return to the Justice Department all copies of      documents produced by the Department in response to Committee      requests for records relating to the nomination of Robert      Bork to the Supreme Court. As Assistant Attorney General John      Bolton noted in an August 24, 1987, letter to you, many of      the documents provided the Committee, ``reflect or disclose      purely internal deliberations within the Executive Branch,      the work product of attorneys in connection with government      litigation or confidential legal advice received from or      provided to client agencies within the Executive Branch.'' We      provided these privileged documents to the Committee in order      to respond fully to the Committee's request and to expedite      the confirmation process.       Although the Committee's need for these documents has      ceased, their privileged nature remains. As we emphasized in      our August 24, 1987, letter, production of these documents to      the Committee did not constitute a general waiver of claims      of privilege. We therefore request that the Committee return      all copies of all documents provided by the Department to the      Committee, except documents that are clearly a matter of      public record (e.g., briefs and judicial opinions) or that      were specifically made a part of the record of the hearings.       Please contact me if you have any questions. Thank you for      your cooperation.           Sincerely,                                                   Thomas M. Boyd,                                Acting Assistant Attorney General.
