 President, I would like to discuss the Kennedy amendment, which passed the Senate earlier today by unanimous consent. This amendment would require that the Director of National Intelligence submit to Congress a new National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq's security situation. At the outset, I would note that Senators Roberts and Stevens should both be applauded for their efforts to improve the original Kennedy amendment.  That said, I would like to make clear my understanding of the Kennedy amendment, as modified. I believe that the Kennedy amendment, if enacted, should be interpreted to mean that the intelligence community should undertake an objective analysis of the situation in Iraq. The original Kennedy amendment included questions that appeared to drive toward predetermined answers, thus potentially distorting the intelligence value of the report. I believe the administration should take notice of the changes that were made to the original Kennedy amendment language and recognize that these changes, which moved the amendment toward requesting information in a more objective manner, were the reason the amendment was able to pass by unanimous consent.  I share the majority leader's concern that those in the intelligence community should take the time they need to conduct a dispassionate analysis of the Iraq situation and not be swayed by the political context within which this amendment was initially offered.
