President, on May 2-4, 1998, more than 1,200 students from across the nation were in Washington, D.C. to compete in the national finals of the We the People . . . The Citizen and the Constitution program. I am proud to announce that a class from Old Orchard Beach High School represented the State of Maine. These outstanding young scholars worked diligently to reach the national finals by winning local competitions in Maine.  The distinguished members of the class representing Maine are: Lauren Asperschlager, Lucy Coulthard, Chad Daley, Rose Gordon, Krista Knowles, Nathan LaChance, Sarah Lunn, Sandra Marshall, Katie McPherson, Cindy St. Onge, Sam Tarbox, and Sharon Wilson. I also want to recognize their teacher, Michael Angelosante, who deserves much of the credit for the success of the class. The district coordinator, John Drisko, and the state coordinator, Pam Beal, also contributed a significant amount of time and effort to help the class reach the national finals.  The We the People . . . The Citizen and the Constitution program is the most extensive educational program in the country developed specifically to educate young people about the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. The three-day national competition simulates a congressional hearing whereby the students are given the opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge while they evaluate, take, and defend positions on relevant historical and contemporary constitutional issues. The simulated congressional hearing consists of oral presentations by the students before panels of adult judges.  Administered by the Center for Civic Education, The We the People . . . program has provided curricular materials at upper elementary, middle, and high school levels for more than 75,000 teachers and 24 million students nationwide. Members of Congress and their staffs enhance the program by discussing current constitutional issues with students and teachers.  The We the People . . . program is designed to help students achieve a reasoned commitment to the fundamental values and principles that bind Americans together as a people. The program also fosters civic involvement as well as character traits conducive to effective and responsible participation in politics and government.  I commend these student constitutional experts from Maine and throughout the nation who have participated in the We the People . . . national finals for their achievement in reaching this level of the competition.                          ____________________
