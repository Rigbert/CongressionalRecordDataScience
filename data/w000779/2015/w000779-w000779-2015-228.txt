President, I rise in opposition to the Lee amendment.  Colleagues, the Lee amendment is the bluntest possible instrument that would cut spending across government on every possible program. The SGR, the doctors reimbursement formula, has always been a fake. The $140 billion in this bill eliminates the budget fakery that Democrats and Republicans believe has gotten out of hand. The underlying bill gets rid of the budget fakery.  I urge colleagues on both sides of the aisle to reject the amendment, and I yield back.
