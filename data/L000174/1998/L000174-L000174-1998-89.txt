President, as the Senate considers possible amendments to the Vacancies Act, we have occasion to focus on the Senate's advice and consent role for all presidential nominations and the American people have an opportunity to review how well, or how badly, this Senate has fulfilled that constitutionally-mandated role.  It is important to explore ways to help the Executive Branch improve the process by which the President nominates, the Senate confirms and then the President appoints people to serve in important positions within the executive and judicial branches of our federal government. Indeed, I have often joined with Senator Byrd to defend the authority of the Senate on this issue and to protect the Senate's role against the executive encroachments by way of excessive use of the recess appointment power.  I recall when the Reagan and Bush administrations were abusing the power of recess appointment and note, by contrast, how sparingly President Clinton has used that constitutional authority. I am advised that while President Reagan made 239 recess appointments in 8 years and President Bush made 78 recess appointments in 4 years, President Clinton has used his recess appointment power only 45 times over the last 5 years.  I also recall how President Clinton acted with great restraint last year when he and the Attorney General joined to appoint Bill Lann Lee the Acting Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights rather than using his power to make that a recess appointment.  Let us focus on the nomination of Bill Lann Lee. He was initially nominated to head the Civil Rights Division in July 1997. At the end of 1997, that nomination got caught up in one of the narrow, partisan-driven whirlwinds that hit Washington every now and then. The result was that the nomination became a victim of the anti-affirmative action lobby and was denied a vote by the full Senate. Bill Lee was mischaracterized last fall as a wild-eyed radical and as someone ready to impose an extreme agenda on the United States. He was misportrayed as a supporter of quotas. The Republican majority demonized this fine man and killed his nomination by denying him a Senate vote.  After looking at Bill Lee's record, I knew he was a man who could effectively lead the Civil Rights Division, enforce the law and resolve disputes. I reviewed his record of achievement and saw a practical, problem solver and noted last year that no one who has taken the time to review his record could call him an idealogue. I recognized that Bill Lee would be reasonable and practical in his approach to the job, and that he would be a top-notch enforcer of the Nation's civil rights laws.  Bill Lann Lee has been serving for almost 10 months now as the Acting Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, and he has established a solid track record. He is doing an outstanding job for all Americans. I have had a chance to take a close look at what he has been doing while serving as the acting head of the Civil Rights Division. What I find is a record of strong accomplishments. I see professionalism and effective problem solving. I find him enforcing the law in a sensible and fair manner.  Accordingly, I urge the Senate finally to consider the nomination of Bill Lann Lee and to confirm him to this important post. The President renominated Bill Lann Lee to be Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Civil Rights Division on January 29 of this year. Given his outstanding performance over the past 10 months, I urge the Senate to show him the fairness of a vote on his nomination. I am confident that when Senators consider his nomination and review his record, a majority of the United States Senate will vote to confirm this outstanding nominee.  It is to raise this matter to the attention of the American people and for action by the Senate, that I have filed an amendment to the Vacancies Reform Act bill to provide for a vote on the longstanding nomination of Bill Lann Lee before the Senate ends this year's session.  As we consider how to improve the Vacancies Act, the Senate would do well to consider its lack of action on the many outstanding nominations that the President has sent to us over the past several years on which the Senate has taken no vote. In addition to unprecedented delays in the consideration of judicial nominations--46 judicial nominations are pending and 22 are on the Senate calendar--there have been a number of executive branch nominations who have been denied consideration and a vote for many, many months.  Bill Lann Lee is an example. He was first nominated for the important position of Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights on July 21, 1997, over 14 months ago. When no Senate vote was taken on his nomination last year, he was renominated on January 29, 1998. For the past 8 months his nomination has, again, been bottled up in committee.  This is an historic nomination. Bill Lann Lee is the first Asian-American to head the Civil Rights Division. He deserves to be confirmed by the Senate and to be accorded the full measure of recognition for all that he has achieved and all that he is doing on behalf of all Americans.  The Senate was denied the opportunity to vote on that nomination before adjournment in 1997. With one notable and courageous exception, the Republican majority of the Judiciary Committee would not report the nomination to the Senate so that the Senate could vote whether to confirm this outstanding nominee. Although the Republicans have a majority in the Senate, they have been unable to pass legislative proposals to undermine the nation's commitment to equal opportunity and civil rights. As a result, the Republican majority decided to stall the Lee nomination without a vote as a trophy to its extremist factions. This nomination could not be defeated in a fair up or down vote, so they determined to avoid that Senate vote altogether and at all costs.  I understand that Senator Durbin, a thoughtful member of both the Senate Government Affairs Committee, from which this bill emerged, and the Senate Judiciary Committee, which refused to report the Lee nomination to the Senate for action, has filed a series of amendments to the Vacancies Reform Act to begin to deal with this aspect of the problem--Senate inaction on nominations. I will study those proposals with great interest.  I was disappointed this year that the Senate Judiciary Committee repeatedly postponed and eventually canceled hearings regarding the performance of the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department under the leadership of Bill Lann Lee. I was disappointed because such a hearing would have offered us a chance to look at the outstanding on-the-job performance of ourActing Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights.  Over the past 10 months, the Division has focused most intensely on three areas of the law: violations of our Nation's fair housing laws, enforcement of the Americans with Disabilities Act (``ADA''), and cases involving hate crimes. Bill Lee and his team of civil rights attorneys have made advances in each of these areas of the law.  The Division has resolved a number of housing discrimination cases over the past few months, including the following: An agreement was reached with two large New Jersey apartment complexes resolving allegations that the defendants had discriminated against potential renters based on family status and race.  A housing discrimination case in Michigan was settled involving an apartment manager who told black applicants that no apartments were available at the same time that he was showing vacant apartments to white applicants. An agreement was also reached with the second largest real estate company in Alabama, which had been steering applicants to agents and residential areas based on race.  The Civil Rights Division has also focused on educating the public about the ADA and enforcing it where necessary. These cases have included: resolution of a case in Hawaii to allow those who are vision impaired to travel to the State without having to quarantine their guide dogs for four months in advance of arrival;  a consent decree with the National Collegiate Athletic Association so that high school athletes with learning disabilities have the opportunity to compete for scholarships and participate in college athletics; an agreement with private hospitals in Connecticut to ensure patients who are deaf have access to sign-language interpreters; and assistance to the State of Florida to update their building code to bring it into compliance with the ADA. Florida joins Maine, Texas and Washington State in having a certified building code thereby ensuring better compliance with the ADA by architects, builders and contractors within the State.  The Civil Rights Division has also resolved several hate crimes cases over the past 7 months, including:       In Idaho, six men pleaded guilty to engaging in a series of      racially motivated attacks on Mexican American men, women and      children, some as young as 9; in Arizona, three members of a      skinhead group pleaded guilty to burning a cross in the front      yard of an African American woman; and in Texas, a man      pleaded guilty to entering a Jewish temple and firing several      gun shots while shouting anti-Semitic slurs.  The Division has also been vigorously enforcing its criminal statutes, including: indictments against three people in Arkansas charged with church burning; guilty pleas by 16 Puerto Rico correctional officers who beat 22 inmates and then tried to cover it up; cases arising from Mexican women and girls, some as young as 14, being lured to the U.S. and then being forced into prostitution; and guilty pleas from 18 defendants who forced 60 deaf Mexican nationals to sell trinkets on the streets of New York. Out of concerns about slavery continuing in the U.S., Bill Lann Lee has created a Worker Exploitation Task Force to coordinate enforcement efforts with the Department of Labor. I commend the Acting Assistant Attorney General for putting the spotlight on these shameful crimes.  Other significant cases which the Civil Rights Division has handled in the past few months include the following: several long-standing school desegregation cases were settled or their consent decrees were terminated, including cases in Kansas City, Kansas; San Juan County, Utah; and Indianapolis, Indiana. Japanese-Latin Americans who were deported and interned in the United States during World War II finally received compensation this year. Lawsuits in Ohio and Washington, D.C. were settled to allow women access to women's health clinics.  The record establishes that Bill Lann Lee has been running the Division the way it should be run. Here in Washington, where we have lots of show horses, Bill Lee is a work horse--a dedicated public official who is working hard to help solve our Nation's problems. I commend him and the many hardworking professionals at the Civil Rights Division.  Bill Lee has served as acting head of the Civil Rights Division for 10 months now. Given the claims made by many in the Senate last fall that Mr. Lee would lead the Division astray, you might expect that he would be in the headlines every day associated with some extreme decision. Instead, we have seen the strong and steady work of the Division--solid achievements and effective law enforcement.  A few weeks ago, I received a letter from Governor Zell Miller of Georgia that is emblematic of the record that Bill Lee has established. Governor Miller discusses Bill Lee's efficient and effective ability to settle an action which involved Georgia's juvenile detention facilities. He notes that he was not exactly a fan of the Civil Rights Division before Bill Lee came along and writes that he ``was fearful that Georgia would be unable to get a fair forum in which to present our position, and that we would once again be compelled to engage in protracted and expensive litigation.'' Governor Miller writes that his fears were unfounded, that the parties engaged in ``intensive and expeditious negotiations'' and reached a fair agreement. Governor Miller also notes:       I have indicated to Mr. Lee both personally and publicly      that he and his staff treated Georgia with professionalism,      fairness, and respect during our negotiations. Under the      direction of Bill Lann Lee, what began as a potentially      divisive and litigious process was transformed into an      atmosphere where the State was able to have its case heard      fairly, resulting in a reasonable agreement benefiting all      parties. This is the way in which the Civil Rights Division      should operate in its dealings with the states, and I am      pleased to commend Mr. Lee and his staff for their efforts in      this matter.  The Acting Assistant Attorney General continues to build on his reputation as a professional and effective negotiator, who routinely earns praise from opposing parties. I had high expectations for Bill Lann Lee when he was nominated and I have not been disappointed. He is doing a terrific job. It is time for the Senate to end his second-class status and confirm him.  We need Bill Lee's proven problem-solving abilities in these difficult times. It is wrong for the Senate to ignore his nomination any longer and a shameful slight to him, to his family and to all who care about fairness and equal rights.  I remember vividly when Mr. Lee appeared at his confirmation hearing almost one year ago. He testified candidly about his views, his work and his values. He understood that as the Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division his client is the United States and all of its people. He told us poignantly about why he became a person who has dedicated his life to equal justice for all when he spoke of the treatment that his parents received as immigrants.  Mr. Lee told us how in spite of his father's personal treatment and experiences, William Lee remained a fierce American patriot, volunteered to serve in the United States Army Air Corps in World War II and never lost his belief in America. He inspired his son and Bill now inspires his own children and countless others across the land. Mr. Lee noted:       My father is my hero, but I confess that I found it      difficult for many years to appreciate his unflinching      patriotism in the face of daily indignities. In my youth, I      did not understand how he could remain so deeply grateful to      a country where he and my mother faced so much intolerance.      But I began to appreciate that the vision he had of being an      American was a vision so compelling that he could set aside      the momentary ugliness. He knew that the basic American tenet      of equality of opportunity is the bedrock of our society.  Bill Lann Lee has remained true to all that his father and mother taught him. I continue to work to end the ugliness of Senate inaction on his nomination. If opponents want to distort his achievements and mischaracterize his beliefs, let them at least have the decency to engage in that debate on the floor of the Senate so that this longstanding nomination can be acted upon--either vote it up or vote it down, but vote on it. His career of good works and current efforts should not be rewarded with continued ugliness. Such treatment drives good people from public service and distorts the role of the Senate. I have often referred to the Senate as acting at its best when it serves as the conscience of the nation. In this case, I am afraid that the Senate has shown no conscience.  Bill Lann Lee is a man of integrity, of honesty and of fairness. Born in Harlem, to Chinese immigrant parents, he has lived the American dream and stayed faithful to American values. He has done nothing to justify the unfair treatment by the Senate.  As a child he worked in his parents' laundry after school. He went on to graduate magna cum laude from Yale College and to obtain a law degree from Columbia University. Bill Lann Lee has spent his life helping others--helping them to keep their jobs, to keep their homes, to have a chance at a well-earned promotion and to raise healthy children.  As western regional counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, a public interest law firm founded by Thurgood Marshall in 1939, Mr. Lee litigated hundreds of cases ranging from employment discrimination claims to efforts to ensure probation offices are widely dispersed throughout Los Angeles to ensuring that poor children are tested for lead poisoning. His extensive experience and renowned skill at settling cases has served him well as Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division.  Most impressive is the array of former opposing counsels and parties who support Mr. Lee's nomination. In addition to Governor Miller, consider the words of Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan: Our ``negotiations could not have concluded successfully without Mr. Lee's practical leadership and expertise.'' I believe Mayor Riordan's enthusiastic support and assurance that Mr. Lee has ``practiced mainstream civil rights law'' should carry some weight.  Mr. Lee is a top quality candidate. He has all the essential qualities for this job--a legal career devoted to top-notch civil rights work, an outstanding degree of integrity and a commitment to practical solutions. This year he also has a proven track record as the Acting Assistant Attorney General.  No one can argue that the President has sent to us a person not qualified by experience to lead the Civil Rights Division. Bill Lee's record of achievement is exemplary. He is a man of integrity and honor and when he said to this Committee that quotas are illegal and wrong and that he would enforce the law, no one should have any doubt about his resolve to do what is right. The Senate should vote on this outstanding nominee. He is the right person to lead the Civil Rights Division into the next century. We need his proven problem-solving abilities in these difficult times.  Unfortunately, last year's consideration of this outstanding nominee took a decidedly partisan turn when the Speaker of the House chose to intervene in this matter and urge the Senate Republican Leader to kill this nomination. In his unfortunate letter, Speaker Gingrich unfairly criticized Mr. Lee and accused him of unethical conduct. The allegations of wrongdoing carelessly lodged against Mr. Lee are contradicted by the Republican Mayor of Los Angeles, Richard Riordan, as well as the Vice-President of the Los Angeles Police Commission, T. Warren Jackson, the Assistant City Attorney, Robert Cramer, and the City Attorney, James K. Hahn, but the damage had been done.  I recall when times were different. I recall when charges were raised against Clarence Thomas and the Judiciary Committee held several days of additional hearings after that nomination had already been reported by the Judiciary Committee to the full Senate. There was a tie vote in Committee on the Thomas nomination, which would not have even been reported to the Senate had we not also voted virtually unanimously, with six Democrats joining seven Republicans, to report the Thomas nomination to the floor without recommendation. Of course, ultimately the nomination of Judge Thomas to become Justice Thomas was confirmed by the Senate.  It remains my hope that the Senate will now give Bill Lann Lee the same fairness that we showed Clarence Thomas and allow his nomination to be voted upon by the United States Senate. It would be ironic if, after the Senate proceeded to debate and vote on the Thomas nomination--one that included charges that he engaged in sexual harassment--the Republican leadership prevented the Senate from considering a nominee because he has worked to remedy sexual harassment and gender discrimination.  After consultation with Senators, the President acted after Congress's adjournment last fall to name Bill Lann Lee the Acting Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. The President then followed through on his commitments and renominated this distinguished civil rights attorney and public servant on January 29, 1998. This Senate is now approaching adjournment, again, and, again, the Senate is not voting whether to confirm or reject this nomination. The President has fulfilled his end of the bargain and acted with restraint and respect in this regard. The Senate has done nothing with respect to this nomination but ignore it. So, when we criticize this President for not sending up nominees fast enough, let us not forget that the Senate has now had ample opportunity for over two years to act on the nomination of Bill Lann Lee and the Senate has not.  Last year, I was honored to stand on the steps to the Lincoln Memorial, where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. spoke 35 years ago and inspired the nation toward the promise of equality. I heard our colleagues Senator Kennedy and Senator Feinstein speak about the continuing struggle to provide equal opportunity to all Americans. I took inspiration from the wisdom of Rep. John Lewis whose compass is ever true on these matters. We heard Rep. Maxine Waters declare in no uncertain terms the support of the Congressional Black Caucus for Bill Lann Lee, Representative Patsy Mink take pride in reiterating the support of the Congressional Asian Pacific Caucus and Representative Xavier Becerra add the support of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.  I heard Justin Dart, a dedicated public servant who worked with President's Reagan and Bush, declare that people with disabilities support Bill Lann Lee and Representative Bob Matsui recount the dark days before the civil rights laws when his family had to suffer the indignity of internment because of the Japanese ancestry.  Just last week when Congress presented Nelson Mandela with the Congressional Gold Medal, we drew upon the American tradition of Lincoln, King and so many who labored long and sacrificed much in the struggle toward equality for all Americans. We honored that past last week. We could extend it today by taking up and voting upon the nomination of Bill Lann Lee to be Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. I call upon the party of Lincoln to be fair to Lee and vote on this nomination.  Let the Senate debate and vote on the nomination of Bill Lann Lee. If the Senate is allowed to decide, I believe he will be confirmed and will move this country forward to a time when discrimination will subside and affirmative action is no longer needed; a time when each child--girl or boy, black or white, rich or poor, urban or rural, regardless of national or ethnic origin and regardless of sexual orientation or disability--shall have a fair and equal opportunity to live the American dream.                          Judicial Nominations  Mr. President, as we debate how to change federal law to require executive nominations within certain time frames and to preclude responsibilities from been fulfilled when a confirmed nominee is not present, we also need to consider how the Senate fulfills its duties with regard to nominees who have been before us for many months without Senate action. Since July I have been comparing the Senate's pace in confirming much-needed federal judges to Mark McGwire's home run pace. As the regular season ended over the weekend, Mark McGwire's home run total reached 70. Unfortunately, the Senate's judicial confirmation total remains stalled at 39.  As recently as 1994, the last year in which the Senate majority was Democratic, the Senate confirmed 101 judges. It has taken the Republican Senate 3 years to reach the century mark for judicial confirmations--to accomplish what we did in one session.  The Senate went ``0 for August,'' risks going ``0 for September'' and is threatening to go ``0 for the rest of the year.'' Indeed, I have heard some say that the Republican Senate will refuse to confirm any more nominations all year. That would be wrong and wouldcertainly harm the administration of justice and perpetuate the judicial vacancies crisis. Senate action has not even kept up with normal attrition over the past 2 years, let alone made a real difference in filling longstanding judicial vacancies. Both the Second Circuit and the Ninth Circuit have had to cancel hearings due to judicial vacancies. Chief Judge Winter of the Second Circuit has had to declare a circuit emergency and to proceed with only one circuit judge on their 3-judge panels. Recently, he has had to extend that certification of emergency.  Yet in spite of that emergency, the Senate continues to stall the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the Second Circuit. Her nomination has been stalled on the Senate calendar for over six months. Chief Judge Winter's most recent annual report noted that the Circuit now has the greatest backlog it has ever had, due to the multiple vacancies that have plagued that court.  For a time Judge Sotomayor's nomination was being delayed because some feared that she might be considered as a possible replacement for Justice Stevens, should he choose to resign from the Supreme Court. After the Supreme Court term had ended and Justice Stevens had not resigned, the Senate might have been expected to proceed to consider her nomination to the Second Circuit on its merits and confirm her without additional, unnecessary delay. Unfortunately, that has not been the case.  When confirmed she will be only the second woman and second judge of Puerto Rican descent to serve on the Second Circuit. Just as Sammy Sosa is a source of great pride to the Dominican Republic and to Latin players and fans everywhere, Judge Sotomayor is a source of pride to Puerto Rican and other Hispanic supporters and to women everywhere.  Judge Sonia Sotomayor is a qualified nominee who was confirmed to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in 1992 after being nominated by President Bush. She attended Princeton University and Yale Law School. She worked for over 4 years in the New York District Attorney's Office as an Assistant District Attorney and was in private practice with Pavia & Harcourt in New York. She is strongly support by Senators Moynihan and D'Amato.  I note that one of her recent decisions, Bartlett v. New York State Board of Law Examiners, that had been criticized by her opponents, was affirmed in principal part on September 14 by a unanimous panel of the Second Circuit. In an opinion written by Judge Meskill, the Court agreed ``with the district court's ultimate conclusion that Dr. Bartlett, who has fought an uphill battle with a reading disorder throughout her education, is among those for whom Congress provided protection under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act.'' In this, as in her other decisions that opponents seek to criticize, Judge Sotomayor applies the law. That is what judges are supposed to do. This affirmance belies the charge that she is or will be a judicial activist.  Ironically, it was Judge Sotomayor who issued a key decision in 1995 that brought an end to the work stoppage in major league baseball. If only the breaking of the single season home run record could signal the end of the work stoppage in the Senate with respect to her nomination.  Instead of sustained effort by the Senate to close the judicial vacancies gap, we have seen extensive delays continued and unexplained and anonymous ``holds'' become regular order.  I began this year challenging the Senate to maintain the pace it achieved at the end of last year when 27 judges were confirmed in the last nine weeks. Instead, the Senate has confirmed only 39 judicial nominees in 25 weeks in session. Had the Senate merely maintained the pace that it set at the end of last year, the Senate would have confirmed 75 judges--not 39 judges--by now.  We have 22 qualified nominees on the Senate calendar awaiting action. Including those still pending before the Committee, we have a total of 46 judicial nominations awaiting action, some of whom were first received over three years ago.  The Senate continues to tolerate upwards of 75 vacancies in the federal courts with more on the horizon--almost one in 10 judgeships remains unfilled and, from the looks of things, will remain unfilled into the future. The Senate needs to proceed more promptly to consider nominees reported to it and to do a better job fulfilling its constitutional responsibility of advice and consent.  Unfortunately, the record that the Senate is on pace to set this year with respect to judicial nominations is the record for the amount of time it takes to be confirmed once the nomination is received by the Senate. For those few nominees lucky enough to be confirmed as federal judges, the average number of days for the Senate confirmation process has continued to escalate. In 1996, that number rose to a record 183 days on average. Last year, the average number of days from nomination to confirmation rose dramatically yet again. From initial nomination to confirmation, the average time it took for Senate action on the 36 judges confirmed in 1997 broke the 200-day barrier for the first time in our history. It was 212 days.  The time is still growing and the average is still rising, to the detriment of the administration of justice. The average time from nomination to confirmation for judges confirmed this year is 259 days. That is three times as long as it was taking before this partisan slowdown.  I have urged those who have been stalling the consideration of the President's judicial nominations to reconsider and work to fulfil this constitutional responsibility. Those who delay or prevent the filling of these vacancies must understand that they are delaying or preventing the administration of justice. Courts cannot try cases, incarcerate the guilty or resolve civil disputes without judges.  The federal judiciary's workload was at least 60 percent lower than it is today when the Reagan-Bush administrations took office. The federal court's criminal docket alone is up from 28,921 cases in 1980 to 50,363 last year. That is an increase of over 70 percent in the criminal case filings in the federal courts.  During the Reagan and Bush administrations, whether it had a Democratic or Republican majority, the Senate promptly considered and confirmed judges and authorized 167 new judgeships in response to the increasing workload of the federal judiciary. While authorized judgeships have increased in number by 25 percent since 1980, the workload of the federal courts has grown by over 60 percent during the same period. That is why the prolonged vacancies being perpetuated by delays in the confirmation process are creating such strains within the federal courts.  Unlike other periods in which judicial vacancies could be attributed to newly-created judgeships, during the past four years the vacancies crisis has been created by the Senate's failure to move quickly to consider nominees to longstanding vacancies.  In the early and mid-1980's, vacancies were between 25 and 34 at the beginning of each session of Congress. By the fall of 1983, the vacancies for the entire federal judiciary had been reduced to only 16.  With attrition and the 85 new judgeships created in 1984, vacancies reached 123 at the beginning of President Reagan's second term, but those vacancies were reduced to only 33 within two years, by the fall of 1986. A Democratic Senate in 1987 and 1988 reduced the vacancies still further to only 23 at the end of the 100th Congress.  It was not until additional judgeships were created in 1990 that the next significant increase in vacancies occurred and then, again, a Democratic Senate responsibly set about the task of helping fill those vacancies with qualified nominees. Although President Bush was notoriously slow to nominate, the Democratic Senate confirmed 124 nominees in President Bush's last two years in office and cut the vacancies in half.  With respect to the question of vacancies, it is also important to note that in 1997 the Judiciary Conference of the United States requested an additional 53 judgeships be created. The Republican Congress has refused to consider that workload justified request. My bill to meet that request, S. 678, the Federal Judgeship Act of 1997, has received no attention since I introduced it over a year ago. Had those additional judgeships been created, asthey were in 1984 and 1990 under Republican Presidents, current judicial vacancies would number 128 and total almost 14 percent of the federal judiciary.  Last week Senator Graham spoke about authorizing the additional District Court judges recommended by the Judicial Conference and needed around the country. These are the judges who try federal criminal cases and hear complex federal civil litigation. Given the Republican Senate's tenacious refusal to consider and confirm judges for the vacancies that currently exist, it seems unlikely that the Republican majority would be willing to authorize the additional federal judicial resources that are needed around the country. That is a shame. The Senator from Florida is right to try and I join him in his efforts.  No one should take comfort from the number of confirmations achieved so far this year. It is only in comparison to the dismal achievements of the last two years that 39 confirmations could be seen as an improvement. The President has been doing a better job of sending the Senate scores of nominees more promptly. Unfortunately, qualified and capable nominees are still being delayed too long and stalled.  I have pledged to continue to work to end the judicial vacancies crisis and to support efforts to provide the federal judiciary with the resources it needs to handle its growing caseload and serve the American people.  When the Senate is asked to consider amendments to the Vacancies Act, it should also reconsider its own inaction on the many outstanding nominees that the President has sent the Senate and that the Senate is refusing to consider.  Indeed, earlier this year I proposed a bill that requires the Senate to vote on nominations for Court of Appeals vacancies that created an emergency under federal law. The week after Chief Judge Winter of the Second Circuit certified such an emergency last spring, I introduced the Judicial Emergency Responsibility Act, S. 1906. The purpose of this bill is to supplement the law by which Chief Justice Winter certified the judicial emergency, a judicial emergency that still persists in the Second Circuit, and to require the Senate to do its duty and to act on judicial nominations before it recesses for significant stretches of time. The Senate should not be taking vacations when a Circuit Court is suffering from a vacancy emergency.  I introduced the bill just before the Senate adjourned for a 2-week recess and I urged prompt action on the nominations then pending to fill those Second Circuit vacancies. At that time, the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor was among those favorably reported and had been on the Senate Calendar awaiting action for a month. That was five months ago. Still, there has not been any action.  I did not believe that the Senate should be leaving for a two-week recess in April or a four-week recess in August and leaving the Second Circuit with vacancies for which it had qualified nominations pending. I do not believe that the Senate should adjourn this year without voting on the many qualified judicial nominees that have been pending before the Senate for so long without action. I have been urging action on the nominees to the Second Circuit for more than a year. The Senate is failing in its obligations to the people of the Second Circuit, to the people of New York, Connecticut and Vermont. We should call an end to this stall and take action.  I intend to consult with the managers of the bill, but believe that I should offer S. 1906 as an amendment to the pending measure.  What the Senate is proceeding to do to the judicial branch in refusing to vote on nominees and perpetuating judicial vacancies is too reminiscent of the government shutdown only a couple of years ago and the numerous times of late when the Republican congressional leadership has recessed without completing work on emergency supplemental and disaster relief legislation. As we approach the end of the session, the Republican Congress has yet to pass a budget or enact the 13 annual appropriations bills that are our responsibility. Must we wait for the administration of justice to disintegrate further before the Senate will take this crisis seriously and act on the nominees pending before it? I hope not.  I look forward to Senate debate on suggestions to impose responsibility upon itself in its treatment of judicial nominations.
