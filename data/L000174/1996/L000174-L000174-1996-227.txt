President, this amendment is offered on behalf of myself, the distinguished Presiding Officer, the distinguished senior Senator from Oregon [Mr. Hatfield], and the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kerry].  I offer this amendment to the provisions in the bill that I believe gut our asylum law. This is not just my opinion but is the opinion of at editorial boards from newspapers that normally do not agree with each other.  Let me first refer to the editorial in The Washington Times yesterday. It says:       In their rush to pass an anti-terrorism bill, lawmakers      perhaps unwillingly and unnecessarily restricted the present      rights of persons seeking asylum in this country to escape      political or religious persecution in their own countries.      Such persons used to get a hearing before an immigration      judge. Now they can be sent home without a hearing or      judicial review. Lawmakers should restore procedural      protections for asylum-seekers.  Then the Washington Post, in another editorial today, speaks of the antiterrorism law being revisited and says, again, that this amendment should be supported.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record those two editorials.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Times, Apr. 30, 1996]                  Immigrants And Other Ordinary People       The story goes that Texas Sen. Phil Gramm was attending a      National Republican Senatorial Committee meeting with      political supporters a few years ago when a woman rose and      asked an awkward question. ``Sen. Gramm,'' she said, ``why do      all the people here talk funny?'' As it happened, about 80      percent of those supporters were first-generation Americans--     immigrants--and Mr. Gramm says you could hear the collective      gulp from the room about 100 miles away. His answer? ``Ma'am,      'cause this is America.''       He elaborated on that answer in memorable remarks to the      Senate last week. ``If we ever get to the point where we do      not have a few citizens who talk funny, if we ever get to the      point where we do not have a new infusion of energy and a new      spark to the American dream, then the American dream is going      to start to die. It is not going to fade, and it is not going      to die on my watch in the U.S. Senate.''       No doubt in part because of his emotional speech, the      Senate last week defeated legislation that would have      effectively limited immigration. But the chamber is not done      with this issue. If you want to see just how far some      lawmakers would go to restrict people who, as Mr. Gramm puts      it, talk funny, then consider some of the immigration      legislation up for a vote as early as this week.       Perhaps the most controversial issue involves so-called      demonstration projects intended to test the use of      verification systems for workers in this country. The idea is      that if the government could just figure out how to keep      illegal immigrants from working then fewer would come here in      the first place. Presto, no more illegal immigration.       This editorial page has said from the beginning of this      debate that it sees nothing wrong with a person's coming here      to work. As the quotable Mr. Gramm put the matter the other      day, ``We have room in America for people who come with their      sleeves rolled up, ready to go to work. But we do not have      room for people who come with their hand out.'' Exactly      right.       Laying the groundwork for a national identification system,      as the demonstration projects do, sets a terrible precedent.      What has this country come to that it would require aspiring      workers to get permission from the government before they can      roll up their sleeves and get to work? Work is not an      entitlement to be disbursed by the politically powerful for      the benefit of the politically favored. Nor is it something      to be trusted to some distant federal worker.       Even if one assumes the government can manage a national ID      system, how is it going to match the ID with the worker? With      fingerprints? With blood and tissue samples?     That's the sort of treatment ordinarily reserved for      criminals, not mere workers.       There's one other thing to keep in mind when senators take      up immigration reform. In their rush to pass an anti-     terrorism bill, lawmakers perhaps unwittingly and      unnecessarily restricted the present rights of persons      seeking asylum in this country to escape political or      religious persecution in their own countries. Such persons      used to get a hearing before an immigration judge. Now they      can be sent home without a hearing or judicial review.      Lawmakers should restore procedural protections for asylum-     seekers.       There's room here for workers. There's room here for people      who genuinely need asylum. ``America is not a great and      powerful country because the most brilliant and talented      people in the world came to live here,'' said Mr. Gramm.      ``America is a great and powerful country because it was here      that ordinary people like you and me have had more      opportunity and more freedom than any other people who have      ever lived on the face of the Earth. And with that      opportunity and with that freedom, ordinary people like us      have been able to do extraordinary things.''                                                                    ____                [From the Washington Post, May 1, 1996]                      The Terrorism Law Revisited       Think back about 10 days to the celebratory pictures of the      president signing the terrorism bill. That measure, deeply      flawed by provisions restricting habeas corpus, allowing the      use of secret evidence at deportation proceedings and      providing for summary exclusion of asylum-seekers, was hailed      as a vital bulwark protecting Americans against international      terrorists. In the rush to pass that legislation by April 19,      the first anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing, scant      attention was paid to Sen. Patrick Leahy, who pointed out      some of these flaws. But this week, when the Vermont Democrat      seeks to use the pending immigration bill to repeal one of      them, the administration is on his side.       Every year, thousands of individuals arrive in this country      seeking asylum from persecution. Until recently, this process      was subject to a lot of abuse. Claimants were admitted, given      a work permit and released with the understanding that they      would show up some time in the distant future (there were      terrible backlogs then) for a hearing. Most of them simply      disappeared into the general population and were never heard      from again. But the Immigration and Naturalization Service      (INS) instituted reforms early in 1994--streamlining      procedures, withholding work permits and keeping many      claimants in custody until their hearings--which have reduced      the problem substantially. The system now in place works      well, and both the Justice Department and the INS say there      is no need for change.       But in the rush ``to combat terrorism'' Congress passed,      and the president signed, new restrictions that create a      presumption that anyone seeking asylum who enters with false      documents, or has traveled through other countries to get      here, does not have a valid claim. In these cases, the      claimant would have to make his case to an immigration      officer on site, without any guarantee that he can be      represented by a lawyer or even have an interpreter. If he      does not persuade this official, he can be returned to his      own country summarily without further hearing before an      immigration judge or review by the Board of Immigration      Appeals.       It is fair to suspect anyone who enters the country with a      false passport, or who has left a place of safety in Western      Europe, for example, to ask for asylum here. But suspicions      need to be proved. It should surprise no one that persecuted      people might not be able to apply for passports in their own      countries, or might have to use a false name to get out. And      a two-hour layover in Germany or France on a long flight to      freedom shouldn't disqualify an applicant for asylum. Sen.      Leahy's effort, which has the backing of the people charged      with enforcing the immigration laws, should be supported.
