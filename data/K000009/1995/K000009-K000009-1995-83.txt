Chairman, tell me would this be in order: We had some conversations here with the leadership on the other side of the aisle and some of the folks here. What if I were to withdraw my amendment at this point perhaps for an hour or two as we are proceeding through the remainder of title II, reserving the right to bring it up at the end of title II?  That would give us more time to discuss this with the full committee chair. It would give us time to discuss with the majority leader since he came over here and talked to us about it.  Would that be in order at this point?
