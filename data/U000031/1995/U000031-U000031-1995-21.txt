Chairman, I ran for Congress to fight spending and to reduce the deficit. What has been more frustrating than ever has been when we have been able to get amendments on this House floor to cut spending, more times than not we have lost those battles. But in the times that we have actually been successful in cutting spending, something happens. The folks in the gallery, the folks at home may cheer watching C-SPAN, but ultimately when the bill goes to the Senate and those bills come back from conference, the spending level is at the same if not even higher.  This lockbox changes things. Thanks to a bipartisan approach from the very beginning, we have been able, I think, to change history with that we are going to be doing tonight. Because in the future when we cut spending for whatever project it might be, defense, nondefense, foreign aid, I do not care, the spending is going to come down and we are going to win and the taxpayers are going to win big time.
