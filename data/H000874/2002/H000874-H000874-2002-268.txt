Chairman, I yield myself 15 seconds for the purpose of saying that everybody's speech is protected. It is how we fund it that is critical. It is how we fund it so that the American people know who is talking to them, that is the issue here, as well as the freedom to talk. Both are protected under Shays-Meehan.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Lewis), who, as I have said before, has risked life and health to protect the civil rights of not only African Americans, but all Americans.
