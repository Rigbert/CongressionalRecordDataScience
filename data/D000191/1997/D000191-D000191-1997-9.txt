Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me the time. I am glad we are back in the regular order and that the ranking member representing the minority is now on the floor of the House.  I am sorry that the majority felt that they had to proceed out of the regular order with this legislation and, in fact, that they felt that they had to hold the House here late in the evening for legislation which could have been dispatched tomorrow during regular business hours.  Mr. Speaker, the legislation, as described by the gentleman from Virginia, whom I do hold in high regard, obviously has merit, and we appreciate the gift. I wish that the Library of Congress did not have to go begging for gifts and that the Republican majority would better fund the Library of Congress, but given the fact that they do not have adequate funds, these sorts of gifts are absolutely vital to maintain our national heritage.  To the gentleman from California [Mr. Thomas], whom I hold in minimally high regard, I do not appreciate his words, and I would say that they are generally characteristic of his performance on the floor. That is why he is held in minimal high regard by so many Members of this body.
