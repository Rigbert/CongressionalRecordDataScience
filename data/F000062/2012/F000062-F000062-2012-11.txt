 President, I rise to oppose this amendment and to indicate that the administration opposes the amendment as well.  We have just 4 days to reauthorize this critical intelligence tool before it expires. That is the reason for having the House bill before us today. The House bill is a clean bill. It extends the program to 2017, when it would sunset and would need another reauthorization. I believe we must pass the House bill now. I believe 2017 is the appropriate date.  I am very worried that if we do anything else, if we pass any one of these amendments, we will jeopardize the continuation of what is a vital intelligence tool. So regretfully, I oppose the Leahy amendment.  I yield the floor.
