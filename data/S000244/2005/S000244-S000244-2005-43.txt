Chairman, I rise in support of the gentleman's amendment.  One of the primary mechanisms for the flagrant abuse of our immigration laws is the use of counterfeited immigration documents, the perpetration of identity fraud, and lying under oath in immigration applications.  This amendment significantly strengthens criminal penalties for all of these crimes and will therefore act as a strong deterrent to aliens considering immigration fraud.  The amendment also provides that if an illegal alien commits a violent crime or a drug trafficking offense, that the alien should receive a criminal sentence at least 5 years longer than he or she would have received otherwise.  If such an illegal alien had previously been ordered deported for having committed another crime, the alien will receive a sentence at least 15 years longer than he or she would have received otherwise.  These are extremely important provisions. It is bad enough for an alien to come illegally to the United States. But for such an alien to come here illegally and then perpetrate a serious, if not deadly, crime takes the offense to a whole other level. And for such an alien to return again and commit yet another offense must simply not be tolerated.  These aliens deserve to see their prison sentences dramatically increased. This is what the amendment does, and I urge my colleagues to support it.
