Speaker, in closing, I appreciate the gentleman's remark about our chairman, Mr. Young, who has announced his retirement at the end of this Congress. You could find no finer person in the world--a kinder heart or wanting to leave the world better--than our chairman.  I would use this time while we are waiting to simply follow on Chairman Rogers' remark in reminding all of our colleagues that we do continue to be a Nation at war, and while we have lost 17 individuals since October 1, in fact, this Nation has lost 117 people since the beginning of this year.  I do hope, as we proceed with the United States Congress and the administration, people understand that we ought to fully fund not just the Department of Defense for their important job, but the other agencies of this government, and certainly through the regular appropriations process.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
