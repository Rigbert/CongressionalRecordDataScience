  I am proud to recognize Kip as the kind of civic champion who did so much for all of the communities he touched, especially for children and families in need.  Mr. Tokuda was born in Seattle in 1946 and eventually served his home district in the Washington State House of Representatives from 1994 to 2002. Through his work on behalf of his constituents and Washington State, he earned a reputation as a deeply principled legislator and respect from both sides of the aisle.  In addition to his service as an elected official, Kip also cofounded the Asian Pacific Islander Community Leadership Foundation, an organization that empowers young people from Asian Pacific Islander communities to seek leadership positions in government and nonprofit organizations. He helped start the Japanese Cultural & Community Center of Washington and last year was awarded the Order of the Rising Sun from the Emperor of Japan for his work to build and maintain strong ties between the United States and Japan. Most recently, he was appointed to the city of Seattle's Community Police Commission, where he worked to create a more diverse police force.  But most importantly, he was a dedicated father, husband, friend, and mentor to many.  People respected Kip because he respected them, and even though he accomplished so much in his life and earned a position of influence, you could always count on Kip to listen.  As a longtime Seattle resident, his kindness and passion inspired all who knew him.  Kip passed away on July 13, 2013 from a heart attack at the age of 66.  Kip is survived by his wife Barb and their two children, Molly and Pei-Ming.  He will be missed by many, but his legacy of service will live on through the organizations he founded and the lives he touched.  Mr. President, I would like to ask my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to Kip Tokuda. He lived a full life and our thoughts are with his loved ones at this time of great and sudden loss.                          ____________________
