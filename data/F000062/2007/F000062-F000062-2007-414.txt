 President, I offer today a private immigration relief bill to provide lawful permanent residence status to Denes and Gyorgyi Fulop, Hungarian nationals who have lived in California for more than 20 years. The Fulops are the parents of six U.S. citizen children. Today, they face deportation having exhausted all administrative remedies under our immigration system.  The Fulop's story is a compelling one and one which I believe merits Congress' consideration for humanitarian relief.  The most poignant tragedy to affect this family occurred in May of 2000, when the Fulops eldest child, Robert ``Bobby'' Fulop, an accomplished 15 year-old teenager, died suddenly of a heart aneurism. Bobby was considered the shining star of his family.  That same year their six-year-old daughter, Elizabeth, was diagnosed with moderate pulmonary stenosis, a potentially life-threatening heart condition and a frightening situation similar to Bobby's. Not long ago, she successfully underwent heart surgery, but. requires medical supervision to ensure her good health.  The Fulop's youngest child, Matthew, was born seven weeks premature. He subsequently underwent several kidney surgeries and is still being closely monitored by physicians.  Compounding these tragedies is the fact that today the Fulops face deportation. They face deportation, in part, because in 1995 the family traveled to Hungary and remained there for more than 90 days.  Under the pre-1996 immigration law, prior to the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, their stay in Hungary would not have been a factor in their immigration case and they would have been eligible for adjustment of status to lawful permanent residents.  Indeed, in 1996, Mr. and Mrs. Fulop applied to the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) for permanent resident status. Due to large backlogs, the INS did not interview them until 1998. By the time their applications were considered, the new 1996 immigration law had taken effect. Given their one-time 90 day trip outside the United States, they were statutorily ineligible for relief pursuant to the cancellation of removal provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act.  One cannot help but conclude that had the INS acted on the Fulop's application for relief from deportation in a timelier manner, they would have qualified for suspension of deportation under the pre-1996 law, given that they were long-term residents of the United States with U.S. citizen children and many positive factors in their favor.  The irony of this situation is that the Fulops were gone from the United States for nearly five months in 1995 because they traveled to Hungary to help Mr. Fulop's brother build his home. Mr. Fulop's brother is handicapped and they went to help remodel his home.  The Fulops are good and decent people. Mr. Fulop is a masonry contractor and the owner and president of his own construction company--Sumeg International. He has owned this business for 12 years and currently has three full-time employees.  The couple is active in their church and community. As Pastor Peter Petrovic of the Apostolic Christian Church of San Diego says in his letter of support, ``[t]he family is an exceptional asset to their community.'' Mrs. Fulop has served as a Sunday school teacher and volunteers regularly at Heritage K-8 Charter School in Escondido. Mrs. Morris, a Heritage K-8 Charter School faculty member says in her letter of support that Mrs. Fulop is ``. . . a valuable asset to our school and community.''  This is a tragic situation. Essentially, as happened to many families under the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, the rules of the game were changed in the middle. When the Fulops applied for relief from deportation they were eligible for suspension of deportation. By the time the INS got around to their application, nearly three years later, they were no longer eligible and in fact suspension of deportation as a form of relief ceased to exist.  The Fulops today have been in the United States since the early 1980s. Most harmful is the effect that their deportation will have on the children, all of whom were born here and who range from three years old to 19 years of age. Their eldest, Dennis, is a 4.0 honor student at Palomar Community College. His sister, Linda, has a 3.8 grade point average, is an honor student in high school, and is also taking one class at Palomar Community College.  It is my hope that Congress sees fit to provide an opportunity for this family to remain together in the United States given their many years here, the profound sadness they have already experienced and the harm that would come from their deportation to their six U.S. citizen children.  I ask unanimous consent that the three letters of community support be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                        Apostolic Christian Church                                                 of San Diego,                                 Escondido, CA, December 28, 2006.     Re The Denes Fulop Family.       To Whom It May Concern: My family and I have known Denes      and Joy Fulop for many year. They have been members in good      standing in our church for approximately 20 years. Denes has      served the congregation faithfully in many capacities. He was      a building committee member during the construction of our      church 10 years ago. He also served as church treasurer for      four years and Sunday School Superintendent for many years.      Presently he is a member on the board of trustees.       Joy Fulop was a building sub-committee member during the      construction of the church and also served for a few years as      a Sunday school teacher. Joy is a devoted and committed      homemaker, and a wonderful example of a loving mother and      wife. Their three younger children, Elizabeth, Sarah and      Abigail are actively involved in Sunday school and in various      youth group activities. The two oldest, Denny and Linda, are      also active in the church. Linda is currently a Sunday school      teacher for 2nd to 5th grade children. Linda and Denny are      very diligent and excellent students in High School and      College and are outstanding citizens.       The family is an exceptional asset to their community.      Denes has been self-employed for many years and is a      knowledgeable and     successful contractor. Their family has never depended on any      government aid, but rather contributes and shares their      blessings with others. Denes, Joy, and their six children are      truly an asset to our church and community.       Should you have any further questions, please don't      hesitate to contact me.           Respectfully submitted,                                                   Peter Petrovic,     Pastor.                                  ____                                                December 29, 2006.       To Whom It May Concern: The purpose of this letter is to      describe our relationship with the Fulop family over the five      years when they became our neighbors.       Dennis Fulop, a contractor, appears to be a very hard      working man, carrying out the responsibilities of owning his      business plus carrying out responsibilities at home for his      wife and six children. I've come to know that Joy, Mrs.      Fulop, spends every free minute taking care of the family,      home, and involving herself in church and school activities.      We have found them to be excellent neighbors, kind,      thoughtful, and ready to carry out any favor we may have.       The six children have been wonderful to see grow up over      the last several years. They excel in school, are well-     mannered, church going, involved in church ministry, and very      polite on every occasion.       Our family finds itself fortunate to have a congenial and      honest family living next door. It is rare to find such a      quality family.           Sincerely yours,     Elizabeth Brandstater Shaw.                                  ____                                  R. Rimmer Construction Inc.,                                     Cardiff, CA, January 3, 2007.       To Whom It May Concern:       The purpose of this letter is to describe my relationship      with Dennis Fulop whom I have known for approximately twenty-     four years.       As a building contractor in the San Diego area I have been      fortunate to have worked with Dennis for most of those years.      He has constructed nearly all of the foundations for the room      additions and new houses that I have built. Dennis has also      constructed most of the driveways, sidewalks, retaining      walls, fireplaces and masonry on my projects. He has also      attended to much of my finish grading, drainage and backhoe      construction needs.       Dennis has long been an invaluable member of my      construction ``team``. He is very knowledgeable in nearly all      construction matters. He has always been very reliable and      responsible in meeting deadlines and upholding high standards      of construction quality.       Dennis is also a very successful small business owner. He      has his own credit accounts with all of the necessary      construction suppliers and to my knowledge has always paid      his bills in a timely manner. In fact, I have never been      contacted or liened by any of his suppliers to date. Dennis      is also very proficient at managing and providing work for      his employees.       Dennis' wife Joy is a dedicated wife and mother to their      six children. She is also actively involved in their church,      the Apostolic Christian Church of Escendido.       I am thankful to know the Fulops on a personal level as      well. They have graciously invited me and my family to      several family and holiday festivities over the years. We      always look forward to getting together with the Fulops and      other members of their church.           Sincerely,                                                       Ron Rimmer,                            President, R. Rimmer Construction Inc.                                 ______                                       By
