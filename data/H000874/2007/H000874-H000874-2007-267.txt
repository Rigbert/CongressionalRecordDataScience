This is about killing this bill. The gentleman will say it comes back promptly. It doesn't come back promptly.  We spent 14\1/2\ hours trying to get money to law enforcement, immigration enforcement and all the other objects in law enforcement, first responders, in this bill. This is about killing this bill. This is about delay. This is about politics, trying to give some of our people a bad vote.  Vote this motion down because it is not real. It is not for substance sake. It is not for the objective as it is articulated in the amendment. It is designed to fail. Reject this chicanery on this floor. Vote ``no.''
