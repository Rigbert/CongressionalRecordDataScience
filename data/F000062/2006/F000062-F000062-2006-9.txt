 This matter was first brought to my attention by key retail constituents in my State including companies like Gap, Inc., Liz Claiborne, and Limited Brands. Retailers have expressed their concern that the import monitoring program would create too much unpredictability and force companies to modify their sourcing strategies and accept the risk of and potential additional cost of antidumping investigations and antidumping duties. They share the concern expressed by the Senator from Oregon that the retail industry was not consulted before the administration committed to setting up the program. I was happy to join the Senator from Oregon on the letter to USTR and Commerce, and I had hoped that we would receive a response before a vote on PNTR on the Senate floor. Is it the Senator's understanding that we will not receive a response to our concerns before the vote?
