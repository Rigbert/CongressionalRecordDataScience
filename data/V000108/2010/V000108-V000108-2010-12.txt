Each year, the Asian American Medical Association pays tribute to prominent, outstanding citizens and organizations for their contributions to the community. In recognition of their efforts, these honorees are awarded the prestigious Crystal Globe Award at this annual banquet.  The Asian American Medical Association has always been a great asset to Northwest Indiana. Its members have selflessly dedicated themselves to providing quality medical services to the residents of Indiana's First Congressional District, and have always demonstrated exemplary service through their many cultural, scholastic, and charitable endeavors.  At this year's Annual Gala, the Asian American Medical Association will present the Crystal Globe Award to one of Northwest Indiana's finest citizens, Dr. M. Nabil Shabeeb, M.D., FACS.  A successful General Surgeon who runs his private practice in Northwest Indiana, Dr. Shabeeb has dedicated his life to medicine. His practice specializes in thyroid and parathyroid surgery, breast cancer surgery, and laparoscopic surgery, as well as cancer support group programs. In addition to his busy medical practice, Dr. Shabeeb has committed himself to many organizations and foundations that positively impact the medical community and the people of Northwest Indiana.  In 1977, Dr. Shabeeb graduated from the College of Human Medicine at Damascus University. He went on to complete his five-year residency at the University of Illinois Metropolitan Group Hospital in 1984. Soon after, he established his private practice in Northwest Indiana. Throughout his tenure, Dr. Shabeeb has gone above and beyond his medical duties as a General Surgeon, serving on numerous medical boards and dedicating much of his time to countless organizations. He has been a member of the Lake County Medical Society since 1984, and has served as a delegate and board member since 1992. At Community Hospital in Munster, Dr. Shabeeb served as Chairman of Surgery from 1992 to 1997, and President of Medical Staff from 1997 to 2001. Currently, Dr. Shabeeb serves as a member of the Board of Directors for the Munster Medical Research Foundation, the Community Foundation of Northwest Indiana, and the Community Cancer Research Foundation. He is also a founding member and Chairman of the Advisory Board for the Cancer Resource Center, a program of the Community Cancer Research Foundation. The Cancer Resource Center is an exceptional program that provides support, counseling, and education to cancer patients and their family and friends free of charge. To date, visits to the center have totaled more than 19,000. For his outstanding commitment to medicine and his many community efforts, in April, 2010, Dr. Shabeeb received the ``Lifetime Achievement Award'' from the Syrian American Medical Society--Midwest Chapter, an educational and humanitarian medical organization.  Madam Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in commending the Asian American Medical Association, as well as this year's Crystal Globe Award recipient, Dr. Nabil Shabeeb, for their outstanding contributions to their communities and beyond. Their unwavering commitment to improving the quality of life for the people of Northwest Indiana and throughout the United States is truly inspirational. For these reasons, the Asian American Medical Association, its members, and Dr. Shabeeb are to be recognized, and I am proud to serve as their representative in Washington, DC.                          ____________________
