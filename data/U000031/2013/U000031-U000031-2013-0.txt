 Mr. Speaker, it is important that seniors don't find a lump of coal in their stockings for Christmas, and this fully offset package represents access to health care for about 40 million seniors. It is going to give seniors the peace of mind, knowing that their trusted physicians will be there when they need them the most by securing stable payments for physicians.  Since its passage back in 1997 SGR has bred uncertainty and frustration. This uncertainty has left seniors in the lurch, wondering if their doctors would be able to remain in practice and available for checkups and consultation. This is no way to keep Americans healthy or run a health care system, so Members on both sides of the aisle agree that the SGR is broken.  Earlier this year, our committee, the Energy and Commerce Committee, myself with Mr. Waxman, we voted 51-0 on H.R. 2810, which would permanently repeal SGR and replace it with a system that promotes the highest quality of care.  While I am disappointed that we didn't repeal SGR permanently this year, this agreement tonight is a step forward. We are going to continue to work at a more complete solution. This fix is fully offset, something that full reform will also need to accomplish. I look forward to working with my colleagues on all the committees to get it done in a bipartisan way.
