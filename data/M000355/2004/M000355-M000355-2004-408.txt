 President, the argument remains the same as it was a few moments ago. The question is whether we can require the Defense Department to predict that which cannot be known. No one knows what the future troop estimate is going to be. We can't predict troop levels 5 years in advance. The Senator from Massachusetts is trying to require the Defense Department to report something that no Defense Department could possibly report. Therefore, the Kennedy amendment ought to be opposed.
