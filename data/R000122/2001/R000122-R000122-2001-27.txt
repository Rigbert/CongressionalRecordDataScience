President, I rise to discuss the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education appropriations bill.  First, I want to commend Chairman Byrd and Senator Stevens, as well as Chairman Harkin and Senator Specter, and their staff, for their work on this bill. Given the budget realities, I know it wasn't an easy task to put this bill together, and I know they would agree we should have even more robust numbers for many programs.  That is why it is important to recognize the increased investments contained in this bill, like dislocated workers; NIH; CDC; SAMHSA; LIHEAP; Head Start; Title I; teacher quality; and Pell grants.  I am particularly pleased that the bill significantly enhances the childhood immunization program under CDC, providing $84.5 million more than last year and $62.5 million more than the administration's budget request.  This additional funding is critical to the continued success of the program, which has faced dramatic increases in vaccine purchase costs, as well as new challenges in program outreach and in vaccine delivery infrastructure development.  In addition to its work in preventing and tracking diseases, the CDC also plays a critical role in our effort to maintain and control the onset of chronic disease among Americans. Seven of every 10 deaths in this country each year can be attributed to chronic diseases such as heart disease, stroke and cancer.  CDC's work to improve our understanding of risk factors, such as tobacco use, poor nutrition and lack of physical activity, through applied research is the cornerstone of our Nation's effort to curb the current epidemic of chronic disease related deaths.  I would also like to commend the chairman and ranking member for preserving funding for the Health Professions Program at HRSA. This program provides vital support to academic institutions and students in an effort to improve the accessibility, quality and racial and ethnic diversity of the health care workforce. The administration's budget proposal would have decimated this program.  During this time of shortages in a variety of health care settings, the health professions and nurse education programs are key to our continued efforts to recruit motivated and qualified individuals for the health care workforce.  I have been particularly interested in the work of the Geriatric Education Centers Program, which provide training for health care professionals who provide care to our Nation's seniors, as well as support for faculty who teach geriatrics. Rhode Island has one of the highest concentrations of people over the age of 65, with persons over the age of 85 being the fastest growing segment of the population. As such, I am deeply concerned about the lack of health professionals specifically trained to address the health care needs of our rapidly aging population. The geriatric programs sponsored by HRSA, including one in my State, play a vital role in enhancing the skill base of health professionals who care for frail and vulnerable seniors.  As a final point with regard to the health related provisions in this legislation, I would simply add that I hope that Senate conferees will be able to work with the House to increase the current funding level for the Community Access Program (CAP) at HRSA.  I also want to thank Senators Harkin and specter for providing $2 billion in LIHEAP funding. This is an 18-percent increase over funding provided in the fiscal year 2001 appropriation bill. LIHEAP is an important program for residents of the Northeast and Midwest, and this increased funding is especially important now. The slowing economy and layoffs will make it increasingly more difficult for low-income families to be able to afford to heat their homes this coming winter. If these families cannot pay their heating bills then they will be forced to chose between heat, prescription drugs, housing, and food. This additional funding will help working poor families maintain economic stability during this difficult time.  As for education funding, I am pleased on many fronts. The bill provides an overall increase of $6.3 billion, including a $1.4 billion increase for title I, $925 million to preserve the School Renovation Program, $1 billion for the 21st Century Community Learning Centers (after school) program, $3 billion for teacher quality, and a $250 boost in the maximum Pell grant to $4,000.  I particularly appreciate the $15 million increase for LEAP, bringing funding for this program to $70 million. LEAP is a Federal-State partnership program which helps needy students attend and stay in college. I have worked closely with my colleague from Maine, Senator Collins, on this program, and I look forward to continuing to work with her, Chairman Harkin, and Senator Specter to maintain this funding level in conference.  I also want to thank Chairman Harkin and Senator Specter for including funding for a critical national cause I have long championed, along with Senator Cochran and others in this body--support for our Nation's school libraries.  The condition of our school libraries is a national disgrace; they either contain mostly bare shelves or are filled with outdated books. Without funding, the goal of the President's Reading First Program to ensure children can read and read well at an early age, will not be met.  While I am pleased that the bill provides a modest downpayment for this program at $25 million, additional funding is certainly needed.  I want to continue to work with Chairman Harkin and Senator Specter to provide increased resources for this critical program, so that it will work hand in hand with Reading First to improve our student's literacy levels and reading scores.  Certainly Chairman Harkin's ESEA amendment to fully fund IDEA would provide the resources needed for the school library program and countless other programs, while meeting the needs of our children with disabilities and schools.  I strongly support this effort, and will work with the chairman of the subcommittee to press for this amendment to be retained in the ESEA conference. Indeed, we must pass this amendment to ensure that essential initiatives get the funding needed to work.                          ____________________
