 President, on November 10th, 1901, several leading citizens of Seaford, DE met in the Town Council room to discuss the organization of a fire company. They understood what we are so very mindful of today, that local firefighters are a key part of our first and best defense against disaster.  By the end of November 1901, there were more than 50 members of the new Seaford Volunteer Fire Department, and W.H. Miller had been elected to serve as its first president. The first chief, T.H. Scott, was elected in early December, and soon after led the company on its first fire response on December 18th, 1901, at a building that was both a store and a home on Seaford's High Street.  The Seaford firefighters used hand-drawn hose reels and ladder trailers until 1921, when the first fire engine was purchased. It is worth taking note that Government money helped buy that first engine, a reminder that a public investment in the fire service is necessary and appropriate. This partnership is all the more important 80 years later, when we ask our firefighters to respond to such a range of threats and dangers.  Today, the Seaford Volunteer Fire Company fleet includes four Pierce fire engines, an aerial truck, two ambulances, a rescue truck, a brush truck, a utility truck and a van, as well as ``Old Number 4,'' a 1948 Seagraves used for fire prevention programs. Four paid ambulance attendants now serve the community, with more than 50 volunteer firefighters still ready to answer the call when their neighbors need them, and 50 more volunteers working in support of the Department.  As we honor the heroes of September 11th, including so many members of New York's Bravest, we stand in prayerful wonder and immeasurable gratitude for what firefighters sacrifice and risk on our behalf. They are, truly, the best of neighbors and the best of citizens.  The Seaford Volunteer Fire Department has been a part of that great tradition for 100 years, and on behalf of the people of my state, and on behalf of the United States Senate, I am proud to extend congratulations to Chief Steve Mayer, President Rich Toulson and all the men and women who have kept the Department and the community strong into a second century of service. Again, we are very proud, and we are deeply grateful.                          ____________________
