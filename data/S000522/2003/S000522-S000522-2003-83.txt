Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Hefley) again, Mr. Speaker, for the outstanding work that he has done. He has been indefatigable in promoting this project along with the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Beauprez). And we are very, very grateful on the committee to have that kind of advocacy coming our way on behalf of the veterans.  Mr. Speaker, I would inquire as to our remaining time and ask if the gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. Berkley) might yield some of her time. We have an additional speaker, the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Beauprez).
