Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume on H.R. 2489.  The National Land Remote Sensing Outreach Act builds on a series of earmarks directed to the United States Geological Survey for nearly a decade. This program originally started out as ``Ohio View'' and has since expanded to more than 35 States, with hundreds of active member groups. This effort has been successful in increasing access to and uses of our Nation's Earth observation satellite assets for education, research, hazardous monitoring, and natural resource management.  This legislation will finally move this program from one funded through earmarks without any oversight from Congress to an authorized Federal program with increased accountability, oversight, and taxpayer protections.  The final version of this legislation the House will consider today includes a number of improvements over the original introduced text. Specifically, this bill places a cap on the annual authorization for this program. This bill also now has a sunset date and requires a cost share from the partners who will work with the U.S. Geological Survey.  These are responsible, necessary changes. Congress should at all times seek to ensure taxpayer protections and oversight of government spending.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
