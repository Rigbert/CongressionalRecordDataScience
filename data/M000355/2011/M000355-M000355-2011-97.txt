 President, I rise today to recognize a fine Kentuckian and an outstanding educator, my friend Dr. Julia Link Roberts. Dr. Roberts is the Mahurin Professor of Gifted Studies at Western Kentucky University and the executive director of the Center for Gifted Studies, a leading Kentucky institution devoted to providing opportunities to gifted students for over 30 years.  Dr. Roberts's stature in her field was recognized recently when she was presented with the Acorn Award by the Kentucky Council on Postsecondary Education. She is the only professor this year from a 4-year institution to be so honored.  Dr. Roberts has been recognized for her excellence before. In 2001, she received the very first David W. Belin Advocacy Award from the National Association for Gifted Children. She was named as one of the 55 most influential people in the field of gifted education by Profiles of Influence in Gifted Education in 2004.  In addition to her work at WKU and with the Center for Gifted Studies, Dr. Roberts was the driving force behind the creation of the Carol Martin Gatton Academy of Mathematics and Science in Kentucky, an outstanding school that provides the opportunity for gifted students from across the State to spend their junior and senior years at WKU taking college-level courses. Newsweek magazine recently named the Gatton Academy one of America's top five high schools.  Thousands of Kentucky's brightest, most promising students have come closer to realizing their full potential thanks to the guidance and direction of Dr. Roberts. I have had the pleasure of meeting many of them and can truly say they are among the finest Kentucky has to offer.  I want to offer her my sincerest congratulations on the well-deserved honor of winning the Acorn Award. It is only the most recent affirmation of the great contribution she has made to the Commonwealth, her students, and the field of education. I am sure her husband, Dr. Richard Roberts, and their children and grandchildren and extended family are very proud of her and all she has achieved.  The Bowling Green Daily News recently published an article recognizing Dr. Julia L. Roberts's remarkable career in education and her most recent achievement in winning the Acorn Award. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:           [From the Bowling Green Daily News, Oct. 8, 2011]                 WKU's Roberts Honored With Acorn Award                           (By Laurel Wilson)       A Western Kentucky University professor recently was one of      two Kentucky faculty members to be honored with an Acorn      Award this year.       Julia Link Roberts, Mahurin Professor of Gifted Studies at      WKU, was recognized as an outstanding professor at a four-     year institution in the state.       The Kentucky Council on Postsecondary Education has given      out Acorn Awards since 1992, said Sue Patrick, communications      director for the CPE. Each year, a faculty member is      recognized from a four-year institution and a two-year      institution.       In addition to Roberts, David Cooper, a professor of      English and African-American history at Jefferson Community      and Technical College, was also honored.       Recipients of the Acorn Award are chosen based on faculty      and student recommendations, as well as self-written essays      about their teaching philosophy, Patrick said.       In his letter of recommendation for Roberts, WKU President      Gary Ransdell called her ``the model of an outstanding      faculty member'' and ``a true champion for education, from      elementary students to professional educators.''       Roberts started WKU's Center for Gifted Studies more than      30 years ago, where she is executive director and has helped      generations of gifted students and their families, Ransdell      said in his letter.       She was also one of the driving forces behind creating the      Carol Martin Gatton Academy of Mathematics and Science in      Kentucky, a program at WKU that allows high-school students      to spend their junior and senior years taking classes at WKU.       The awards were presented during the 23rd annual Governor's      Conference on Postsecondary Education Trusteeship, which took      place Sept. 23 in Lexington and was sponsored by the CPE and      Kentucky's colleges and universities.       ``This is always the highlight of our conference,'' Patrick      said.       The conference is a great place to showcase faculty      excellence because trustees from all state universities are      together in one place, she said.       Roberts and Cooper each received $5,000 and a plaque, she      said.       ``Our faculty members are the heart of each of our colleges      and universities,'' CPE President Bob King said in a news      release. ``Recognizing excellence among so many talented and      dedicated teachers and scholars is a difficult, but rewarding      task. We are enormously grateful to Professor Cooper and Dr.      Roberts for their contributions to so many students across      the commonwealth.''       Roberts said in an email that she was ``both thrilled and      humbled'' to be recognized for her excellence in teaching,      scholarship and service.       ``I am proud to have a positive impact on young people who      participate in various programs offered by the Center for      Gifted Studies,'' she said. ``I am very happy to work with      teachers as my graduate students and to write articles and      books that encourage educators to remove the learning ceiling      for children and young people who are ready to learn at      advanced levels.''                          ____________________
