47, the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                      National Association for the                                Advancement of Colored People,                                 Washington, DC, February 1, 2013.     Re NAACP Strong Support for S. 47, to Reauthorize the 1994          Violence Against Women Act     Senator Patrick Leahy,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Leahy: On behalf of the NAACP, our nation's      oldest, largest and most widely-recognized grassroots-based      civil rights organization, I would like to sincerely thank      you for your leadership in introducing S. 47, legislation      strengthening and reauthorizing the 1994 Violence Against      Women Act (VAWA). As strong and consistent supporters of      VAWA, the NAACP recognizes that this important legislation      would improve criminal justice and community-based responses      to domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault and      stalking in the United States.       As you know, the NAACP supported the passage of VAWA in      1994, and its reauthorization in 2000 and 2005. We have      witnessed VAWA change the landscape for victims of violence      in the United States who once suffered in silence. Victims of      domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault and      stalking have now been able to access services, and a new      generation of families and justice system professionals has      come to understand that domestic violence, dating violence,      sexual assault and stalking are crimes that our society will      no longer tolerate.     Your bill will not only continue proven effective programs,      but that it will make key changes to streamline VAWA and make      sure that even more people have access to safety, stability      and justice.       Thank you again for your continued leadership in this      endeavor. Your thoughtfulness and tenacity in this area over      the years has improved the lives of millions of Americans.      Should you have any questions or comments, please do not      hesitate to contact me.           Sincerely,     Hilary O. Shelton,       Director, NAACP Washington Bureau & Senior Vice President      for Advocacy and Policy.                                  ____                    Seattle Human Rights Commission  Resolution #13-01: Support for Reauthorization of Violence Against                                Women Act       Whereas, all Seattle residents are born free and equal in      dignity and rights; and       Whereas, the Seattle Human Rights Commission is committed      to protecting and advocating for justice, human rights, and      the equal treatment of all people who live and work in      Seattle; and       Whereas, on December 10, 2012, Seattle officially declared      itself a Human Rights City through Council Resolution Number      31420; and       Whereas, human safety is a fundamental human right and      violence against women is a violation of human rights; and       Whereas, Congress failed to reauthorize the Violence      Against Women Act (VAWA) in the 112th Congress; and       Whereas, in the 112th Congress, the U.S. Senate passed a      version of VAWA that included important protections for      groups particularly affected by violence against women, such      as Native Americans, immigrants, and LGBTQ communities; and       Whereas, in the 112th Congress the U.S. House of      Representatives passed a version of VAWA that left out those      protections for Native Americans, immigrants, and LGBTQ      communities; and       Whereas, in the current 113th Congress, the Senate is      considering a nearly identical bill (S. 47) to the one it      passed in the 112th Congress which contains the same      important protections for Native Americans, immigrants, and      LGBTQ communities; and       Whereas, in the current 113th Congress, Rep. Gwen Moore      introduced the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of      2013 (H.R. 11) in the House of Representatives, which is      identical to the Senate bill; and       Whereas, protections against sexual assault and domestic      violence for Native Americans, immigrants, and LGBTQ      communities are required in order to guarantee the human      rights of equality, safety, liberty, integrity and dignity      which are enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human      Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of      Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), the International      Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial      Discrimination, the International Covenant on Civil and      Political Rights, and the American Declaration on Human      Rights among others;       Whereas, in 2011 the United Nations Special Rapporteur on      Violence Against Women recommended that the U.S. reassess its      laws and policies protecting domestic violence survivors and      punishing abusers, including the recognition of tribal      authority to prosecute offenders contained in the current      Senate bill (S. 47); and       Whereas, in 2011 the Inter-American Commission of Human      Rights (ICHR) ordered the United States to comply with its      international duty to prevent violence against women in the      case of Jessica Lenahan (Gonzales) v. the United States,      through the enactment of legislation and policy reforms that      do not discriminate and provide for equal protection before      the law to victims of domestic violence and their children,      under Article 2 of the American Declaration on Human Rights;      and       Whereas, in 2012 the Commission joined with the Seattle      Women's Commission to call for the U.S. House to pass the      Senate version of VAWA and on June 27, 2012, the Commission      co-sponsored a public rally with the Seattle Women's      Commission to support the Senate version of VAWA; and       Whereas, on September 6, 2012 the Commission adopted      Resolution 12-03 urging the House to pass the Senate version      of VAWA,       Now therefore be it resolved, that the Seattle Human Rights      Commission hereby calls upon the United States Congress to      reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act by passing      legislation which does not leave out fundamental protections      for Native Americans, immigrants, and LGBTQ communities in      recognition of the principle that safety is a fundamental      human right and violence against women is a violation of      human rights; and       Now therefore be it further resolved, that the Seattle      Human Rights Commission urges the Senate to pass S. 47 and      the House to pass H.R. 11; and       Now therefore be it finally resolved, that should the House      leadership decide against advancing H.R. 11, then in that      case the Seattle Human Rights Commission urges the House to      pass legislation that still contains protection for Native      Americans, immigrants, and LGBTQ communities.       Adopted by the Seattle Human Rights Commission on February      1, 2013                                              Christopher Stearns,                                                         Chairman,                                                    Jennifer Yogi,                                                        Secretary.
