 GORTON. I yield.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Craig). The Senator from Kentucky.  Mr. McCONNELL. The Senator from Washington indicated it would be illegal under the bill for citizens to form together and form a political action committee and submit a candidate. But is it not true if an individual does it, they better do it early, because once the speech limit has been achieved, even the individual is shut out of the political process, is he not?
