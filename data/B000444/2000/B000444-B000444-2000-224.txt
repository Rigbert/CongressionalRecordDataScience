 President, circumstances have prevented my being able to be here for the vote this evening on Julio Fuentes's nomination to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, but I wanted to take this opportunity to make it clear that I am pleased to support his nomination.  Judge Fuentes is eminently qualified for this important position. After several years in private practice, Judge Fuentes has served the New Jersey community with honor first, as a judge on the Newark Municipal Court, and now, as a judge on the New Jersey Superior Court, where he has served admirably for well over a decade.  Judge Fuentes is an excellent jurist with an unblemished record and a man of integrity. He is regarded with great esteem within his community and hasreceived the endorsement of many different organizations. In fact, I understand that Judge Fuentes was originally recommended for a seat on the District Court in New Jersey, but the White House was so impressed after meeting him that the President nominated him to the Third Circuit instead.  I always monitor the nominations made to the Third Circuit with special interest because my own state of Delaware is part of that Circuit. And I can say without reservation that I am confident that Judge Fuentes will discharge his new responsibilities with distinction and will make a fine addition to that court. I commend the two Senators of New Jersey for their support of this nominee and am proud to join them.                          ____________________
