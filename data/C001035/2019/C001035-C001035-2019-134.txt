President, access to quality healthcare is the foundation of any community. Throughout his long and distinguished career at Stephens Memorial Hospital in Norway, ME, Dr. William Medd has helped to build that foundation in Oxford County. It is a pleasure to join his friends and neighbors in thanking him for 45 years of expert, dedicated, and compassionate service.  Healthcare is essential to the vitality, even the survival, of rural communities. In a recent interview, Dr. Medd said that, after he graduated from the University of Rochester Medical School, he had a wide choice of places to practice. He decided to practice in a place where he could make a real difference, and he certainly has. His role in starting the Maine Track program through Maine Medical Center and the Tufts University School of Medicine to recruit young physicians to rural practice will make a difference for generations to come.  When a new medical center opened in Norway 3 years ago, it was named in Dr. Medd's honor as a tribute to his many contributions to his community. Just as important is the gratitude the people throughout the Oxford Hills region have for his outstanding attentiveness to their health and well-being. I offer Dr. William Medd my congratulations upon his retirement and best wishes for the years to come.                          ____________________
