 And the floor staff, they are always back there. They work on all the bills, but they dropped everything to make this a reality: Laura Dove, Robert Duncan, Chris Tuck, Megan Mercer, Tony Hanagan, Katherine Foster, Brian Canfield, and Abigail Baker.  Now, let's vote on this conference report, and let's have the vote be so overwhelming that there isn't a military family in America who could doubt our commitment to them. Let's use our vote to send a message as well to Russia and China that we are revitalizing American power so we can win the competition for influence that will shape the kind of world our children and grandchildren are going to live in.  Kay and I have 20 kids and grandkids. They are the ones I am concerned about, as well as your kids and grandkids. We are not going to win with a strong military alone, but we will lose without one. That is what this NDAA will do: revitalize American military power so we can achieve our vision of a safe, prosperous, and free world. That is what this is all about. That is what we are going to do.  Merry Christmas.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). The Senator from North Dakota.
