 President, today the Senate loses its leader, but our Nation and its people gain a leader. What this country needs at this time is to see a good example coming from its political leaders. What this country needs is moral leadership. It is truly lacking, of course, in the current White House. I have been speaking out on this subject of lack of moral leadership, with several specific examples of that failed leadership by the President and First Lady, since March 19.  It is not enough to call Bob Dole a friend, a steady presence in the Senate, an ally. It is more important to know his qualities.
