 President, let me say briefly to the ranking member of the Rules Committee, I listened carefully to his statement. I thank him very much for respecting the process by which we have selected our nominees for the Federal Election Commission. He made it clear that, had the choice been his, he would not have picked Professor Smith. I will make it clear a little later that had the choice been mine, I would not have picked Commissioner McDonald. This is the way the FEC is supposed to work. I thank my colleague for honoring that tradition.
