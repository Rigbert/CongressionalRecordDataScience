 Chairman, I fully support the current provisions that require a CBO estimate of the costs to State and local governments of unfunded mandates. That is very important. That is very important. But these estimates alone misrepresent the true cost of legislation and ignore its benefits. This amendment corrects that fatal flaw. This amendment helps us fulfill the laudable purposes spelled out in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act.  Its purposes include, and I quote from the bill, ``to end the imposition, in the absence of full consideration by Congress, of Federal mandates,'' and ``to assist Congress in its consideration of the proposed legislation * * * by establishing a mechanism to bring such information to the attention of the Senate and House * * * and to promote informed and deliberate decisions by Congress.''  If Members support these purposes, I urge Members to support this amendment.  The CBO will not always be able to provide a quantitative cost-benefit analysis. This amendment recognizes this limitation and only requires quantitative analyses when practicable, but when it is practicable, we need to be aware of all essential pieces of information. Uninformed decisions do not lead to cost-effective decisions. Let us save money and pass intelligent legislation that is not shortsighted.  I urge the Members to vote for this amendment, and vote for full and unbiased information.
