Mr. Chairman, what is wrong with this microphone? I am getting a little tired of it. Whoever is running this thing had better be on the ball, because this thing never goes on on time and some of the time we cannot hear anybody, and maybe that is on purpose. But we have spent an awful lot of money on this project, brand-new, and I have been here and listening to this and it is not properly run and it deeply disturbs me.
