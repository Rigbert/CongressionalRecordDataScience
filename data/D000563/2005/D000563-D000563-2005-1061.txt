 Let me ask the Senator. It is not a carefully guarded secret that part of the reason they want to move this bill off the Senate is so they can bring to the floor the National Rifle Association bill on gun manufacturers' liability before we leave for the August recess. So it is not just a matter of cloture to move the DOD bill, the Department of Defense bill, it is to make room and time for the National Rifle Association, another special interest group, so that they have more days to deliberate their bill than we may spend on this bill.
