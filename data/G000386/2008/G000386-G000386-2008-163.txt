 President, I want to address an issue of corporate responsibility, particularly as it relates to my hometown of New Hartford, IA, and the flood that recently took place there, and whether a large chainof convenient stores that is headquartered across Wisconsin is going to take the corporate responsibility of continuing to serve a small town that has been devastated by a flood.  It has been a tough and challenging time for Iowans over the past few weeks. I have come to the floor on a few occasions already to update my colleagues on the natural disasters that have hit Iowa so hard.  Tornadoes and floods have caused economic and emotional toil and pain and have, sadly, taken 24 lives across the Midwest.  Just a mile from my farm is the town of New Hartford, where I have lived my entire 74 years. It is a modest town of about 650 people. On May 25, the north edge of the town suffered extensive damage from a tornado.  That same tornado destroyed half the town of Parkersburg, IA, just 10 miles west of my hometown of New Hartford, and continued damaging towns over a 43-mile range, including Dunkerton and Hazleton, as that tornado traveled east.  Then came the floods. The town and residents of New Hartford were devastated by the flood waters of what we call Beaver Creek. Much of the town's homes and businesses suffered damages from the floods.  But Iowans are resilient people. The residents and the entire community are pulling together to help their neighbors get back on their feet.  But one resident is abandoning the people of New Hartford. Kwik Star has announced that the only convenience gas store in town will not be rebuilt. The decision by Kwik Star to not reopen their store is a serious setback for the town of New Hartford.  These folks have endured a tornado and a damaging flood, but they are working to rebuild, pull themselves together, and somehow get their lives back to normal.  But the one gas station and convenience store will not be around to help with that rebuilding. They view the damage to their facility as too great, too daunting to overcome. This news has added another devastation to the residents of the community. We get the story: Well, we will not rebuild in New Hartford. We will put one double the size of that one in Parkersburg, so then all the people in New Hartford can drive 10 miles to get whatever they would get in their local community.  This is a large chain of convenience stores. I am begging for corporate responsibility, to continue to serve the community. And, particularly, don't ditch people when they are most in need.  Well, their decision doesn't sit well with the residents of New Hartford. As you can tell, it doesn't sit well with me.  As the residents are cleaning up their homes, parks, and businesses, Kwik Star has decided to abandon them. Kwik Star is hurting my neighbors and friends emotionally and economically.  If they don't see the value in rebuilding in New Hartford, why should the residents have any hope? These folks are doing everything they can to bring their properties back from this disaster, to rebuild our hometown, and Kwik Star is leaving them high and dry during this time of devastation.  It is not just the emotional pain of their decision that hurts the people of New Hartford, IA; it is also economic because Kwik Star employed 15 people before the flood. Three full-time employees--Deana Ackerson, Brenda Smith, and Barb Harper--have each worked for Kwik Star for many years.  Twelve other employees--Cindy Huberg, John Mulder, John Anderson, Matt Winkelman, Rich Moore, Teresa Peverill, Carol Grooms, Lauri and Roger Palmersheim, Mitch Konken, Pam Hargema, and Heather Hugelucht--depended on Kwik Star for employment as well.  The bottom line is that the residents of New Hartford are clinging to their hope that the town will come back even stronger than before these disasters. They are using that hope to get through this.  But Kwik Star is dashing that hope. Kwik Star is telling them that their town no longer deserves a gas station and convenience store. One flood is all that this big corporation can seem to handle. If you want gas, milk, or bread, you will have to drive 10 miles to get it in a new, refurbished store that is twice as large.  I can tell them that in another town, just 15 miles away, they had a flood, and they had two stores in that town. One of the two stores in Waverly was flooded, but they are going to rebuild that store. I don't understand this. I am working for tax changes, which is the very same thing we did for Katrina in New Orleans, and with the help of Senator Baucus and Congressman Rangel, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, we are working to enact tax relief for victims of natural disasters similar to what was done to the victims of the hurricane. I hope this will encourage Kwik Star to stay in New Hartford.  This includes expensing for demolition and cleanup of debris. Another major provision would allow additional depreciation to greatly reduce or eliminate the business tax liability for the current year, including an operating loss carryback, as an example, for 5 years, which ought to be plenty of incentive for these businesses to continue in the communities where they work.  In the case of the floods, we are talking about 250 different communities in eastern Iowa, just as an example; and, in addition, Wisconsin, Illinois, and Indiana--and now it looks as though it is going to cover Missouri as well.  I am pushing these provisions to help businesses such as Kwik Star cope with the cost of damage and rebuilding.  Mr. President, I am here to appeal to this major convenience store and corporation serving the Midwest, the Kwik Star Corporation, and tell them that New Hartford is worthy of a convenience store. Our residents deserve Kwik Star's commitment to the community. They need to know that a company they have depended on and they have done business with for over 20 years will reverse this decision and join them in bringing New Hartford back from disaster.                             Iowa Flooding  Mr. President, I want to take a moment to provide another update on the flooding in Iowa. As you are aware, Iowa is in the middle of a crisis. Across the State, floods have devastated homes, businesses, farms, and communities, and that continues.  I have been traveling back and forth to Iowa to see the catastrophic damage, and I have been anguished to see my fellow Iowans suffering. People are hurting, and it will take a long time and a lot of hard work just to get back to normal.  However, in the midst of this devastation, I have also witnessed incredible examples of the spirit of Iowa. I have seen Iowans come together in communities across the State sandbagging, consoling, sharing, and providing a helping hand to neighbors and strangers alike. This spirit of dedication, a natural inclination to put others before self, is what makes me most proud to call myself an Iowan.  I cannot talk about the spirit of Iowa without talking about the dedication and efforts of our police, fire, emergency medical services, National Guard forces, and the Civil Air Patrol. These first responders are the frontline of defense for all Iowans. These selfless individuals come to the aid of all Iowans, putting duty first to help others defend their homes, livelihoods, and lives. They do this without thinking twice and put others' lives before their own. They have worked tirelessly to build levees, to sandbag, to secure dangerous areas, and to make water rescues. They have suffered loss, just as all Iowans have; but they never waiver and they always continue to come to the aid of others.  For instance, police and fire stations across the flood zone have been damaged or destroyed. News reports have documented how the fire station in Columbus Junction, IA, was under 10 feet of water. Other reports point to devastation of police, fire, and EMS facilities across the State, including the second largest city in our State, Cedar Rapids. Despite this, first responders still continue to provide security and to help communities in distress. Their efforts are nothing short of heroic.  It is not just local police, fire, EMS personnel who are helping out. Law enforcement officers with the Iowa State Patrol and from other agencies across the State have come to the flood zone to lend a helping hand.  Some have come from out of State. For instance, Coast Guard rescue teams based out of St. Louis came toprovide search and rescue. State troopers and police officers from Nebraska and Minnesota have helped the Cedar Rapids Police Department keep the city secure as the floodwaters recede and cleanup begins.  I appreciate the sacrifice and dedication these folks have made to help Iowa in its time of need.  But it does not stop there. The Iowa National Guard has deployed over 4,000 of their members across the State, providing vital manpower to assist local communities. They have used their skills and training to help meet numerous local needs. They have helped with sandbagging, shoring up levees, saving homes and businesses, and they have secured bridges and patrolled levees. They have been assisting local law enforcement with security. They have distributed clean drinking water to communities that have no running water and provided generators to those without power.  The National Guard has also provided air support via helicopters to support the assessment of damage and transportation of vital equipment. The list of needs met by our Iowa Guardsmen goes on and on, and their dedication knows no bounds.  In fact, one Iowa Guardsman, National Guard SPC Curtis L. White, had to change his wedding plans when he was deployed in support of the flood effort. He married his wife Daniele on Thursday, June 19, on the viaduct on the corner of Highway 92 and 2nd Street in Columbus Junction where he had been assisting with the flood operations. I thank him, his new wife, and his fellow Iowa National Guard soldiers and airmen for their sacrifices and compassion for their fellow Iowans.  I also thank those in the Iowa wing of the Civil Air Patrol who flew Senator Harkin and this Senator around the State to view the impacted areas. The Civil Air Patrol also flew photo missions to examine the extent of flooding. I commend the Civil Air Patrol for their dedication.  Finally, I thank the men and women across the State who are serving in hospitals, emergency rooms, long-term care facilities, community health centers, home health agencies, and hospices. Many of these people lost their homes to flooding, and yet they still showed up at work to do the right thing. They are to be commended for those efforts.  I know these folks were on the frontline working to evacuate patients from places such as Mercy Medical Center in Cedar Rapids as floodwaters rose. When this happened, facilities such as Saint Luke's Hospital in the same city and others nearby jumped up without hesitation to take in these displaced hospital patients.  We cannot forget the hard work and dedication of our health care professionals during this crisis, and as they are on the road to recovery. With people such as these, I have no doubt that facilities such as Mercy Medical Center will be fully operational in no time.  As the floodwaters start to recede and Iowa moves toward rebuilding, the responsibility of public safety will still be on the shoulders of our first responders. These capable men and women who serve in law enforcement, fire departments, EMS, the National Guard, and in hospitals across the State need all the resources we can provide them in this time of need. We have a responsibility to make sure they are equipped for the job and any future natural disasters we have.  That is why I led the Iowa congressional delegation in writing to Federal agencies, such as the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice, asking that deadlines for law enforcement and first responder grant programs be extended for communities impacted by the flooding.  Communities in Iowa should not be penalized from receiving grants because they have not had the time to hurry up and beat a deadline that does not take into consideration such natural disasters. These communities should be given special consideration for applying for grant moneys because of the extensive damage.  Programs such as the Assistance to Firefighters and the Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response Firefighters can provide vital assistance to fire departments that were impacted by the flooding. These departments may need new equipment, radios, computers, and repairs to their fire stations. These grants can provide that assistance.  Further, programs such as the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Program, called Byrne/JAG, as we all know it around here, and the Community Oriented Policing Services, and we refer to that as the COPS Program, can also provide these same types of resources to police departments in need.  Iowans will soon be facing a long process toward rebuilding. It will not be easy. However, I am proud to say that I know Iowans will be helping others to rebuild in the Iowa spirit of hard work and generosity. We in Congress are doing all we can on our end to ensure that first responders in the field have the resources they need.  So I applaud, maybe now a third or fourth time but you cannot do it too many times, these brave men and women who serve their communities and carry on the spirit of Iowa.  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.
