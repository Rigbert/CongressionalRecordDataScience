Speaker, I submit to the record a story of two young women whose voices we in hear. Last Thursday, ``Ms. A'' and ``Ms. B'' traveled from Bangladesh to our nation's Capital to tell their story. The two women are the survivors of the horrendous fire that occurred in the Chowdhury Knitwear factory in Bangladesh on November 25, 2000.  Sadly, their story echoes the events of the 1911 fire that occurred at the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory in New York City where 146 young garment workers were killed.  The women traveled to the United States to tell their compelling story of the dangerous working conditions under which they are forced to work. Fifty-one of their co-workers were killed in the fire that blazed through the factory. Many of the workers were electrocuted, suffocated, or trampled to death, due to the doors of the factory being locked that evening by the owners to keep union organizers out. Through timid voices they explained that they are forced to work long hours, and had not received a raise in two years. They spoke of their fear for their jobs when they returned home because of their trip to the United States. However, they stated that they traveled to the United States to tell their story in hope of making a difference for the workers in the Chowdhury factory in Bangladesh and workers around the world.  In Bangladesh nearly 80% of garment workers do not earn the legal monthly minimum wage of $17. The average workday is 12-14 hours, many times for as little as 5 cents an hour. The workers are denied the right to organize and are subjected to deplorable working conditions. ``Ms. A''and ``Ms. B'' sew for first-world clients at the Chowdhury Knitwear Factory. The factory produces towels and bedding products that are shipped to the European Union. However, the owner of the factory owns and operates another factory across the street that makes products that are shipped to the United States.  Unfortunately, there are many factory workers who can tell stories such as ``Ms. A'' and ``Ms. B's''. There are factories like the Chowdhury Knitwear factory in Bangladesh all over the world. In the past decade hundreds of workers have been killed in factory fires throughout Asia, in Thailand, and in China. We have a responsibility to impel companies in countries such as Bangladesh to provide their workers with safe conditions and the right to organize, and collectively bargain. America should not allow the import of goods from nations that allow the exploitation of their own workers.  As a member of the International Workers Right Caucus, I strongly urge the United States Congress, and all nations to ratify the International Labor Organization Standards providing individuals abroad basic worker rights.  Mr. Speaker, I submit to the record the story of these women and their associates because I am their voice, the voice that can be heard by the American public, and by the U.S. government.  It is because of the conditions that exist at the Chowdhury Knitwear factory in Bangladesh that I will continue to fight for labor rights both home and abroad.                          ____________________
