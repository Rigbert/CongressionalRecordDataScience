Mr. Speaker, over the years the Helsinki Commission has closely monitored human rights developments to Turkey. I have supported Commission efforts and have joined my colleagues in speaking out about suppression of free speech, torture, and fundamental human rights questions concerning Turkey's Kurdish citizens. As the new Chairman of the Commission, I will continue to speak out on these and other such developments.  I rise today to protest the arrest of seven leaders of the Human Rights Association of Turkey's Diyarbakir branch. Prosecutors want to jail these individuals for no less than 10 years on charges that a publication they produced which documented human rights cases constitutes ``separatist propaganda.'' One of those detained, Neymetullah Gunduz, an attorney and association leader, had met with members of a Helsinki Commission delegation last October. Just weeks ago, several other human rights leaders were acquitted of similar charges. Mr. Speaker, international scrutiny has and should continue to focus on these draconian speech restrictions and other human rights problems which continue to tarnish Turkey's democratic credentials.  For years now, Human Rights Association members throughout Turkey, but especially in the southeast, have been harassed, gunned down, and have had their offices forcibly closed. The Diyarbakir branch was the last allowed by authorities to function in the region, and now, it too has been silenced. Mr. Speaker, the deteriorating human rights situation facing residents of southeast Turkey can only be described in terms of fear and violence. The freedoms and liberties of all citizens have been stripped in an effort to fight terrorism, and residents are victimized by both terrorist and security forces.  Mr. Speaker, Turkish leaders have expressed dismay at efforts to slow Turkey's integration into the European Union, and yet that Government has continued to pursue policies contrary to accepted international human rights norms. Their protests about congressional conditioning of U.S. aid on human rights performance ring equally hollow given the flagrant disregard for Turkey's stated human rights commitments, including those undertaken with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.  Mr. Speaker, I call upon the Government of Turkey to immediately drop its case against the seven activists and to release all those political prisoners who presently languish in Turkish prisons simply for expressing their opinions.                          ____________________
