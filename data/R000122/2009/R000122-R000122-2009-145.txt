President, we are dealing with a plethora of issues that are absolutely critical to the economic success of the country. I mentioned climate effects. I mentioned investment in reducing our carbon footprint. All of these have been outlined and provided for in this budget resolution.  We are also going a long way to invest in the future of the country through education. I am pleased to see that this proposal includes a deficit-neutral reserve fund for higher education to allow for expanding student aid.  I have worked with Senator Collins on an amendment to ensure that this reserve fund may be used for increased investments in the Leveraging Educational Assistance Partnership or LEAP program which provides critical need-based grant aid and support services to low-income students.  This budget also provides for increased spending on Pell Grants, and as such, invests in our greatest resource, the talent and innovation and imagination of America. In that sense, I think this is a very strong step forward.  The budget helps deal with the issues facing small business in terms of providing, for example, $880 million for the Small Business Administration. It is small businesses, indeed, that create the jobs. Too often in the past, we have talked the talk but not walked the walk. This budget provides real resources for the Small Business Administration.  We have very difficult decisions to make, but we have made them before. I can recall being elected in 1990, beginning in 1991 with a huge deficit. Through the tough decisions we made here, a Democratic Congress following a Democratic Congress, we were able to not only turn the economy around but reduce the deficit. That is something we have to do going forward, and we must do that. I think this budget will position us to do that.  We have a difficult series of choices before us. I believe this budget and the work of Senator Conrad have positioned us to respond to the crisis of the moment and positioned us to take opportunities of the future.                           Amendment No. 836  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment and call up amendment No. 836, the Reed-Snowe LIHEAP amendment.
