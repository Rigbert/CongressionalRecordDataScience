Joe exemplifies the meaning of public servant. I have served as chairman and ranking member of the House Committee on Agriculture, and today I serve as the ranking member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry. All along the way, Joe has served the Congressional Research Service and thereby the Congress with excellence and distinction over the course of 40 years. His focus has included the nutrition assistance programs, almost from their inception. From programs ranging from SNAP, WIC, school meals, and faith-based initiatives, Joe is a recognized expert, a prolific writer, and unparalleled in his field.  A nonpartisan professional, Joe has been an invaluable resource for Members and staff and has regularly been relied upon to navigate the complexities of statutes, rules, and regulations, and the myriad of forms public assistance has taken over the last several decades. From farm bills to child nutrition reauthorizations and related legislation in-between, he has been a compendium of information on the ideas generated, efforts attempted, reforms enacted, and the effects and changes to society our laws have made. He is a tribute to his profession, and our Nation is a better place to live for all Americans as a direct result of his efforts.  I and my staff have greatly appreciated Joe's counsel. Whenever called upon, Joe would answer, be it during regular business hours, late into the night, or early the next morning, always helpful, and always forthright. I appreciate the dedication demonstrated by public servant Joe Richardson. Thank you Joe, you will be missed.
