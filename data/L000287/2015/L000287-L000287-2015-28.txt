Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1026, the Taxpayer Knowledge of IRS Investigations Act.  Earlier this afternoon, the House passed H.R. 1058, the Taxpayer Bill of Rights Act. Two of the rights included in that bill were the right to confidentiality, the right to be informed. This bill complements that legislation.  Generally, tax returns are confidential and may not be disclosed unless authorized by the Internal Revenue Code. Section 6103 of the Code provides certain exceptions. These do not include telling a taxpayer if there has been an unauthorized disclosure of his or her tax return information. Fines, criminal penalties, or both apply to the unauthorized inspection or disclosure of tax return information.  H.R. 1026 would allow the Internal Revenue Service to update a taxpayer on the status of investigations of unauthorized disclosure of his or her tax return. They would be allowed to know whether the investigation started, is open, or is closed.  This is a simple, commonsense bill. Taxpayers have a right to know if their tax return information has been compromised.                              {time}  1415  I want to thank my friend, the gentleman from Pennsylvania, my Republican colleague; the ranking member of the subcommittee; and the chairman for bringing this bill to the floor today.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
