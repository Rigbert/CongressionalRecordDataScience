REID. The center would be a clearinghouse for scientific research in support of water conflict resolution. As a focal point for advanced research and education in water security issues, it would bring together scientists, engineers, water managers, and policymakers from arid and other water-starved regions worldwide. Through collaborative research exchanges, the center would promote long-term capacity building in developing countries, which would benefit from our leadership in desalinization, water treatment, hydrologic modeling, water-use efficiency, and other technical approaches. The center would also support education of young Americans in international water policy and security, an area of expertise that we will certainly need in the future. The wide spectrum of cultures and landscapes would broaden the outlook of everyone involved, fostering the multidisciplinary approaches needed to ensure project viability and longevity.  Mr. McCONNELL. Where might the center be based?
