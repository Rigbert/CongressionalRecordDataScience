 President, I ask to have printed in the Record copies of some of the finalist essays written by Vermont High School students as part of the sixth annual ``What is the State of the Union'' essay contest conducted by my office. These finalists were selected from nearly 800 entries.  The material follows:             NICK SEARS, VERMONT COMMONS SCHOOL (FINALIST)       The United States of America is an amazing nation that      continues to lead the world through the complex geopolitical      problems that we are faced with today. As a strong economic      and political world leader, we have become the role model for      developing nations attempting to give their people the same      freedoms and opportunities that Americans have become so      accustomed to. This is why it is so important to work harder      than we ever have before to better ourselves as a nation,      because what we change will set a precedent of improvement      around the world and inspire change.       The biggest problem in the U.S. is the incarceration      system. It has been broken for decades, and there has been no      legitimate attempt to fix it. Over the past thirty years,      there has been a 500% increase in incarceration rates,      resulting in the U.S. leading the world in number of      prisoners with 2.2 million people currently incarcerated.      Especially in this example, it is important to humanize these      statistics. These are 2.2 million people, who now because of      their conviction will find it much harder to be truly      integrated back in their communities, due to the struggles of      finding a job with a record, and the fact that they often do      not qualify for social welfare. The incarceration system is      also bankrupting both the state and federal government. It      currently is the third highest state expenditure, behind      health care and education.       Fortunately, we as a nation have the opportunity to fix the      incarceration system. First, we need to get rid of mandatory      minimum sentences. Judges from across the nation have said      for decades that they do not like mandatory minimums, that      they do not work, and that they are unconstitutional.      Mandatory minimum sentences, coupled with racially biased      laws concerning drug possession is the reason why we see the      ratio of African American males to white males over 10:1.      This leads to the second action we must take; we must end the      war on drugs. It has proven to be a failed experiment that      has reopened many racial wounds in our nation. The war on      drugs also put addicts behind bars, rather than treating      addiction like the problem it actually is; a mental health      issue.     PAIGE THIBAULT, CHAMPLAIN VALLEY UNION HIGH SCHOOL (FINALIST)       In common day society, education is widely accepted as a      valuable resource to our nation's future. Education has      immeasurable impact on our lives and on our identity, as we      build foundations of our growth off of our learning. However      with all these potentially influential factors that education      possesses, the system that we have nurtured has failed in      reaching students with meaning and value. Like other things      in our world, the system is broken.       What I've been noticing within my own education is that the      prospect of content is idolized in the classroom. Teachers no      longer cram memorization into our heads (an educational      revolution in itself), yet their focus is still the intimate      prevalence of deadlines and test scores. Yes--school is where      we learn--yet the purpose of our learning should not to      become `smart'. When students start thinking that this is      indeed the purpose of their learning, inspiration and drive      are completely decimated. Being `smart' is a subjective      standard that we press upon our kids, yet it's something      which has shallow value. Classes stuffed with disconnected      information only promote this misconception even further. Why      should we be focusing on feeding students material when the      students themselves don't see why they're supposed to consume      it?       And this isn't just the content; it's the atmosphere. An      example: When an adult reads from a manual in front of a      class, there are two parties in play. There's the instructor      (includes the teacher, the manual, the authors of the      manual), and there is the student body. Notice it's not      twenty individual humans learning differently on the same      topic, it is the singular and collective student group.      Sitting in this blob of the ``student body'' and being      considered solely for the fact that you belong to a mass of      apparent learning is an extremely demoralizing thought in the      learning setting. I want to be appreciated for what I can      bring to my learning; not what the class average is. What      value do I have if I can be replaced with a statistic?       I'll tell you why: our hopes and dreams are original. Our      minds run differently. And most importantly our souls all      want to go in our own direction. No matter how similar our      test scores are, we will never be destined to have the same      future, so why are we clustered to have the same upbringing?      Why are we held to the same expectations if the only thing      that is the same about us is the year on our birth      certificate? I understand that grouping students by age is a      positive thing, but we should not let that number classify us      as learners.       We need to rethink education, emphasizing personal growth      versus increased IQ. Students should not be accepted with      their differences, but should be accepted because of them.      The teachers that guild students should be trained with the      ideology that learning is not for a destination, it is for a      journey. Administrators and Curriculum Directors or      Superintendents need to see the content and need to      understand that force-feeding students knowledge is not      knowledge at all. We need to create the environment where      students have choice of what their learning environment looks      like; choice of how they learn material; choice of how they      develop and a choice of how they grow.       It's true: education is an important system that gets a      significant share of financial and governmental attention.      Now let's make it a revolution of consciousness. Let's make      meaningful education for our future; not for our brains.       PETER UNGER, CHAMPLAIN VALLEY UNION HIGH SCHOOL (FINALIST)       The internet is the first human creation with the potential      to unify and connect the world; with the potential to change      the way we collaborate and innovate forever; with the      potential to reestablish the United States of America as the      preeminent global leader in education, technology, and      medicine. However, none of this potential will be realized      without a fundamental rethink of Internet Service Provider      regulations. We also need a fresh approach on infrastructure      capable of launching a new age industrial revolution. The      United States of America needs a government maintained and      mandated fiber optic network. We no longer have an economy      based on production of tangible products for a regional      economy, instead we produce innovative and revolutionary      ideas. Without a fiber optic backbone, these ideas won't      reach their potential. Let me convey to you the urgency and      importance of this issue. The competition has already started      or even finished the improvements this country is in dire      need of. The cost of broadband in dollars per megabits per      second ranked Bulgaria as number one with a cost of forty      seven cents per megabit per second, and in thirty third place      is the United States of America at three dollars and fifty      cents. This disconnect between value and product is dousing      the innovative fire that is the American Technology industry.       What do we do? Myself and experts alike, know for certain      that the Internet Service Providers aren't going to figure it      out on their own. They are up selling us into decade old      technology for a premium. Currently, there is no incumbent to      challenge the oligopoly that are the American Internet      Service Providers. The only realistic solution to this dire      problem is a mindset change in the legislative branch of this      very country; people don't do things on the internet, people      just do things. Internet needs to be classified as the true      utility it is. The internet may be the most powerful      collaboration and creation tool ever known to man. I      personally believe that we can't currently comprehend the      possibilities that will be made real by this truly amazing      tool.       Do you want cable companies to control what website you      visit and to prioritize services that pay a premium?      Currently, these are controlled by a concept known as net      neutrality, the cable companies' lobbyists want to abolish      this fundamental protection of freedom of speech and      innovation. Without this fundamental freedom, the creativity,      innovation, and communication, at which the internet is so      powerful at stimulating, will be stomped out for good.       The only way to protect the openness, fairness, and freedom      we as United States Citizens are accustomed to as well as      enhance the creativity, innovation and communication, which      we all use the internet for, is for the Federal      Communications Commission to reclassify broadband service      under Title II of the Telecommunications act. This letter is      not a preventative measure, this letter is an     eleventh hour plea to pull even with the rapidly evolving      global information arms race.                          ____________________
