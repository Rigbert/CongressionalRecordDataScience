President, I oppose this amendment because it contains language that raises serious First Amendment questions regarding the separation of church and state.  This amendment basically allows taxpayer dollars to flow to religious institutions, such as churches, mosques, and synagogues, to administer social services and public health benefits on behalf of our federal government. I believe this provision is Constitutionally suspect and requires more thoughtful Congressional scrutiny in the form of hearings and public discussion. Instead, this dubious language has been slipped into a several-hundred page amendment that few, if any, of my Senate colleagues have probably read.  Unlike the charitable choice provision in the 1996 welfare reform act, which applies to a very limited number of social service programs, this language would expand the scope of ``charitable choice'' to every current and future public health and social service program that receives federal funds. This new charitable choice language also would go further by allowing religious institutions receiving taxpayer dollars to discriminate in their hiring and firing decisions on the basis of their particular religious beliefs and teachings, abrogating the intent of our nation's civil rights laws.  Thus, under this particular provision, persons hired with federal taxpayer money, notwithstanding their personal religious beliefs, could be fired because they did not abide by particular religious standards, such as regular church attendance, tithing, or perhaps abstinence from coffee, tea, alcohol, and tobacco. This new language could allow a federally funded employee to be fired because she remarried without seeking an annulment of her first marriage. This seemingly innocuous ``charitable choice'' language amounts to federally funded employment discrimination, and allows religious organizations supported by taxpayer money to exclude people of different tenets, teachings and faiths from government-funded employment.  I would also like to address a point made by Senator Santorum last evening regarding Vice President Gore's support of ``charitable choice.'' Senator Santorum failed to mention that in a speech given in May 1999 by the Vice President, he stated that any charitable choice ``extension must be accompanied by clear and strict safeguards.'' He also said that ``government must never promote a particular religious view, or try to force anyone to receive faith.'' This amendment fails on both accounts.  There is a tradition in Rhode Island of religious tolerance and respect for the boundaries between religion and government. Indeed, Roger Williams, who was banished from Massachusetts for his religious beliefs, founded Providence in 1636. The colony served as a refuge where all could come to worship as their conscience dictated without interference from the state. With that background, I believe that we should be very careful to maintain the distinction between government and religion. They both have important roles to play, especially in helping some of our country's neediest citizens. However, if a church or mosque is going to accept taxpayer dollars to perform contractual government services, they should not be able to deny employment to qualified American citizens. Our nation's laws should not allow discrimination on the basis of religion.  I suspect that the drafters of the amendment understand the Constitutional infirmities of their language. They seek some protection by inserting a reference to the ``Establishment Clause in the First Amendment'' as a check on permissible programs. However, such an approach blithely ignores the succeeding words of the same sentence. ``Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof . . .'' (emphasis added).  Their use of the Establishment Clause is a transparent ploy to dress up dubious legislation in the trappings of the Constitution without giving effect to the full meaning of the Constitution. The proposed legislation raises serious questions about the ``free exercise'' of religion. By imposing religious tests on federally funded employment and by condoning religious based treatment regimes paid for by public funds which may conflict with the religious beliefs of beneficiaries, this legislation severely impinges on the ``free exercise'' of conscience.  With specific regard to the religious beliefs of beneficiaries, the drafters try to salvage this amendment from the Constitutional morass that they have created. They purport to require governmental entities to provide access to an ``alternative'' service provider if an individual objects to the religious character of the service provider. Having abandoned the Constitution, the amendment now abandons reality. In a country with insufficient resources to fully treat and serve all who qualify for public services, where are these alternative service providers? We are all familiar with the long waiting lists for substance abuse treatment, just to name one area of concern. We are equally familiar with situations in many areas, both rural and urban, where there is only one realistic provider. How available can any alternative provider be in practice? Moreover, why should a qualified beneficiary have to advance a ``religious'' reason as a condition to receiving public benefits?  Unfortunately, the enactment of the ``charitable choice'' language in this amendment will result in expensive and time-consuming Constitutional litigation, bogging down the passage of its laudatory community renewal provisions.  Mr. President, I would urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment and to vote against federally supported religious discrimination.  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of my remarks be included at the appropriate place in the Record.                           amendment no. 3838
