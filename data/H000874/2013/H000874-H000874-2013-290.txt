Speaker, 7 weeks on, Americans have already begun to feel the effects of the Republican policy of sequestration.  Sequestration defies common sense and is irresponsible. It is happening because the Tea Party faction of the Republican Party is hell-bent on cutting spending, no matter what the consequences, no matter how irrationally it is done, and no matter how adverse the consequences of these cuts.  These arbitrary, across-the-board cuts to Federal programs without regard to our priorities was never meant to be a solution, but rather, a deterrent to Congress failing to reach one.                              {time}  1010  Since coming into effect on March 1, Americans are seeing why sequestration is not a policy we should follow or continue. This week, the FAA began furloughs for 47,000 employees. I've talked to the Secretary and I've talked to the Deputy Assistant Secretary. They do not have an option under the policies that this Congress has adopted. Thirteen thousand air traffic controllers are among those 47,000.  Already, delays of up to 2 hours at major airports are disrupting travel, which impacts business and produces major headaches for American families trying to get to where they need to go. Some flights have been diverted because the air traffic control system is being overwhelmed with limited personnel.  In addition to its effects on the FAA, sequestration is also placing a heavy burden on small business. According to an article in Politico on April 16--just a few days ago--small businesses are being hit the hardest by sequestration's cuts. The Small Business Administration is being forced to cut $16.7 million in loan subsidies; those are guarantees. That means $16.7 million in loans--capital--not available to small businesses. At the same time, the article goes on to report as many as 956,000 small business jobs could be at risk from sequestration as employers lay off their workers in anticipation of further cuts.  We ought to abandon this stupid policy.  Also at stake are critical research programs in medicine and science research that fuel American innovation and advance lifesaving treatments. They're at risk because of sequestration. Cuts to the National Institutes of Health are already leading to a reduction in research grants, including tens of millions of dollars that will halt innovative genomics and cancer research at some of America's top universities, including Harvard, Penn, and Johns Hopkins in my State. And the National Science Foundation will have to award 1,000 fewer grants this year to researchers who are helping keep America on top of technology and innovation. How irrational.  This is a stupid, harmful, future-hurting, and America-undercutting policy. It must be changed.  Sequestration is also reducing our military readiness and putting civilian defense employees at risk of being furloughed and, more to the point, putting at risk our own national security. Communities in my district across Maryland and throughout the country whose economies depend on a strong military are going to be hard hit.  But the good news is there is an alternative. Congress has the power to end sequestration by reaching a big and balanced solution to deficits that can replace these irrational cuts. But to do so, Democrats and Republicans will have to work together in a bipartisan way. We ought to go to conference on the budget, adopt a fiscally responsible and balanced plan, and eliminate the sequester for this year and the 8 years to come.  We offered an alternative to sequester four times in the last month, and four times we were not given the opportunity to have it voted upon on this floor. This was supposed to be open and transparent, and we would consider alternatives. We did not. But I believe we can do it. Our economy, our ability to create jobs, and the success of our country in the decade ahead is dependent on our jettisoning these irrational cuts we call sequestration.  Too many jobs, lives, and livelihoods are at stake for Congress to engage in partisan games. As the weeks and months continue without turning sequestration off, its effects will only get worse.  Let's act now. Let's act together. Let's act in a bipartisan way before our people and our businesses feel the full effects of this irrational and senseless sequestration policy. Let's work together to achieve the big, balanced solution the American people deserve from their Congress and that we owe to our country.  I will submit an article for the Record written by our colleague, Representative David Price of North Carolina, entitled: ``Lawmakers' sequestration double-talk.''              [From the Charlotte Observer, Apr. 23, 2013]                  Lawmakers' Sequestration Double-Talk                     (By U.S. Rep. David E. Price)       Double-talk is never in short supply in Washington. But as      the axe of ``sequestration''--the across-the-board spending      cuts triggered by Congress' failure to pass a long-term      budget plan--begins to fall, self-contradiction and hypocrisy      have reached heights unusual even for the Capitol.       Indeed, many of the same Congress members who welcomed      sequestration as a way to force the president to cut spending      are now protesting loudly when their pet programs feel the      pain. Members who voted for the package that Speaker John      Boehner said included ``90 percent'' of what Republicans      wanted now claim that sequestration does not need to hurt      very much and accuse the president of imposing cuts for      political effect.       The reality is that sequestration was designed to cut both      deeply and indiscriminately. Although it barely touches the      two main deficit drivers--tax expenditures and entitlement      spending--it was supposed to be sufficiently draconian and      unacceptable to     force action on those fronts, to compel agreement on a      comprehensive budget plan along the lines of the 2010 Bowles-     Simpson Commission proposal or the budget agreements that      produced four years of surpluses under President Bill      Clinton.       Congress failed to produce such a plan, however, because      Republicans refused to consider increasing revenues or      closing special-interest loopholes. Today's Republicans value      their anti-tax ideology far more than the defense cuts that      were supposed to drive them to the bargaining table. As      sequestration approached, more and more of them said, ``Bring      it on.''       Now that the cuts are coming, members are scrambling,      sometimes to apply Band-Aids, sometimes to insist that the      president spare programs they favor. One day there is an      outcry about reduced meat inspections, on another an      insistence that tuition benefits for military personnel be      restored, on another that air-traffic controllers be kept on      duty in little-used airports. The latest uproar started two      days ago. Federal Aviation Administration furloughs of air      traffic controllers at large airports kicked in, delaying      flights across the country--at Charlotte Douglas      International Airport 31.2 percent of flights were delayed.      My North Carolina colleague, Rep. Renee Ellmers, recently      introduced a bill to reverse Medicare cuts for cancer      treatment, calling the cuts an ``unintended consequence'' of      sequestration. In fact, the 2 percent cuts were an intended      and easily anticipated consequence of sequestration.       Congress has now passed appropriations bills for the      remainder of 2013, locking in place the sequestration      spending levels. Scattered provisions mitigate specific      sequestration impacts, but the result often is to shift the      cuts to equally important areas that aren't in the news at      the moment. Fort Bragg, adjacent to my district, now faces a      furlough of civilian employees and a 34 percent cut in its      operating budget. And sequestration comes on top of $1      trillion in cuts to domestic programs already adopted.      Together, these cuts have driven major disease research off a      cliff--fewer than 10 percent of proposals to fund heart      disease, cancer and diabetes research are being funded--and      slowed road and bridge construction to a snail's pace.       I want to mitigate the harm as much as any member of      Congress. But damage control is not a viable budget policy.      Sequestration is a self-inflicted wound, unworthy of those      who profess to govern. It is hypocritical and misleading,      having imposed indiscriminate cuts on the administration, to      pretend that the president can fix the problems with a flick      of the wrist.       The remedy lies in a comprehensive budget agreement that      puts revenues and all categories of spending on the table.      The president's budget reflects such an approach, going      beyond the comfort zone of many of his political allies. A      similar offer was spurned by Speaker Boehner and House      Republicans in December, and sequestration ensued. It is a      failure of historic proportions and it must be reversed.                          ____________________
