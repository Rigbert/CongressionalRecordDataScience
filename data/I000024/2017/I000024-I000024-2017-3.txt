President, there is one last thing I want to say that is on a little different subject. Today is a very special day. Today, a little girl named Kay and I got married a long time ago. These are our kids and grandkids. Today is December 19, which is our 58th wedding anniversary. I want to say to Kay: I love you.  I yield the floor.
