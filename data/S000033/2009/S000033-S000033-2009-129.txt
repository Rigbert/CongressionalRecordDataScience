 President, this amendment is cosponsored by Senator Casey, Senator Carper, and Senator Kerry. It is also supported by the National Volunteer Fire Council representing the interests of over 800,000 volunteer firefighters.  At a time when due to the economic crisis fire departments all over this country are laying off firefighters, and in rural America volunteer fire departments are finding it increasingly difficult to attract and retain those firefighters who not only help us, saving our property and our lives, but also are involved in EMS services, we are putting some of that $100 million directly into recruitment and retention for volunteer firefighting efforts. The offset is the science and technology fund, which I have nothing against, but I think the priorities now have to be for firefighting and for volunteer fire departments.  I yield 15 seconds to Senator Casey.
