President. I would like to join my colleagues in expressing my sadness and my condolences in behalf of the family of Paul Coverdell.  In the more than 3 years that I have had the privilege of serving in the Senate, he was someone who was respected for his work, for his effort, and for his sincere commitment to ensuring that all the viewpoints were heard, and that we moved forward and acted for the people of this country.  He was particularly protective, obviously, of his State of Georgia and his constituents because he felt deeply for their needs. He worked hard to achieve benefits for his constituents. He had talent, personality, and character. You could disagree with him, but he was not a disagreeable person. He was a consummate gentleman. He was polite. He was civil. He was approachable. He had those personal qualities that endeared him to all who serve in this body. He was someone respected by all of us. We all admired him.  Other colleagues have talked about his many efforts in educational policy, such as his efforts to ensure appropriate response for our military posture around the world.  I had the occasion just briefly in the last debate about Colombia to work with him and speak with him. He was committed to ensuring that our policy in that part of the world was not only consistent with our ideals as a democratic nation but also helped decisively stem the tide of drugs that has weakened this country. He did it in his typical fashion--quietly, diligently, without a lot of fanfare but with great success and great results.  We shall miss his temperament. We shall miss his commitment to this process. We shall miss his character and his contribution to the country.  To his family I offer my sincerest condolences.  I yield the floor.
