President, tomorrow the Senate will resume consideration of the children's health insurance bill. We will continue to work through the amendments to the bill.  I want to say, by way of observation, that today's proceedings in the Senate were refreshing and positive. Amendments were brought to the floor, debated, voted on, and we are moving on to more tomorrow. It is almost like the Senate of old.  We will continue to work through amendments to the bill, and I hope in the spirit of bipartisan cooperation we can complete this bill. Senators should be prepared to work on these amendments and vote throughout the day tomorrow.                          ____________________
