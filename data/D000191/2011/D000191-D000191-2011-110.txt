Speaker, I rise today to recognize a person who has made an important impact on the state of Oregon and the federal research enterprise through his work at the University of Oregon as Vice President for Research and Graduate Studies. Dr. Richard Linton is the longest serving vice president of research in the University of Oregon's history and among the longest-serving vice presidents of research within the Association of American Universities' membership.  He leaves the university after more than a decade of service. Dr. Linton's leadership has markedly improved the university's federal research enterprise, enabling university faculty and researchers to engage in discovery, innovation and scholarship that contribute to society's well-being and our understanding of our world.  Dr. Linton deserves special recognition for his guidance of sponsored programs, research initiatives, graduate education, technology transfer and the university's research park. Under his leadership, UO has seen sustained growth in federal research grants and technology transfer activities. He has guided the UO in growing and launching interdisciplinary centers and initiatives spanning the innovation cycle, from basic discovery to commercialization.  I am particularly pleased that companies directly derived from University of Oregon research currently employ more than 255 Oregonians and in 2010 generated more than$32 million in revenue for Oregon's economy. A remarkable accomplishment.  At the core of Rich Linton's decade of accomplishment at the university is his ability to be collaborative and to establish important strategic partnerships that have contributed greatly to the region's economic security and future. Thank you, Dr. Linton!                          ____________________
