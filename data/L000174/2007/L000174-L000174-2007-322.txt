It was in a package to be confirmed, I guess by unanimous consent, with the Republicans in leadership, and a Republican Senator from Kansas objected to one of the nominees, and, of course, it brought down the package.  If I understood the Senator correctly, he was worried about political actions. Was he aware--I know he was not able to make a couple recent markups of the Senate Judiciary Committee, although he is a member. Is he aware of the fact that Mr. Southwick is on the agenda for tomorrow's markup?
