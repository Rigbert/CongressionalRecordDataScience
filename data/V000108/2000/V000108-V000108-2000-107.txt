Speaker, I rise today to join several of my colleagues in condemning the actions of the Iranian government against 13 members of that nation's Jewish community. These Jews, arrested over a year ago, have been accused of spying for Israel. In Iran, a country where Jews enjoy virtually no freedoms and are under constant government scrutiny, one of the world's most effective intelligence organizations, Israel's Mossad, has allegedly chosen to use Jews to collect state secrets. Not only is this assertion preposterous, it is offensive. A shoe salesman, a candy store owner, and a 16-year-old boy, are being portrayed as agents of espionage.  Ten of the 13 have been imprisoned since their arrest last year. All have been brought before a court with no jury, in which the judge also serves as the prosecutor, to face accusations they have not heard, without the assistance of a lawyer or any contact with their families or friends. To add insult to injury, a Justice Ministry spokesman recently announced that ``only one or two'' of the 13 Jews were actually accused of espionage, the others were accused of the lesser crime of acting against national security. This after the Minister of Intelligence and Security said, in January, ``if they are condemned to hang, they will be hanged.'' As if ``one or two'' deaths were any less despicable than 13.  This would not be the first time a show trial in Iran resulted in the deaths of members of the Jewish community there. Since the Islamic revolution in 1979, 17 Jews have been executed in Iran. I say it is time for this to stop. I ask those in Iran who represent fundamental Islamic faith to recall the centuries old Islamic tradition that protects strangers in Muslim lands. I call on those in Iran who represent reason and reform to intervene and prevent a brutal outcome to this trial. And I ask all Iranians to look at the changing world and recognize that by rejecting reconciliation with Jews, they are no longer on the fore of a unified Arab front, they are lonely outsiders who will never reap the benefits of the lasting partnerships being formed in the Middle East.                          ____________________
