 As I indicated earlier, there will be no votes on Monday, April 24. However, Senators will be able to come to the floor for opening statements on the supplemental bill. We will begin consideration of the bill on Tuesday, and therefore votes will occur on Tuesday.  We also have two district judges on the calendar and may well schedule votes on them on that Tuesday as well.  I certainly wish everyone a restful and safe break.                          ____________________[Page S3404]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                                PROGRAM  Mr. McCONNELL.
