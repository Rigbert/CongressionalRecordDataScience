Speaker, I rise today to highlight a significant event in the life and times of a Toledo, Ohio institution: 2015 marks the 100th anniversary of the Toledo branch of the NAACP. The organization celebrates this milestone with a special gala on Saturday, October 24, 2015.  The Toledo Branch of the NAACP was chartered on February 2, 1915. Today, one hundred years later, it is one of the oldest continually operating branches in the country. The branch was formed by some of the leading citizens of the day including Albertus Brown--the first chapter president--Charles A. Cottrill and Della Fields. These three founders were able to grow that initial gathering to about 160 people. Since then, the Toledo NAACP branch has marched through time thanks in large part to what historian Kenneth Goings refers to as the `` `unsung heroes' of the Toledo chapter--everyday men and women who worked behind the scenes over the years to make sure the chapter would make it to its 100th birthday.''  In addition to the legion of ``unsung heroes'' the Toledo branch of the NAACP was led by several legendary leaders who served at the helm of the organization throughout the years. These leaders' names reverberate through history, still recognized today through the buildings and streets named for them. We remember their legacy and the shoulders on which the generations forward have stood through the century.  During its rich history the Toledo NAACP has been a leader in the fight for empowerment and justice for all. Its focus grew from battles against outright discrimination in the past to prosperity and ensuring the economic, educational, judicial and social equality as well as enfranchisement of all citizens.  The Toledo branch explains, its ``purpose is to serve our mission by having a relevant agenda that emphasizes career and economic development, next level entrepreneurship, political empowerment, educational excellence, health and lifestyle awareness, civil rights and youth outreach.'' Coupled with the mission and vision of the NAACP ``to ensure the political, educational, social, and economic equality of rights of all persons and to eliminate racial hatred and racial discrimination and ensure a society in which all individuals have equal rights and there is no racial hatred or racial discrimination'' the Toledo branch's 100 year history is a story of highs and lows in that journey. The organization has been at the vanguard of the events which have shaped our nation's 20th century and beyond. Today, it continues on a path toward social justice reminiscent of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King's admonition that ``Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.''  Experiencing a rebirth, the Toledo branch of the NAACP is headquartered in the city's historic Dorr Street corridor, once home to a thriving African American business district and the center of its residential communities. The corridor's own storied history marched alongside that of the NAACP in bringing prosperity to Toledo's African American families.  Former national NAACP chair Julian Bond once explained when discussing the organization, ``. . . the NAACP branches--the grassroots--kept plugging away. They kept doing what they do, and they do it well.'' For 100 years the Toledo branch of the NAACP has done it well: as a champion of humanity and hope, a beacon of light and a wellspring of truth. As we look back on a century of service, of triumph and trials, we look forward to renewed hope for the future.                          ____________________
