Yes, the intent of S. 877 is to capture all e-mail messages as that term is commonly understood. This includes e-mail messages where the domain part of the address may not be displayed. That is why the bill's definition of e-mail address, in referring to the domain part, contains the phrase ``whether or not displayed.'' We certainly do not want to create any loopholes that spammers could potentially exploit and I appreciate the opportunity to clarify this point.
