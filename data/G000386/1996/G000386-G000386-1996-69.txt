 President, I remind everybody who says that this is necessary for our national defense, to remember that U.S. News & World Report article in 1990 entitled ``Unpatriotic Profits.'' It reported how the Navy was being forced to pay U.S.-flag carriers $70,000 to ship what could have gone on foreign flags for just $6,000.  This was during the Persian Gulf war. It was because our cargo preference laws are out of control. My amendment will take care of this.  If my amendment does not pass, we will see the same abuses the next war that we face. Nothing in this bill defines fair and reasonable rates. My amendment does define what is fair and reasonable in the very same way we have defined it in the Buy America. I yield the rest of my time to the Senator from Colorado.
