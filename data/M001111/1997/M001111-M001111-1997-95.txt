 President, I rise in strong opposition to the DeWine amendment (No. 936) to the Treasury, Postal Service appropriations bill for fiscal year 1998. This amendment is nothing more than another attempt to attack basic reproductive health services for Federal employees and their dependents. This has become an annual tradition during consideration of appropriations bills.  What always surprises me about this amendment is the arguments used in defense of denying Federal employees access to the same reproductive health and choices afforded most private sector employees. We are told that this is a matter of not allowing for the use of Federal funds for abortion related services. But, this is not argument does not make sense when one considers that most Federal employees contribute to their own health insurance through premiums, deductibles, and copayments. In addition, health insurance benefits are a form of compensation for services rendered.
