President, we spend less than a quarter of our nation's education dollars to educate approximately half of our nation's students. You don't have to be a math whiz to know that the numbers just don't add up.  Thousands of rural and small schools across our nation face the daunting mission of educating almost half of America's children. Increasingly, these schools find that they are underfunded, overwhelmed, and overlooked. While half of the nation's students are educated in rural and small public schools, they only receive 23% of Federal education dollars; 25% of State education dollars; and 19% of Local education dollars.  We all grew up thinking that the three R's were Reading, Writing, and Arithmetic. Unfortunately for our rural school children, the three R's are too often run-down classrooms, insufficient resources, and really over-worked teachers.  Increasingly, Mr. President, rural and small schools are plagued by disparities connected to their geographic location and limited enrollment. To top it off, rural and small schools face shrinking local tax bases, higher transportation costs associated with the greater distance students must travel to school, and crumbling school buildings that may not have air conditioning, hot water, or roofs that do not leak.  Rural school districts and schools also find it more difficult to attract and retain qualified administrators and certified teachers. Consequently, teachers in rural schools are almost twice as likely to provide instruction in two or more subjects than their urban counterparts. Rural teachers also tend to be younger, less experienced, and receive less pay than their urban and suburban counterparts. Worse yet, rural school teachers are less likely to have the high quality professional development opportunities that current research strongly suggests all teachers desperately need.  Limited resources also mean fewer course offerings for students in rural and small schools. Consequently, courses are designed for the kids in the middle. So, students at either end of the academic spectrum miss out. Additionally, fewer rural students who dropout ever return to complete high school, and fewer rural higher school graduates go on to college.  On another note, recent research on brain development clearly shows the critical nature of early childhood education, yet rural schools are less likely to offer even kindergarten classes, let alone earlier educational opportunities. Limited resources also mean less support for teacher training, technical assistance, educational technologies, and school libraries.  To make matters worse, many of our rural areas are also plagued by persistent poverty, and, as we know, high-poverty schools have a much tougher time preparing their students to reach high standards of performance on state and national assessments. Data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress consistently show large gaps between the achievement of students in high-poverty schools and students in low-poverty schools.  Our bill would provide funding to approximately 3,400 rural and small school districts that serve 4.6 million students--a short-term infusion of funds that will allow these schools and their students to take substantial strides forward.  Local education agencies would be eligible for REDI funding if they are either ``rural'' (serve a non-metropolitan area) and have a school-age population (ages 5-17) with 20 percent or more of whom are from families with incomes below the poverty line; or ``small'' (student population of 800 or less) and a student population (ages 5-17) with 20 percent or more of whom are from families with incomes below the poverty line.  Like the Education Flexibility Act of 1999 (Ed-flex) I authored with Senator Bill Frist earlier this Congress, REDI is voluntary--states and school districts could choose to participate in the program. Both Ed-flex and REDI are designed to provide states and districts with the flexibility they need in order to use funding to deal with their local priorities.  I've heard it said that this would be the Education Congress, but we have much to do before we earn that title. Ed-flex was a good start, but it was a start, not a finish. It's time to showthat we when it comes to education, we won't leave anyone behind, and REDI will give poor, rural children a real chance. We can't afford to stop now.                          ____________________
