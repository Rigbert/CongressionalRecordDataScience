 President, as you might expect, as I so often do on the floor of the Senate, I rise to speak about agriculture because it is a very important industry in my State. The legislation that I am introducing today, with Senators Pressler and Baucus, is bipartisan in sponsorship and changes the treatment of what are referred to as the aggie bond provisions of our tax statutes. We call this the Aggie Bond Improvement Act.  This legislation is important because of the changing scene of agriculture,the inability of young farmers to get started in farming, and particularly because today the average age of farmers. In my State of Iowa, and I think in most agricultural States, farmers average in their upper fifties. In 5 to 6 years we will have 25 percent of the farmers retiring. Hence, the necessity for improving programs to encourage young people to go into farming is clear. We introduce this bill today for with this purpose in mind.  This legislation will recondition and strengthen the popular first-time farmer programs administered by various State authorities. These authorities issue tax-exempt bonds to finance first-time farmers' loans. This combined agriculture and tax legislation enjoys the company of a companion bill in the House to be introduced by my colleagues from Iowa, Congressman Lightfoot and Congressman Ganske and the remainder of the Iowa House delegation. Joining me in our efforts in the Senate, as I have already said, are Senators Pressler of South Dakota and Senator Baucus of Montana. These two Senators are very interested in the problems of agriculture. The problems in their States are similar to those in mine.  We encourage all of our colleagues in the Senate to join us as sponsors in this Aggie Bond Improvement Act. Many beginning farmers and ranchers utilize low-interest loans authorized by aggie bonds to get started in farming and ranching. With the help of State authorities, these usually younger farmers must secure a participating private lender. This is a Government-private sector partnership. This private lender assumes all of the loan risk.  A Federal law limits the use of aggie bonds for first-time farmer purchases and restricts them to a maximum of $250,000 per family, per lifetime. I know that sounds like a lot of money to people that do not understand agriculture, but with that sort of loan you create one job. We are not talking about a massive farming operation with a massive amount of hired help. It takes that much capital to create one job in agriculture because of the nature of the investment.  State laws usually impose additional restrictions in addition to those that we do in the Federal Government. They might do this from the standpoint of net worth, material participation, and residence requirements--all very legitimate requirements. Therefore, there is no risk of any misappropriation of any underlying tax benefit.  These State programs present American taxpayers with a new generation of farmers to ensure that our grocery stores continue to stock the greatest food bargains in the world. However, to fully succeed, the States need the improvements offered by this legislation.  First, cosponsors to this bill will help family members purchase the family farm by changing the current rule prohibiting aggie bond financing for family member transactions.  Senators from agriculture States know that the high startup costs for farming and the unique expertise required of farmers, cooperate to ensure that only the children and family members of present farmers can themselves become farmers. Therefore, disallowing aggie bond financing for family member transactions has operated as an unintended obstacle to the success of aggie bond programs.  Second, cosponsors to this bill will help more first-time farmers become lifetime farmers by allowing more young people to qualify for aggie bond financing. Present law disqualifies beginning farmers who have previously owned and farmed any parcel of land that is 15 percent or more of the median-size of a farm in the same county. Depending on the size of other farms in the county, many young farmers cannot utilize beginning farmer loans because of this restriction. Therefore, this legislation would qualify a beginning farmer who had previously owned and operated any farm that is no more than 30 percent of the average size of a farm in the same county. In Iowa, this means where present law disqualifies an average beginning farmer for having farmed only 35 acres, with this legislation, average beginning farmers can farm up to 100 acres and still qualify for aggie bond financing.  Having been a farmer all of my adult life, I can attest that no farmer can make a living to support even himself on 100 acres, not to mention supporting a family. These persons truly are just starting out in the farming trade and desperately need the first-time farmer's loans financed by these aggie bonds.  Mr. President, farm State Senators know the average age of farmers is increasing. Presently, our farmers in Iowa average in their late fifties. This aging trend is common in every State in this country. Last year, the Iowa Agriculture Development Authority--the authority that issues these aggie bonds in my State along with comparable agencies in about 20-some other States--issued 177 of these loans in my State, and nearly 80 percent of the applicants were under 35 years of age.  Truly, there is an aging generation of farmers still on the land who would like to retire and there is a younger generation of farmers who want to begin. This legislation to improve the State aggie bonds programs simply makes the necessary transactions possible. Seeing these possibilities, the National Counsel of State Agriculture Finance Programs, and a farming organization called Communicating for Agriculture, strongly endorse this legislation. It is also important to note that the Federal Government shoulders absolutely no financial risk in aggie bonds, and their cost, after these improvements, will be minimal.  I urge my colleagues to join me and the other cosponsors of this bill in supporting America's beginning farmers.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the legislation.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1674       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
