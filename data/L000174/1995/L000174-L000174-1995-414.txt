President, George Seldes, who died Sunday in Vermont at the age of 104, was literally, a Witness to a Century--the title of his autobiography.  A true investigative reporter who refused to accept the subtle pressures imposed upon journalists by publishers, editors, and advertisers--he was uncompromising in reporting what he saw and heard, and printed those observations in his own independent publication--In Fact.  Izzy Stone called Seldes the ``granddaddy'' of investigative reporters--high praise from another great independent journalist of our century.  My visits and frequent correspondence with George rank among the highlights of my Senate career. He never intruded, but did on occasion offer some very good advice to this senator--and most times, I was smart enough to recognize good counsel when I heard it. I had the great pleasure of joining him at his 100th birthday party in Vermont--an event that became a public celebration of his life.  Here was a man who interviewed William Jennings Bryan, Theodore Roosevelt, Eddie Rickenbacker, Generals Pershing, Patton, and MacArthur; a personal observer of Lenin and Mussolini and a confidant of Picasso, Ernest Hemingway, and Sinclair Lewis.  One of the great lives of our century has passed--but George Seldes left behind a recorded history to guide our understanding of the turbulent time.  I attach an editorial that appeared in the July 8, 1995 edition of The Burlington Free Press, and a column written by Colman McCarthy that appeared in the July 11 edition of The Washington Post.  They capture the spirit and dogged pursuit of truth that marked George Seldes' lasting contribution to journalism and the history of our age. I ask unanimous consent that they be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Burlington Free Press, July 8, 1995]                            A Contrary Voice       George Seldes, who died Sunday at 104, was a journalist and      harsh critic of mainstream journalists who might be best      remembered by Vermont newspaper editors and reporters from an      appearance before the Vermont and New Hampshire Press      Associations in the late 1980s.       Except for a slowed step and a bit of a stoop, nothing in      Seldes' appearance betrayed his exceptional age, nor hints of      any mellowing on matters he found important--beginning and      invariably ending with a journalist's responsibility to tell      it straight.       What bothered this long-time resident of Hartland Four      Corners most during his 86 years of covering historic events      was not so much what got into newspapers of his day but what      didn't--especially immediately preceding and following World      War II. Errors of omission.       It was a time when some journalists doubled as government      informers for U.S. intelligence agencies as a gesture of      patriotism; when the Washington Press Corps kept many elected      officials' personal foibles and peccadillos a secret; and      powerful publishers ran newspapers more like personal      fiefdoms in pursuit of selective causes than purveyors of the      larger truth.       Like I.F. Stone, Seldes figured if mainstream newspapers      wouldn't print what he wrote for fear of riling advertisers      or powerful news sources, he would print it in his own      publication. In Fact, it was called, and it took on, among      many powerful interests, the tobacco industry and its ability      to keep damaging health data out of newspapers--a      consequence, Seldes was never shy about charging, or      newspapers' heavy reliance on cigarette advertising.       In some cases, he was acting on tips from mainstream      reporters who knew their own papers would never print what      they'd dug up. They would leak the news to Seldes who would      print it. In other cases, In Fact became a more reliable      source of news for mainstream newspapers than their own      sources--the ultimate flattery for any newspaper person, and      ultimate indictment of those who missed the news.       In his later years, Seldes was always careful to note      improvements in the objectivity of today's newspapers--while      holding firm to the belief that when newspapers forget their      responsibility to truth, they risk retreat into those bad old      days.       Nor was his burr-under-the-saddle style without fault--his      muckraking, make-waves narrowness of vision caused him to      miss some of the bigger picture, too; a heavy dose of Seldes      at this prime could be hard for any average reader with      broader interests to take.       What seemed most striking about his comments at that      appearance in Hanover, N.H. however--just as it does now--is      the diminished capacity of contrary voices like his to be      heard today in the din of the modern information age.       Today, so many loud, contrary voices compete for listeners'      ears, with so many public outlets for spreading their views,      the problem is no longer an absence of facts, in some cases      it's too many facts--and too few people taking the time to      make sense of them.       More big-picture wisdom and few disconnected facts in every      type of media today would go a long way--a need that's grown      wider with George Seldes' passing.                                                                    ____               [From the Washington Post, July 11, 1995]                   George Seldes: Giant of Journalism                          (By Colman McCarthy)       As a traveling companion, George Seldes didn't believe in      letting you rest. In the spring of 1982 when he was 91 and in      New York to collect a George Polk Award for a lifetime of      contribution to journalism, I took the Fifth Avenue bus with      him for a 30-block ride between the ceremony and his nephew's      apartment. We would have taken a cab but he preferred the      bus: a better way to get the feel of the city and its people.       Along the jostling way, Seldes threw at me a half-dozen      story ideas, mingled with sidebars of his opinions, plus      advice on how not merely to gather facts but to cull the      useless from the useful, and then a string of mirthful      recollections from his newspapering days going back eight      decades. If we were the boys on the bus, George Seldes was      some boy.       He died on July 2, in his 104th year and only a half-decade      or so after retiring from a reporting career that began in      1909 with the Pittsburgh Leader.       It's well within the bounds of accuracy to say of Seldes--     and this isn't the kind of gassy praise that's the customary      sendoff for the deceased--that for much of the 20th century      he stood as a giant and a pilar of journalism, a reporter's      reporter. He had the subverse notion that investigating the      press--the money-saving schemings of the publishers of his      day, editors cowering before advertisers, reporters      fraternizing with the pashas they write about--should be as      vital a beat as skeptically covering politicians.       At the Polk ceremony, the citation of the awards committee      succinctly summarized the spirit of intellectual independence      Seldes committed himself to: ``By mutual agreement, George      Seldes belonged not to the journalism establishment, nor was      he tethered to any political philosophy. With a gimlet eye      ever fixed upon transgressors, he soared above the      conventions of his time--a lone eagle, unafraid and      indestructible. He is 91 now and still a pretty tough bird.''       Seldes lived in Hartland Four Corners, Vt. Until recently,      he was self-sufficient at home and ever delighted to receive      such pilgrims as Ralph Nader, Morton Mintz and Rick      Goldsmith, a California filmmaker who is completing a      documentary on Seldes's life. The film will include      references to I.F. Stone, who credited Seldes' newsletter      ``In Fact''--which had 176,000 subscribers for a time in the      1940's--as the model for his own carefully researched I.F.      Stone's Weekly.''       The titles of some of Seldes's books give a hint of the      fires that burned within him: ``You Can't Print That: The      Truth Behind the News'' (1928). ``Never Tire of Protesting''      (1986), ``Tell the Truth and Run'' (1953), ``Lords of the      Press'' (1935). In the 1980s, he wrote his memoir ``Witness      to a Century'' and edited ``The Great Thoughts,'' the latter      a thick and rich collection of ideas Seldes had gathered      throughout a lifetime of reading and listening.       ``Sometimes in isolated phrase or paragraph,'' he said of      his selections from Abelard to Zwingli and from Ability to      Zen, ``will work on the reader's imagination more forcefully      than it might when buried in a possibly difficult text. Each      time a quotation in this book makes a reader think in a new      way, I shall have achieved my aim.''       As a reporter and press critic, Seldes was more than an      iconoclastic outsider, as worthy and rare as that calling is.      His news-gathering and analysis were ethics-based. Omitting      the news is as vile a sin as slanting the news, he believed.      Too many papers avoid stories that might upset the powerful      or the majority, while printing news on safe subjects and      editorializing to bloodless conclusions.       In ``freedom of the Press,'' Seldes recalled how he was      compromised while covering World War I: ``The journals back      home that printed our stories boasted that their      correspondents had been at the fighting front. I now realize      that we were told tonight but buncombe, that we were shown      nothing of the realities of the war, that we were, in short,      merely part of the Allied propaganda machine whose purpose      was to sustain morale at all costs and help drag unwilling      America into the slaughter. . . We all more or less lied      about the war.''       If so, that was to be the last time Seldes shied from      getting the whole story. For the rest of his long life, his      reporting on what were often no-no subjects--workers' rights,      public health and safety, press sellouts, corporate and      government lies--was the essence of truth-telling. Like his      life, the telling had fullness.                               ____________________
