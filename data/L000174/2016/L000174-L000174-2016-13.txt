President, it is an honor for anyone to serve in the U.S. Senate. Giving voice to your constituents' views is a humbling responsibility. It is one thing to be called to serve; it is another to come back for a second tour of duty. Senator Dan Coats' life is one of public service, beginning with military service and culminating for now in his retirement this year from the Senate--his second tenure representing the people of Indiana.  Senator Coats has championed a number of efforts during his terms in the Senate. I am particularly grateful for his support of the National Guard and his support for our efforts to empower the National Guard within the Pentagon. Senator Coats has been a watchdog of government spending, a supporter of critical home assistance programs for low-income families such as the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, and was a supporter of our most recent efforts to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act.  Senator Coats has come a long way since his early days as a State staffer for then-Representative and future Vice President Dan Quayle. I am sure Hoosiers have not seen the last this public servant will offer. I wish him, his wife, Marsha, and their entire family the best in retirement.                          ____________________
