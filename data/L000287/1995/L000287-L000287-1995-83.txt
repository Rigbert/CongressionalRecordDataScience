Mr. Speaker, I rise today to say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle: Do not cut Medicare to pay for tax cuts for the rich.  Under some Republican plans, seniors--37 million seniors--will pay an additional $900 each year for health care. These cuts will be used to pay for tax cuts for the rich. For people who earn more than $230,000.  That is not right. That is not fair.  Medicare is the lifeline for many of our seniors.  It is time to be frank and honest with the American people. Tell them what you are doing and why. Lay all your cards on the table, face up.  Do not take health care from our senior citizens to pay for tax cuts for the rich. That is not Medicare reform. And our senior citizens will not be fooled.                          ____________________
