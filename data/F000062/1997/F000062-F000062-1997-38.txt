  First, tariff inqequities: As I said, the United States is already the most open market in the world. But our trade agreements have sometimes disadvantaged American industries by not requiring a level playing field with other nations. All too often, the price of modest tariff reductions elsewhere has been further reductions in the already low U.S. tariffs.  Any future agreements should require that other countries meet our tariff level before we agree to lower our tariffs further. Any fast-track proposal would have to address this issue before winning my support.  There should also be stronger enforcement mechanisms included when trade barriers are not lowered as provided for in an agreement. Half the problems with previous trade agreements have stemmed from nonenforcement. A recent report from the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan said more effort must be dedicated to enforcing existing agreements.  For example, Europe simply did not accept the GATT commitments on audio visual services, instead, maintaining its 1989 European Union Broadcast Directive. This EU directive limits the market for U.S. movies and TV broadcasting.  Another example is an agreement signed with China in May of this year which grants the United States access to Chinese markets for table grapes. However, despite the agreement, China maintains a 55 percent tariff on United States table grapes, presenting a significant barrier to United States exports.  Second, phytosanitary standards:  In addition to tariff inequities, disagreements over phytosanitary standards continue, and are often used as de facto trade barriers. For example: Japan's stringent tests for pesticides on American nectarines, cherries, and other fruit continues to deny market access for United States products.  Another example is Chile: The United States imported 1 billion trays of fresh vegetables from Chile during the 1996-97 growing year, while the United States exported no similar products to Chile during its growing year--why?--because of Chile's phytosanitary restrictions on imports of United States poultry, fruit, and vegetables, whichhas effectively banned all imports of these goods.  The President's fast track proposal--section 2(b)(6)(C)(iii)--states that unjustified phytosanitary restrictions should be eliminated, but there is no language requiring that scientifically based standards be established before a trade agreement can be signed.  Third, dispute resolution: The previous free trade agreement with Canada, and the NAFTA agreement, established a process for resolving disputes. But the process does not always work. For example:  California growers have complained in the past about Mexican inspectors being unavailable at the border, so shipments are delayed.  There is also no timely method of solving a dispute within a matter of hours. This is important when perishable goods are sitting at a border or a port warehouse awaiting a decision.  A bigger problem now is that if a Mexican inspector finds a pest and does not know whether that pest is subject to quarantine, it reportedly takes a week for the inspector to find out. No shipper can leave fruit sitting at the border for a week.  In January of last year, Mexico shipped over 8,000 boxes of brussels sprouts to the United States market causing the price to drop literally in half. This product dumping caused the price to drop to a level from which the brussel sprout industry could not recover during that season.  The dispute resolution process needs to be strengthened to include a mechanism for swift resolution--within 48 hours--when a dispute involves perishable commodities.  Fourth, environmental standards: I agree with many of my colleagues that we should not encourage a race to the bottom, in which the country with the weakest environmental protection wins the prize of economic growth.  We all know that pollution knows no geographic boundaries. U.S. commitment to preserving the quality of our environment should be as vigorous as our commitment to open markets, and that commitment should be reflected in our trade agreements to the greatest extent possible.  For example, large numbers of American companies have located in Mexico. The pollution from these companies goes into the New River, which flows north into the United States, terminating at the Salton Sea. I have flown over the New River, and I have seen first hand the extent of the pollution which is killing the Salton Sea. No companies in the United States can do what is being done in Mexicali.  Also, Mexican farmers have access to pesticides and other chemicals that are not available to American growers. These disparities will only increase as we enforce our own laws.  California growers will soon face an uneven playing field regarding the use of methyl bromide, a widely used soil and post-harvest fumigant. Under the Clean Air Act, the United States is phasing out the use of methyl bromide by 2001, but our trading partners will continue to use the chemical. Moreover, many of our trading partners require our growers to fumigate their crops with methyl bromide before the commodity is shipped.  U.S. requirements to control particulate matter will add costs to U.S. producers, while no comparable requirements are being imposed on many of our trading partners.  Our trade agreements should encourage our trading partners to live up to the highest environmental standards, not put added pressure on American companies to lower our standards.  Fifth, manufacturing base and labor standards: I also share the concern raised by many of my Democratic colleagues that we need to be particularly careful to protect our manufacturing base, and not undermine labor standards, as we negotiate new trade agreements.  At one point, California was home to six automobile manufacturing plants, but today we are reduced to one. Once we lose our manufacturing capacity, I am very concerned it will be very difficult if not impossible to reclaim.  Akio Morita, the chairman of Sony, made a blunt assessment of the situation: he said America will cease to be a world power if it loses its manufacturing base. I wholeheartedly agree.  Service jobs, like energy and transportation services--which have fueled much of my State's economic rebound--are important, but can't compensate for the loss of higher-wage manufacturing jobs in this country. And if we lose our manufacturing base, we lose the service jobs, technology advances, and innovation that go with it.  U.S. manufacturers already face enormous pressure to relocate manufacturing capability abroad to meet the regulatory and competitive demands of foreign nations.  The Semiconductor Industry Association, representing the makers of computers chips, says 30 percent of their investment abroad is due to chipmakers' desire to avoid high tariffs or meet a foreign government's requirement that manufacturing be done in their country, in order to sell in an otherwise closed market.  For example: China's $3 billion semiconductor market is growing rapidly. But they have a closed market, imposing high tariffs unless the manufacturer builds a plant in their country.  This is a $132 billion worldwide market and is expected to reach $245 billion market by the year 2000. California is the Nation's leading chip producing State, so this is enormously important to my State.  U.S. trade agreements must aggressively tear down the trade restrictions that force U.S. manufacturers overseas.  U.S. manufacturers often cannot compete with foreign countries on wage costs.  One of the arguments advanced by NAFTA supporters was the expansion of trade will boost the economies of our trading partners--and theoretically their wages--and expand the demand for our products in return. However, based on our NAFTA experience, the theory has not materialized.  According to the Labor Department, the wage gap between United States and Mexico workers is widening, rather than narrowing. In 1993, Mexican wages were 15 percent of those in the United States. Today, they are 8 percent.  This decline in wages is not solely the effect of the Mexican peso crisis. In 1994--before the peso collapse--real hourly wages in Mexico had already dropped to nearly 30 percent below their 1980 level--UC-Berkeley sociologist Harley Shaiken.  Mexico's financial problems only exacerbated the trend. Since 1994, real wages in Mexico have dropped another 25 percent to roughly half their 1980 level.  Clearly, NAFTA has not yet improved the wages of Mexican labor.  Conclusion: Any fast track legislation must contain the following assurances:  There must be a mechanism for swift and effective dispute resolutions.  There must be language included stipulating that any agreement negotiated under fast track must set equal tariffs between the United States and our trading partners before the United States agrees to lower tariffs further.  There must be mandatory mutual acceptance of scientifically-sound phytosanitary standards.  There must be enforceable environmental standards in place.  And there must be labor and wage provisions, and aggressive reduction of trade barriers, to protect our manufacturing future.  Without these assurances written into the bill, I am very concerned that extension of fast track authority would give away, once again, the only ability I have as a U.S. Senator to influence trade agreements to see that they are responsive to the concerns of my State and important industries.  Until these concerns are addressed, Mr. President, I must oppose any extension of fast-track authority.                          ____________________
