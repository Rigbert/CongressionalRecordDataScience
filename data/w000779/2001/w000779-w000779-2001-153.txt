President, today I am introducing legislation to provide enforceable consumer protections for airline passengers. The bill I introduce today is the result of a process that started over two years ago, when I first introduced bipartisan passenger rightslegislation. Instead of enacting that legislation, Congress decided to give the airlines a year-and-a-half to improve customer service through voluntary plans. At the end of that time, the Department of Transportation Inspector General was to report to Congress on the airlines' progress.  The Inspector General released his report last month. It is a carefully researched and balanced document, and it finds that, while the airlines have made progress in some areas, there are also significant continued shortcomings. In particular, in many cases passengers are still not receiving reliable and timely communications about flight delays, cancellations, and diversions. The report recommends a number of specific, reasonable steps that could be taken to improve the experience of the flying public.  I want to commend the chairman of the Commerce Committee, Senator McCain, and Senators Hollings and Hutchison, for the bill they have introduced, which reflects the essence of the Inspector General's report. My bill is intended to complement and further the discussion that legislation has begun.  My legislation closely tracks the findings and recommendations of the Inspector General's report. First, it features ``right-to-know'' provisions that require airlines to tell customers when a flight they are about to book a ticket on is chronically delayed or canceled, and to provide better information about overbooking, frequent flyer programs, and lost baggage. The bill also contains provisions to enhance and improve the enforcement of the airlines' customer service commitments, such as requirement that each airline incorporate its commitments into its binding contract of carriage. Finally, the bill calls on the Secretary of Transportation to review existing regulations to make sure airlines adhere to their commitments, and to encourage the establishment of a baseline standard of service for all airlines.  The provisions of this bill are not radical, nor are they regulatory; they are basic reasonable steps based directly on the specific findings and recommendations of the Inspector General. Most importantly, they would create meaningful, enforceable protections for consumers in the areas where the Inspector General has identified ongoing problems.  I am hopeful that my colleagues here in the Senate will join me in supporting this legislation, and I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 483       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Fair Treatment of Airline      Passengers Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       The Congress finds the following:       (1) United States airline traffic is increasing. The number      of domestic passengers carried by United States air carriers      has nearly tripled since 1978, to over 660 million annually.      The number is expected to grow to more than 1 billion by      2010. The number of domestic flights has been steadily      increasing as well.       (2) The Inspector General of the Department of      Transporation has found that with this growth in traffic have      come increases in delays, cancellations, and customer      dissatisfaction with air carrier service.       (A) The Federal Aviation Administration has reported that,      between 1995 and 2000, delays increased 90 percent and      cancellations increased 104 percent. In 2000, over 1 in 4      flights were delayed, canceled, or diverted, affecting      approximately 163 million passengers.       (B) At the 30 largest United States airports, the number of      flights with taxi-out times of 1 hour or more increased 165      percent between 1995 and 2000. The number of flights with      taxi-out times of 4 hours or more increased 341 percent      during the same period.       (C) Certain flights, particularly those scheduled during      peak periods at the nation's busiest airports, are subject to      chronic delays. In December, 2000, 626 regularly-scheduled      flights arrived late 70 percent of the time or more, as      reported by the Department of Transportation.       (D) Consumer complaints filed with the Department of      Transportation about airline travel have nearly quadrupled      since 1995. The Department of Transportation Inspector      General has estimated that air carriers receive between 100      and 400 complaints for every complaint filed with the      Department of Transportation.       (3) At the same time as the number of complaints about      airline travel has increased, the resources devoted to      Department of Transportation handling of such complaints have      declined sharply. The Department of Transportation Inspector      General has reported that the staffing of the Department of      Transportation office responsible for handling airline      customer service complaints declined from 40 in 1985 to just      17 in 2000.       (4) In June, 1999, the Air Transport Association and its      member airlines agreed to an Airline Customer Service      Commitment designed to address mounting consumer      dissatisfaction and improve customer service in the industry.       (5) The Department of Transportation Inspector General has      reviewed the airlines' implementation of the Airline Customer      Service Commitment. The Inspector General found that:       (A) The Airline Customer Service Commitment has prompted      air carriers to address consumer concerns in many areas,      resulting in positive changes in how air travelers are      treated.       (B) Despite this progress, there continue to be significant      shortfalls in reliable and timely communication with      passengers about flight delays and cancellations. Reports to      passengers about flight status are frequently untimely,      incomplete, or unreliable.       (C) Air carriers need to do more, in the areas under their      control, to reduce over-scheduling, the number of      chronically-late or canceled flights, and the amount of      checked baggage that does not show up with the passenger upon      arrival.       (D) A number of further steps could be taken to improve the      effectiveness and enforceability of the Airline Customer      Service Commitment and to improve the consumer protections      available to commercial air passengers.

The      information reported shall include--       ``(1) the percentage of successful redemptions of requested      frequent flyer awards for free tickets or class-of-service      upgrades for the air carrier;       ``(2) the percentage of successful redemptions of requested      frequent flyer awards for free tickets or class-of-service      upgrades for each flight in the air carrier's top 100      origination and destination markets; and       ``(3) the percentage of seats available for frequent flyer      awards on each flight in its top 100 origination and      destination markets.       ``(g) Overbooking.--       ``(1) Oversold flight disclosure.--An air carrier shall      inform a ticketed passenger, upon request, whether the flight      on which the passenger is ticketed is oversold.       ``(2) Bumping compensation information.--An air carrier      shall inform passengers on a flight what the air carrier will      pay passengers involuntarily denied boarding before making      offers to passengers to induce them voluntarily to relinquish      seats.       ``(3) Disclosure of bumping policy.--An air carrier shall      disclose, both on its Internet website, if any, and on its      ticket jackets, its criteria for determining which passengers      will be involuntarily denied boarding on an oversold flight      and its procedures for offering compensation to passengers      voluntarily or involuntarily denied boarding on an oversold      flight.       ``(h) Mishandled Baggage Reporting.--Within 6 months after      the date of enactment of the Fair Treatment of Airline      Passengers Act, each air carrier shall revise its reporting      for mishandled baggage to show--       ``(1) the percentage of checked baggage that is mishandled      during a reporting period;       ``(2) the number of mishandled bags during a reporting      period; and       ``(3) the average length of time between the receipt of a      passenger's claim for missing baggage and the delivery of the      bag to the passenger.       ``(i) Small Air Carrier Exception.--This section does not      apply to an air carrier that operates no civil aircraft      designed to have a maximum passenger seating capacity of more      than 30 passengers.     ``Sec.  41723.
