Speaker, it is my distinct pleasure to stand before you today to recognize and commend the members of the Gary, Indiana, branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). On Saturday, June 2, 2012, the Gary NAACP will hold its 47th Annual Life Membership Banquet at the Genesis Convention Center in Gary, Indiana.  This annual event is a major fundraiser for the Gary NAACP. The funds generated through this event directly support the organization's many outstanding programs and advocacy efforts. Through its membership and the support of the community, the Gary NAACP is able to serve the people of Northwest Indiana and continue the mission started by the national organization in 1909 by working diligently to combat injustice, discrimination, and unfair treatment for all people in today's society. In addition, the banquet serves to update and keep the community aware of the NAACP's activities and formally honor its new life members.  The keynote speaker at this year's event will be Reverend Dr. Michael Eric Dyson. Dr. Dyson is a Georgetown University professor of sociology and a political analyst for MSNBC. Dr. Dyson has been able to positively influence the lives of numerous individuals through his remarkable career and his noteworthy dedication to charitable endeavors. In addition to his outstanding professional career, Dr. Dyson is well-known as a social activist, renowned orator, and prophetic preacher.  This year, the Gary NAACP will honor twelve outstanding individuals from Northwest Indiana who will join the hundreds of other outstanding civil, community, and religious leaders that have previously been recognized as life members. For 2012, the distinguished individuals who will be inducted as life members of the Gary NAACP are: Indiana Supreme Court Justice Robert Rucker, Dr. Judy Ball, Shontrai Irving, Esq., Gage Brown, Kamden Brown, Shante Brown, Zachery Brown, Stephen Mays, Dr. Linda Peterson, Renee Ceaser-Patterson, Kennedy Winfrey, and Kya Winfrey.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in paying tribute to the newest life members of the Gary branch of the NAACP, as well as Attorney Karen Pulliam, the current Gary NAACP president, and all members of the organization for their extraordinary efforts and for their tremendous leadership. These outstanding men and women have worked tirelessly to improve the quality of life for all residents of Indiana's First Congressional District, and for that they are to be commended.                          ____________________
