This whole concept, the underlying philosophy that you will hear from President Bush and Senator McCain with his support, is the notion of the ownership society which, to put it in shorthand, means: Just remember, we are all in this alone. They believe when it comes to at least the issue of Social Security, it would be preferable to divert money from current benefits and to put it in the stock market. That was the notion supported by John McCain and President Bush which the American people rejected. It is my understanding as well that Senator McCain has taken this ownership society idea to the notion of health insurance too, that they would penalize employers that provide health insurance and give people a tax break to go out into the market and go shopping for their own health insurance policies.  I ask the Senator if he has any reaction to the notion of individuals and families shopping for health insurance, not as part of some pool where they work but on an individual family basis.
