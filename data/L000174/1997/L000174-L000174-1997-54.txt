President, I submit for the Record a joint statement by myself and Senator Jeffords on the retirement of Dr. Harriett G. Jenkins.  The statement follows:Joint Statement by Senator Patrick Leahy and Senator James Jeffords on                the Retirement of Dr. Harriett G. Jenkins       On September 30, 1997, Dr. Harriett G. Jenkins officially      retired after twenty-five years of service in the executive      and legislative branches of our government. Her outstanding      contributions in the field of education, at the National      Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the Office of      Senate Fair Employment Practices, the Senate Committees on      Agriculture, Labor, and Judiciary, and at the U.S. Equal      Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) have won her the      respect and admiration of everyone who has been privileged to      work with her. Her impressive career in public service      spanned 19 years as a public school educator in Berkeley,      California, and carried through her most recent and superior      performance as Special Assistant to Commissioner Reginald      Jones of the EEOC. In appreciation of her outstanding      service, we want to recognize her many achievements.       Dr. Jenkins was born in Fort Worth, Texas, and received a      Bachelor of Arts Degree in Mathematics from Fisk University      in Nashville, Tennessee. She earned a Master of Arts Degree      in Education and a Doctorate of Education in Policy, Planning      and Administration, both from the University of California at      Berkeley. She completed the Advanced Management Program of      the Harvard Business School; obtained a law degree from      Georgetown University, Washington, D.C., and was awarded an      Honorary Doctorate of Science Degree from Fisk University.       Dr. Jenkins began her career as a public school educator in      Berkeley, California, and rose through the ranks to become      vice-principal, principal, and Director of Elementary      Education before reaching the post of Assistant      Superintendent for Instruction in 1971. She assisted with the      integration of the school system, fully involving parents and      the community, and with the implementation of many exemplary      educational programs. In 1973, Dr. Jenkins moved to      Washington, D.C., accepting the position of consultant to the      District of Columbia school system for the Response to      Educational Needs Project.       In 1974, Dr. Jenkins joined the staff at NASA. She served      for eighteen years as Assistant Administrator for Equal      Opportunity Programs at NASA. She helped NASA integrate its      workforce and ensure equal opportunity in personnel      transactions. During this period, she helped initiate a      significant increase in the number of female and minority      employees, particularly in the non-traditional positions of      engineers, scientists and astronauts. She also assisted with      the expansion of educational programs and scientific research      for minority universities.       In 1992, Harriett Jenkins was chosen by the Majority and      Minority Leaders and appointed by the President pro tempore      of the United States Senate to be the first Director of the      newly established Office of Senate Fair Employment Practice.      In 1996-1997, she served as counsel and professional staff      member on the Senate Committees on Agriculture, Forestry and      Nutrition, Labor and Human Resources, and Judiciary. In June,      1997, she was appointed as Special Assistant to Commissioner      Reginald Jones of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity      Commission until her retirement on September 30, 1997. In      this position, she made critical contributions to the report      of the EEOC task force on the ``Best'' Equal Employment      Opportunity Policies, Programs and Practices in the Private      Sector.       Dr. Jenkins has received numerous awards throughout her      prestigious career. In 1977, Dr. Jenkins received NASA's      highest award, the Distinguished Service Medal. Also during      1977, she chaired the Task Force on Equal Opportunity and      Affirmative Action, one of nine task forces of the Personnel      Management Project which led to the Civil Service Reform Act.      For this work, she received the Civil Service Commissioner's      Award for Distinguished Service. Dr. Jenkins received the      President's Meritorious Executive Award in 1980; NASA's      Outstanding Leadership Medal in 1981; and the President's      Distinguished Executive Award in 1983.       In 1986, Dr. Jenkins was elected to the National Academy of      Public Administration; and in 1987, she received the Black      Engineer of the Year Award for Affirmative Action. In 1988,      she received a second Distinguished Service Medal from NASA;      in 1990, the Women in Aerospace Lifetime Achievement Award;      in 1992, NASA's Equal Employment Opportunity Medal, and the      President's Meritorious Executive Award; and in 1994, NASA's      Equal Employment Opportunity Medal. In September, 1997, she      was awarded a citation by the EEOC for her distinguished      service to the Task Force on the ``Best'' Equal Employment      Opportunity Policies, Programs and Practices in the Private      Sector.       Integrity, intelligence, and commitment to doing the best      job possible are characteristics that describe Dr. Jenkins.      She has worked tirelessly to advance the goals of protecting      the American worker from discrimination in the workplace and      tear down the barriers preventing women and minorities from      reaching full employment potential.       Dr. Jenkins is leaving government service, but her legacy      of dedication to fairness and equality in the workplace will      enrich and enlighten workers for generations to come. We      personally want to thank Dr. Jenkins for her long career in      government service as a friend and advisor and wish her the      very best in her retirement years.                          ____________________
