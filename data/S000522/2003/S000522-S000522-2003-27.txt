Mr. Speaker, I rise with my colleagues today in support of one of the most courageous men of peace on the planet today, an advocate for freedom, Dr. Oscar Biscet. A long-time human rights activist and pro-life doctor in Cuba, Dr. Biscet had already spent some 3 years, unjustly, 3 years in Castro's gulag for speaking out against the death penalty in Cuba and for calling for the release of all political prisoners.  After his release, Mr. Speaker, in the fall of 2002, he remained undaunted by his oppressors, Castro and the brutal thugs who run his regime, and continued to attempt to peacefully organize human rights' supporters. Dr. Biscet was redetained with 16 other dissidents after they attempted to simply meet in a home in Havana to discuss human rights last September. Just think about that, my colleagues, just simply meeting, gathering together, and in come the thugs to take you away.  When police prevented him from entering that home, Dr. Biscet and others, just like Dr. Martin Luther King, sat down in the street and protested, uttering slogans like ``long live human rights,'' and ``freedom for political prisoners.'' For that, he received a draconian 25-year prison sentence in April. That was during the same time when there was a massive crackdown that Amnesty International pointed out, reminiscent of what happened during the early years of Castro's brutal regime when massive numbers of people were arrested and given long prison sentences, many of those, 75 of them, some of the bravest and brightest in Cuba today: Independent journalists and democracy activists, who now themselves languishing in prison.  Mr. Speaker, while reports of Dr. Biscet's actions in prison continue to be heroic, and the word does get out, this is a man of conscience, a man of courage, the reports of his mistreatment, however, have been equally horrific. He is heroic; the mistreatment is horrific. For months, we know that he has endured solitary confinement for refusing to wear the prisoner's uniform. He has lived with insufficient light, and now no light at all, no running water and no bed. His benign and peaceful protest on November 11 on behalf of the cruel treatment of another prisoner, even though he is suffering so much, Mr. Speaker, he speaks out and tries to lend a hand to other prisoners who are being mistreated, for that he was moved to a punishment cell, as my colleagues have pointed out, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Lincoln Diaz-Balart), who spoke so eloquently a moment ago, to a cell known as the dungeon.  This man, this peaceful man, this Martin Luther King of Cuba is now languishing in a dungeon, a small confined area with no light. He has been put into a prison cell, this dungeon, with a man who on 12 different occasions has committed assault.  I remember during the years of Nicolae Ceausescu, the brutal thug inRomania, what he used to do. He would put people who committed crimes in with peaceful activists, political prisoners, and political prisoners of conscience with the hope and the thought that these men of violence would commit violence against these peaceful activists, and God forbid that that happens. We will continue to speak out, and, hopefully, nothing will happen as a result of this emplacement of this thug in with Dr. Biscet.  Let me just point out to my colleagues that in the spring Dr. Biscet, and this just shows the heart of this great man, stated ``I am innocent of the charges for which I was condemned, which is why I will maintain my ideological position. A true man cannot betray himself, so I can only appeal to the living God and pray to our Lord. And he is not neutral and never abandons his flock.'' What a faith. Here is a man crying out from prison, praying to God above, asking that he not be forgotten in a way that is reminiscent of our Lord when he said, why have I been abandoned? Well, in this case he is saying despite his ordeal that God will not abandon him.  Mr. Speaker, we cannot abandon him, and that is why we are speaking out and speaking out so strongly tonight. We cannot allow this prisoner of conscience, and there are hundreds, as the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Lincoln Diaz-Balart) said so ably earlier, hundreds who live likewise in Castro's gulag. His wife, Elsa Morejon, has said his crimes are honoring the universal declaration of human rights: Opposing abortion and the death penalty and organizing civil rights movements through nonviolent civil disobedience to reclaim the rights of fellow Cubans that he believes are being violated. For that, 25 years being mistreated and being treated in a way that we would not even treat our animals.  Let me just conclude, Mr. Speaker. After months of brutal treatment, his health is very poor. We have to speak out. There are Members who take to the floor here and say we need to have an expansion of travel and trade and the like. Well, not until these individuals, starting with Dr. Biscet, are released. Otherwise, the blame and the crime of complicity rests at your doorstep.                          ____________________
