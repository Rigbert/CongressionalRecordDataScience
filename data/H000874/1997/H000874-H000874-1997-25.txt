I came to the floor and I heard the gentleman from Washington [Mr. White] speak about Joel Pritchard. I had not heard that he died.  Madam Speaker, I had the opportunity to serve with Joel Pritchard. He was a Representative, as has been said, of great integrity and great substance, a very decent human being who believed that partisanship came long after principle. He was a delight to serve with, and I am sorry to hear that he has passed away.  But as I will say about John Sturdivant, Joel Pritchard was someone who made this House a better place because of his service.  Madam Speaker, I rise to speak about a very good friend of mine, John Sturdivant, president of the American Federation of Government Employees. John Sturdivant died just a few days ago of cancer. I had the opportunity to talk to him about 3 our 4 days prior to his death. Even at that time, he was talking about his beloved members of the American Federation of Government Employees, was talking about how he could fight for and work for ensuring that they had an opportunity to earn sufficient funds to create for themselves a decent life and to provide well for their families, their husbands, their wives, their children.  Madam Speaker, his death leaves not only the American Federation of Government Employees, not only government employees generally, but our Nation bereft of an individual who fought tirelessly on behalf of our Nation's civil servants and on behalf of efficiency and effectiveness in our government.  As president of AFGE, John Sturdivant represented over 700,000 workers throughout the United States during one of the most difficult periods facing civil servants in this country's history. He was deeply committed, Madam Speaker, to the belief that today's civil servants constitute the answer, not the problem, to making our Government operate more smoothly and efficiently. The thousands of workers he spoke for could not have had a more committed, more knowledgeable, more passionate advocate of their interests.  Madam Speaker, I knew John Sturdivant well. He was my friend. He worked very hard to shift public opinion of civil servants from the incorrect perception of inactivity and nonperformance to the truth of a dynamic and hard-working national resource.  Madam Speaker, I will be speaking at John Sturdivant's funeral next week, and I will remember him as a good human being, as an American who cared about his country, as a person who utilized his talent to the fullest, not simply for himself or for profit or for gain, personal gain, but for the welfare of the country he loved and the welfare of his members.  He was at times a person of great passion and even anger, but that anger and passion was directed at correcting and righting wrongs that he perceived.  I know that he dealt with the President, with the Vice President, and with so many of us in the Congress of the United States as an advocate of policies that would reward our personnel based upon their effort and their talent and their accomplishments.  He will be difficult for AFGE to replace. He will, like all of us, be replaced. None of us are indispensable. But all of us hopefully can be remembered as making a special contribution, a contribution of significant worth, a contribution emanating from a sense of our country's needs and the needs of our fellow men and women.  Madam Speaker, I thank you for this time to remember a good and decent American, John Sturdivant, President of the American Federation of Government Employees.                          ____________________
