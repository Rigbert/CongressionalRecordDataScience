 First settled in 1829 upon the Kalamazoo River, the city's namesake, the city was incorporated in 1885, midway between Detroit and Chicago.  Over the past 125 years, Kalamazoo has made a name for itself as a pioneer in the health sciences, industry, and higher education. The city is the birthplace of many classic American icons, such as Gibson Guitars, Shakespeare fishing rods, and Checker taxi cabs. As a leader in the medical field, Kalamazoo is also home to the Upjohn Company, the longtime pharmaceutical manufacturer, and Stryker Corporation, a global leader in the development of medical implants, equipment, and technologies. While many changes have come to the region over the years, hard work and innovation remain hallmarks of the local economy.  More recently, Kalamazoo attracted national recognition for the groundbreaking ``Kalamazoo Promise,'' a pledge made by a group of anonymous area donors to pay the tuition for graduates of Kalamazoo's public schools to attend any of the state's public colleges or universities. This philanthropic model has since been adopted in states across the country with great success.  Kalamazoo is home to Western Michigan University, the fourth largest higher education institution in our state as well as Kalamazoo College, one of the nation's oldest and most respected higher education institutions dedicated to the liberal arts. Kalamazoo Valley Community College has distinguished itself as a national leader in the development of alternative energy and other important technologies.  Over the years, Kalamazoo has also earned a reputation as a community passionately dedicated to the arts, a reflection of its cultural diversity and exceptional level of community engagement. Kalamazoo has also produced and attracted its share of national celebrities, including New York Yankees' Derek Jeter, Green Bay Packers' Greg Jennings, Seattle Seahawks' T.J. Duckett, and American Idol favorite Matt Giraud.  Despite the great economic challenges faced by our state, the people of Kalamazoo have continued to work together, as they always have, for the benefit of their entire community. This has been the secret to the city's long success and an example for other communities to replicate.  Again, it is my honor to stand today in recognition of the City of Kalamazoo for its rich 125 year history. Here is to the next 125 years.                          ____________________
