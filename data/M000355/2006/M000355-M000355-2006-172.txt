 President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate immediately proceed to executive session to consider the following nominations on today's Executive Calendar: Calendar No. 893; provided further that the Foreign Relations Committee be discharged from consideration of the following nominations and that the Senate proceed to those en bloc: Senator Coleman (PN2044) and Senator Boxer (PN2043).  I further ask unanimous consent that the nominations be confirmed en bloc, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate then return to legislative session.
