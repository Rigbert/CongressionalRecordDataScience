  Mr. Speaker, a moment ago the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Portman) indicated that his legislation deals with the fact that millions of workers have seen reductions in the pensions promised to them by companies converting from defined benefits to cash balance payments. I wonder if the gentleman from Ohio can be specific and tell those millions of workers who were double-crossed by large companies like IBM how his legislation is going to improve their situation.
