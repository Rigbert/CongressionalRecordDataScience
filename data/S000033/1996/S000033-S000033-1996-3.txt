 Speaker, let us be frank. Exxon, Ford, Citibank, and DuPont are profitable multibillion dollar corporations who pay their CEO's millions of dollars in salary. These companies do not need OPIC corporate welfare payments from the taxpayers of this country to provide them with incentives to invest abroad. Incentives to invest abroad.  At a time when some Members of this body are proposing huge cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, education, veterans programs, environmental protection, it is totally absurd to increase the amount of corporate welfare that we provide to these huge profitable corporations.  Not only is this a bad deal for taxpayers, it is bad economic development and job creation. Many of these same corporations are downsizing, laying off hundreds of thousands of American workers. Our policy should not be to encourage these companies to invest abroad, our policy should be to demand that these companies reinvest in the United States of America, in the State of Vermont, all over this country, and create decent paying jobs here.  Let us vote no on this OPIC corporate welfare program.                          ____________________
