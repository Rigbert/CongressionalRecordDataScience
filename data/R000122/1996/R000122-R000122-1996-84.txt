Speaker, I rise today to submit for the Record a letter from Wendy Sherman, Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs at the State Department, in response to my concerns regarding Hmong refugees in Thailand. I am pleased that the State Department has made progress with the Royal Thai Government in gaining access to Hmong refugees. On behalf of the Hmong community in Rhode Island, I will continue to monitor this important issue.         U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Population, Refugees,            and Migration,                                 Washington, DC, January 22, 1996.     Hon. Jack Reed,     House of Representatives       Dear Mr. Reed: Thank you for your letter of November 28,      1995 regarding your concerns for Hmong refugees in Thailand.       First, let me assure you that we share your concern for      this special population. Since      1975, we have resettled approximately 249,000 Lao refugees (mostly      Hmong) out of Thailand. We have provided a large share of the      support that the Office of the United Nations High      Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has received to maintain      refugee camps and we and non-governmental organizations      assist programs in Laos for refugees who have elected to      return home. With only some 6,000 Lao refugees remaining in      camps in Thailand we are committed to these same two      solutions: voluntary repatriation and third country      resettlement.       As you state in your letter, we have for some time      requested permission of the Royal Thai Government to be      allowed to interview those remaining Hmong and other Lao      refugees in camps in Thailand who may wish to resettle in the      United States. In November, a team of officers led by      Department of State Deputy Assistant Secretary Charles Sykes      went to Bangkok specifically to discuss this issue. I am      pleased to report that we reached an agreement in principle      with the Royal Thai Government for U.S. access to Hmong and      other Lao in the first asylum camps in Thailand. We are now      working to finalize the agreement and hope to begin      processing this population in early January. Within the FY      1996 refugee admissions ceiling there are sufficient numbers      available for approved Laotian cases to be admitted to the      U.S. this fiscal year.       We would also like to assure you that, contrary to reports,      to date, no asylum seekers or refugees have been forced to      return to Laos. Approxiamtely 23,000 Lao (mostly Hmong) have      returned voluntarily to Laos since 1980. From all reprots,      including nongovernmental organizations working in Laos and      from U.N. officials, there is no persecution of returnees.      The United States and other governments contribute to      reintegra-      tion programs which assist returnees to resettle in Laos.      UNHCR has Hmong- and Lao-speaking monitors who travel      throughout the country to assist returnees and to monitor      their situation. These monitors have reported no persecution      of returnees.       We hope that the above information addresses your concerns.      Please do not hesitate to contact this office again if we can      be of further assistance.           Sincerely,                                                    Wendy Sherman,     Assistant Secretary, Legislative Affairs.                          ____________________
