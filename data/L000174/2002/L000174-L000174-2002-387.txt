 I had the privilege of attending the economic summit in New York City this weekend. I saw the distinguished Presiding Officer on several occasions. In fact, I was beginning to think that somehow she had been cloned because she was attending and speaking and was involved in so many different events.  I know the economic summit came to New York City as a gesture of solidarity with the city after the terrible events of last fall. They came there knowing that not only would they bring people from around the world as well as from our own country, but they would bring the press from around the world to show the world that New York City is open, and New York City is in a position to handle, as it always has, any group of any size for any purpose. I want to say that New York City did.  I was extraordinarily impressed with the level of everything from communications, certainly to law enforcement--New York's finest was there--to the continuing work at ground zero. My wife and I and our daughter visited to see again the work that continues by these brave men and women from the New York Fire Department, who are still working there. The police department is still working there, and other agencies as well as volunteers.  I was gratified to see while we were there a number of foreign visitors going to ground zero. Anybody has to be moved just reading the notes that have been left there by family members. While we were there, foreign delegations were laying wreaths and paying homage.  The point, though, is that New York City reflects, really, what is best in America. We have seen a major city of commerce, of education, of entertainment, and of history badly damaged that came right back, and was able to demonstrate that to the rest of the world.  As one coming from the State of Vermont, I sometimes hear regional accents at their best when I go to New York City. I am sure that New Yorkers feel the same way when they come to Vermont. But the accent I heard was one of hope, of excitement, of all the best things that are reflected by that city.  I commend not only the two Senators, my two friends from New York, but everybody--from the mayor to the Governor, and everyone who has worked so hard on this. New York City is open for business, as it was for some members of the Leahy family. It was a pleasure to be there.                          ____________________
