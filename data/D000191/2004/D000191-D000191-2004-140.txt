Speaker, if the gentleman would yield, do not forget the farmers and ranchers. I had some cattlemen come to my town hall last week who say, hey, we are next. Not only was Canada a huge threat to our industry and not only are they bringing in stuff that might kill the American people with mad cow disease, but the so-called free trade agreement with Australia, Argentina, other target countries in CAFTA, that is going to kill off the U.S. agriculture people. So we will import the beef that will be probably ground up overseas because that is value added, but then when the frozen patties get here, we will still manufacture them into a finished device which is, i.e., a Big Mac or a Whopper, we do not want to shortchange Burger King here and/or whatever you want to call it, and somehow we will prosper as a Nation by doing this.  I thank the gentleman.
