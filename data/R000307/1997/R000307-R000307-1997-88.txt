And second, who is going to enforce all this? We are going to need a SWAT team down at the Federal Election Commission.  Mr. McCONNELL. If I may say to my friend, I often say the FEC would soon be the size of the rest of the administration. There would be battalions of auditors and lawyers crawling all over the books, not just of candidates for public office but every organized group out in America seeking to express itself in the course of the campaign. They would be crawling all over them. Let some little group in Kansas utter a peep in the next race against Senator Roberts, and the FEC could come down on them like a house of bricks saying, ``Shut up. Congress has said you don't get to speak. You don't get to say how you feel in the election--or any other time. Shut up.''  All of that is possible under this amendment, to amend the first amendment for the first time in history, to give this Congress the power to quiet the voices; quiet the voices, not just of Members of Congress and the people who may oppose them, but anybody else who may oppose it, any individual, any group, anybody. We could shut them all up. And in what way would America be better for that?
