 President, today, April 24th, marks the 82nd anniversary of the beginning of the Armenian Genocide. I rise today to acknowledge and commemorate this terrible chapter in history, to help ensure that it will never be forgotten.  Eighty-two years ago today, one of the darkest chapters in human history began. On April 24, 1915, Ottoman authorities began arresting Armenian political and religious leaders throughout Anatolia. Over the ensuing months and years, some 1.5 million Armenians were killed at the hands of the Ottoman authorities, and hundreds of thousands more were exiled from their homes.  On this 82nd anniversary of the Armenian Genocide, let us renew our commitment never to forget the horror and barbarism of this event.  We must remember, we must speak out, and we must teach the next generation about the systematic persecution and murder of millions of Armenians by the Ottoman government. I know that I am joined by every one of my colleagues, by the Armenian-American community, and by people across the United States in commemorating the Genocide and paying tribute to the victims of this crime against humanity.  As Americans, we are blessed with freedom and security, but that blessing brings with it an important responsibility. We must never allow oppression and persecution to pass without notice or condemnation.  By commemorating the Armenian Genocide, we renew our commitment always to fight for human dignity and freedom, and we send out a message that the world can never allow genocide to be perpetrated again.  Even as we remember the tragedy and honor the dead, we also honor the living. Out of the ashes of their history, Armenians all across the world have clung to their identity and have prospered in new communities. My state of California is fortunate to be home to a community of Armenian-Americans a half-a-million strong. They are a strong and vibrant community whose members participate in every aspect of civic life, and California is the richer for their presence.  The strength and perseverance of the Armenian people is a triumph of the human spirit, which refuses to cede victory to evil. The best retort to the perpetrators of oppression and destruction is rebirth, renewal, and rebuilding. Armenians throughout the world have done just that, and today they do it in their homeland as well. A free and independent Armenia stands today as a living monument to the resilience of a people. I am proud that the United States, through our friendship and assistance, is contributing to the rebuilding and renewal of Armenia.  Let us never forget the victims of the Armenian Genocide; let their deaths not be in vain. We must remember their tragedy to ensure that such crimes can never be repeated. And as we remember Armenia's dark past, we can take some consolation in the knowledge that its future is bright with possibility.                          ____________________
