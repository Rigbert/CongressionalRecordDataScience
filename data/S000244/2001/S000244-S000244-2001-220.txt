Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.  With all due respect to my friend, the gentleman from California (Mr. Horn), I do not think the gentleman has read the bill and I do not think he has been listening to the debate.  This bill does not stop scientific research. This bill does not stop stem cell research. This bill stops research in destruction of cloned embryonic stem cells, no other stem cells whatsoever.  I do not think Dr. Salk used cloned material when he developed the polio vaccine. Nobody even thought of cloning 45, 50 years ago when Dr. Salk was using his research.  Please, let us talk about what is in the bill and what is in the Greenwood substitute, rather than bringing up issues that are completely irrelevant to both.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Stupak), the coauthor of the bill.
