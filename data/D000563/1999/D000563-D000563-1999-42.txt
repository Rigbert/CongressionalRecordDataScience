President, on Friday, November 12, a United Nations World Food Programme airplane carrying 24 people crashed in northern Kosovo, killing all on board. The plane departed Rome bound for Pristina, Kosovo--the wreckage was found only 20 miles from its destination. The passengers, mainly humanitarian aid workers, were on a routine flight run by the World Food Programme.  The World Food Programme is the world's largest international food aid organization that provides food aid to 75 million people worldwide through development projects and emergency operations.  The WFP fights both the acute hunger that grips a family fleeing civil conflicts and the chronic hunger that slowly gnaws away a life. Hunger afflicts one out of every seven people on earth. 800 million people are malnourished. Starvation threatens at least another 50 million victims of man-made and natural disasters. In 1998, the WFP delivered 2.8 million tons of food to 80 countries. These projects are enormous undertakings, and are sometimes not without human costs.  The WFP has lost more employees than any other UN agency in work-related accidents, illnesses or attacks. Fifty-one people since 1988 have lost their lives while in service to those who would otherwise go hungry. Among the 24 people who died in the most recent tragedy were doctors, a civil engineer, aid workers, a volunteer chemist, police officers and non-governmental organization workers.  As we begin to plan our Thanksgiving meals, let us pause a moment to reflect on those who dedicate themselves to the eradication of starvation. Let us remember our dear friend and colleague, Congressman Mickey Leland, who died in a plane crash 10 years ago while leading a mission to an isolated refugee camp in Ethiopia.  And as we talk about the United Nations, let us not forget who the U.N. is made up of--humanitarian aid workers who devote their lives, often at great risk, to easing the suffering of others.                          ____________________
