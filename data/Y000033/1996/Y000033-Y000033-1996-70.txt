Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  May I suggest one thing. Let the House participate. Let this Congress participate in this process. This is the people's house. Let the people have the decision to make. That is crucially important, to continue the process. That is all this bill does.  For those that are afraid of letting this Congress participate, you should not be in Congress. It is that simple. What is wrong with us being involved? Why should we let the executive branch and the U.N. make decisions about my private property rights? I urge the passage of this legislation.
