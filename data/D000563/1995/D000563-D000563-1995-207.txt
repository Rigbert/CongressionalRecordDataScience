Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk, and I would like to inquire of the chairman of the committee if he would like to enter into a unanimous consent as to the time for the debate on this amendment relative to the tobacco program, and I would like to suggest to the chairman that we limit the debate on this amendment and all amendments thereto to 1 hour, 30 minutes on each side.
