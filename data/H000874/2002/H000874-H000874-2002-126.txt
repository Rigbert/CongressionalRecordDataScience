 But the point I want to make is, this is clearly not a partisan issue. This is an issue of judgment as to clearly we want to keep the Blues in the program. Some years ago we lost Aetna. We do not want to lose competitors in the program that will adversely affect Federal employees and adversely affect taxpayers who participate, as you know, in 70 percent of the average cost of the FEHBP. So clearly I think we all want to get to the same place, but I think there is some question here, and I tried to contact OPM today to follow up on this without success after I found out that the administration was for essentially the Kucinich amendment.  They did not mention that amendment. They simply mentioned that they were in favor of this provision being dropped. But clearly I want to assure the gentleman from Florida, and I know that having talked to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Istook), the chairman of our committee, about this, whatever happens on this amendment, we are going to look very carefully at it; and we are not going to allow anything to happen which will adversely affect the Federal employees and which will unfairly affect Blue Cross/Blue Shield.
