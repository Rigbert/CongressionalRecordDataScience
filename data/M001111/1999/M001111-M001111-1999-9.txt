 President, today I introduce a bill entitled the ``Quality and Accountability Are Best for Children Act.'' Every child in every classroom in America deserves to have a fully-qualified teacher; this legislation takes a comprehensive approach to helping communities make that a reality. The bill should be seen as complementary to the professional development sections of last year's Higher Education Act, and to the professional development sections of S. 7, the Public Schools Excellence Act. It should also be seen as part of a comprehensive strategy to forge a strong partnership on education between the Congress and the teachers, families, and students in communities across America which it serves.  While my efforts today are to address educator quality issues, I also recently introduced S. 1773, the Youth and Adult School Partnership Act of 1999, and S. 1772, the Family and School Partnership Act of 1999. In addition, I have been working for some time to pass S. 1304, the Time for Schools Act. All these efforts work in concert, to address the very real needs of our local schools when it comes to investing in the strategies that work, and in making it possible to involve all the necessary members of our local school communities in the decisions that affect them.  I have spoken before about what I have heard from the literally thousands of families and students and educators and community leaders I have met. I have spoken about how most Americans want an increased but appropriate federal role in education. They want decisions about how to help students achieve at higher levels to be made in the local school, but they also want increased federal funds--help where help is needed--to support their local efforts. Most people are shocked to learn that their federal government only devotes 1.6 percent of overall spending to education.  I have spoken before about how the federal class size reduction initiative has at its core a streamlined funding mechanism that targets funds to a goal and then holds the school accountable to the local community for making progress toward that goal. I have talked about how important I feel this funding mechanism can be as a way for us to look at other federal programs in education. I have spoken about the importance of keeping the federal role firmly in mind: to ensure opportunity on the one hand, and to fund shared national priorities on the other. In addition, we must ensure accountability for results at every step along the way.  We need to remember that what families and students and educators and community leaders have asked us for is targeted help and support, to fund such efforts as reducing class size, and providing for special education students, and after-school programs, and school modernization, and education technology, and school safety and other efforts. Our responsibility is to give them the help they have sought, and no topic is more important to them than funding the necessary steps it will take to help local schools improve the quality of their corps of educators. We must rethink how educators are taught, and how we support their learning of the new skills it takes to teach students the basics and ``new basics'' that it will take for them to succeed in today's complex world.  In addition, we must fund local schools' efforts to recruit, retain and reward the world's finest corps of educators. And assure that their local communities can hold them accountable for doing so.  Today I introduce the Quality and Accountability are Best for Children Act, or Quality ABCs Act. This bill will help school districts improve the quality of their educator corps, and helpcommunities hold schools accountable for results. Since all communities are struggling to improve the quality of their teaching force, funds are provided at a level that allow all school districts to participate. It will authorize an additional formula grant, based on enrollment, in the amount of $2 billion per year for teacher quality improvement, plus $100 million per year for principal professional development. Funds will supplement current federal, state, and local professional development efforts, and school districts are encouraged to use existing law, waivers, of Ed Flex authority to coordinate activities at the local level.  With the goal of reducing paperwork and avoiding lengthy program descriptions, my legislation is based on the bipartisan mechanism agreed to under the fiscal year 1999 Appropriations Class Size Reduction Initiative. Applications are streamlined, school districts can use money flexibly at the local level, as long as they target funds to improving educator quality in at least one of three subject areas (recruitment, retention, and rewards) and school districts are accountable to the local community in the form of a report card describing district efforts to improve teacher quality.  School district are required to use funds to improve educator quality, but have a broad range of options to do so.  To recruit new teachers, school districts may use tools such as the following:  Establishing or expanding teacher academies, teachers-recruiting-future-teacher programs, and programs to encourage high school and middle school students to pursue a career in teaching;  Establishing or expanding para-professional training programs, paraeducator-to-teacher career ladders or other efforts to improve the training and supervision of para-educators;  Establishing or expanding programs for mid-career professionals to become certificated teachers;  Reaching out to communities of color or other special populations to make the teaching corps more reflective of current and future student demographics:  Placing advertisements, attending college job fairs, offering signing bonuses, and other recruitment efforts;  Embarking on and coordinating with other activities to help recruit the best quality teaching corps, such as: offering forgivable loans; assisting new hires to reach higher levels of state certification or to become national board certified teachers; recruiting new teachers in specific disciplines including math and science;  In addition, the Secretary of Education will be authorized directly, or by creating programs at the state or local level to:  Offer incentives for teachers to achieve national board certification;  Create forgivable loan programs under the current student aid programs;  Report on successful efforts and take part in dissemination activities;  Provide technical assistance to states and school districts to assist them to use technology in recruitment, processing, hiring, and placement of qualified teaching candidates.  To retain teachers, school districts may:  Use funds to offer or stipends or bonuses to educators to seek further subject matter endorsements, advanced levels of state certification or national board certification. These retention efforts can also fund other local initiatives specifically designed, such as mentor teacher programs, to retain teachers in the first 5 years of teaching;  Local education agencies can use funds, within district criteria for mentor or master teacher criteria, for a range of retention activities: mentor and/or master teacher job classification/career ladders; sabbatical/research activities such as the Fulbright program, or working in industry/non-profit world to improve teacher education; or other activities that keep teachers fresh while preserving their job slot/pay/benefits. These retention efforts can also fund other local initiatives specifically designed to retain experienced teachers, beyond the first five years of teaching;  To reward teachers:  School districts can reward elementary and secondary schools, based on improvement in the proportion of highly qualified teachers or other measures of teacher quality--improved recruiting, retention, improved ``in endorsement'' ratio, higher percentage of certificated staff, higher levels of certification, professional development curricular improvement;  School districts can provide teachers with a one-time bonus/reward of $5,000 for achieving national board certification;  Each state will receive $100,000 to support the McAuliffe awards and National Teacher of the year awards to create additional forms of conferring respect and recognition upon distinguished educators.  The bill requires school district report cards to contain information about efforts they have undertaken to improve the recruiting, retention, rewarding, and accountability for teachers. Reports include which programs were offered locally, how much of the funding was spent on which efforts, and what results were achieved in terms of measurable improvements to teacher quality and student achievement.  Each report card shall include information about how parents and other community members can access processes under school district policies regarding teacher accountability.  The bill includes an effort to provide, on a statewide basis, professional development services for public elementary school and secondary school principals designed to enhance the principals' educational leadership skills.  The programs will provide principals with:  Knowledge of effective instructional leadership skills and practices;  Comprehensive whole-school approaches and programs that improve teaching and learning;  Improved understanding of the effective uses of educational technology, including best practices for incorporating technology into the instructional program and management of the school;  Increased knowledge of State content and performance standards, and appropriate related curriculum;  Assistance in the development of effective programs, and strategies for assessing the effectiveness of such programs;  Training in effective, fair evaluation and supervision of school staff, and training in improvement of instruction;  Assistance in the enhancement and development of the principals' overall school management and business skills;  Knowledge of school safety and discipline practices, school law, and school funding issues.  The bill also includes the K-12 school sections of my teacher Technology Training Act. Last year, I included in the Higher Education Act provisions to improve pre-service teacher training offered by universities, by including technology in teacher training. The Quality ABCs Act will take the relevant steps to integrate technology into the professional development offered by school districts.  This bill is only one step but it is a necessary one. We cannot succeed in improving student learning if we do not also invest in the quality of our educators. We must assure that schools can use all the tools at their disposal to do what's necessary, and the Quality ABCs Act funds the recruitment, retention, rewards and accountability measures essential to their success.  In all these pieces of legislation, whether I am a sponsor or a cosponsor, my approach is to offer help where help is needed. Schools face increasing challenges and higher expectations from their communities and from all Americans.  Now is not the time for easy answers. Too many have suggested that it's all about paperwork or all about trust or all about bureaucracy. We must take steps to squeeze the most out of every dollar, and make things more efficient, but, as we've seen with the funding mechanism under the class size reduction initiative, local flexibility, targeted to a specific purpose, with local accountability built in, can work very well.  But even that approach is only a partial answer. Helping all our schools perform for all students now and into the next century is a monumental task. None of these challenges is easy. The kind of student success we are hoping for will not happen without an actual, working partnership among localschools and school districts, state and regional education agencies, and the federal government. The success will not happen without a partnership between educators and families and young people and community leaders.  No person, school, or government entity has the resources, the research, the leadership, the experience, or the capability to go it alone. People cannot succeed in a global economy without an education that is world-class, relevant, and sufficiently funded. We all must work together as a nation if we want to succeed as a nation in a complex world. We owe this kind of perspective to our children and to our future. We must all strive to find the areas where we agree. Only a shared vision of the future of education will help us all to move toward our destination. Let us take that first step together.  Mr. President, the drafting of these bills would have been impossible without the efforts of two legislative fe3llows in my office, Ann Mary Ifekwunigwe and Peter Hatch. I thank them for their work.  Mr. President, I ask that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  The bill follows:                                S. 1926       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Quality and Accountability      are Best for Children Act''.     SEC. 2. REFERENCES.       Except as otherwise expressly provided, whenever in this      Act an amendment or repeal is expressed in terms of an      amendment to, or repeal of, a section or other provision, the      reference shall be considered to be made to a section or      other provision of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act      of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.).     SEC. 3. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Academically qualified, highly trained and professional      teachers are a critical component in children's educational      success.       (2) The Department of Education has reported that our      Nation will need to hire 2,200,000 more teachers during the      10-year period beginning in fiscal year 2000.       (3) Newspaper accounts from the 18th century described      teachers as well-respected, but ill-rewarded.       (4) In 1999, because many individuals view teaching as a      thankless profession which garners little respect, little      support, and little money, nearly 50 percent of those who      enter teaching leave the profession within 5 years.       (5) Sixty-three percent of parents and teachers believe      that accountability systems with financial rewards are a good      idea, and would motivate teachers to work harder to improve      student achievement.       (6) Paying professional salaries is integral to teacher      retention. The State of Connecticut, for example, has been      able to improve student achievement, eliminate its teacher      shortage, and retain highly qualified teachers by offering      the highest salaries in the Nation (an average of $51,727 per      year).       (7) Dissemination of information regarding the teacher      corps working at individual elementary schools and secondary      schools, and accountability procedures enforced by the local      educational agency can provide an important tool for parents      and taxpayers to measure the quality of the elementary      schools or secondary schools and to hold the schools and      teachers accountable for improving student performance.       (8) Although elementary school and secondary school      teachers need the most up-to-date skills possible to ensure      that students are equipped to deal with a complex economy and      society, less than 50 percent of such teachers report that      they are competent in using technology effectively in the      classroom.       (9) Although principals and other administrators are the      educational leaders and chief executive officers of our      Nation's elementary schools and secondary schools, and      research strongly suggests that strong leadership from the      principal is the single most important factor in effective      schools, research also has revealed that the characteristics      of a good principal are not necessarily those things for      which principals are trained and rewarded.     SEC. 4. PURPOSES.       The purposes of this Act are--       (1) to recruit the best and the brightest candidates to      teach in public elementary schools and secondary schools by      looking to young people, people from special populations,      mid-career professionals, and others as potential new      teachers;       (2) to offer retention incentives to highly qualified      teachers to keep the teachers in the classroom;       (3) to reward elementary schools and secondary schools      that, and teachers in such schools who, succeed in improving      student achievement;       (4) to hold elementary school and secondary school teachers      accountable for achieving high levels of professionalism,      including possessing expert knowledge and skills in the      subject areas in which the teachers teach, being actively      involved in all aspects of the school community, and being      committed to the academic success of students, by providing      parents and the school community with specific information      about the qualifications of the local teaching corps;       (5) to improve teacher professional development in the uses      of technology in teaching and learning and in the study of      technology, and to help local communities to use technology      as a vehicle to improve teacher professional development; and       (6) to improve the professional development of elementary      school and secondary school principals and other      administrators to ensure that the principals and      administrators are the community's educational leaders, and      have sophisticated knowledge about student achievement,      school safety, management, evaluation, and community      outreach.     SEC. 5. IMPROVING TEACHER RECRUITMENT, RETENTION, REWARDS,                    AND ACCOUNTABILITY.       Title II (20 U.S.C. 6601 et seq.) is amended--       (1) by redesignating part E as part G;       (2) by redesignating sections 2401 and 2402 (20 U.S.C.      6701, 6702) as sections 2601 and 2602, respectively; and       (3) by inserting after part D the following:   ``PART E--IMPROVING TEACHER RECRUITMENT, RETENTION, REWARDS, AND                             ACCOUNTABILITY;     ``SEC. 2401.
