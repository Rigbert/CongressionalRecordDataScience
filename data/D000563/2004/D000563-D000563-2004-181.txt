The answer is clear to all of us. This Congress, under the Republican leadership and this administration, has decided that the special interest groups are more important than these issues that are facing working families. They have decided that giving tax cuts to the wealthiest people in America is more important than giving working families the deductibility of college education expenses. They have decided that giving breaks to oil companies is more important than confronting those oil companies and OPEC to bring down gasoline prices. They have decided that the pharmaceutical companies and the health insurance companies in America are more important, their bottom line profits are more important than the cost of health insurance to businesses, to labor union members, and to families across America. They have caved in time and time again to special interest groups, and they refuse to listen to the real concerns of America.  That is why Americans are saying, by a margin of almost 2 to 1, that we are headed in the wrong direction as a nation. They want leadership in Washington that responds to the real issues, the family room issues, the kitchen table issues families face every single day. This administration has refused to do it. Frankly, this Congress has refused to do it. They want to divert attention. They want to have the old sleight of hand. Let us talk about constitutional amendments. Let us not talk about things that deal with the real issues facing families.  I am happy to yield to the Senator from Nevada.
