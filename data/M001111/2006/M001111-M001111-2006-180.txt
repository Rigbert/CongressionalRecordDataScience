 President, a question has been raised about whether the minimum wage provision affecting States that allow tips to be exempt would be impacted by the legislation that is before us. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from Gary Weeks, who is the director of the Washington State Department of Labor and Industries, that says definitively:       Under our preliminary analysis, this proposal, in effect,      appears to nullify an employer's obligation to pay the      minimum wage rate in RCW 49.46.020 with regard to tipped      employees. This means that Washington workers who receive      tips--typically service industry workers--would see a      decrease in income.  I ask unanimous consent to have that printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                              State of Washington,                           Department of Labor and Industries,                                      Olympia, WA, August 3, 2006.     Hon. Patty Murray,     United States Senator,     Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.     Hon. Maria Cantwell,     United States Senator,     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Murray and Cantwell: Your office asked me to      respond to an inquiry as to how the proposed HR 5970 would      affect workers in the state of Washington.       As you know, Washington State does not recognize tips as      part of the minimum wage. Tipped employees are entitled to      the full minimum wage, currently $7.63 an hour. Additionally,      Initiative 688, passed overwhelmingly by voters in 1998, tied      the minimum wage to the Consumer Price Index, to be      recalculated and adjusted each year.       The proposed bill, Section 402 of HR 5970, which amends the      Fair Labor Standards Act to add a paragraph that states:       (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, any      State or political subdivision of a State which on or after      the date of enactment of the Estate Tax and Extension of Tax      Relief Act of 2006 excludes all of a tipped employee's tips      from being considered as wages in determining if such tipped      employee has been paid the applicable minimum wage rate, may      not establish or enforce the minimum wage rate provisions of      such law, ordinance, regulation, or order in such State or      political subdivision thereof with respect to tipped      employees unless such law, ordinance, regulation, or order is      revised or amended to permit such employee to be paid a wage      by the employee's employer in an amount not less than an      amount equal to--       (A) the cash wage paid such employee which is required      under such law, ordinance, regulation, or order on the date      of enactment of the Estate Tax and Extension of Tax Relief      Act of 2006; and       (B) an additional amount on account of tips received by      such employee which amount is equal to the difference between      the cash wage described in subparagraph (A) and the minimum      wage rate in effect under such law, ordinance, regulation, or      order, or the minimum wage rate in effect under section 6(a),      whichever is higher.       Under our preliminary analysis, this proposal, in effect,      appears to nullify an employer's obligation to pay the      minimum wage rate in RCW 49.46.020 with regard to tipped      employees. This means that Washington workers who receive      tips--typically service industry workers--would see a      decrease in income. However, the proposal does give states      the right to amend their laws to specifically reinstate their      current minimum wage rate laws. Until and unless the      Washington State Legislature amends the minimum wage act to      reinstate the current wage rate provision for tipped      employees, it would diminish workers' rights in Washington      State.       I trust that this is useful information. Please let me know      if I can be of further assistance.           Sincerely,                                                    Gary K. Weeks,                                                         Director.
