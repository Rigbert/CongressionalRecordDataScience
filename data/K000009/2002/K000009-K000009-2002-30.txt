Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Washington for yielding and say that I rise in opposition to the rule on the conference report.  The American people know something is wrong in Washington when every single trade bill passed by this Congress and signed by the President results in more lost jobs, more penny-wage jobs, more lost markets as imports deluge in here from every single country in the world and we cash out good jobs with good benefits in textiles, in electronics, in agriculture, in automotive, in machine tools, in steel; even baseball and U.S. flags.  TPA expands NAFTA to the entire hemisphere. Before NAFTA, we had a trade balance, I say to the gentleman from California (Mr. Dreier), with Mexico. Every year the trade balance has gone down, gone south, losing over hundreds of thousands of jobs into Mexico and cashing out our automotive and machine tool industry and even agriculture now down there. And when people start getting paid $3 a day, then guess what happened? They moved the jobs to China.  So we have had a sucking sound to Mexico which is now shifting over to China, and I defy any American to go into a store today and buy something that is not made in China, and the American people can verify this through their own experience.  Now, I say to the gentleman from California (Mr. Dreier), he did not really talk about the pain and suffering. Talk to the workers at Brachs Candy in South Chicago. They are about to go through that shutdown, a 100 year-old company. It is one in a long line of millions of U.S. jobs.  I used to feel sorry for you that you really did not understand, but I feel much sorrier for the workers and the farmers of this continent and the world, because you are creating a great divergence between wealth and poverty. You are drawing a new Mason Dixon Line. It is different than what we experienced inside the United States. The wealthy, the shareholders, those on Wall Street and the futures markets, they love this system. But the workers of our country and the farmers of the world, they are being hurt. What do you think is fueling immigration into this country from the south?  Mr. Speaker, I would urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the rule and ``no'' on the report. Do not vote for a world with these kinds of extremes in wealth and poverty that are cashing out our middle class and creating global environmental cesspools and corporate slums and global plantations with penny-wage jobs. Vote for the kinds of trade agreements that build a middle class here at home and abroad and true world peace.  And what a shame for us, what a shame for us that this is being brought up at 1 o'clock in the morning, just like GATT was about 8 years ago, because they want to do it in the quiet of the night when most people are sleeping. It is too important for that. Have some self-respect for us. Let us debate as we should one of the most important bills that will come before this Congress.
