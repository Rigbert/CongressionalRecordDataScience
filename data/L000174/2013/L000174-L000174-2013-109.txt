So my question to the Senator is, in all of these discussions they have had, the 40 times they voted, have they ever once come up with an alternative piece of legislation that would provide for your children, if they are in college, to be on your health care policy, or if you have a member of your familiy with a preexisting condition such as diabetes or has gone through cancer, have they come up with any alternative or is it just: We want nothing?
