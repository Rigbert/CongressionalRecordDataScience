Speaker, I thank the gentleman. I look forward to working with him on both--continuing to focus on Ebola, while at the same time we focus on the immediate threat of Zika.  The last comment I would make, Mr. Speaker, is that Members ought to be disabused of the concept--and I have heard it, as well as the gentleman has heard it--that the legislation under consideration for Puerto Rico is a bailout. There is no money going to Puerto Rico. There is no guarantee of any of their indebtedness going from the United States to Puerto Rico.  This is simply whether or not we can construct a mechanism so that they can restructure their debt, which may prolong the period of time in which the debt is paid off. It may reduce by some amount the debt that is repaid. But as the gentleman knows--and he is shaking his head in agreement--we are not contemplating nor are we moving forward on a bailout for Puerto Rico.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________
