Speaker, it is important for us to understand why we are here. We are here because the Republican majority in the House and the Senate and the President of the United States have not funded the government.  Secondly, we also are here because there are a number of issues on which I think there is agreement in both Houses that have not been brought to the floor irrespective of the majority's will.  It appears, from what the Senate leader has said, that there is an agreement in the Senate, and, perhaps--and I think probably--we will move forward today to open up the government.  But I hope my Republican colleagues do not misinterpret what is happening because the issues will not go away. Between now and February 8, if that is the date, we must resolve how we are going to fund the government--that is what has held us up--and we must bring to this floor a bill to protect people whom the President of the United States said we ought to protect.  Let's do it. Let's do our work.                          ____________________
