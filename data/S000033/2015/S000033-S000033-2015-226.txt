 I thank Senators Bennet, Carper, Leahy, Menendez, Warren, and Whitehouse for cosponsoring this amendment.  My amendment is extremely simple. It is about 1\1/2\ pages, and I think it is easily understood by anyone who reads it. It says:       It is the sense of Congress that Congress is in agreement      with the opinion of virtually the entire worldwide scientific      community that--       (1) climate change is real;       (2) climate change is caused by human activities;       (3) climate change has already caused devastating problems      in the United States and around the world;       (4) a brief window of opportunity exists before the United      States and the entire planet suffer irreparable harm; and       (5) it is imperative that the United States transform its      energy system away from fossil fuels and toward energy      efficiency and sustainable energy as rapidly as possible.  That is it. That is the entire amendment.  What this amendment does is simply ask the Members of the Senate whether they agree with the overwhelming majority of scientists who have told us over and over and over again that climate change is real, that climate change is caused by human activity, including the emission of carbon, that climate change is already causing devastating problems in the United States and around the world, and that if we are going to leave our children and our grandchildren a planet that is habitable, we must transform our energy system away from fossil fuels.  Progressives, conservatives, and people in between have many disagreements on issues--and that is called democracy. There is nothing to be ashamed about that; that is the democratic process. We all have differences of opinion. But what is not a good thing is when we make public policy in contradiction to what the scientific community tells us. That is not a good thing.  When we look at medical issues such as cancer or heart disease, what we do is look at the scientific communities and medical doctors for their opinions as to how we should proceed.  When we look at infrastructure issues, the issues of roads and bridges, we look at engineers for their opinion as to how we should proceed.  When we look at education and try to understand how best kids can best learn, we look at educators and those people who know most about education for advice as to how we should proceed.  In terms of the issue of climate change, the process should not be any different. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the IPCC, is the leading scientific body that deals with the issue of climate change. I will very briefly quote what the IPCC said last fall:       Warming of the climate system is unequivocal as is now      evident from observations of increases in global average air      and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice      and rising global average sea level.  More than 97 percent of the scientific community in the United States and across the globe agrees with these findings, including the American Chemical Society, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Meteorological Society, and the American Geophysical Union, to name just a few.  In fact, at least 37 American scientific organizations, 135 international scientific organizations and national academies of science, and 21 medical associations, all agree that climate change is real and is significantly caused by human activities.  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the names of 37 American scientific organizations, 135 international scientific organizations and national academies, and 21 medical associations which all have gone on record as stating that climate change is real and is significantly caused by human activity.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:       Virtually every major scientific organization in this      country and throughout the world have said that climate      change is real, climate change is caused by carbon emissions      and human activity, and that climate change is already      causing devastating problems in the United States of America      and around the world.
