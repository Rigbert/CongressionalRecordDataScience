 President, I am sorry my friend and colleague, the Senator from Vermont, is not going to be able to support the bill. But I do want to commend him for his ongoing effort with regard to demining. The Leahy War Victims Fund has had a dramatic impact not only on rehabilitation but also on safety; in addition, Senator Leahy's interest in and devotion to the subject of infectious diseases. He has single-handedly driven the funding levels up. The surveillance, control, and treatment have improved throughout the world because of his commitment.  I commend him for that.  Mr. President, it is my understanding that both sides are interested in having this vote at noon. I am prepared to yield back my time, if Senator Leahy is, and we will proceed with the vote.
