President, I am delighted to commend the Falmouth Middle School of Falmouth, ME, on being named a 2016 National Blue Ribbon School of Excellence. This outstanding middle school is one of only 329 schools across the country to receive this prestigious recognition from the U.S. Department of Education.  Created in 1982, the Blue Ribbon Schools Program honors public and private schools that are either academically superior in their States or that demonstrate significant gains in student achievement. The schools singled out for this national recognition are models of high educational standards and accountability.  Falmouth Middle School is among a select group of schools to achieve the Blue Ribbon designation not once, but twice. Since receiving its first award in 2008, the school has continued to excel as a community of collaborative and engaged learners who value diversity, kindness, creativity, excellence, responsibility for self, and service to others.  This award recognizes the hard work and determination of Falmouth Middle School's pupils and staff. This is a top-performing school on State-required assessments, and staff at the school use assessments throughout the academic year as a tool for improving and customizing instruction. A strong commitment to professional development ensures that teachers and staff, as well as students, are lifelong learners.  Falmouth Middle School is known for its extensive extracurricular activities in academics, athletics, and the arts, which help forge a strong school community where students are connected and encouraged to pursue their interests. Just this year, three new afterschool clubs were formed--in French, writing, and dance--driven by enthusiastic students and guided by involved teachers.  This Blue Ribbon award is a tribute not only to the students, but also to the administrators, teachers, staff, and parents of Falmouth Middle School. Together, they are succeeding in their mission to generate excitement and momentum for learning. They are making a difference in the lives of their students, helping them reach their full potential as independent, responsible learners and citizens. I congratulate the entire community for this well-deserved recognition.                          ____________________
