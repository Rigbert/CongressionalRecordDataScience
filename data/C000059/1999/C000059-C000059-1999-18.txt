Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2605, the Energy and Water Appropriations bill. First, I would like to thank Chairman Packard for his hard work and dedication in crafting a balanced bill. I would also like to commend Chairman Young for his responsible leadership in ensuring that these necessary spending bills are delivered on time and at the levels required under the budget resolution.  As a member of the southern California delegation, I understand the importance of preserving our water resources and protecting citizens from flood damage. This bill appropriates vital funds for watershed management, flood control, environmental enhancement, water conservation and water supply, and building dams which will save many lives downstream.  This bill will help protect vulnerable communities. I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill.  I also urge my colleagues to vote against the Visclosky amendment. Under current law, if the Corps of Engineers determines that no wetlands exist on a piece of property, a third party can file suit in court. But, if the Corps determines that wetlands do exist, then the landowner is forced to go through the entire permitting process before he or she can go to court.  Mr. Speaker, current law puts the hard-working citizens at a disadvantage to extreme environmental groups. This bill will allow landowners the same right to appeal a decision in court, the same right that any interested third party currently enjoys. It's only fair and I urge my colleagues to oppose the Visclosky amendment.
