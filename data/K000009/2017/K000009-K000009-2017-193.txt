Speaker, I am so grateful for Mr. Crowley's presence and his eloquent remarks this evening, representing one of the major cities in our country where Jewish leaders from all walks of life have helped elevate America. I know how proud they are of him and what he is attempting to do. I hope every one of our colleagues, all 435, sign on to his resolution. It is most worthy. I thank him so very, very much for joining us this evening.  I want to tell a story in the region that I represent, though this particular neighborhood was cut out of my district. A Nazi swastika was painted on a garage door recently of the home of a Muslim family. It was really repugnant and very cruel, but what happened in our community? What did the American people do? One neighbor came over with a bottle of red paint and she made a big heart over the swastika. Then the conductor of the symphony came and musicians came, and they played ``Ode to Joy'' to the family, and other friends came and the American people.  I love the American people because deep in their hearts they live the values of liberty and justice for all. The garage door itself was replaced by the Toledo Overhead Door Company. They gave the family a new door for free. I am just so proud of them. I am just so proud of them.  Our communities don't have to bear this sadness of anti-Semitism and of degradation by those who really don'tget what this country is made of. I know the Trump White House statement on the Holocaust falls far short of the administration's ability to properly recognize and record history accurately.  The Trump White House has the means to hire appropriate staff to prepare thoughtful, carefully researched statements, and their 2017 statement is out of touch with history. History teaches us that wherever anti-Semitism has gone unchecked, the persecution of others has been present or not far behind. Presenting historical truth and defeating anti-Semitism must be a cause of great importance not only for Jews but also for us, for people who value liberty, truth, free expression of religion, justice for all. I know that is the vast majority of the American people.                             General Leave
