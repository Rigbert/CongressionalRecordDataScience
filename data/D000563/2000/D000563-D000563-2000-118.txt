President, 31 years ago, when I graduated from law school here in Washington, DC, my wife and I picked up our little girl, took all of our earthly possessions, and moved to the State capital of Springfield, IL. It was our first time to visit that town. We went there and made a home and had two children born to us there and raised our family.  So for 31 years Springfield, IL, has been our home. It has been a good home for us. We made a conscious decision several times in our lives to stay in Springfield. It was the type of home we wanted to make for our children, and our kids turned out pretty well. We think it was the right decision. Springfield has been kind to me. It gave me a chance, in 1982, and elected me to the House of Representatives, and then it was kind enough to be part of the electorate in Illinois that allowed me to serve here in the Senate.  I have come to know and love the city of Springfield, particularly its Lincoln history. I was honored as a Democrat to be elected to a congressional seat of which part was once represented in the U.S. House of Representatives by Abraham Lincoln. Of course, he was not a Democrat. He was a Whig turned Republican--first as a Whig as a Congressman and then Republican as President. But we still take great pride in Lincoln, whether we are Democrats or Republicans.  When I was elected to the Senate, their came a time when someone asked me to debate my opponent. They said it was the anniversary of the Douglas-Lincoln debate of 1858 which drew the attention of the people across the United States. Douglas won the senatorial contest that year. Two years later, Lincoln was elected President.  It seems that every step in my political career has been in the shadow of this great Abraham Lincoln.  In about 1991, I reflected on the fact that in Springfield, IL--despite all of the things that are dedicated to Abraham Lincoln, the State capital where he made some of his most famous speeches and pronouncements, and his old law office where he once practiced law, the only home he ever owned across the street from my senatorial office, just a few blocks away the Lincoln tomb, and only a few miles away Lincoln's boyhood home in New Salem--of all of these different Lincoln sites in that area, for some reason this great President was never given a center, a library in one place where we could really tell the story of Abraham Lincoln's life to the millions of people across the world who are fascinated by this wonderful man.  We had at one point over 400,000 tourists a year coming to the Lincoln home. I know they are from all over the world because I see them every day when I am at home in Springfield.  I thought: we need to have a center, one place that really tells the Lincoln story and draws together all of the threads of his life and all of the evidence of his life so everyone can come to appreciate him.  In 1991, that idea was just the idea of a Congressman, and I tried my best to convince a lot of people back in Illinois of the wisdom of this notion. I worked on it here in Washington over the years. Once in Congress, people came along and said: Maybe it is a good idea. There should be a Lincoln Presidential center. We really ought to focus the national attention on this possibility.  We passed several appropriations bills in the House. Some of them didn't go very far in the Senate. But the interest was piquing. All of a sudden, more and more people started discussing this option and possibility.  I recall that in the last year of the Governorship of Jim Edgar in his last State of the State Address he raised this as a project that he would like to put on the table for his last year as Governor. He told me later that he was amazed at the reaction. People from all over Illinois were excited about this opportunity. He weighed in and said the State will be part of this process. His successor, Gov. George Ryan, and his wife Laura Ryan, also said they wanted to be part of it. The mayor of Springfield, Karen Hasara, asked that the State accept from the city of Springfield a parcel of real estate so they could build the center.  All of a sudden, there came together at the local and State level this new momentum and interest in the idea of a Lincoln Presidential library and a Lincoln center. I was energized by that.  Then, of course, the Illinois Congressional Delegation weighed in in support of it, and we have tried now to make a contribution from the Federal level toward this national project, which brings together local, State, and Federal sources in the name of Abraham Lincoln.  This Interior appropriations bill, of course, includes $10 million of a $50 million authorization for that purpose. I think that is a good investment and a very worthy project for which I fought for 10 years.  I am happy to have joined with my colleague, Senator Fitzgerald, who offered a bill which authorized this center. He offered this bill as a freestanding piece of legislation. I coauthored it with him. He added an amendment relative to the bidding process, and that amendment was adopted in committee. It was agreed to on the floor. It is my understanding that it is now going to be sent over to the House for conference. I was happy to stand with him in that effort.  But I think I would like to reflect for a moment on this project and to say a few words about the debate that has gone on today on the floor of the Senate.  The debate seems to focus on several different aspects of this Lincoln center. I cannot tell that it is in the best location in the city of Springfield. I didn't choose that location. I believed it wasn't my place to get involved. The minute this Lincoln center was suggested, people from all over Springfield who owned real estate came flocking to my door and reminded me of what good friends they were and asked me to pick their location for the Lincoln center. I said I wasn't going to do it. It shouldn't be a political decision. It should be a decision made in the best interests of the hundreds of thousands of people who will come and visit this location.  The location which they have chosen is in a good spot when you consider the restoration of the old railroad station from which Abraham Lincoln left for his Presidency, and the old State capital which was important in his life and to this new center. They create a campus that I think will be visited and enjoyed by a lot of people.  There was also a question about the design of the center. I am no architect or planner. I really defer to others. I know what I would like. I would like to put in my two cents worth. But I am not going to act as an architect, a planner, or an engineer. That is really a decision to be made by others. It should not be a political decision.  I think what Senator Fitzgerald said during the course of this debate is that the bidding process for this center should not be political either. I agree with him completely. I think he is on the right track.  As he and I have said in various ways, a center that honors ``Honest Abe'' should be built in an honest fashion. That is what we are going to try to do in Springfield, IL. Senator Fitzgerald and I have been in agreement to this point. I believe, though, that we may have some difference of opinion in how we are going to progress from here.  I, frankly, believe that trying to create a new bidding process for this center involving Federal rules may be difficult and may be impossible. What agency is going to do it? Who is going to implement these rules and regulations? How will this law apply? But I agree with him that whatever process we use--whether it is Federal, State, or some other means--that it should be one where competitive bidding is the absolute bottom line so that it is open and honest.  That is why I asked of the Capital Development Board in Springfield, which I believe will be the agency supervising this bidding, for a letter that expressly states that this process will be done by open competition and open bidding. I received that letter yesterday.  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                State of Illinois,                                    Capital Development Board,                                 Springfield, IL, October 3, 2000.     Hon. Richard J. Durbin,     Russell Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Durbin: This letter is an additional attempt      to allay concerns that have been raised about our state's      commitment to competitive bidding and the efficacy of our      state purchasing laws. Let me assure you that all      construction contracts for this library and museum are being      and will continue to be competitively bid pursuant to state      law that is at least as stringent, if not more so, than      federal bidding requirements.       Competitive bidding has long been the requirement for State      of Illinois construction contracts and was most recently      reaffirmed with the passage of the stricter Illinois      Procurement Code of 1998. Only six exemptions to that      provision, which are defined by rule and must be approved by      the Executive Director, exist:       (1) emergency repairs when there exists a threat to public      health or safety, or where immediate action is needed to      repair or prevent damage to State property;       (2) construction projects of less than $30,000 total;       (3) limited projects, such as asbestos removal, for which      CDB may contract with Correctional Industries;       (4) the Art-in-Architecture program which follows a      separate procurement process;       (5) construction management services which are      competitively procured under a separate law; and,       (6) sole source items.       None of these exceptions have ever or will apply to the      library project, as they do not apply to the overwhelming      majority of CDB's projects.       With regard to the federal practice of ``weighting''      construction bid criteria, there is no similar provision in      state law, because there is only one criteria allowed--our      bids must be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder--     period. While it appears to me that the federal government      has taken the approach that it will determine the      responsiveness of the individual bidders after bids are      received, Illinois law actually requires that process to      occur before bidding takes place. Construction companies are      required to become prequalified with CDB before they can bid      on construction projects. It is during the prequalification      process that we determine a company's bonding capacity and      assess their work history and level of experience through      reference checks--in short, their ability to perform      construction work.       All bids for a construction project are opened during      publicly held and advertised ``bid opening'' meetings. All      interested constructors are informed at that time of the bid      amounts. There is no provision that allows CDB not to award      to the low bidder.       I hope that this clarifies some of the issues that have      been raised. Please do not hesitate to call on me if I may be      of further assistance.           Sincerely,                                                     Kim Robinson,                                               Executive Director.
