 President, this morning, following the 60 minutes of morning business, we will resume debate on the bankruptcy legislation. Yesterday, by a vote of 69 to 31, we were able to invoke cloture on the bill; therefore, we will finish the bill this week. Once we return to the bill this morning, there will be 40 minutes of debate prior to a series of votes on four of the pending amendments. These four votes can be expected to begin at around 11:30 this morning.  We will continue to work through the pending germane amendments to see which are ready for rollcall votes. And I presume we will have another series of votes later on today. We encourage Senators who have pending amendments to review whether they really need to ask for a recorded vote on each of their amendments. Perhaps we can further limit the number of amendments that will require rollcall votes so we can finish this bill at a reasonable hour, even today.  I thank my colleagues for their hard work on the bill. We are on the cusp here, on the verge of completing another very important piece of legislation in the early part of this Congress. We would like to wrap it up today if at all possible.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.                          ____________________[Page S2297]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                                SCHEDULE  Mr. McCONNELL.
