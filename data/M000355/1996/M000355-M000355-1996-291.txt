 President, I can answer my colleague's question very directly and without ambiguity. Yes.  Yes, the Subcommittee on Foreign Operations recognizes the commitment that Jordan has made to peace in theMiddle East. Jordan has joined with Israel in a treaty of peace. The subcommittee believes that the lease of F-16 aircraft to Jordan, a transfer of military equipment which is supported by Israel, will strengthen Jordan militarily and provide a strong signal of United States support for King Hussein and the people of Jordan as partners with Israel in the quest for peace in the Middle East.  It is the subcommittee's intention that the grant funding which we recommend to finance the required upgrades will be used to support the U.S. private sector and further serve U.S. interests by enhancing the defense industrial base. While third countries may participate in maintenance programs at a later date, the subcommittee believes that, insofar as the upgrades are concerned, the original U.S. manufacturer can best insure quality control, cost management, and interoperability with U.S. Air Force units.
