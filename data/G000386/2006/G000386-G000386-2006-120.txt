 President, I rise today to pay tribute to PFC William Edgerton Thorn who died honorably Thursday, August 24 at 8 a.m. in Baghdad at the age of 26. He was killed in Operation Iraqi Freedom after an improvised explosive devise detonated near his vehicle.  Given the opportunity to protect the people he loved and his strong belief in the cause, Willy, as he was known among family and friends, fought proudly. Similarly, Corey, his wife, is serving her country in Iraq. The couple was married on November 10, 2001 and enlisted in the Army in May of 2005. While they realized the dangers and hardships, they were willing to risk their lives for the freedom of others. My thoughts and prayers are with Corey Thorne at this difficult time, and I thank her for her service and tremendous sacrifice.  Willy loved making children laugh, and he and his wife hoped to save enough money to adopt a baby. His death is deeply mourned by his hometown, Rock Valley, and throughout the nation. Thus there is great truth in what Willy's mother-in-law, Deb Jasper, said ``A fallen soldier hits everyone because they have fallen for each and every one of us. What a sacrifice. What an honor.'' We, the American people, are forever indebted to Willy for his great strength and heroic sacrifice.                    Staff Sergeant Jeffrey J. Hansen
