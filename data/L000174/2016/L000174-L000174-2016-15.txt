President, mountains, rivers, cities, and plains separate Vermont and California, two States as different as any in the country. But here in the U.S. Senate, we are on equal footing. It is one of the hallmarks of our Constitution and representative government. For over three decades, Barbara Boxer worked to advance the priorities of Californians. Thankfully, in many ways, those priorities, despite the diversity of our States, have mirrored those of Vermonters.  A trailblazer in her own right, Senator Boxer rose to become the first woman to chair the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, where she fought to protect and preserve our environment, promote clean and safe drinking water, update our antiquated infrastructure, and improve public safety.  Senator Boxer was an early and vocal supporter of our efforts to reauthorize and expand the important Violence Against Women Act. Her passionate pleas to Senators and Members of the House to approve this critical--and lifesaving--bill was essential to the Senate's debate.  Of course, most important in Senator Boxer's life is her family. Like many, I was touched when she announced her retirement in an interview with her grandson. She has been a tireless advocate for her home State and for the country. And now, in retirement, I hope she enjoys even more time with Stewart and her wonderful family. Far from finished fighting, I know Barbara's voice will not be one soon forgotten in the U.S. Senate.                          ____________________
