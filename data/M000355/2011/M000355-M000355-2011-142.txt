  At the end of cloture, as I just heard the Parliamentarian say, we would be entitled to offer it anyway. We are trying to cooperate and get these motions lined up in a way that would give everybody an opportunity to vote shortly.  I just would say to my friend the majority leader, it doesn't seem to me unreasonable for the minority to be able to pick the minority's amendments. It was challenging enough for us to filter our way through the hundreds that my Members would have liked to have offered to get down to seven. It was particularly challenging since they were not allowed to offer any amendments prior to cloture on the bill, which would be the normal process around here.
