 President, when my friend Senator Flake talks about reforming Social Security, what he is talking about is cutting Social Security. He is suggesting that is the only way we can save Social Security. Of course, that is nonsense. I would urge my good friend from Arizona to get on board legislation that I will be offering. Do you know what it does? It extends the life of Social Security for 55years and expands benefits, and it does that by lifting the cap so that billionaires contribute more into the Social Security trust fund.  To suggest that nobody on this side wants to do anything is inaccurate. We do want to do something. We want to raise benefits and extend the life of Social Security. And, yes, some campaign donors--billionaires--may have to pay more in taxes.  I urge my colleagues to reject the Flake amendment and support the Sanders amendment.  Mr. President, I raise a point of order that the pending amendment, No. 52, is not germane to the underlying resolution and therefore violates section 305(b)2 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.
