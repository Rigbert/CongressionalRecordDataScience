 President, I have decided to vote against the National Consumer Credit Reporting System Improvement Act because, bottom line, this bill reduces the privacy rights of 36 million Californians.  These rights were obtained through the passage of landmark legislation sponsored by Senator Jackie Speier earlier this year in California, which gave consumers the right to tell financial institutions that they don't want their most sensitive personal information shared with hundreds or even thousands of affiliated companies.  This practice--affiliate sharing--can include your most sensitive information--the stocks you own, the certificates of deposit you hold, or the amount of money in your checking account.  Importantly, California's financial industry signed off on Senator Speier's bill, rather than face a ballot initiative, which likely would have succeeded.  Industry executives said at the time that the California bill ``encompasses all aspects of the workability needed to ensure protection of customers' privacy'' and that it is ``a workable, reasonable compromise.'' In fact, the only major reservation expressed about that provision was that the bill did not represent a national standard. But now, given the opportunity to set such a national standard, these same companies worked to wipe out such protections--and I find this conduct particularly concerning. Attached is a letter from Senator Speier that attests to the behavior of California's financial industry.  So in response to calls for a national standard and to protect the rights of Californians, Senator Boxer and I developed an amendment that would have established a strong national standard on affiliate sharing, consistent with California's law, which would have given consumers a real voice in how their personal information is used.  This amendment came up for a vote and, unfortunately, it was defeated. I think time will show that this was the wrong vote, and I have no doubt that this issue will resurface as consumers learn more about the misuse of their most sensitive personal information.  I am disappointed that we did not achieve our main goal of adopting an amendment which would allow consumers to have control over their personal data, but I am pleased that the Senate approved two amendments, which I sponsored along with Senator Boxer, to protect consumers.  The first amendment, authorized by Senator Boxer, which I cosponsored, would give consumers greater protection against unwanted marketing.  Most importantly, the amendment would allow consumers to permanently opt-out of marketing by unrelated affiliates, while the underlying bill would have only limited the opt-out to 5 years. This means that if a consumer asks a corporation not to share information with its affiliates for the purpose of marketing, the affiliate cannot solicit them--forever. Without this amendment, a consumer would have been required to go back to the corporation and reiterate his request after 5 years.  Additionally, this amendment clarified what the bill meant by a ``pre-existing business relationship'', where there was no definition before. With this amendment, a company's affiliate would only be able to market to consumers who have:  One, purchased, rented or leased the seller's goods or services or completed a financial transaction between the consumer and seller, within the 18 months immediately preceding the date of a solicitation; or  Two, inquired about or applied for a product or service offered by the seller, within the 3 months immediately preceding the marketing contact.  Without this clarification, companies might have been able to market to customers who purchased goods as many as 5 or 10 years earlier, or who made the mildest inquiry a few years ago. It is the same definition developed by the Federal Trade Commission in creating a national ``Do Not Call'' registry for telemarketers.  The Senate also adopted a second amendment, which I authored and was cosponsored by Senators Boxer and Kennedy, that essentially provided a far more encompassing definition of medical information than is contained in current law.  Simply put, this amendment will help ensure that consumers aren't discriminated against based on their medical or health information when they apply for credit, insurance, or employment. The amendment also has the support of the American Medical Association, the American Cancer Society, and the California Medical Association.  The Feinstein amendment would broadly expand the definition of ``medical information'' to read:       Information or data except age or gender, whether oral or      recorded in any form or medium, created by or derived from a      health care provider or the consumer that relates to:       (1) The past, present or future physical, mental or      behavioral health or condition of an individual;       (2) The provision of health care to an individual; or       (3) Payment for the provision of health care to an      individual.  This is the same definition of medical information established by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners in 2002. This definition has been implemented in a vast majority of our states.  Even with these modest amendments, however, I cannot support the reauthorization of the Fair Credit Reporting Act.  The Boxer-Feinstein marketing amendment will help prevent consumers from receiving unwanted solicitation, but it will do nothing to limitthe ability of companies to share information with their affiliates.  Affiliates, therefore, will continue to be able to use personal information to profile consumers in a way that leads to unfair increases in premiums or interest rates, to giving certain consumers inferior service, or to outrightly deny them credit cards, insurance policies, or other products.  Furthermore, the bill will do nothing to stop the creation of ``internal credit reports'' by large financial institutions. Unlike with traditional credit reports, consumers will continue to have no ability to access or correct errors in these documents.  Most Americans consider their personal information their private property. Yet, this bill will continue to deprive ordinary American consumers from having any choice over how their information is shared in the business world. This is the fundamental issue.  To give you a sense of the deep support for privacy, I would point to a survey of California voters completed on February 7 of this year.  The statewide survey found that by a 91-to-7 percent margin, California voters would favor a ballot proposition that ``would require a bank, a credit card company, insurance company, or other financial institution to notify a customer and receive a customer's permission before selling any financial information to any separate financial or non-financial company.''  This means that 9 out of 10 Californians support even stronger protections--where companies would have to gain your prior consent--opt-in--to share your financial data--than the amendment which Senator Boxer and I offered. And polls across the country reflected similar levels of support by Americans for stronger privacy laws.  This only underscores the need for strong federal standards. Clearly, businesses should be able to manage customer information in order to enhance services. But there must be strong rules that protect consumers. That is why Congress should have given consumers a choice--allowing them to tall companies that they don't want their most personal information shared.  So despite the fact that I support efforts in this legislation to combat identity theft and improve consumer access to credit report information, I believe that the bill doesn't do enough to protect consumer's privacy, and that is why I am voting against it.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from Senator Jackie Speier be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                      California State Senate,                                 Sacramento, CA, October 24, 2003.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senator, California,     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.     Hon. Barbara Boxer,     U.S. Senator, California,     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Feinstein and Boxer: I wish to thank you for      your efforts on behalf of consumer privacy rights, and urge      you continue to do all that is possible to protect      California's hard-fought consumer privacy gains.       It has recently come to my attention that the financial      services industry has been criticizing the contents of your      amendment to S. 1753, substituting the newly-enacted and      stronger California privacy standard on affiliate sharing in      the ``corporate family of companies,'' as unworkable and      unreasonable. This same industry recently called my      California bill ``workable and reasonable,'' specifically      removing their opposition to my measure and lavishing praise      on it, even helping to gather votes. Industry made it clear      that my bill met their workability concerns, progress made      with their active participation. If my bill was workable for      industry in California, then why shouldn't it be the national      standard? A transcript of their August 14, 2003, public      comments bear this out and is attached.       One industry representative stood with me on that day and      said my bill ``encompasses all aspects of the workability      needed to ensure protection of customers' privacy,'' while      another called it ``a balanced measure that will provide      meaningful privacy protections to consumers while also      addressing the workability concerns'' that industry had. Now      the story is different, as industry sees a political      opportunity to preempt California's standard on affiliate      sharing with a weaker one.       The financial services industry appears to be acting in bad      faith--it seems willing to say and do anything to erode      California's recent progress on behalf of consumers, first to      avoid a costly initiative battle and local ordinances      limiting third-party sharing, now to pull the wool over      Congress' eyes. Does the financial services industry really      believe that millions of American consumers don't deserve a      choice over what happens when their personal financial      information, their financial DNA, is shared with thousands of      affiliated companies? The industry's position is flawed      public policy, weaker than their own standards abroad, and      the kind of business practice that erodes consumer      confidence.       I urge you to continue your efforts in making California's      privacy standards those of the nation. California's affiliate      standard was good enough for the financial industry two      months ago; it certainly is acceptable now. Thank you again      for your efforts; I stand ready to help you in any way      possible.           All the best,                                                    Jackie Speier,                                         California State Senator.
