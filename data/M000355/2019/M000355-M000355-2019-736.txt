 President, recently my home State of Kentucky had the opportunity to celebrate the 103rd birthday of a truly remarkable individual. Brigadier General Ron Van Stockum marked the occasion by sharing his lifetime full of rich memories in Shelbyville's ``Sentinel-News.'' I would like to take a moment today to pay tribute to my friend and join Ron's admirers across Kentucky in thanking him for his service.  Ron was born in England in the midst of the First World War. His father, a sergeant in the British forces, was tragically killed in the Battle of the Somme a week before the birth of his son. While her heart may have been broken, Ron's mother Florence felt determined to continue serving their Nation in uniform. Before his second birthday, Florence placed Ron in the care of their relatives and joined the Women's Royal Air Force.  Through her service in the war effort, Florence first met Anton Van Stockum, an immigrant to the United States who volunteered to serve his adoptive homeland in the U.S. Army Air Corps. Florence and Anton quickly developed an affection for one another, sharing a letter-writing correspondence that lasted beyond the war's conclusion.  Returning home, Anton settled in Seattle, WA, and worked at a lumber mill. Florence decided to travel with Ron, now nearly four, to visit her pen pal. It was a journey that would forever change their lives and set Ron on a previously unimagined path.  After traveling thousands of miles, Florence and Ron finally reunited with Anton in British Columbia. They married and settled in the United States to start a new family. Interestingly, no record was made of Ron's entry into our country. That oversight would prove challenging in the coming years when Ron, like his father, mother, and stepfather before him, chose to serve in uniform.  While studying at the University of Washington, Ron sought to enter the Advanced Reserve Officers' Training Corps. It would be his first step in a distinguished career of service. Without an official proof of citizenship, however, he almost wasn't allowed in at all. Ron and his family were forced to gather multiple testimonials documenting his life in the United States and attesting to his story. He was permitted to join the ROTC and was later commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Marine Corps. The experience led Ron to value the high honor of calling himself an American.  For the next three decades, Ron honorably served as a marine. During World War II, he was part of the amphibious assaults in the Pacific. Ron also served at sea with the Navy aboard a battleship and an aircraft carrier. Because of his diligent service and remarkable merit, he eventually achieved the rank of brigadier general.  When Ron retired from active duty, he and his wife Susanne moved to her family's historic farm in Shelby County, KY. Since 1970, our Commonwealth has been made better because of Ron's many contributions to the State. Here, he began his second career in education. Spending 11 years at my alma mater, the University of Louisville, Ron served as the assistant dean for administration at the school of medicine and later as the assistant to the president of Uof L.  In 1981, Ron began what he calls his second retirement, but his friends knew there was no chance he would slow down. Since then, he has written six books chronicling the history of our Commonwealth and his own family lineage. He has also taken to writing for the ``Sentinel-News,'' and he has published more than 250 columns on a wide variety of interests.  Over the years, it is been a privilege to call this great American a dear friend, and I've enjoyed reading his reflections. As he celebrates his 103rd birthday, I share my sincere congratulations and best wishes. We are so proud of his contributions to our Commonwealth and his service to this Nation. I urge my Senate colleagues to join me in wishing a happy birthday and many future successes to Brigadier General Ron Van Stockum.                          ____________________
