Speaker, in the ranks of federal workers are many exceptional people. I want to draw the House's attention to the latest achievement, and lifetime of service, of one federal employee who lives in my congressional district: Ms. Virginia F. Saunders, of Beltsville, Maryland.  Ms. Saunders, a dedicated Government Printing Office employee for over fifty years, was recently presented the James Bennett Childs Award by the American Library Association's Government Documents Round Table. This prestigious honor, reserved for persons making extraordinary contributions in the field of government documents librarianship, was awarded to Ms. Saunders in June at the ALA's annual convention in New Orleans. She received the Childs Award in recognition of her work in the compilation and publication of the U.S. Congressional Serial Set, which since 1817 has collected all numbered Senate and House documents into an authoritative, permanent record of the U.S. Congress.  Mr. Saunders has served with distinction at the GPO since 1946, when Harry Truman was President. For the last 30 years, she has been the individual primarily responsible for the Serial Set, a publication of incalculable value to library collections, historians, researchers, and students everywhere.  In the words of historian Dee Brown, the U.S. Congressional Serial Set ``contains almost everything about the American experience . . . our wars, our peacetime works, our explorations and inventions . . . If we lost everything in print, except our documents, we would still have a splendid record and a memory of our past experience.'' As the GPO's 1994 Report of the Serial Set Study Group pointed out, researchers and librarians agree that the Serial Set is ``without peer in representative democracies throughout the western world as a documentary compendium.''  Throughout her career, Virginia Saunders has worked tirelessly to improve the Serial Set, and has generously shared her knowledge with document librarians across the country. In 1998, she delivered an overview of the Serial Set's history at the 7th Annual Federal Depository Library Conference. In addition, she has served as a penalist at the ALA's annual conference.  This latest award is not Saunders' first recognition for her exemplary service. In 1989, her timely, common-sense suggestion that duplicative House and Senate reports stemming from the Iran-Contra investigation be assigned serial numbers as required, but not bound, saved the government more than $600,000, and earned her commendations from the Public Printer and President George Bush.  Her nomination for the Childs Award summarized her work with the Serial Set as follows: ``Ms. Saunders has not only meticulously maintained a set for records of vital importance to the Nation, but has worked with information professionals and Government officials to improve it, to lower costs, and to enhance its accessibility to librarians, researchers, and the public.''  Mr. Speaker, let's join in offering our heartfelt congratulations to Virginia Saunders for her latest achievement, and our sincere thanks for her lifetime of service and a job well done.                          ____________________
