President, I say through the Chair that I wish to join in. I started my career as a staffer and then as a Parliamentarian so I know what happens behind the scenes is sometimes even more important than what you see on the floor of the Senate.  For 25 years, Tim Mitchell has been behind the scenes and at the heart of the activity in the U.S. Senate. I have been here for 20 years and have relied on Tim and our great staff team that has really stepped up time and time again.  Like most people, it took just a minute or two in the Senate cloakroom to realize that Tim Mitchell is the biggest baseball fan I have ever run into. I didn't know he had 100 baseball neckties, but he does, and as Senator Reid said, some are very challenging from a style viewpoint, but he is loyal to his sport and particularly to his team, the Boston Red Sox.  I watched him as he came into his glory moment when the Boston Red Sox won the World Series after a long wait. I know he is now looking for the Boston Red Sox to return to the World Series, and I have a pairing in my mind that would be perfect. It involves a former Red Sox President who came over to help the Chicago Cubs. His name is Theo Epstein, and he made history in Boston by taking the Red Sox to the World Series. We think he is going to make history in Chicago. This would be the perfect World Series for Tim, me, and for baseball.  Let me close by saying that would be a perfect World Series, you have been a perfect addition to the Senate for 25 years, and we look forward to a lot more ahead.  Thanks, Tim.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rounds). The Senator from Washington.
