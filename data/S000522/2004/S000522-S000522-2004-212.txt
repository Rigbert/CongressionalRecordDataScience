Mr. Chairman, I rise to engage in a colloquy with the gentleman from California, chairman of the Committee on Armed Services. I want to thank the gentleman for his support and leadership on a significant matter affecting the security of our Nation's military installations. Last year scores of undocumented workers were arrested at several DoD installations across the country, including New Jersey. In the post-9/11 world, we simply cannot afford to allow our contractors to hire undocumented and unskilled workers to work on military bases.  As the gentleman knows, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Saxton), the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LoBiondo), and I have worked together with him to address this problem. Section 822 of H.R. 4200 authorizes a demonstration project intended to provide incentives to contractors who have a meaningful and comprehensive skilled worker staffing plan to ensure all workers are properly documented.
