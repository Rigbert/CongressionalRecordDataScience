Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to congratulate Mr. Randy Johnson on his perfect game. Throughout his long career, Mr. Johnson has been a fierce opponent with his vicious change-up and scorching fastball. On May 18, Mr. Johnson achieved perfection. At the age of 40, and after being awarded the Cy Young award in both the American and National Leagues, Randy Johnson threw a perfect game. He is the oldest pitcher to achieve this athletic triumph.  With this achievement, Mr. Johnson joins an elite class of pitchers that spans the history of America's game and include baseball legends Cy Young, Don Larsen, Sandy Koufax, and Catfish Hunter.  Mr. Johnson has been one of the preeminent pitchers in baseball over a career that has spanned 17 years. We congratulate Randy Johnson for pitching a perfect game and recognize him for a brilliant pitching career.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
