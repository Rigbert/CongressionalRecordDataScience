President, reserving the right to object, I did not hear.  Mr. McCONNELL. Let me say that the amendment of the Senator from Georgia will be laid aside after he finishes his discussion.  We will vote first in the morning on the amendment of the Senator from Arizona, Senator McCain, and no time agreement will be entered into tonight for a time certain on a vote on the Coverdell amendment.  I yield the floor.
