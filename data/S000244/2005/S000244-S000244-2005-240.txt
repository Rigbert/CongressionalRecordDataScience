Res. 547) expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit deplorably infringed on parental rights in Fields v. Palmdale School District.  The Clerk read as follows:                              H. Res. 547       Whereas the Palmdale School District sent parents of      elementary school students at Mesquite Elementary School in      Palmdale, California a letter requesting consent to give a      psychological assessment questionnaire to their first, third,      and fifth grade students;       Whereas without the informed consent of their parents, the      young students were instead administered a questionnaire that      contained sexually explicit and developmentally inappropriate      questions;       Whereas seven parents subsequently filed a complaint      against the Palmdale School District in a Federal district      court;       Whereas on November 2, 2005, a 3-judge panel of the Ninth      Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the United      States District Court for the Central District of California      in the case (Fields v. Palmdale School District) and held      that parents ``have no constitutional right . . . to prevent      a public school from providing its students with whatever      information it wishes to provide, sexual or otherwise, when      and as the school determines that it is appropriate to do      so'';       Whereas the Ninth Circuit stated, ``once parents make the      choice as to which school their children will attend, their      fundamental right to control the education of their children      is, at the least, substantially diminished'';       Whereas in Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 401 (1923), the      Supreme Court recognized that the liberty guaranteed by the      14th amendment to the Constitution encompasses ``the power of      parents to control the education of their [children]'';       Whereas the Supreme Court in Pierce v. Society of Sisters,      268 U.S. 510, 534-35 (1925), highlighted the Meyer doctrine      that parents and guardians have the liberty ``to direct the      upbringing and education of children under control'' and      emphasized that ``[t]he child is not the mere creature of the      state; those who nurture him and direct his destiny have the      right, coupled with the high duty, to recognize and prepare      him for additional obligations'';       Whereas in Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 232-33 (1972),      the Supreme Court acknowledged that ``[t]he history and      culture of Western civilization reflect a strong tradition of      parental concern for the nurture and upbringing of their      children. This primary role of the parents in the upbringing      of their children is now established beyond debate as an      enduring American tradition. . . . The duty to prepare the      child for `additional obligations', referred to by the Court      [in Pierce] must be read to include the inculcation of moral      standards, religious beliefs, and elements of good      citizenship'';       Whereas a plurality of the Supreme Court has stated, ``it      cannot now be doubted that the Due Process Clause of the      Fourteenth Amendment protects the fundamental right of      parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and      control of their children'' (Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S.      57, 66 (2000) (plurality opinion));       Whereas the Ninth Circuit's decision in Fields v. Palmdale      School District presupposes that ``parents make the choice as      to which school their children will attend'' when, in fact,      many parents do not have such a choice;       Whereas the decision in Fields establishes a dangerous      precedent for limiting parental involvement in the public      education of their children; and       Whereas the rights of parents ought to be strengthened      whenever possible as they are the cornerstone of American      society: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of      Representatives that--       (1) the fundamental right of parents to direct the      education of their children is firmly grounded in the      Nation's Constitution and traditions;       (2) the Ninth Circuit's ruling in Fields v. Palmdale School      District undermines the fundamental right of parents to      direct the upbringing of their children; and       (3) the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth      Circuit should agree to rehear the case en banc in order to      reverse this constitutionally infirm ruling.
