 President, I heard the objection.  I just have to say, the exchange we just heard is exactly what we have been objecting to. We were told the bill would be online at 9:30 this morning. It was online at 11. I have a copy of it, but we are hearing from the other side now that this isn't the bill. This is a discussion draft. We aren't going to see the bill. We will not see the real bill, apparently, until next week, even though we were told we would see it this morning.  This has been the problem we have had since this discussion started. We started in January with a process which cut us out of this under reconciliation. Thirteen men in a private room wrote this ``discussion draft,'' which is not a bill, that we are supposed to now look at and decide whether we like it--and the American public--a discussion draft, a bill even the other side doesn't know what we have. That is what we are objecting to.  We are asking that the American people--who have a right to know what is going to impact every one of their lives, every one of their families, every one of their communities, every one of their businesses--have more than a discussion draft, more than 10 hours of debate, time to look at it, and know how we are going to do an amendment process next week.
