Speaker, it is bad enough that the Gingrich Republicans are proposing a tax cut for the wealthiest people in America. We expect the Gingrich Republicans to continue to slather the fattest cats with tax cuts and without so much as the slightest regrets, these same Republicans cut children's programs like school lunches to pay for them.  But today the Gingrich Republicans take this extremism to a new low. Late Tuesday night, a handful of lobbyists met secretly with Republican congressional leaders and killed a provision that would have closed a tax loophole for billionaires who renounce their American citizenship, that is right, billionaires who made their fortunes in America using our country's freedoms and opportunities, our economy, our infrastructure, our national defense, renounce their citizenship to escape taxes, and the Republicans want to protect these economic traitors. And our Treasury loses $3.6 billion because of this.  These super-rich traitors and their well-paid lobbyists are the big winners. The Republicans have once again rolled [[Page H3980]] out the red carpet for them. If this latest Republican outrage does not steam the dumplings of every American who ever pledged allegiance to our flag, nothing will.                          ____________________
