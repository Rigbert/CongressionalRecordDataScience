 President, let me thank my long-time foreign policy adviser, Robin Cleveland, who sits here to my right, for her invaluable assistance in developing this package and for her tenacity in sticking with it all the way to the end, which has been a tortuous path and difficult to predict from moment to moment over the last month. Robin's done that with intelligence and good humor when that was required and toughness when that was required. It is always a pleasure to work with her. I have immensely enjoyed doing that over the last 13 years. And to her right, Billy Piper, who also makes an important contribution to this debate every year. Billy has been a pleasure to work with over the course of this legislation . And also Robin's assistant on the committee, Will Smith. I appreciate the important contribution that he has made.  Mr. President, with that, I see my friend and colleague is here, and I will yield the floor.
