Speaker, I rise today as the month of February 2016 comes to a close to recognize a milestone anniversary in the life of Toledo's Indiana Avenue Baptist Church. This month the congregation has been celebrating its 70th anniversary with a series of special gatherings. I was privileged to join the congregation yesterday.  Founded by Reverend M. J. Stephenson in February 1946, the congregation has been shepherded by Reverend John Roberts for more than half a century. Pastor Roberts, in fact, was part of the organizational meeting of the church. Thus, this long standing beacon in our city has been blessed with a continuity of leadership since its beginnings.  Indiana Avenue Missionary Baptist Church's first services in its building were held in its lower level in 1948. An upper level was added twenty years later and since 1980 services have been held in its newer sanctuary. In 1989 a fellowship hall was added which has served the congregation very well, with special focus on activities for youth. The hall bears the name of founding Pastor Stephenson and longtime Pastor Roberts.  Starting with less than 100 members, the congregation of Indiana Avenue Missionary Baptist Church has served over 7,000 people through its seven decades and currently serves about 2,000 people. An anchor in our community, the church serves its faithful while ministering to the needs of its neighbors. One of the wonderful traditions at the church is the Interfaith Mass Choir. The choir's beautiful blend of voices soar in faith-filled praise, lifting up in joy those it reaches through song.  Psalms Chapter 18 Verse 2 tells us, ``The Lord is my rock, my fortress and my deliverer; my God is my rock, in whom I take refuge, my shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold.'' Through the days of its ``threescore and ten'' years, the shepherds and flock of Indiana Avenue Missionary Baptist Church have lived this truth as their lives have given testament to Jesus' message of love which ``bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.'' (1 Corinthians 13:7)                          ____________________
