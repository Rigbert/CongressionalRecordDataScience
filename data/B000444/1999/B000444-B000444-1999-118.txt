 President, this idea that the stockpile is not going to be reliable, that you can't--we have thousands of parts, and the Russians have missiles with bombs with only 100 parts, and that has some significance. I have said it before.  I will yield now. I used to practice law with a guy named Sidney Balick--a good trial lawyer. Every time he would start a jury trial, he would start off by saying: I want you to take a look at my client. I want you to look at him. They're going to tell you he's not such a good looking guy. He's not. They're going to tell you you would not want to invite him home for dinner to meet your daughter. I wouldn't either. They're going to tell you--and he would go on like that. But he would say: I want you to keep your eye on the ball. Keep your eye on the ball. Follow the bouncing ball. Did he kill Cock Robin? That is the question.  The question is, At the end of the day, if we reject this treaty, are we better off in terms of our strategic interest and our national security or are we better off if we accept and ratify the treaty that all our allies have ratified? Which is better? Keep your eye on the ball.  I will respond, as I said, in due time to every argument my friend has made, from ``the safety features argument'' to ``the purpose can't be achieved'' to ``nations that don't have sophisticated weapons are going to be able to cheat,'' and so on and so forth. But in the meantime, out of a matter of comity, which is highly unusual, because I should do a full-blown opening statement, I will yield to my friend from Pennsylvania because he has other commitments. Then I will come back to a point-by-point rebuttal of the statement by my friend from Arizona.  How much time is the Senator seeking?
