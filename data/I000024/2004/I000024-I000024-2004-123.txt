President, I have one sentence before yielding to the Senator from New Mexico. This is a feasibility study. That is all it is. You can keep saying over and over that it is more, but it is not. In the 5-year plan, which says in the event the feasibility study recommends it, and in the event the President recommends it, in the event we authorize it in both the House and Senate, then you can go forward with it. Right now, it is a feasibility study.  With that, I yield the floor.
