 The last two reauthorizations, each one an improvement on the one before, passed this body unanimously. We should do the same. It is not a partisan issue. I ask other Senators, if they haven't spoken with victims of abuse, to speak to those who are; talk to the police chiefs; talk to the people who have to deal with this; talk to the people who have survived some of these horrendous attacks. Ask them if they think this is needed. Ask those who have been protected from further abuse because of the steps we have taken in the Violence Against Women Act--ask them if we need it.  The Presiding Officer and the other 98 Senators come in this building and we are protected by one of the finest police forces that exists, the Capitol Hill Police force. We don't have to worry; nobody is going to attack us. In the Presiding Officer's State and my State and all of the other States, unfortunately, thousands of people cannot rest easily that way. They know their attacker and often they know their attacker is waiting to do it again. We can easily stand up and say here in the Senate: No, we won't stand for this violence against women. Let's take the steps that we can take, the men and women in this body. Let's take the steps we can take to stop the violence.                               Exhibit 1                                                   April 19, 2012.     Hon. Harry Reid     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,          Washington, DC.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building,          Washington, DC.       Dear Majority Leader Reid and Minority Leader McConnell: As      mayors who collectively represent over seven and a half      million women, we believe it is imperative that the Senate      pass S. 1925, the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act      of 2011. Despite considerable progress over the past two      decades in addressing the epidemic of violence against women,      we recognize that much more needs to be done and that this      legislation will strengthen our national commitment to      tackling the challenges that remain.       Since 1994, the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) has      provided a comprehensive, coordinated, and community-based      approach toward reducing domestic violence, sexual assault,      stalking, and other forms of violence. Over the past two      decades, its programs and services have provided lifesaving      assistance to hundreds of thousands of victims. Through      victim support programs, local and state funding assistance,      and the U Visa program, VAWA has strengthened the ability of      the criminal justice system to investigate and prosecute      crimes and hold violent perpetrators accountable. These      efforts have contributed to dramatic reductions in the      incidence and impact of violence against women, including an      over 50 percent decline in the annual rate of domestic      violence. As we seek to make further progress, we believe it      is essential that we provide services to victims regardless      of their gender, race, language, Immigration status, or      sexual orientation.       As mayors, we have seen the tremendous positive impact of      the Violence Against Women Act in our communities. In New      York, VAWA funding has helped open three Family Justice      Centers, which are one-stop domestic violence centers with      staff from government agencies and nonprofit organizations to      assist victims of domestic violence. In Los Angeles, VAWA      funding has also helped expand its Domestic Abuse Response      Team--a collaborative effort between law enforcement officers      and victim advocates to respond to domestic violence calls at      the scene of the crime and provide crisis intervention. The      Chicago Police Department uses its funding to train staff to      assist victims of domestic abuse in an effort to provide the      best resources to these victims. These are just a few      examples of the vital services and assistance that this      landmark law has enabled communities all over the country to      provide to combat this terrible problem.       Despite the progress that has been made, much more needs to      be done. Still today, nearly one in five women have been      sexually assaulted or raped in their lifetime, and 45 percent      of the women killed in the United States die at the hands of      an intimate partner. This level of violence is simply      unacceptable. We believe that S. 1925--like the 2000 and 2005      reauthorizations that preceded it--will help us better      address continuing problems and remaining unmet needs. This      legislation will expand services to immigrant and lesbian,      gay, and transgendered communities, who not only experience      the highest rates of violence but often have the most      difficulty in accessing services. in recognition of the      persistent problem of sexual violence, S. 1925 also will      strengthen the capacity of local, state, and federal law      enforcement to investigate and prosecute these crimes. While      these tools will be essential in     achieving justice, they are also a reminder of the wide      impact that domestic violence has on the community at large      including law enforcement. In each of our cities, police      officers have been injured or murdered while responding to      domestic violence incidents.       For these reasons, we believe that it is critical that the      Senate move quickly to take up and pass S. 1925 in order to      strengthen our national commitment to all victims of domestic      violence.           Sincerely,     Rahm Emanuel,       Mayor, City of Chicago.     Antonio R. Villaraigosa,       Mayor, City of Los Angeles.     Michael R. Bloomberg,       Mayor, City of New York.                                  ____                                              National Association                                         of Attorneys General,                                 Washington, DC, January 11, 2012.       Dear Members of Congress, Since its passage in 1994, the      Violence Against Women Act (``VAWA'') has shined a bright      light on domestic violence, bringing the issue out of the      shadows and into the forefront of our efforts to protect      women and families. VAWA transformed the response to domestic      violence at the local, state and federal level. Its successes      have been dramatic, with the annual incidence of domestic      violence falling by more than 50 percent.       Even though the advancements made since in 1994 have been      significant, a tremendous amount of work remains and we      believe it is critical that the Congress reauthorize VAWA.      Every day in this country, abusive husbands or partners kill      three women, and for every victim killed, there are nine more      who narrowly escape that fate. We see this realized in our      home states every day. Earlier this year in Delaware, three      children--ages 12, 2\1/2\ and 1\1/2\--watched their mother be      beaten to death by her ex-boyfriend on a sidewalk. In Maine      last summer, an abusive husband subject to a protective order      murdered his wife and two young children before taking his      own life.       Reauthorizing VAWA will send a clear message that this      country does not tolerate violence against women and show      Congress' commitment to reducing domestic violence,      protecting women from sexual assault and securing justice for      victims.       VAWA reauthorization will continue critical support for      victim services and target three key areas where data shows      we must focus our efforts in order to have the greatest      impact:       Domestic violence, dating violence, and sexual assault are      most prevalent among young women aged 16 24, with studies      showing that youth attitudes are still largely tolerant of      violence, and that women abused in adolescence are more      likely to be abused again as adults. VAWA reauthorization      will help us break that cycle by consolidating and      strengthening programs aimed at both prevention and      intervention, with a particular emphasis on more effectively      engaging men and local community-based resources in the      process.       A woman who has been sexually assaulted can be subjected to      further distress when the healthcare, law enforcement, and      legal response to her attack is not coordinated and      productive. Whether it is a first responder without adequate      training, a rape kit that goes unprocessed for lack of      funding, or a phone call between a crisis counselor and a      prosecutor that never takes place, sexual assault victims      deserve better. We must develop and implement best practices,      training, and communication tools across disciplines in order      to effectively prosecute and punish perpetrators, as well as      help victims heal and rebuild their lives.       There is a growing consensus among practitioners and      researchers that domestic violence homicides are predictable      and, therefore, often preventable. We can save the lives of      untold numbers of potential homicide victims with better      training for advocates, law enforcement, and others who      interact with victims to recognize the warning signs and      react meaningfully.       The fight to protect women from violence is one that never      ends. It is not a year-to-year issue, which is why we think      it is critical that Congress reauthorize the Violence Against      Women Act. We know a great deal more about domestic violence,      dating violence, sexual assault and stalking than we did 17      years ago. Reauthorizing VAWA will allow us to build on those      lessons and continue to make progress and save lives.       VAWA was last reauthorized in 2006 and time is of the      essence for reauthorization of this important law. We urge      Congress to take on this critical mission and reauthorize      VAWA.       Thank you.

Leahy, D VT, and 60 cosponsors, Apr. 23, 2012)       The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of S.      1925 to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, a      landmark piece of bipartisan legislation that first passed      the Congress in 1994 and has twice been reauthorized. That      Act transformed the Nation's response to violence against      women and brought critically needed resources to States and      local communities to address these crimes.       The Administration is pleased that S. 1925 continues that      bipartisan progress and targets resources to address today's      most pressing issues. Sexual assault remains one of the most      underreported violent crimes in the country. The bill      provides funding through State grants to improve the criminal      justice response to sexual assault and to better connect      victims with services. The bill also seeks to reduce domestic      violence homicides and address the high rates of violence      experienced by teens and young adults. Reaching young people      through early intervention can break the cycle of violence.       The Administration strongly supports measures in S. 1925      that will bring justice to Native American victims. Rates of      domestic violence against Native American women are now among      the highest in the United States. The bill builds on the      Tribal Law and Order Act--which President Obama signed on      July 29, 2010--to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of      tribal justice systems and will provide additional tools to      tribal and Federal prosecutors to address domestic violence      in Indian country. The Administration also supports the      important leadership role of the Office on Violence Against      Women and believes that all victims should have access to      critically needed services and protections.                          ____________________
