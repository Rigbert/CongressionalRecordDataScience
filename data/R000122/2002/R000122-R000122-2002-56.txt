President, I rise today to express my support for the fiscal year 2003 Defense authorization bill. I believe this bill provides the needed resources to compensate and to reward the men and women in uniform who are doing an extraordinary job protecting this country across the globe and here at home. I also think the bill will provide the funding and the direction to continue the transformation of our military forces so that we are able to meet the new emerging threats of this new century.  This year, I again served as chairman of the Strategic Subcommittee. This subcommittee focuses on strategic systems, space systems, missile defense, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance programs, and the national security functions of the Department of Energy. The subcommittee and the full committee held seven hearings dealing with matters in the subcommittee's jurisdiction.  The issues addressed by the subcommittee cover a wide range of subjects. These issues include the Nuclear Posture Review, which the Defense Department issued in December, which covers our strategic nuclear plan; the creation of a new Missile Defense Agency, which replaced the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization; increased concerns about the security of nuclear weapons and materials; the need to substantially restructure several space programs; and proposed reductions to the number of deployed nuclear weapons in the context of the new and very commendable agreement with Russia.  Let me turn, first, to the issues of strategic systems.  The strategic systems that fall within the jurisdiction of the Strategic Subcommittee include long-range bombers, the land-based and sea-based ballistic missile forces, and the broad range of matters pertaining to nuclear weapons in the Department of Defense.  In the area of strategic systems, the bill, as reported, adds $23 million to keep the Minuteman III ICBM upgrade programs and the effort to retire the Peacekeeper on track, as has been requested by the Air Force in their list of unfunded requirements.  The Peacekeeper and the Minuteman III missiles are both land-based missile systems. When the Peacekeeper is retired, Minuteman III will be the only land-based system, so it is very important to ensure, for our nuclear deterrence, that the process of retirement of Peacekeeper and modernization of Minuteman III continues at the appropriate pace.  Under the terms of the Nuclear Posture Review, the Department of Defense plans to eliminate all 50 of the Peacekeeper missiles and download the 500 Minuteman III missiles from their current multi-warhead configuration to a single warhead. This is a significant step in reducing the threat posed by nuclear weapons and one of the major reasons that the United States and Russia were able to come to an agreement.  Reducing the number of warheads on the Minuteman III to one warhead per missile, and removing all of the warheads from retiring Peacekeeper missiles, is a key to achieving the goals of a reduced number of deployed missiles that are at the heart of the agreement with the United States and Russia.  The commitment is to reduce the number of deployed nuclear warheads to the range of 1,700 to 2,200 from the present approximately 6,000 deployed warheads.  Also, this will provide more stability, as missiles with single warheads, in the context of deterrence policy, are a more stable element than multi-warhead missiles.  These are all encouraging developments, but it is necessary to keep this process on track by the additional funds which we have added to this legislation.  The subcommittee is also concerned about ensuring that the long-range bomber fleet is modernized and maintained. These bombers, particularly the B-2 and the B-52, have repeatedly showed their usefulness in conflicts from Desert Storm to present operations. There are no plans to replace these bombers in the near future. In fact, in 2000, when the Air Force last reviewed the projected lifetime of these bombers, they determined they could rely on these bombers for an additional 30 years. The reality is, the pilots who will retire the B-52 and B-2 bombers have not yet been born.  We have to maintain these systems, upgrade their electronics and avionics, to make sure they are still a valuable and decisive part of our forces.  This bill would include an additional $28 million to address shortfalls in the B-2 and B-52 bomber programs, and also approves the request by the Department of Defense to reduce and consolidate the B-1 fleet.  Adding these additional funds is absolutely necessary if the Air Force projections are correct, and we will have these systems--the B-2 and the B-52--in our inventory for an additional 30 years.  Turning to the area of space, another jurisdiction of the Strategic Subcommittee, we considered a variety of very important Defense Department space programs. These programs include satellite programs that provide communications, weather, global positioning systems, early warning, and other satellites for defense and national security purposes.  Space programs are critical to the effective use of our Nation's military forces, and each day they grow in importance. This is a very important aspect of our deliberations.  We also included in our consideration the ability of the United States to continue to effectively launch space vehicles by looking at the east coast ranges in Florida and the west coast ranges in California.  The bill includes funding at the requested levels for most of the Department of Defense space programs. There are some exceptions, however. The committee has added $29 million to continue to improve the readiness and operations safety at the east coast and west coast space launch and range facilities. If we cannot launch vehicles into space, we cannot ensure that we have the appropriate constellation of satellites to communicate, to provide intelligence resources, to provide global positioning signals--all the things that are critical to the success of our military forces in the field. These ranges are important, and these additional funds will upgrade their ability to continue to play a vital role in our national security.  The bill also includes reductions in certain space programs. One of these programs is the Space-Based Infrared Radar-High or SBIRS-High satellite program. This is a satellite program which is critical to replacing an older and aging system of satellites that provides early warning of missile launches and other activities of concern to the United States.  The worldwide reach of this satellite system is key to its ability to warn of any launches and to provide other critical intelligence. But this program has been plagued with serious problems. It is overbudget and years behind schedule. It is in the process of being restructured by the Department of Defense.  Reflecting this restructuring, the bill reduces the over $800 million budget request for SBIRS-High by $100 million so that this restructuring can literally catch up with the funding stream. I think this is an appropriate way to continue to maintain the defense capabilities of the United States while recognizing a program that is in the midst of serious restructuring by the Department of Defense.  The bill also reduces the requested funding for another satellite that has had a troubled history; and that is the Advanced Extremely High Frequency, or Advanced EHF satellite. This satellite program is designed to ensure that the Department of Defense and the military services will retain the ability to have a reliable and survivable communication. Advanced EHF, like SBIRS-High, is a replacement for a current system. But, here again, the program is in serious trouble, overbudget and behind schedule. It, too, is being structured. This restructuring made $95 million available that the Air Force requested be shifted to other high-priority programs. And we have followed their advice and their suggestion.  Space programs are critical to the operations of the U.S. military. As I indicated, with each day, they become more and more critical. But several of these programs, not only the SBIRS-High program and the Advanced EHF communications satellite program, are experiencing significant problems with cost growth and schedule slippage.  Some of the problems with the space programs appear to be connected with the oversight and management of the programs. To address this, the bill includes a legislative provision to ensure the adequate oversight of space programs. This provision would direct the Office of the Secretary of Defense to maintain oversight of space programs and would require the Secretary to submit to Congress a plan on how oversight by OSD and the joint staff will be accomplished. This provision is included largely as a result of testimony before the Strategic Subcommittee in March of 2002 and will ensure that OSD remains and retains an oversight role for space programs.  Under Secretary of the Air Force Peter Teets, when testifying before the subcommittee, stated that the Air Force is facing significant challenges in several of our most important space programs. This bill attempts to address these concerns by ensuring that adequate oversight by the Department of Defense is maintained.  Let me again stress the importance of these programs. We have all been amazed by the extraordinary success of our military forces in Afghanistan. If you listened to the reports of the special forces troops conducting these operations on the ground, one of the key weapons they had was not a cannon or an M-16, it was a global-positioning, range-finding, targeting device which will operate magnificently as long as we have GPS satellites and comparable satellites in the air. So communications and satellites are critical to the special forces soldier on the ground, the aviator in the air, every member of our military forces. We are endeavoring to maintain, to enhance, and to secure the future of our space operations within this legislation.  Let me turn now to another aspect of our responsibilities. That is the intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance functions. This area includes programs such as the Global Hawk and the Predator unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs. We have long supported these very innovative and sophisticated weapons. They have shown their worth, particularly Predator in Afghanistan, and therefore the committee recommends fully funding the administration's request to accelerate the development and procurement of UAVs.  Another area we have supported--and in fact we provide additional support in the legislation--is the acquisition of commercial satellite imagery by the Department of Defense. The bill includes an additional $30 million to authorize the Department to buy commercially available imagery to supplement and complement the imagery which we collect through our own assets. This will enhance our ability to conduct operations. This is an initiative strongly supported by Senator Allard, ranking member of the committee. We join in his support of this very worthy enterprise and endeavor.  Let me turn to some of the aspects in the subcommittee that touch upon the responsibilities of the Department of Energy when it comes to nuclear weapons. We include several provisions addressing DOE programs. The first would ensure that Congress continues to exercise its oversight responsibility with respect to funding for future nuclear weapons activities.  This is absolutely important. In December the administration released a Nuclear Posture Review. This Nuclear Posture Review has been criticized, challenged, identified as perhaps blurring the line between nuclear and conventional responses. This is an area where there is much concern. Again, it reinforces the need for Congress to be informed and responsive to evolving policy with respect to development and deployment and use, potentially--we hope never--of nuclear weapons.  If you look at the Nuclear Posture Review, you will see throughout a new triad which includes offensive strike systems which are described as including both nuclear and nonnuclear.  You will see that in the context and literal words of the Nuclear Posture Review, they have talked about ``in setting requirements for nuclear strike capabilities, distinctions can be made among the contingencies for which the United States must be prepared. Contingencies can generally be categorized as immediate, potential, or unexpected.''  In the realm of immediate, potential, or unexpected contingencies, they list countries such as North Korea, Iraq, Iran, Syria, and Libya. These are countries which may be endeavoring to develop nuclear weapons but at this time are not declared nuclear powers, raising the issue of whether we would abandon a long-term policy that we would not use nuclear weapons as a first strike on a nonnuclear power unless they attack us in conjunction with a nuclear power. This uncertainty, ambiguity, exists. Perhaps it has always existed, but it underscores the need for Congress to be informed, to be part of this evolving discussion and debate about nuclear policy.  Therefore, we would ask that the Department of Energy specifically request funds for any new or modified nuclear weapons. There is no money in this budget for such weapons, but I think at this juncture we have to go on record to ask for that type of specific information and not rely upon finding it buried in some larger account. It is an important issue. It is a critical issue. After the tensions between Pakistan and India, that have not yet subsided totally, no one needs to be reminded about the horrendous impact of the potential use of a nuclear weapon. Therefore, it is vitally important that this Congress be informed of any potential developments of new weapons by the United States.  The budget request did include $15.5 million for a feasibility study of a robust nuclear earth penetrator weapon. The bill denies funding for this purpose and directs the Secretaries of Energy and Defense to submit a report to Congress setting forth the military requirements, the characteristics and types of targets the nuclear earth penetrator would hold at risk, the employment policies of such a nuclear earth penetrator, and an assessment of the capabilities of conventional weapons against these potential targets.  Once again, in the context of a statement by administration officials about the, perhaps, rejection of long-term policy, the nonfirst use against nonnuclear powers, and the ambiguity that has been created, it is essential to stop and look at justification for creating this weapon system.  We already have a nuclear earth penetrator. It is the B61-11; it has been publicly reported. We have the system in place. It is incumbent upon the Departments of Energy and Defense to say why we need to modify another system to do a similar job.  I will also point out there has been some suggestion that what the Department of Energy might be working on is a small mini-nuke that would be less troublesome in terms of radiation, in terms of the impact. Quite seriously, once we cross the nuclear threshold, the size of the weapon may be less important than the fact that we have crossed the threshold.  From the candidates that might be chosen to modify for this robust nuclear earth penetrator, these are very large weapons, hundreds of kilotons, atleast six or seven times the destructive force that was used upon Hiroshima. We have to be very careful. The bill goes ahead and denies the funds and asks the Department of Energy to justify with the report several parameters which are necessary before they go forward, if they do go forward.  The last DOE provision I would like to speak about is a provision that would focus additional resources, $100 million, in cleanup efforts to clean up DOE sites throughout the country that have been polluted by the nuclear activities going back more than 50 years. It is essential to make our commitment to communities throughout this country that have hosted DOE facilities and now see the ground around them literally contaminated, in many cases by nuclear operations. This is very important.  Let me turn to one of the most contentious and challenging issues before the subcommittee. That is the issue of ballistic missile defense. I want to take some time and go into some detail because there are misconceptions and misinformation about what the subcommittee did and what the committee finally approved.  Let me start with the very broad picture. The administration requested $7.6 billion for missile defense. The committee recommends $6.8 billion, a reduction of $812 million, or 11 percent. I should point out that the budget for missile defense has grown dramatically in the last several years. We are still funding this program at a very robust $6.8 billion. The $812 million reduction in ballistic missile defense was transferred to more immediate and pressing needs in the view of the committee.  The most significant, in terms of dollars, was $690 million for additional shipbuilding, which will provide advanced procurement for a new submarine, a new destroyer, and a new troop transport ship, all immediate and vital needs for our military forces.  Some of the additional money would be used to increase the security of the Department of Energy facilities. Again, after the last several weeks, where we thought an al-Qaida operative was making his way to the United States to steal radioactive material to construct a ``dirty'' bomb, the need for enhanced security at DOE sites, as well as many other sites that have radiological material, cannot be underestimated.  Let me talk in general terms about the ballistic missile threat and the programs that are evolving to meet that threat. First, historically and generally, we have categorized this in two ways: short-range threats and the longer range threat of the intercontinental ballistic missile. The reality is that many countries have short-range missiles, some of which are capable of mounting chemical and biological warheads. They are an immediate present threat to U.S. forces deployed throughout the world and to U.S. allies throughout the world.  Intercontinental ballistic missiles are those, obviously, that travel long distances and are designed to strike the homeland of the United States. Those two distinctions have formed most of our programmatic response for many decades.  The administration has come in and, in some respects, blurred the lines between these two distinctions. Rather than the traditional distinction between theater missile and national missile defense, between the short- and medium-range missiles and the longer range intercontinental ballistic missiles, they have talked about creating a missile defense consisting of the boost phase defense systems--those systems designed to strike a missile when it leaves the launch pad, in the 2 or 3 minutes before it gets into the upper atmosphere; in fact, outside of the atmosphere in some cases--a midcourse phase, as the term indicates, which would destroy the missile in the middle of its flight; and the terminal phase, which is the final point where the missile is heading toward its target, coming down rapidly towards its target.  Now, there is a certain logic to this. I have to be fair about that. If one looks at defense in other contexts, such as the more terrestrial contexts of a land battle, defense in depth is a watchword--long-range fires, intermediate fires, and close fires. So there is a logic to this, and it might be unwitting, but there is a blurring and distortion that I think can be misinterpreted--and I think it has been in many cases--with respect to the actual programs we are trying to develop and the progress on those programs.  One case in point is a recent article in the Wall Street Journal, on June 18, where it talks about discussions by General Kadish, about the Navy theater-wide missile system, on which the Journal opined in this article:       The move would represent the first deployment of a      defensive missile shield since a system was first proposed by      President Reagan in the 1980s.  What General Kadish was talking about was a theater missile, not a national missile system. In point of fact, the PAC-3 system, a land based theater system, is being operationally tested now and likely will be deployed. Certainly it is further along in development than this proposed sea based system.  This type of blurring of the lines in recalibration and renaming of systems I think has created a lot of misunderstanding. Hopefully, we can add some clarity today.  As I mentioned before, theater ballistic missiles have long threatened forward deployed U.S. forces. For years we have confronted the potential of a real-time missile attack in North Korea and in other places. Long-range missiles were the source of our long and, fortunately, stalemated cold war with the Soviet Union. They had the capacity to fire missiles intercontinentally. We were able to wait them out or, through deterrence, through our strategic policy, we were able to bring the cold war to a conclusion, and also to have a situation in which now we are making real progress with Russia in terms of strategic arms control. So this distinction between theater missiles and ICBMs is significant.  I think it is appropriate at this point to try to go through the list of the systems which have been developed, which we have been developing, and systems that are the underpinning of this new constellation of missile defenses the administration talks about.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed an article by Philip Coyle, former director of operational test and evaluation in the Department of Defense, in the Arms Control Today of May 2002. It summarizes in excellent detail the systems we are talking about today.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                  [From Arms Control Today, May 2002]            Rhetoric or Reality? Missile Defense Under Bush                           (By Philip Coyle)       Since it assumed office, the administration of President      George W. Bush has made missile defense one of its top      priorities, giving it prominence in policy, funding, and      organization.       First, the administration outlined an ambitious set of      goals that extend well beyond the Clinton administration's      missile defense aims. In early January 2002, Secretary of      Defense Donald Rumsfeld described the administration's top      missile defense objectives his way: ``First, to defend the      U.S., deployed forces, allies, and friends. Second, to employ      a Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) that layers      defenses to intercept missiles in all phases of their flight      (i.e., boost, midcourse, and terminal) against all ranges of      threats. Third, to enable the Services to field elements of      the overall BMDS as soon as practicable.''       Then, in its nuclear posture review, the administration      outlined the specific elements of a national missile defense      that it wants to have ready between 2003 and 2008: an air-     based laser to shoot down missiles of all ranges during boost      phase; a rudimentary ground-based midcourse system, a sea-     based system with rudimentary midcourse capability against      short- and medium-range threats; terminal defenses against      long-range ICBMs capable of reaching the United States; and a      system of satellites to track enemy missiles and distinguish      re-entry vehicles from decoys.       Finally, to speed implementation, the administration has      taken a number of tangible steps. It announced on December      13, 2001, that the United States would withdraw from the 1972      Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty, ostensibly because the      treaty was restricting testing of mobile missile defenses      against y026ICBMs. In its first defense budget, the      administration requested a 57 percent increase in funding for      missile defense--from $5.3 billion to $8.3 billion, of which      it received $7.8 billion. Then, Rumsfeld reorganized the      Ballistic Missile Defense Organization into the new Missile      Defense Agency, cancelled the internal Pentagon documents      that had established the program's developmental goals, and      changed the program's goal from being able to field a      complete system against specific targets to simply being able      to field various missile defense capabilities as they become      available.       All in all, a lot has happened in missile defense in the      first year or so of the Bush administration. But have these      actions brought     the United States any closer to realizing its missile defense      goals, especially deployment of a national missile defense?      And what elements, if any, of a national missile defense      capability might it be possible for the United States to      deploy by 2008, as called for in the nuclear posture review?       Despite the Bush administration's push for missile defense,      the only system likely to be ready by 2008 is a ground-based      theater missile defense intended to counter short-range      targets--i.e., a system to defend troops in the field. Before      Bush leaves office, the only system that could conceivably be      ready to defend the United States itself is the ground-based      midcourse system pursued by the Clinton administration. None      of the other elements mentioned in the nuclear posture review      as possible defenses against strategic ballistic missiles is      likely to be available by 2008.       To understand why, let us examine each of the missile      defense programs--starting with the short-range, theater      missile defense systems and moving to the longer-range,      strategic systems--to see what has happened since the Bush      administration took office 16 months ago. The results suggest      that the Bush administration should not base its foreign      policy on the assumption that during its tenure it will be      able to deploy defenses to protect the United States from      strategic missiles.                        Theater Missile Defenses       Each of the U.S. military services has been pursuing      tactical missile defense programs designed to defend U.S.      troops overseas. None of these programs was designed to      defend the United States against ICBM attacks, and none has      any current capability to do so. However, the administration      hopes to be able to apply some of the technology from these      service programs to a layered national defense capable of      defending the U.S. homeland. (For an explanation of the      various stages of development discussed below, see the box      below.)     PAC-3       The Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) is a tactical      system designed to defend overseas U.S. and allied troops in      a relatively small area against short-range missile threats      (such as Scuds), enemy aircraft, and cruise missiles.      Developmentally, it is the most advanced U.S. missile defense      system, and a small number have been made available for      deployment although testing has not yet been completed.       PAC-3 flight testing began in 1997. From 1997 to 2002, 11      developmental flight tests were conducted, including four      flight intercept tests with two or three targets being      attempted at once. Most of these tests were successful, but      in two of the tests one of the targets was not intercepted.      In February, PAC-3 began initial operational testing, in      which soldiers, not contractors, operate the system. Three      operational tests have been conducted, all with multiple      targets. In each, one of the targets has been missed or one      of the interceptors has failed.       A year ago, PAC-3 was planned to begin full-rate production      at the end of 2001. However, problems with system reliability      and difficulties in flight intercept tests have delayed that      schedule. This means that full-rate production likely will be      delayed until more stressing ``follow-on'' operational tests      can be conducted against targets flying in a wide range of      altitudes and trajectories. In March, Lieutenant General      Ronald Kadish, who heads U.S. missile defense programs,      testified to Congress that the full-rate production decision      would be made toward the end of 2002 (before operational      testing has been completed), representing a delay of about a      year since last year. The full system will be deployed once      all operational testing has been completed, perhaps around      2005.       A future version of PAC-3 is being considered for terminal      defense of the United States. However, PAC-3 was not designed      to counter long-range threats, and no flight intercept tests      have been conducted to demonstrate how it might be      incorporated in a terminal defense layer. Further, the ground      area that can be defended by PAC-3 is so small that it would      take scores of systems to defend just the major U.S. cities.      A version of PAC-3 that could be effective in a national      missile defense is probably a decade away.     THAAD       The Theater High Altitude Air Defense (THAAD) system is      designed to shoot down short- and medium-range missiles in      their terminal phase. THAAD would be used to protect forward-     deployed troops overseas as well as nearby civilian      populations and infrastructure. THAAD is to defend a larger      area against longer-range threats than PAC-3, but it is not      designed to protect the United States from ICBMs.       From 1995 to 1999, 11 developmental flight tests were      performed, including eight in which an intercept was      attempted. After the first six of those flight intercept      tests failed, the program was threatened with cancellation.      Finally, in 1999, THAAD had two successful flight intercept      tests. The THAAD program has not attempted an intercept test      since then, instead focusing on the difficult task or      developing a new, more reliable, higher-performance missile      than the one used in early flight tests.       A year ago, full-rate production was scheduled to begin in      2007 or 2008, but because there were no intercept tests in      2000 or 2001, that schedule has likely slipped two years or      more. In fact, no flight intercept test is scheduled until      2004, and it is therefore unlikely that the first THAAD      system will be deployed before 2010.       The Bush administration is considering THAAD for use in a      layered national missile defense system. Conceptually, THAAD      might be used in conjunction with PAC-3 as part of a terminal      defense, or it could be deployed overseas to intercept enemy      missiles in the boost phase. However, in its current      configuration THAAD is incapable of performing these      missions--even once it has met its Army requirements for      theater missile defense--and therefore a role for THAAD in      national missile defense is probably more than a decade away.     Navy Area Theater Ballistic Missile Defense       The Navy Area Theater Ballistic Missile Defense was the      sea-based equivalent of PAC-3. The Navy Area system was being      designed to defend forward-deployed Navy ships against      relatively short-range threats. But in December 2001 the      program was cancelled because its cost and schedule overruns      exceeded the limits defined by law. (Ironically, the      cancellation came just one day after President Bush announced      that the United States would pull out of the ABM Treaty      because its missile defense testing was advanced enough to be      bumping up against the constraints of the treaty.)       The Navy still wants to be able to defend its ships against      missile attack, and the program will most likely to be      restructured and reinstated once the Navy decides on a new      approach. In the meantime, the Navy Area program is slipping      with each day that passes. As with PAC-3, the Bush      administration has considered extending the Navy Area system      to play a role in the terminal segment of a layered national      missile defense. However, at this point the program is too      poorly defined to allow speculation about when it could      accomplish such a demanding mission.     Navy Theater Wide       The Navy Theater Wide program was originally intended to      defend an area larger than that to be covered by the Navy      Area system--that is, aircraft carrier battle groups and      nearby territory and civilian populations--against medium      range missiles during their midcourse phase. In this sense,      Navy Theater Wide is the sea-based equivalent of THAAD.       In January, the Navy Theater Wide program conducted its      first successful flight intercept test, but a dozen or more      developmental flight tests will be required before it is      ready for realistic operational testing. About a year ago,      full-rate production was scheduled for spring 2007, meaning      that the system could be deployed before the end of the      decade.       But since then, the Pentagon has given new priority to a      sea-based role in defending the U.S. homeland. Navy Theater      Wide was not designed to shoot down ICBMs, but the Bush      administration has restructured the program so that it aims      to produce a sea-based midcourse segment and/or a sea-based      boost-phase segment of national missile defense.       Either mission will require a new missile that is twice as      fast as any existing version of the Standard Missile, which      the system now uses; a new, more powerful Aegis radar system      to track targets; a new launch structure to accommodate the      new, larger missiles; and probably new ships. As a result,      the Navy Theater Wide program requires a great deal of new      development. It is unlikely that Navy Theater Wide will be      ready for realistic operational testing until late in this      decade, and it will not be ready for realistic operational      demonstration in a layered national missile defense for      several years after that.     Airborne Laser       The Airborne Laser (ABL) is a program to develop a high-     power chemical laser that will fit inside a Boeing 747      aircraft. It is the most technically challenging of any of      the theater missile defense programs, involving toxic      materials, advanced optics, and the coordination of three      additional lasers on-board for tracking, targeting, and beam      correction. The first objective of the program is to be able      to shoot down short-range enemy missiles. Later, it is hoped      the ABL program will play a role in national missile defense      by destroying strategic missiles in their boost phase.       The ABL has yet to be flight-tested. About a year ago,      full-rate production of the ABL was scheduled for 2008. The      plan was to build seven aircraft, each estimated to cost      roughly $500 million. At that time, the first shoot-down of a      tactical missile was scheduled for 2003. Recently, the ABL      program office announced that the first shoot-down of a      tactical missile had been delayed to later 2004 because of      many problems with the basic technology of high-power      chemical lasers--about a one-year slip since last year and      about a three-year slip since 1998. Accordingly, full-rate      production probably cannot be started before 2010, and the      cost will likely exceed $1 billion per aircraft.       Assuming all this can be done, it is important to note that      the ABL presents significant operational challenges. The ABL      will need to fly relatively close to enemy territory in order      to have enough power to shoot down enemy missiles, and during      a time of crisis it will need to be near the target area      continuously. A 747 loaded with high-power laser equipment      will make a large and inviting target to the enemy and will      require protection in the air and on the ground. Finally,      relatively simple countermeasures such as reflective surfaces      on enemy missiles could negate the ABL's capabilities.       Deployment of an ABL that can shoot down short- and medium-     range tactical targets is not likely before the end of the      decade, and the Airborne Laser will not be able to play a      role in national missile defense for many years after that.                        National Missile Defense       The Bush administration hopes to build a layered national      missile defense that consists of a ground-based midcourse      system, expanded versions of the theater systems discussed      above, and, potentially, space-based systems. The Bush      administration does not use the phrase ``national missile      defense'' because it was the name of the ground-based      midcourse system pursued by the Clinton administration and      because the Pentagon's plans to defend the country are now      more robust. But national missile defense is a useful      shorthand for any system that is intended to defend the      continental United States, Alaska, and Hawaii against      strategic ballistic missiles, and it is in that sense that it      is used here.       For all practical purposes, the only part of the Bush      national missile defense that is ``real'' is the ground-based      midcourse system. It is real in the sense that six flight      intercept tests have been conducted so far, whereas versions      of the THAAD or Navy Theater Wide systems that might be used      to defend the United States have not been tested at all.      Space-based systems are an even more distant prospect. For      example, the Space-Based Laser, which would use a laser on a      satellite to destroy missiles in their boost phase, was to be      tested in 2012, but funding cuts have pushed the testing date      back indefinitely. Deployment is so far in the future that it      is beyond the horizon of the Pentagon's long-range planning      document, Joint Vision 2020.       As a result, despite the Bush administration's attempts to      distinguish its plans from its predecessor's, Bush's layered      national missile defense is, in effect, nothing more than the      Clinton system.       Since 1997, the ground-based midcourse program has      conducted eight major flight tests, known as IFTs. The first      two, named IFT-1A and IFT-2, were fly-by tests designed      simply to collect target information. The next six tests,      IFT-3 through IFT-8, were all flight intercept tests. IFT-4      and IFT-5, conducted in January 2000 and July 2000      respectively, both failed to achieve an intercept, which      became a principal reason why, on September 1, 2000,      President Bill Clinton decided not to begin deployment of      ground-based midcourse components, such as a new X-band radar      on Shemya Island in Alaska.       Another year passed before the next flight intercept test,      IFT-6, was conducted. The intercept was successful except      that the real-time hit assessment performed by the ground-     based X-band prototype radar on the Kwajalein Atoll in the      Marshall Islands incorrectly reported the hit as a miss. IFT-     7, conducted in early December 2001, was also successful.      Until then, all of the flight intercept tests had had      essentially the same target cluster: a re-entry vehicle, a      single large balloon, and debris associated with stage      separation and decoy deployment. Then, in IFT-8, conducted on      March 15, 2002, two small balloons were added to the target      cluster. This flight intercept test also was successful and      marked an important milestone for the ground-based midcourse      program.       However, despite these recent successes, there have been      significant delays in the testing program. Several of the      flight tests were simply repeats of earlier tests, and as a      result IFT-8 did not accomplish the tasks set for it in the      original schedule. In short, the testing program has slipped      roughly two years--i.e., what was originally scheduled to      take two years has taken four. That is not to say that the      program has made no progress but rather that key program      milestones have receded into the future.       The pace of successful testing will be one of the primary      determinants of how quickly the United States can field a      national missile defense. If the ground-based midcourse      system has three or four successful flight intercept tests      per year, as it has during the past year, it could be ready      for operational testing in four or five years. If those      operational tests also were successful, then whatever      capability had been demonstrated in all those tests--which      would probably not include the capability to deal with many      types of decoys and countermeasures or the capability to      cover much of the space through which an enemy missile could      travel--could be deployed by the end of the decade or even      by 2008.       However, the ground-based midcourse system has difficulties      beyond the testing pace of its interceptor. The system      requires a new, more powerful booster rocket than the      surrogate currently being used in tests--a task that was      thought to be relatively easy. That new booster was to be      incorporated into the continuing series of flight intercept      tests to make those tests more realistic and to be sure that      the new booster's higher acceleration did not adversely      affect other components or systems on board.       But development of the new booster is about two years      behind schedule. Indeed, on December 13, just hours after      President Bush announced U.S. plans to withdraw from the ABM      Treaty, a test of the new booster had to be aborted and the      missile destroyed in flight for safety reasons because it      flew off course. Flight intercept tests that were to have      used the new booster have come and gone without it. Indeed,      development of the booster is so far behind that the Pentagon      recently issued another contract for a competing design.       Equally problematic is uncertainty over how the system will      track enemy missiles in flight and distinguish targets from      decoys. One approach is to use high-power radars operating in      the X-band (that is, at a frequency of about 10 billion      cycles per second). A prototype X-band radar on the Kwajalein      Atoll has been part all of the ground-based midcourse flight      intercept tests so far, and technically, X-band radar      progress has been one of the most successful developments in      missile defense technology.       A year and a half ago, Lieutenant General Kadish testified      to Congress that establishing an X-band radar in Alaska was      the ``long pole in the tent'' for missile defense. This meant      that the X-band radar was critical to a ground-based      midcourse system and that if that radar was not built soon,      the program would start slipping day for day. Then, as now,      there were many other developments that would take as long or      longer than building an X-band radar at Shemya, but the      Pentagon's official position was that construction needed to      start in the spring of 2001 at the latest. Nevertheless,      Clinton deferred taking action on the radar.       Surprisingly, the Bush administration has not requested      funding for an X-band radar at Shemya in either of its first      two budgets. This may be because the administration views      such an installation as inconsistent with the ABM Treaty,      which the administration has said it will not violate while      the treaty is still in effect. Or the administration may not      have requested funding because the Missile Defense Agency has      been exploring ``portable'' X-band radars--that is, X-band      radars deployed on ships or barges.       Some defense analysts believe that the Space-Based Infrared      Satellite (SBIRS) program could be used in place of the X-     band radar to assist a national missile defense. SBIRS--which      would consist of two sets of orbiting sensor satellites,      SBIRS-high and SBIRS-low--is designed to detect the launch of      enemy ballistic missiles and could be used to track and      discriminate among them in flight. However, the program has      significant technical problems.       SBIRS-high, which will consist of four satellites in      geosynchronous orbit and two satellites in highly elliptical      orbits, is to replace the existing Defense Support Program      satellites, which provide early warning of missile launches.      A year ago, the SBIRS-high satellites were scheduled for      launch in 2004 and 2006, but recently those dates have      slipped roughly two years because of problems with software,      engineering, and system integration. A year ago, realistic      operational testing was scheduled for 2007; now, it may not      occur this decade, which means that full deployment may not      occur this decade. SBIRS-high is also well over cost and is      in danger of breaching the legal restrictions covering cost      growth.       SBIRS-low is to consist of approximately 30 cross-linked      satellites in low-Earth orbit. A year ago, the launch of the      first of these satellites was scheduled for 2006, but SBIRS-     low has slipped two years because of a variety of difficult      technical problems. The developmental testing program for      SBIRS-low is very challenging, and realistic operational      testing will probably not begin this decade. This could delay      deployment of the full constellation of SBIRS-low satellites      until the middle of the next decade. SBIRS-low is also      dramatically over budget and was threatened with cancellation      in the latest round of congressional appropriations.       For now, the administration has been saying that it will      upgrade an existing radar on Shemya called Cobra Dane. Under      this plan, the Cobra Dane radar would become an advanced      early-warning radar with some ability to distinguish among      targets. But the Cobra Dane radar operates in the L-band with      about eight-times poorer resolution than a new X-band radar      would have, raising questions about the effectiveness of any      national missile defense using it.       In sum, the only element of a ``layered'' national missile      defense that exists on anything but paper is the ground-based      midcourse system pursued by the Clinton administration.      Accordingly, it is nearly impossible to predict when, if      ever, an integrated, layered national missile defense with      boost, midcourse, and terminal phases might be developed. As      noted above, given the most recent pace of testing, some part      of the ground-based midcourse system could be deployed by the      end of the decade or possibly by 2008.       However, the capability such a system would have would be      marginal and probably would not be able to deal with many      types of decoys and countermeasures or to cover much of the      space through which an attacking ICBM might fly. The Bush      administration has said it will deploy test elements as an      emergency capability as early as possible, but such a      deployment would be rudimentary and its capabilities would be      limited to those already demonstrated in testing. It would      likely not be effective against unauthorized or accidental      launches from Russia or China, which might include missiles      with countermeasures. It also would not be effective against      launches from Iraq, Iran, or Libya since those countries are      to the east, out of view of a radar on Shemya.                               Conclusion       During the first year of the Bush administration, all U.S.      missile defense programs--both theater and national--have      slipped. In general, the shorter-range tactical missile     defense systems are further along than the medium-range      systems, and those medium-range systems are further along      than the longer-range systems intended to defend the United      States against ICBMs.       PAC-3 is the most developmentally advanced of any U.S.      missile defense system, but full deployment will not likely      take place before 2005, and realistic operational testing      will continue for many years after the first Army units are      equipped in the field. The THAAD program has slipped two      years or more and will not be deployable until 2010. The Navy      Area Wide program has been cancelled, and the Navy Theater      Wide program has slipped two years or more and will not be      deployable in a tactical role until the end of the decade. If      the Pentagon restructures the program so that its priority is      boost-phase or midcourse defense against strategic missiles,      it will likely take longer. The Airborne Laser has slipped      one year and will probably not be deployed as a theater      missile defense before the end of the decade.       SBIRS-low has slipped two years and doubled in cost and      probably will not be deployed before 2008. For all practical      purposes, national missile defense is technically not much      closer than it was in the Clinton administration. There have      been no flight intercept tests of the boost-phase or      terminal-phase elements suggested by the Bush administration,      and developmental testing could take a decade or more,      depending on the pace of testing and the level of success in      each test. The only element that can be flight-intercept      tested against strategic ballistic missiles today is the      ground-based midcourse system. Part of that system could be      deployed by 2008, but elements fielded before then will have      only a limited capability.       Thus, while making foreign policy, the Bush administration      would do well to consider that probably only a limited-     capability version of PAC-3 will be fielded during its tenure      and that an effective, layered national missile defense will      not be realized while it is in office. It would make little      sense to predicate strategic decisions on a defense that does      not exist.       It is important for Congress and the American public not to      be frightened into believing that the United States is--as      some missile defense proponents like to assert--defenseless      against even a limited missile attack by a ``rouge state''      such as North Korea. Powerful and effective options exist,      both military and diplomatic.       In Afghanistan, U.S. attack operations with precision-     guided weapons have been highly effective. Those same      precision weapons would be effective against an enemy ICBM      installation. In fact, given current capabilities and the      ever-improving technologies for precision strike, it would be      fantasy to believe any national missile defense system      deployed by 2003 to 2008 would work better and provide      greater reliability at a lower cost than the precision-guided      munitions used in Afghanistan.       On the diplomatic front, in 1999 former Secretary of      Defense William Perry made a series of trips to convince      North Korea to stop developing and testing long-range      missiles. He was remarkably successful. Although Secretary      Perry would not say that North Korea was no longer a threat,      it was obvious that the North Korean threat had been      moderated. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was able to      build on his trip the next year to secure a pledge from      Pyongyang to half flight testing of missiles. Dollar for      dollar, Secretary Perry has been the most cost-effective      missile defense system the United States has yet to develop.      The most straightforward route to missile defense against      North Korea may be through diplomacy, not technology.       Many decision-makers in Washington--and, from what one      reads, the president himself--seem to be misinformed about      the prospects for near-term success with national missile      defense and the budgets being requested for it. It takes 20      years to develop a modern, high performance jet fighter, and      it probably will take even longer to develop an effective      missile defense network. Taking into account the challenges      of asymmetric warfare, the time it can take to develop modern      military equipment, the reliability required in real      operational situations, and the interoperability required for      hundreds of systems and subsystems to work together, it would      be highly unrealistic to think that the United States can      deploy an effective, layered national missile defense by 2004      or even by 2008.       In the meantime, policymakers should be careful that U.S.      foreign and security goals and policies are not dependent on      something that cannot work now and probably will not work      effectively for the foreseeable future. A case in point is      President Bush's decision to abandon the ABM Treaty with      Russia. That decision was certainly premature given the state      of missile defense technology and likely could have been      avoided or postponed for many years if not indefinitely.       This is not to say that missile defense technology ought      not to be pursued--only that it should be pursued with      realistic expectations. Policymakers must be able to weigh      the potential merits and costs of missile defense based on a      sound understanding of both the technology and the possible      alternatives. No one weapon system can substitute for the      sound conduct of foreign policy, and even a single diplomat      can be effective on a time scale that is short when compared      with the time that will be required to develop the technology      for national missile defense.                         stages of development       Missile defense, especially national missile defense, is      the most difficult program ever attempted by the Department      of Defense--much more difficult than the development of a      modern jet fighter like the F-22 Raptor, the Navy's Land      Attack Destroyer (DD-21), or the Army's Abrams M1A2 tank      complete with battlefield digitization, endeavors that all      have taken 20 years or more. Each new major weapons system      must proceed through several stages of development, which are      listed below. Most U.S. missile defense systems are currently      in developmental testing and are therefore not close to      deployment.       Research and Development (R): The period during which the      concepts and basic technologies behind a proposed military      system are explored. Depending on the difficulty of the      technology and the complexity of the proposed system, R can      take anywhere from a year or two to more than 10 years.       Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD): The period      during which a system design is engineered and the industrial      processes to manufacture and assemble a proposed military      system are developed. For a major defense acquisition such as      a high-performance jet fighter, EMD can take five years or      more. If substantial difficulties are encouraged, EMD can      take even longer.       Developmental Testing: Testing that is performed to learn      about the strengths and weaknesses of proposed military      technologies and the application of those technologies to a      new military system in a military environment. Generally,      developmental testing is oriented toward achieving certain      specifications, such as speed, maneuverability, or rate of      fire. Developmental testing is conducted throughout the R      and EMD phases of development and becomes more stressing as      prototype systems evolve and mature.       Operational Testing: Testing that aims to demonstrate      effective military performance against operational      requirements and mission needs established for a system.      Testing is performed with production-representative equipment      in realistic operational environments--at night, in bad      weather, against realistic threats and countermeasures.      Military service personnel, not contractors, operate the      system, which is stressed as it would be in battle.      Operational testing of a major defense acquisition system      typically takes the better part of a year and is usually      broken into several periods of a month or two to accommodate      different environments or scenarios. If substantial      difficulties are encountered, several years of operational      testing may be required.       Production: The phase of acquisition when a military system      is manufactured and produced. Early on, during ``low-rate      production,'' the quantities produced are typically small.      Later, after successfully completing operational testing, a      system may go into ``full-rate production,'' where the rate      of production is designed to complete the government's      planned purchase of the system in a relatively short period      of time, about five years.       Deployment: The fielding of a military system in either      limited or large quantities in military units. The first      military unit equipped may help develop tactics, techniques,      and procedures for use of the new system if that has not      already been done adequately in development.       All ballistic missiles have three stages of flight.       The boost phase begins at launch and lasts until the rocket      engines stop firing and pushing the missile away from Earth.      Depending on the missile, this stage lasts three to five      minutes. During much of this time, the missile is traveling      relatively slowly although toward the end of this stage an      ICBM can reach speeds of more than 24,000 kilometers per      hour. The missile stays in one piece during this stage.       The midcourse phase begins after the propulsion system      finishes firing and the missile is on a ballistic course      toward its target. This is the longest stage of a missile's      flight, lasting up to 20 minutes for ICBMs. During the early      part of the midcourse stage, the missile is still ascending      toward its apogee, while during the latter part it is      descending toward Earth. It is during this stage that the      missile's warhead, as well as any decoys, separate from the      delivery vehicle.       The terminal phase begins when the missile's warhead re-     enters the Earth's atmosphere, and it continues until impact      or detonation. This stage takes less than a minute for a      strategic warhead, which can be traveling at speeds greater      than 3,200 kilometers per hour.
