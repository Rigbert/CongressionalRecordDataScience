It essentially shifts a very modest amount of funds, $10 million, from the administrative costs within the Department of Energy to help restore funds to solar energy research and development within the energy efficiency and renewable energy program.  Sadly, the bill overall moves backward in terms of helping America invent its new energy future because it cuts research in solar development by more than one-third from last year and over 60 percent from the President's request. The base bill provides $166 million for solar research, which is a $97 million reduction below this year's level and a $291 million reduction below the President's request.  What sense does that make when we're importing petroleum at this level, we continue to use more and more, and prices are going up? It is pretty clear America needs new answers. So my effort is to merely reprogram about 5 percent of the funds in the administrative budget of the Department of Energy and shift those to the energy efficiency and renewable energy program itself.  I believe that the Department of Energy, which took years to even get their solar array up at the national headquarters here, could save the money that we need to put into research if they'd merely be more energy efficient about their own buildings. And that comes out of their administrative funds. So this merely is a 5 percent shift. It's $10 million from the administrative budget, and put it into hard research that really helps to create jobs. We know that America has to invent her future. We can't depend on the energy sources of the past alone. Technology is critical to that.  And in the solar field, the competition globally for patents and for the cutting edge research that is part of this sector is just growing so fast globally, America simply can't slip backward. We just have to keep up our edge. It's very difficult with China and with Germany having the kind of incentives they do in their own country. For example, China even offers companies 15-year tax holidays, and they have so many more engineers and scientists than we do working on this. So I think cutting solar research is not a good option for this country. This bill makes many other cuts. Surely, we know thatresearch investments in solar technology have helped create numerous companies already and thousands and thousands of new jobs.  In fact, solar companies employ over 90,000 American workers now, and they expect both growth in sales and jobs, but that depends fundamentally on cutting-edge breakthroughs in technology. And that is a fight that is occuring every day, not just in this country, but in research platforms around the world.  I mentioned earlier that Isofoton, a Spanish solar manufacturer in my region, had announced 300 new jobs this past week. So global firms are coming to places like northern Ohio where they know that the energy systems of the future are being built. But the number of jobs being created in this sector far exceed what is being created in just the general job creation sector in our country.                              {time}  1650  Cornell University's 2010 solar job census shows that in solar energy, the number of new jobs is increasing by 26 percent; and those are good jobs building a new future for our country and for our people. We know that many of these entrepreneurial companies are too small to do their own in-house research, they still need Federal research and basic research to help us use new materials and to help us develop the new transmission technologies to make them truly competitive, to compete against the Chinas and the Germanys of the world that are taking market share as I stand here even today.  So the race is a serious one in the solar energy field. Basic research is the critical ingredient. My amendment essentially moves 5 percent of the funds out of the administrative accounts into the Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy accounts at the Department. I would ask for my colleagues' support on that. Hopefully, we can help take a small step for humankind, for solar energy development in our country.  I yield back the balance of my time.                             Point of Order
