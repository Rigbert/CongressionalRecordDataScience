 President, I am proud to cosponsor the Hispanic educational opportunities amendment which will help address the challenges facing Hispanic students from coast to coast.  I thank Senator Reid and Senator Bingaman for offering this amendment, and today I want to highlight how this bill will help so many people in our communities.  Just last month in Washington State, I saw once again how important education is to our entire state and especially to the Hispanic community.  On August 11, I had the opportunity to hold a day-long summit of Hispanic leaders in Yakima, WA. The turnout was overwhelming.  In one room, we brought together Hispanic elected officials from across the State, along with public and private-sector leaders, on a host of issues.  Congressman Ciro Rodriguez, the chairman of our Congressional Hispanic Caucus, served as a cohost, and shared his national perspective on the issues.  We had also had international leaders, including Peruvian Consul Miguel Velasquez and Mexican Consul Jorge Madrazo.  I am especially proud that we had more than a dozen panelists who shared their expertise and led our discussion.  I publicly thank each of our panelists for their time not only at the summit, but for dedicating their lives to helping the community. Many of them had to overcome significant barriers in their own lives, and today they are working to knock down barriers for all Hispanics. Their participation that day was just one example of the leadership they show every day of the year.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print the names of the panelists in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                          Education Panelists       Miguel Puente, CAMP Director at Heritage College,      Toppenish; Ricardo Sanchez, LEAP Director, Seattle; Armondo      Mungia, student at Eastern Washington University, Cheney; and      Elizabeth Padilla Flynn, Pasco School District.
