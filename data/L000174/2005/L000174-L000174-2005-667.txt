President, I spoke on the floor last week to briefly recount some of the many reasons that Vermont and the Nation will miss the leadership, the independence and the decency of Senator Jim Jeffords when he chooses to retire from the Senate at the end of his current term.  Since then there have been many news articles and editorials that have also catalogued and described various aspects of Jim Jeffords' distinguished legacy. As is often the case when he writes about the events and issues of the day, Emerson Lynn, the publisher of the St. Albans Messenger in my home State of Vermont, did this particularly well. I would like to share his editorial with the members of the Senate.  I ask unanimous consent that Emerson Lynn's recent editorial about Senator Jeffords be printed in the Record  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the St. Albans Messenger, Apr. 21, 2005]           Jeffords Leaves Before His Time, Accomplishes Much       Senator Jim Jeffords, who turned Washington's political      world upside down 4 years ago with his defection from the      Republican Party, Wednesday turned Vermont's political world      upside down with his announcement not to seek reelection.       He said it was time to begin a new chapter in a life that      for 38 years has been dominated by an election cycle that      began as a state senator from Rutland in 1967, to Attorney      General in 1969, to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1974      to the United States Senate in 1988. He has represented      Vermont in one office or another for almost four decades. If      that is a chapter, most our lives can be explained in a      paragraph.       Wednesday's announcement was the sad affirmation of what      many of those close to the Senator had feared: his health is      less than optimum and his wife, Liz, is battling cancer and      about to undergo a third round of chemotherapy. At some point      the question is more akin to the clap of thunder to our      better senses: is being senator worth one's health; is it      worth not being able to pay the proper attention to one's      wife who is battling cancer, and, is the twilight of one's      life best spent with one's children, and an expected      grandchild, or with the churlish likes of Tom DeLay and the      hard right that have stolen a sense of civility and class      from the Senate? For anyone not suffering from the hubris      that often comes attached to the position, the choice is      clear and Jim Jeffords made that choice with grace and      perspective.       He also did the honorable thing politically. He announced      his retirement with sufficient time for both parties to give      thoughtful consideration as to how to approach the November      2006 race. He could have waited. He didn't, and in so doing      reinforced the integrity that has characterized his career.       And his has been a remarkable career. The history books      will undoubtedly begin their biographies noting the impact of      his May, 2001 decision to bolt from a Republican party he      said had left its moorings. But the senator's accomplishments      extend far beyond one's party allegiance. As Vermont's      attorney general he played a pivotal role in the      implementation of Act 250, and the law to outlaw billboards.      No Vermont politician has had a greater impact on dairy      farming, nor does any politician have a better understanding      of the industry and its needs. There isn't a single bit of      legislation dealing with special education [or education in      general] that doesn't have his fingerprints on it in one      fashion or another. The same can be said of his years in the      Senate when dealing with the environment. He was also a      passionate defender of the arts. What he has accomplished      will endure beyond fame's notoriously short life.       It's axiomatic that this was not the choreographed      conclusion of his choosing. His desire was to win reelection      as an independent, thereby vindicating a personally wrenching      decision to leave the Republican Party. Life's bows cannot be      so neatly tied and those who try find them but ropes of sand      that disintegrate in the twisting.       Sadly, we are in an age that exploits one's natural      fissures as though they were fatal flaws of one's character.      One's vulnerabilities are extrapolated into insurmountable      deficiencies, as if there were only sun and no shadows, all      light, no darkness. The senator knows only too well how that      game is played. The Yale/Harvard educated man will be known      more for a twisted tongue than a clear mind, as if being      articulate were a higher calling than being thoughtful.       In the end, it's not what others think of you but the joy      you carry in your toil. And, in the end, it is Mr. Jeffords      that wears the smile, not his accusers. He is like Sisyphus      in Albert Camus' ``Myth of Sisyphus'', the character in Greek      mythology who was condemned for eternity to roll a boulder up      a hill, only to have it roll back down again. Camus made the      convincing argument that Sisyphus' lot was not tragic, but      uplifting. He could smile at the absurd because he understood      it as such.       Camus concluded by writing: ``I leave Sisyphus at the foot      of the mountain! One I always finds one's burden again. But      Sisyphus teaches the higher fidelity that negates the gods      and raises rocks. He too concludes that all is well. This      universe henceforth without a master seems to him neither      sterile nor futile. Each atom of that stone, each mineral      flake of that night filled mountain, in itself forms a world.      The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a      man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy.''       We imagine Mr. Jeffords' heart is full and that he is      happy. He should be remembered as such.       The clamor to claim his political perch has begun and din,      at times, will overwhelm. What Vermonters can hope for is      that all followers choose Mr. Jeffords' path of integrity and      independence.                          ____________________
