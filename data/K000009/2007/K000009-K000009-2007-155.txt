Bishop, it is a privilege to be invited to honor and celebrate the life of Sadie Mae Grove at her homegoing today from Mt. Pilgrim Baptist Church, Toledo, Ohio, September 21, 2007. Thank you all for allowing me to participate. In this church, we can all feel the love she shared with us as we comfort one another at this time of great bereavement.  Once in a while, human beings gain a glimpse of heaven in the people we meet. Sadie Grove was such a person.  She was loving, joyful, strong, kind, generous. And she was wise. To her beloved daughter Louise, lifelong friend Ada Mae McQueen, chosen brothers Freddie and Booker, precious granddaughters Natasha and Cassandra, great-grandchildren Tyrin and Deiondre, blessed family, friends and colleagues--our community extends its deepest sympathy. Grief is such a heavy load. Believe me, as I know from personal experience, Sadie's strength will help carry you now. Rev. Bishop, Sadie drew enormous strength in knowing you would help carry her home today. She is grateful that we are all here at this moment.  In life, some persons are of such strength and texture, the power of their personhood sets a standard of character, not just for their family, but for the broader community. Sadie was a woman of character. Our community has been shaped and imbued with her nature--smiling, caring, building, nurturing others, all of us--a woman of deep faith, abiding hope, and selfless charity. In some faiths, a smile is regarded as a charity. Surely, angels of all persuasions welcome Sadie today as we recall her welcoming smile, extending from ear to ear. She gave us her warm, encouraging hugs, and her gusto, guts, and grace.  Sadie did not lead an easy life. Yet she took joy and gave joy in her journey. She was a woman from the working class of people who had to make her own way. Can you imagine the back-breaking discipline it took for a woman to work for 30 years in the old Jeep paint shop, not the new one . . . on her feet, day in and day out, many times working overtime, working with mainly men when she began. She had to be one of the few women with that experience. Then, due to her skills and personality, she moved to the UAW job training facility at the Jeep unit of the United Auto Workers Local 12. It was there I first met her with now Lucas County Commissioner Pete Gerken. Imagine all the lives she touched, helping people transition from auto manufacturing to other fields as the bad economy that has plagued us yielded more terminations and layoffs. She assisted her co-workers, day after day. How hard it must have been to draw the strength to touch each life, one after the other, to give people hope. She helped lead them to a new road forward. That is what Sadie did.  Sadie effectively connected to the world beyond her family--she was a full citizen. She embraced local, state, and national politics. I can't remember a time when Sadie wasn't there--at NAACP, the Fraternal Order of Police, The Perry Burroughs Democratic Club, the United Auto Workers, the Elks, and as a steward of her cherished church, Mt. Pilgrim. She was a member of the Senior Usher Board #1. I thought number one meant she was the most senior, for we in Congress respect seniority, but in any case she was #1 to all of us. She was a pillar of this church. Where would our community be without this church community? Imagine Toledo without this church. There would be a huge vacuum here. She helped fill that space. I can still see her scurrying to greet me whenever I visited this church. For how many other visitors did she do that? She always waited for me in that back hall. It was there she first shared with me her dream for the housing development for this church and she lived to know it was completed. The treasurer of your church just told me that the $1.7 million addition the church accomplished was to have been paid in 15 years. Sadie headed the stewardship committee, and the loan was paid off in 5 years and 7 months. Yes, you and we, could depend on Sadie.  Sadie made us strong just by being with us. How blessed we all have been to have known her and shared her life. May her family, friends, and our entire community be grateful for her life and, in her memory, may you be given Godspeed in the days and years ahead.  A poem by Nancy Wood entitled ``Earth Prayers'' brings us comfort as we honor the life of Sadie Grove:     A long time I have lived with you     And now we must be going     Separately to be together.     Perhaps I shall be the wind     To blur your smooth waters     So that you do not see your face too much.     Perhaps I shall be the star     To guide your uncertain wings so that you have direction in            the night.     Perhaps I shall be the fire     To separate your thoughts     So that you do not give up.     Perhaps I shall be the rain     To open up the earth     So that your seed may fall.     Perhaps I shall be the stream     To play a song on the rock     So that you are not alone.     Perhaps I shall be a new mountain     So that you always have a home.                          ____________________
