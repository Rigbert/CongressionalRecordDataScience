Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 444) supporting the goals and ideals of National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                              H. Res. 444       Resolved,      SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Gynecological Resolution for      Advancement of Ovarian Cancer Education''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       The Congress finds that--       (1) ovarian cancer is a serious and under-recognized threat      to women's health;       (2) ovarian cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer      death among women living in the United States;       (3) ovarian cancer is very treatable when it is detected      early, but the vast majority of cases are not diagnosed until      the cancer has spread beyond the ovaries;       (4) only 19 percent of ovarian cancer cases in the United      States are diagnosed in the early stages;       (5) in cases where ovarian cancer is detected before it has      spread beyond the ovaries, more than 94 percent of women will      survive longer than five years;       (6) many people do not know that ovarian cancer often      presents with persistent symptoms such as abdominal pressure,      bloating, discomfort, nausea, indigestion, constipation,      diarrhea, frequent urination, abnormal bleeding, unusual      fatigue, unexplained weight loss or gain, and shortness of      breath;       (7) many people do not know that certain women are at      higher risk for developing ovarian cancer if they have risk      factors, including increasing age, a personal or family      history of ovarian, breast, or colon cancer, and not having      had children;       (8) raising public awareness of ovarian cancer by educating      doctors and women about the disease will save lives;       (9) ovarian cancer research is needed to develop early      detection tools, prevention methods, enhanced therapies, and      a cure;       (10) there are still large gaps in knowledge on key      scientific aspects of the disease;       (11) there is still no reliable and easy-to-administer      screening test for ovarian cancer;       (12) President George W. Bush proclaimed September 2005 as      National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month; and       (13) during the month of September, the Ovarian Cancer      National Alliance and its 46 State and regional groups held      hundreds of events across the country to increase public      awareness of the disease.     SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.       The House of Representatives supports the goals and ideals      of National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month, and it is the      sense of the House of Representatives that--       (1) awareness and early recognition of ovarian cancer      symptoms are currently the best way to save women's lives;      and       (2) ovarian cancer research should be well-funded so that a      reliable screening test can be developed and a cure can be      found.
