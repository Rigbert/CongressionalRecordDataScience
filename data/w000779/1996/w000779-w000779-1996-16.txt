President, I want to inform the Senate that I have put a hold on S. 555 so that I may have time to negotiate my request that the Senate take up S. 697, the Domestic Violence Identification and Referral Act, in conjunction with S. 555. I believe that if we take up a bill dealing with the education of health professionals, we should insure that doctors, nurses and other health professionals are trained to identify, refer, and treat victims of domestic violence. Domestic violence is the leading cause of injury to women between 15 and 44. It seems to me that if the Federal Government is going to invest money in educating medical students, they should at least be trained in how to identify and refer cases of domestic violence. This is why I have requested that the Senate and the Committee on Labor and Human Resources consider my and Senator Boxer's legislation in conjunction with S. 555.                          ____________________
