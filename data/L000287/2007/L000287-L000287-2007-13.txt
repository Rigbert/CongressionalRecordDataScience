Mr. Speaker, I am a proud cosponsor of this resolution, and I applaud the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro) for her leadership on this important issue.  Every day in Darfur men are tortured and massacred as women and little girls seeking solace and refuge are raped, abused, and murdered. This is a systematic effort to destroy an entire race of people.  Where is the humanity, Mr. Speaker? Where are our souls? How can we stand by when hundreds and thousands are suffering every day at the hands of their own government?  Today, on the front page of the Washington Post there is an article entitled ``U.S. Promises on Darfur Don't Match Actions''. It highlights our Government's inaction during one of the most horrific human rights disasters of our generation.  Every single one of us has a duty to pressure our Government, the United Nations, the world--to act.  Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan resolution is not about politics. It is not about pushing an agenda forward.  We have a moral obligation to stand up for the women and children in Darfur against systematic and unchecked abuse.  They have no voice, no government, nobody to stand with them, nobody to stand for them.  Every day that we wait for a solution to magically appear, is another day that a woman, a child, is stripped of her home, her family, her dignity, her health, and her humanity.  I urge all of my colleagues to support H. Res. 726.
