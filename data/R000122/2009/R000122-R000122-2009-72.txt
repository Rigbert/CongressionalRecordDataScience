President, today I am introducing the Assistance for Unemployed Workers Extension Act, legislation to extend unemployment insurance benefits so people can pay their bills while they look for work. These benefits are set to expire at the end of this year. I am joined in introducing this critical legislation by Senators Durbin, Schumer, Boxer, Lautenberg, Levin, Stabenow, Whitehouse, Kerry, Menendez, Cardin, Brown, Begich, Burris, and Franken.  Last fall, I authored the law that provided additional weeks of unemployment insurance for individuals exhausting their benefits. Among other provisions to help stimulate the economy, create jobs, and help the unemployed, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act extended the termination dates of these unemployment benefits.  Yet, as jobs have become scarcer, we need to do more. My legislation will continue several current-law unemployment compensation programs through 2010.  In addition, it also provides help to those who are getting stuck on unemployment for long periods. Indeed, there is only roughly one job opening for every five job seekers.  The Assistance for Unemployed Workers Extension Act provides 13 additional weeks of unemployment insurance for states like Rhode Island, South Carolina, Oregon, California, Ohio, Michigan, and Georgia as well asother states which have an unemployment rate at or above 8.5 percent.  Without this legislation, over half a million workers are expected to exhaust their benefits by the end of September, and another 1.5 million are estimated to run out of coverage by the end of the year. This is an extraordinary number of Americans that will face life without a paycheck or an unemployment check during the worst economy since the Great Depression.  While all states are suffering during these very difficult times, my own State of Rhode Island has been hit especially hard, saddled with the second highest unemployment rate and a recession that hit earlier than in any other State.  More than 1,500 Rhode Islanders have exhausted their unemployment insurance benefits this year. By November, another 3,300 unemployed Rhode Islanders will also exhaust their benefits. This is about 150 people each week.  Providing basic support for those who are out-of-work through no fault of their own assures Americans can provide for their families and keep a roof over their heads, stemming the tide of foreclosures and the deterioration of neighborhoods.  As has been the case with past extensions, I look forward to working on a bipartisan basis to pass this legislation. It is critical that we provide help to the growing ranks of the unemployed.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1647       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
