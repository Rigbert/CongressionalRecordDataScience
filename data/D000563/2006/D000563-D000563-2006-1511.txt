President, I rise in support of the efforts of the Senator from Maine. She has been our leader and our champion on this issue of funding LIHEAP. It has been a bipartisan effort, too. Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, on this side of the aisle, and many others, have spoken in favor of what she is attempting to do.  To describe it very briefly, for those who are following this debate, it would put $1 billion more in the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program across America. We said we thought we would need $5 billion this year.
