Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to an extraordinary life, to an extraordinary individual, to a dear and good friend of mine for many, many years. Emanuel Raymond Lewis was the librarian emeritus, the last and longest-serving librarian of the U.S. House of Representatives, a prolific author, archivist, educator, humorist, historian, illustrator, psychologist, and recognized expert on military and naval history. He died on May 14.  He was the husband of my former chief of staff, Eleanor Lewis, an extraordinary individual in her own right, who had been Geraldine Ferraro's chief of staff as well.  Ray Lewis was a man of great intellect, of great warmth, and of great contributions to this institution, to his country, to his family, and to the intellectual education of so many.  Ray Lewis was a man of the House and so much more. He lived a life of vast experience. He was, as Eleanor observed, a genuine Renaissance man. He loved his work and his scholarship and service to the House and to this country, which he enriched so extraordinarily well.  During his tenure as an officer in the House, Dr. Lewis combined disciplined intellect with a deep interest in the House's history and patience to guide House Members and staff seeking historical understanding of this institution.  During the House Judiciary Committee impeachment hearings on President Nixon, Dr. Lewis provided critical historical references to guide the committee in its work. And he honored the tradition of the office he headed, authoring a history of the House Library and promoting ties with the Senate Library and the Library of Congress' Congressional Research Service.  As I said, Mr. Speaker, I knew Ray Lewis for much of the time I served in the House of Representatives. I got to know him, his sense of humor, his sense of this institution, his sense of decency, and his sense of excitement of what was going on here and around the world. With Eleanor, he traveled in much of the world; and in each place, he learned something new and brought it home for all of us.  Dr. Lewis created extraordinary research on fortifications, coastal fortifications, river fortifications. He was, indeed, one of the world's experts on that particular historical focus.  Eleanor Lewis, as I said, was my former chief of staff. She is still a very dear and close friend. She and Ray were partners in life for over four decades. They were partners, as well, in intellectual pursuits and in their love of this country and of this institution, the House of Representatives. They enriched all.  Ray Lewis was born to two Siberian immigrants in Oakland, California, on November 30, 1928. He attended the University of California at Berkeley and the University of Oregon. While enrolled at the University of Oregon, he studied with a grant from the National Institute of Mental Health. He became a tenured psychology professor in the Oregon University system for a half dozen years. Dr. Lewis was among thefirst psychology professors to participate in the creation of the Oregon State Board of Psychologist Examiners and was the first Oregon professor to teach on campus through television. A Renaissance man, a man before his time.  He had a lifelong love of public spaces and actively worked to preserve parkland. In fact, on May 27, 1937, at the age of 8, he joined his parents and his brother Albert, now deceased, in walking across the Golden Gate Bridge on opening day. He donated specimens unearthed at forts to national and State parks, including Fort Stevens at the mouth of the Columbia River in Oregon. Ray Lewis, to the very end of his life, digested life, welcomed life.  Tennyson wrote a poem about Ulysses, in which he said: ``I am a part of all that I have met; yet all experience is an arch wherethrough gleams that untravelled world, whose margin fades for ever and for ever when I move.'' That was Ray Lewis' psyche. He saw life as an ever-expanding opportunity to enrich himself and to enrich others with his intellect and his excitement for what could be done and how well he participated in doing for this House, for this country, and for his family.  Mr. Speaker, my remarks are longer than this, and I will not repeat all of them. Much of them have been contributed by his wife's observations and her writing skills, and I would ask that they be included in the Record. I have read some of them, but the remarks I give about him are personal because he was my friend. He was an American to be admired by us all. He was a good citizen, a great American, a man of the House.  My sympathy to Eleanor for her loss, but to all of us, as well, for our loss of a good and decent man who made such a contribution to this country and to all of us.  in memory of emanuel raymond lewis, librarian emeritus of the U.S.                         house of representatives  Emanuel Raymond Lewis, Librarian Emeritus, the last and longest serving Librarian of the U.S. House of Representatives, prolific author, archivist, educator, humorist, historian, illustrator, psychologist, and recognized expert on military and naval history, died May 14 in Suburban Hospital, Bethesda, MD. The cause of death was dementia.  Dr. Lewis was appointed House Librarian in 1973, and served until January 1995 when the library, which predated the Library of Congress, along with the House Historical Office, was down-sized and placed under the Legislative Resource Center. The Library was the official custodian of all documents generated by the House.  Ray Lewis was a man of the House, and so much more. Ray lived a life of vast experience--he was a genuine Renaissance man. He loved his work, and his scholarship and service to the House and to this country left us all enriched.  During his tenure as an officer of the House, Dr. Lewis combined disciplined intellect with a deep interest in the House's history and the patience to guide House members and staff seeking historical understanding of this institution. During the House Judiciary Committee's impeachment hearings on President Nixon, Lewis provided critical historical references to guide the committee in its work. And he honored the tradition of the office he headed, authoring a history of ``The House Library'' and promoting the ties with the Senate Library and the Library of Congress' Congressional Research Service.  From his service as an officer in military intelligence from 1954-1956, Dr. Lewis developed a life-long interest in the history of military architecture and technology in the United States, which culminated in the 1970 publication of ``Seacoast Fortifications of the United States'' published by the Smithsonian Institution Press. He wrote this work while a Post-Doctoral Research Associate 1969-1970 at The Smithsonian Institution. Initially an architectural student at the University of California at Berkeley, Dr. Lewis turned his early drawing talents to illustrate his book.  Commissioned as a First Lieutenant in the Coast Artillery Corps, he transferred to Military Intelligence when the Corps was abolished shortly after his commission. As commander of a group of Soviet military defectors--Lewis was a native Russian speaker--he was assigned responsibility for testing security at military bases. He retired as a Captain.  Dr. Lewis researched military documents in the National Archives, and traveled extensively to fortification sites around the country for his book, the first comprehensive work on the subject of coastal fortifications in a century, now used by the U.S. National Park Service in training their employees. This seminal work examined the prominent role played by these fortifications in American defense policy prior to World War II.  Lewis was accompanied on these travels by his future wife, Eleanor (Gamarsh) Lewis, the couple referred to the time as ``their forting days in lieu of their courting days.'' Travel would become a constant in their lives together--his proposal of marriage included an unusual vow--``marry me and I will take you to Tashkent, Samarkand, and Bukhara''--and he did. Over 45 years they would visit every continent, and more than 100 countries.  Dr. Lewis published widely in military and naval-related journals including ``Military Affairs,'' the ``U.S. Naval Institute Proceedings,'' ``The Military Engineer,'' ``Capitol Studies,'' ``U.S. Naval Institute Proceedings;'' ``Military Engineer,'' ``Dictionary of American History,'' Encyclopedia of the United States Congress''; and ``Warship International.'' Editors of the latter publication honored his work in their annual ``Best Articles of the Year'' on three separate occasions.  In 1969 working for System Development Corporation of Santa Monica, CA, considered the world's first computer software company, Dr. Lewis co-authored ``The Educational Information Center: An Introduction,'' a general guide to the process of establishing an educational information center.  Born to Siberian immigrants in Oakland, CA, November 30, 1928, Dr. Lewis attended the University of California at Berkeley (BA/MA) and the University of Oregon (PhD). While enrolled at the University of Oregon he studied with a grant from the National Institutes of Mental Health (NIMH). He became a tenured psychology professor in the Oregon University System for a half-dozen years. Dr. Lewis was among the first psychology professors to participate in the creation of the Oregon State Board of Psychologist Examiners, and the first Oregon professor to teach on campus through television.  Dr. Lewis had a life-long love of public spaces and actively worked to preserve parkland. On May 27, 1937 at age 8, he joined his parents and his brother Albert, now deceased, in walking across the Golden Gate Bridge on opening day. He donated specimens unearthed at forts to national and state parks, including Fort Stevens at the mouth of the Columbia River in Oregon.  To honor his father, Jacob A. Lewis, Dr. Lewis donated ten acres to the city of Hayward, CA--the ``J.A. Lewis Park'' is now part of the Hayward (CA) Area Recreation and Park District. The elder Lewis had donated the same land area--ten acres--in San Francisco to build Congregation Ner Tamid.  In 1965, Dr. Lewis prepared ``A History of San Francisco Harbor Defense Installations: Forts Baker, Barry, Cronkhite, and Funston'' for the State of California Division of Beaches and Parks. This work, which evolved into Dr. Lewis' later book on coastal fortification, was instrumental in the formation of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area (GGNRA) in 1972. In 1971 Dr. Lewis was called to testify before a subcommittee of the House Interior Committee during hearings on creating the GGNRA.  Dr. Lewis was well-known to House Members and especially staff who sought his help in researching issues before the Congress. He was regarded as a friendly curmudgeon who could be relied on to quickly locate helpful historical information. The time he saved those staffers, however, was all too frequently consumed in conversation about whatever matter Dr. Lewis happened to be engaged in researching at the time.  His curiosity and love of learning spanned a wide range of interests. Those interests were manifested in his personal collection authentic African spears, including several purchased in Umhlanga, South Africa, which were used in the 1879 Anglo-Zulu War; the muzzle of a 16-inch gun from the USS Indiana now on display at the Navy Museum in Washington, DC; a 1954 MG which was best of show in the 25th Anniversary of the ``Concours d'Elegance'' June 29, 1997 in Forest Grove, Oregon; and Soviet Field Marshal memorabilia. Side interests included the study of California geography, and Native American tribes--the House Librarian was once called upon by Vice President Spiro Agnew for advice on the authentic pronunciation of tribal names.  It was fitting that the House Librarian--in the tradition of Jefferson--held thousands of books in his personal collection.  Ray's passions for travel and collecting items of interest came together when it came to trains. It's hard to know whether his collection of train models, especially those of the Southern Pacific Daylight, came from the time he spent riding the rails, but we know he loved traveling by train. His adventures included a cross-country excursion from Washington, DC to San Francisco, as well as passage on the Trans-Siberian Railway from Khabarovsk to Moscow. Along with his trips on the Canadian and Pacific Railways, Ray's rail experiences, like so much of his life, were full and adventurous.  For all his scholarly activities, Lewis took great pleasure in hanging out with some of thelegendary cultural figures of his time--jazz greats Louis Armstrong and Dave Brubeck, as well as comedy giants Lenny Bruce and Mort Sahl at San Francisco's ``Hungry i.''  An engaging and enthusiastic raconteur, Lewis could entertain with stories of juicy irony from the day's news, or of his time playing slots with Frank Sinatra in Reno, Nevada when the singer was obtaining his divorce from Ava Gardner. His own performing exploits--he sang and played guitar--ended with producing musicals and comedies in graduate school.  Born with a rare cholesterol disorder, Dr. Lewis first entered NIH in 1964 as an in-patient, and was involved in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes' research protocols that led to the discovery of the statin drugs. Dr. Donald S. Fredrickson, named by President Gerald Ford to become head of the National Institutes in 1974, was Lewis's doctor; Lewis was a research patient in Dr. Frederickson's 1967 paper describing the classification of lipoprotein abnormalities in five types. This became known as the ``Frederick classification,'' later adopted as a standard by the World Health Organization in 1972.  A devoted atheist, Dr. Lewis became a minister in the Universal Life Church, Inc., in the 1960s--he liked to joke that he could marry you or bury you--your choice. In 1999, he experienced a lifetime thrill when he met the Dalai Lama at a dinner in Washington, DC. The Lewises had recently visited Lhasa, Tibet and at the dinner presented the Dalai Lama with photographs of Norbulingka, the summer palace from which he escaped the Chinese in March 1959.  Dr. Lewis is survived by his wife of 47 years, Eleanor G. Lewis of Washington, DC, my former Chief of Staff; his son Joseph J. Lewis of Eugene, Oregon, cousin Ruth Lycette, her son and daughter-in-law, Bob and Kathy Lycette of Palo Alto and San Carlos respectively; his cousin in law, Eve DeLanis of Virginia Beach, VA; a sister-in-law, Roberta Foulke and her husband, Robert, of Las Vegas, Nevada, 11 nieces and nephews, and many great nieces and nephews.                          ____________________
