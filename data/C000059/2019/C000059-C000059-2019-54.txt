After serving ten years on the Murrieta City Council, my good friend Randon Lane recently stepped down to take a position with the U.S. Department of Transportation, here in Washington, D.C.  After graduating from college, Randon began a career in business working for Fortune 500 companies including AT&T Broadband, Nextel and Sprint. Until recently, Randon served as a Public Affairs Manager for The Southern California Gas Company, the largest natural gas provider in the nation. In addition to his business career, Randon has long been active in public service. In 2003, he was appointed to the Murrieta Planning Commission. In the following years Murrieta witnessed an incredible 70 percent population explosion, one of the largest population increases in the nation during that period.  In 2008 Randon was elected to the Murrieta City Council. While successfully leading Murrieta as Mayor in 2011 and 2016, he along with the City Council continued to prioritize investments in infrastructure and public safety. Forbes named Murrieta the No. 1 post-recession ``boom town'' in America and FBI statistics rank Murrieta the third safest city in the Nation among cities with populations over 100,000 residents. Randon's strong leadership led his council colleagues to appoint him to represent them on agencies locally, regionally, statewide and nationally. Randon and his wife, Bridget ``Bo'', have been married for 21 years, 17 of those in Murrieta. Together they have a daughter, Chelsea, 27 and son-in-law Sean and two sons, Randon, Jr., 15 and Joshua,11.  Randon has contributed immensely to the betterment of our region and I am proud tocall him a dedicated public servant, American and friend. To conclude, Madam Speaker I want to thank Randon for his service to the Inland Empire--his dedication, insight and passion will be greatly missed. I wish him the very best in his new position with the Department of Transportation.                          ____________________
