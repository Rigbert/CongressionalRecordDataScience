Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman yielding and would add my voice to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Knollenberg) in opposition to the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, my first concern is that we have just had a vote on this floor to, essentially, increase funding for renewables by $40 million. And secondly, I do think under the NERI program we are doing very important research. We are looking to continue to improve efficiency and reliability and to reduce the cost of existing nuclear energy applications. We are looking for proliferation resistant reactors in fuels. We are looking for new reactor designs with improved safety, higher efficiency, and lower costs that would be competitive in the global market. And we are looking for new technologies for nuclear waste management and investigations into fundamental nuclear science.  I do oppose the amendment put forth and would encourage my colleagues to vote against it.
