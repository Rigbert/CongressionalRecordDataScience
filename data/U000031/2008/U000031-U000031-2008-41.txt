Gary L. Cramer of Kalamazoo, Michigan for his years of outstanding service to Kalamazoo Charter Township and the State of Michigan.  Gary began his work as a public official in 1980, when he was elected to serve as Kalamazoo Township trustee. Over the next 16years, Gary distinguished himself as a clear-thinking and approachable leader, earning him the trust and respect of government, business, and community leaders alike. In his capacity as trustee, Gary also assumed an active role as a township fire commissioner and as a member of the city planning commission.  From the role of trustee, Gary was elected to the position of township supervisor, where he admirably served the residents of Kalamazoo Township from 1996 to 2008. For those 12 years, Gary also worked as a member of the Kalamazoo Township Policy and Administration Committee, the Kalamazoo Area Transportation Study, the Coalition for Urban Redevelopment, the Kalamazoo Regional Water & Wastewater Commission, and the Community Action Board. In 1999, he was elected to the Michigan Township Association Board, where he retired as president in 2008.  Gary has always risen above the fray of partisan politics to ensure that the interests of those he represents are met. As both an administrator and representative, he truly exemplifies the best of the public servant.  Once again, I would like to congratulate and express my gratitude to Gary Cramer for his many years of distinguished service to the residents of Kalamazoo Township. Southwest Michigan is truly stronger because of his contributions.                          ____________________
