Speaker, we have seen that notion disproven several times over, and the results of experimenting with that idea have been higher deficits and a ballooning debt that fuel Republican efforts to disinvest in our future and to dismantle Medicare, Social Security, and safety net programs. Let's not make the same mistake again.  Instead, we ought to be voting on a straightforward, 2-year extension, and then commit ourselves to meaningful tax reform as David Camp did. It is tough to do, I understand that, but it is the right thing to do. Let us show that we have courage as well as common sense. Defeat this bill. Let us move on to meaningful tax reform and to growing our economy.
