Mr. Speaker, as we have debated today the issue of American participation in any NATO peacekeeping effort in Kosovo, I urge my colleagues, regardless of their views on that matter, to focus on what is happening in Serbia itself. Slobodan Milosevic, President of an unrecognized Yugoslav state of which Serbia and Montenegro are part, is using Kosovo to perpetuate his regime, to rally Serbia's public opinion around him, and to label as ``traitors'' not only his opponents but anyone who thinks independently.  Last year, Milosevic imposed draconian laws which curtailed the independence of journalists to report news freely, and threatened the academic community's ability to maintain its intellectual integrity. In response, the Helsinki Commission which I chair, held a hearing appropriately entitled: ``The Milosevic Regime Versus Serbian Democracy and Balkan Stability.''  As an example of what is happening right now in Serbia, I would note for the Record what has happened to three of the witnesses at the hearing.  On December 28, 1998--less than three weeks after the hearing--Boris Karajcic, a leader in the university student movement ``Otpor'' (Resistance), was attacked and beaten on the street in front of his Belgrade home by masked thugs with bats. As they fled, their comments indicated the political nature of the attack.  During the first week of February, Milan Panic, the Serb-American pharmaceutical executive who is a leader of the Alliance for Change, the main coalition of political opposition to Milosevic's ruling Socialist Party, has had his Serbian subsidiary company taken over by the authorities. The purpose was likely two-fold: to intimidate Panic and to gain hard-currency assets.  On March 8, Slavko Curuvija, the chief editor of newspaper Dnevni Telegraf and the new magazine Evropljanin, was sentence along with two of his journalists to five months in prison by a Belgrade court for ``spreading false reports with an intention to endanger pubic order.'' They remain free on appeal.  Mr. Speaker, these assaults on freedom demonstrate that Milosevic feels vulnerable to democratic forces which do, in fact, exist in Serbia, forces which may indeed be growing. Indeed, the Serbian Government undertook to make a paper prepared by the hearing witness from the United States Institute for Peace and openly circulated at that same hearing into an alleged confidential CIA document which showed, they alleged, that the U.S. Government was plotting to overthrow the Belgrade government.  Despite his insecurity at home, Milosevic does feel sufficiently secure in a U.S. policy which seemingly needs his presence for implementation for the Dayton Agreement in Bosnia, and to get an agreement in France on Kosovo. Our dependence on him, he reckons, means we will not seek to undercut his dictatorial power. The clear lack of attention many senior Administration officials have paid to Serbia' democrats has only reinforced this feeling in Belgrade.  Mr. Speaker, this must change. The actions against Karajcic, Panic, Curuvija and countless other advocates of a democratic Serbia must be condemned not with words alone. The United States must stop dealing with Milosevic directly. The United States must protest his assault on innocent civilians when they occur. The United States must encourage democratic change in Serbia, and assist those who promote this change from within, the true Serbian patriots.  One way in which the Congress can help in this regard is to move quickly on the legislation I have just introduced, H.R. 1064, the Serbia and Montenegro Democracy Act of 1999. This Act would ensure adequate attention is paid to democratic forces in Serbia and Montenegro by those allocating U.S. democratic assistance. The legislation has bipartisan support.  Mr. Speaker, I am deeply concerned about developments in Serbia generally, and the incidents involving Helsinki Commission hearing witnesses in particular. As Chairman of the Commission, I am committed to making sure that the people in Serbia have the same rights and freedoms which so many other Europeans enjoy and take for granted, the rights and freedoms enshrined in the Helsinki Final Act and defined in subsequent OSCE documents. The suppression of these rights in Serbia is unacceptable, it ultimately will prove untenable, and it must change sooner rather than later, not only for the sake of the people in Serbia but all people in south-central Europe.                          ____________________
