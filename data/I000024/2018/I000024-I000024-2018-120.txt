 I know the intentions are good; we have voted on the same thing for the last 5 years. I can tell you right now what the vote result is going to be because it has been the same for the last 5 years.  No one has had a more consistently conservative record than I have, but I would have to say that this would undo a lot of what we have accomplished with the last vote to allow us to start rebuilding our systems. We got in a position where we didn't have brigade combat teams that were adequately prepared to go to battle. Sixty percent of our F-18s were not flying. We are trying to recover from all of these things. We have now started that recovery.  My concern is--and I think Senator Graham said it very well--in the event that we pass this--if it did pass; it won't, but if it did--that is going to be a problem and a problem that we can't overcome.  Right now, our No. 1 concern should be defending this Nation. This is the opportunity to at least let people know that there is a legitimate vote for conservatives to vote for a strong national defense.  I don't want to send a signal to our kids overseas--our kids in battles and in harm's way--that we are not going to take care of their needs, as we just started just a year ago to do. We have to continue that.  For the sake of our national security, I suggest that we vote against the Paul proposal.
