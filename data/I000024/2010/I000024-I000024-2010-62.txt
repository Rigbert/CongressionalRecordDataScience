. Air Force LTG Thomas Patten Stafford, a former National Aeronautics and Space Administration astronaut and the first U.S. general officer to travel into space, being one of only 24 people to fly to the Moon. A command pilot in both the Air Force and NASA, General Stafford gave a lifetime of service to the Nation in space exploration, logging multiple flights into space to further our understanding and capabilities in space exploration. As one of the pioneers of our country's space program, General Stafford established protocols, procedures, and even a few records, that are still present in today's contemporary space programs and operations. He has been a national treasure and an unsung hero, willingly taking on the challenges associated with our innate fascination with what lay beyond our terrestrial home.  General Stafford graduated with honors from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1952 and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force. He attended pilot training at Connally Air Force Base, Waco, TX, in 1953 and after completing advanced interceptor training was assigned to his first tactical duty station at Ellsworth Air Force Base, Rapid City, SD, as a pilot with the 54th Flight Interceptor Squadron with the mission of planning for and executing the air defense of the United States. It was in 1955 that General Stafford received an overseas assignment to Hahn Air Base, Germany, where he joined the 496th Fighter Interceptor Squadron, at the tip of the spear as part of the United States defense of Europe during the Cold War. At the time, the 496th flew F-86D model aircraft, known as the ``Sabre Dog.'' It was a transonic jet, all-weather interceptor designed to intercept Soviet attack and bomber aircraft. It was during this time that General Stafford developed and honed his flying abilities and understanding of flight operations and performance testing, which would prove vital to his influence over our Nation's space program and guarantee many successes in those endeavors.  In 1962, General Stafford was selected among the second group of astronauts to participate in Projects Gemini and Apollo, the two fabled national space programs that epitomize our country's tremendous quest for space exploration. In December 1965, General Stafford piloted Gemini VI, the first rendezvous in space, thus developing and proving techniques for space rendezvous that would be critical for future operations. In June 1966, he commanded Gemini IX and demonstrated a rendezvous technique that would be used in the Apollo missions to the Moon. And because of this expertise, he headed the mission planning analysis and software development responsibilities for the astronaut group for Project Apollo.  The most pivotal piece to this was his development and implementation of the techniques a pilot would use to manually fly the Saturn booster into orbit and the descent and ascent to and from the Moon's surface. All of this culminated with his command of the Apollo 10 mission in May 1969, when General Stafford personally performed the first lunar module rendezvous around the Moon and the entire lunar landing mission except for the actual landing.  It was with this expertise that General Stafford assumed the role of Deputy Director of Flight Crew Operations at the NASA Manned Space Flight Center, where he was responsible for the planning and implementation of programs for the astronaut group and all aircraft operations. General Stafford's time with NASA culminated with his fourth space flight as the Apollo commander of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project mission in 1975. This was a joint space flight with the Soviet Union that culminated in the historic first meeting in space between American Astronauts and Soviet Cosmonauts.  General Stafford was the first member of his Naval Academy Class of 1952 to pin on the first, second and third stars of a general officer. He flew six rendezvous in space, logged over 507 hours in space flight and wore the Air Force Command Pilot Astronaut Wings. In his life time he has flown over 127 different types of aircraft and helicopters and four different types of spacecraft. And in his later years in the Air Force, General Stafford was personally involved in the development of two of our most critical Air Force stealth aircraft: the F-117A Stealth Fighter and the B-2 Stealth Bomber.  Though General Stafford retired from the Air Force in 1979, his efforts in our country's space program continued. In his post retirement period, General Stafford continued to influence our efforts in space, chairing independent think tank teams focused on developing a 30 year roadmap for both Presidents Bush and Clinton for returning and inhabiting the Moon and extending our exploration efforts to Mars. And he currently sits as the Chairman of the NASA Advisory Council Task Force on International Space Station Operational Readiness and the cochairmanof the Stafford-Covey Space Shuttle Return to Flight Task Group.  General Stafford is a true American hero; an amazing testament to the spirit and the selflessness of the American public servant. There are very few that have obtained the level of historic influence as he has, leaving behind a true legacy for all of us to follow. General Stafford celebrates his 80th birthday this Friday, September 17, 2010. There is a lot to be said for 80 years of life that have seen some two-thirds of that spent in the service to our Nation. I, for one, take my hat off to a great national icon and applaud him for what he has done for this great nation. On behalf of Congress and the United States of America, I thank General Stafford and his family for their lifelong commitment, sacrifice, and contribution to this great Nation and I wish him a happy 80th birthday with many more to come.                          ____________________
