President, for the first time since the America's Cup left Newport for Fremantle in 1983, Rhode Island is home to a championship trophy. With a 5-1 victory over the Rochester Americans last night, the Providence Bruins won the esteemed Calder Cup as the 1999 Champions of the American Hockey League. The P-Bruins have won the hearts of sports fans in Rhode Island since professional hockey returned to the state in 1992 after a 16-year hiatus.  But this victory was much deserved for a team that truly turned itself around. In winning the Calder Cup, the 1999 Providence Bruins became one ofonly four teams in AHL history to have gone from last place to first in one season. Under the able leadership of Coach Peter Laviolette and assistant Bill Armstrong, the Providence Bruins amassed a 56-20-4 record--tops during the regular season--then ran off a perfect 10-0 record at home in the playoffs. In winning the Calder Cup, this Bruins team can rightly boast that they are among the best in the history of the league.  While this championship was very much the team's victory, a special acknowledgment belongs to Peter Ferraro, who, as the Providence Bruins' leading scorer in the playoffs with nine goals, won the Most Valuable Player honor for the 1999 series. The Providence Bruins' determination and great Championship victory exemplify the dedication of the entire team, and their efforts have been appreciated by the people of Rhode Island, who have flocked to their games throughout the season. All of Rhode Island takes justifiable pride in the Providence Bruins' victory, and we wish them continued success as they strive to repeat as winners of the Calder Cup next year.                          ____________________
