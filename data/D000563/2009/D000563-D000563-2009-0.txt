Brueggemann of the Illinois State Police. Mr. Brueggeman has served with distinction for 25 years with the Illinois State Police, including as second in command of the department since April 1, 2008.  Mr. Brueggemann began his outstanding career with the Illinois State Police in 1985, serving in patrol, as well as a variety of investigative positions to include narcotics, homicides and crimes against persons. He also served during his tenure in management positions that contributed greatly to the department and community he served. Those positions included district commander, executive officer, assistant deputy director, deputy director and first deputy director.  As first deputy director, Mr. Brueggemann oversaw the agency's five divisions--operations, forensics, information and technology command, internal investigations, and administration. He was responsible for the oversight of the director's principal advisors assigned to legislative affairs, public information, inspections and budget.  In his prior position, Mr. Brueggemann had oversight of the operations division, with wide-ranging responsibilities including patrol, investigations, homeland security and gaming. While serving in that capacity, Mr. Brueggemann was charged with coordinating a plan to reduce highway fatalities. Under his leadership, the division developed a remarkable strategy that reduced highway crashes to their lowest level in 87 years.  In other honors, he was selected in 2005 by the FBI to attend a counterterrorism leadership program that involved traveling abroad with seven other major city, State, and Federal law enforcement executives to share information and open lines of communications between different nations in the fight against terrorism. Law enforcement officials from Scotland, England, Northern Ireland, and Canada also participated.  Mr. Brueggemann received his bachelors degree from McKendree University and a masters degree in Homeland Defense and Security from the Naval Postgraduate School. Married for more than two decades to his wife Susan, they have two daughters Beth and Ali.  I congratulate Mr. Brueggeman on his retirement and thank him for his service to the people of Illinois.                          ____________________
