 Speaker, at a time when the gap between the rich and the poor is growing wider, I am not impressed by the Republican plan which provides huge tax breaks for the wealthiest people in this country and the largest corporations, and cuts back savagely on a wide variety of programs meant for low-income and middle-income people.  When thousands and thousands of senior citizens in the State of Vermont today are finding it very hard to pay their health care bills, I am not impressed by a Contract With America which savagely cuts back on Medicare and Medicaid. When millions of middle class families today cannot afford to send their kids to college because of the high cost of higher education, I am not impressed by a Contract With America which cuts back terribly on loans that millions of young people will need in order to get to college. The Contract With America works for the rich. It is a disaster for middle-income and working people.                          ____________________
