 President, I want the Senator to know it is my intention to vote for her amendment. I obviously did not want it on this bill, but since it is, it is my intention to vote for it.                           Amendment No. 395 (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that text of the REAL ID       Act of 2005 should not be included in the conference report)
