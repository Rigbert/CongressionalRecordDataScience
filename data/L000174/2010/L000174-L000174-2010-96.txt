President, this summer, Marcelle and I were honored to be at the Vermont Supreme Court with former Supreme Court Justice Jeff Amestoy, his wife Susan, and their daughters. Like all Vermonters, I have respected his tenure, both as attorney general and as chief justice, as both were exemplary. While the portrait captures the image of the Jeff Amestoy his friends honor and care for, his words are what should be read by everyone who cares about our judiciary. Jeff's commitment to the law, our justice system, and our sense of what makes Vermont the State we love is in his words. They were so impressive I asked him for a copy, and I ask unanimous consent that they be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:  Remarks of Chief Justice Jeff Amestoy (Retired) at Portrait Ceremony                         Vermont Supreme Court                    (Montpelier, VT, Aug. 13, 2010)       Governor Douglas, Senator Leahy, Chief Justice Reiber,      family and friends:       Thank you for the honor you do me by attending this      ceremony. Thank you Justice Burgess for your generous      introductory remarks. Brian Burgess served as Deputy Attorney      General when I was Attorney General. I doubt that either of      us could have foreseen this day but here we are together      again. History may not repeat itself, but it sometimes      rhymes.       Thank you Kenneth McIntosh Daly--artist, rancher, and      friend who has once again made the trip from California to      Vermont.       And thank you to my daughters Katherine, Christina, and      Nancy for the unveiling.       This September I begin my seventh year as a Fellow at the      Harvard Kennedy School nearly as long as I served on the      Supreme Court of Vermont.       For those of you wondering how a Harvard Fellow spends his      time, I can say I have spent the better part of the last two      years living in the nineteenth century--more precisely in the      Boston of the decade before the Civil War.       It was a time when a young man working as a waiter in a      coffee house, or a clerk in a clothing store, could be seized      by agents of the United States Government, brought before a      Judge, and under the provisions of the new Fugitive Slave Law      (where no process was due), be sent back into slavery.       Contrary to what I thought I knew about American history,      Boston in the period leading up to the Civil War, was in the      words of Charles Francis Adams, Jr., ``almost avowedly a      proslavery community.'' ``It was a time'' wrote Emerson,      ``when judges, bank presidents, railroad men, men of fashion,      and lawyers universally all took the side of slavery.''       Well, almost all. I am interested in understanding how a      society, and particularly the legal establishment of 1850s      Boston, was transformed from the beginning of the decade when      Daniel Webster said ``no lawyer who makes more than $40 a      year is against the Fugitive Slave Law,'' to the end of the      decade when lawyers literally went to war against it.       My window on that time, curiously enough, opened when I saw      a portrait of a lawyer of that period.       So this day, for many reasons, has prompted me to look to a      future as far removed from us today as the Boston of 1850. A      century from now when each of us will be someone's memory,      there will be, I trust, remembrances of things past.       In some building if not this one, there will be a wall      where portraits of forgotten Chief Justices still hang--or      where an enterprising curator has retrieved old paintings and      artifacts for an exhibit of our times.       And on some class field trip (for those will always be with      us), among a group of very bored students, there may be (if      the world is lucky to still have teachers as inspiring as      Mrs. Amestoy), a bright, curious student who will pause in      front of this painting.       She will not, of course, recognize its subject, but as she      looks through the window in the portrait, she will see Mt.      Mansfield. And the window of the painting will begin to open      for her a window on our time.       Our young historian will immerse herself in the flood of      newspapers, opinions, and books of those long ago days at the      beginning of the twenty-first century. On the basis of the      documentation and her own insight, she will attempt to bring      to life the color and passion when the social changes were so      profound that even on our own time scholars characterized the      upheaval as ``The Great Disruption.''       If our young scholar has had a history teacher as good as      Mr. Remington, she will know she cannot rely on a single      perspective. (In any event, my autobiography, The      Indispensable Man, will long be out of print). But our future      historian will be struck, as many historians have been, by      the disproportionate impact Vermont has had on American      history. She will not lack in material looking back at our      time.       One Vermont Senator whose unparalleled leadership of the      Senate Judiciary Committee, and pivotal endorsement of      America's first African-American President, will echo down      the halls of history; another whose rejection of the narrow      partisanship of his party realigned the political balance of      the United States Senate. A Governor whose candidacy for the      Presidency altered the nature of presidential campaigns;      another whose exemplary service at the beginning of the      twenty-first century reflected the virtues Vermont's      eighteenth century constitution calls ``absolutely necessary      . . . the firm adherence to justice, moderation, temperance,      industry, and frugality.''       Our historian will read of an opinion of the Vermont      Supreme Court that framed a debate for a nation. And of the      people of Vermont who demonstrated what the result is when      that debate is conducted with respect and resolved in      humanity.       If the Vermont of the twenty-second century is as blessed      as ours, there will still be a justice system that ``speaks      for principle and listens for change.'' Just as the      Commission on the Future of Vermont's Justice System      envisioned when on the eve of the twenty-first century a new      Chief Justice wrote: ``if the future is realized in the way      every member of the Commission devoutly wishes it to be, a      century hence our successors will     hear these fundamental principles resonate as clearly as we      hear them resonate today.''       I am optimistic about that future. How could I not be with      these daughters?       This portrait (assuming, of course, it is actually hung)      may gather dust well into the next century. As school field      trips will endure, I am confident that so too will the duty      of new law clerks to conduct students on tours.       To the question: ``Who is that in the painting?'' I trust      that current and future clerks will always know the answer      is: ``A Vermonter.''                          ____________________
