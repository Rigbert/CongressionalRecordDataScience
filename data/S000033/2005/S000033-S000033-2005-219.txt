 Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to commend the Craftsbury Chamber Players, who this year are celebrating a double anniversary. For 40 consecutive years they have performed chamber music in the Northeast Kingdom of Vermont, and for 25 consecutive years they have performed in Burlington, Vermont's largest city. Founded and still directed by pianist Mary Anthony Cox, the Craftsbury Chamber Players bring chamber music of the highest order to northern Vermont.  The Northeast Kingdom is the least populous area of Vermont, yet every summer the woods of Craftsbury, Hardwick and Greensboro reverberate with the sounds of Haydn, Schubert, Dvorak, and twentieth century music. The Craftsbury Players present concerts that are both innovative and broad. Their repertoire spans over 300 years of music, introducing audiences to little-known works of the past and present, as well as those great chamber pieces which have sustained generations of music lovers. Every concert explores music which should be heard, but often isn't: forgotten works by major composers, supposedly difficult compositions by twentieth century modernists, and seldom-preformed works from our very own day.  These world-class performers come to Vermont to play together, to make music because they love the great richness which comes from measured rhythms and ordered sound. It is fitting that this year their anniversary celebration will be capped by the world premiere of a quintet by Kenji Bunch, a long-time violist with the Craftsbury Players. Commissioned especially for this anniversary, it will be performed on July 20, 2005 in Burlington and July 21 in Hardwick.  The Craftsbury Chamber Players have shared their love of music with thousands of people in Vermont. On this, their 40th anniversary, the people of Vermont salute them for their dedication to music and for bringing the best in music to our communities.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Page E761]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                   CHAMBER MUSIC OF THE HIGHEST ORDER                                 ______                                                           HON.
