He has been here a long time as well. I do not believe I have ever tried to demean this House, and I hope he thinks I never would.  Now, this is not my amendment; but as I started to say to him, this is an amount which speaks to a legitimate legislative perspective, that is to say whether or not an expenditure should be in one section of the bill or another. This is a substantive issue. This is whether or not we should pay the utility bills of the Vice President's residence out of the Vice President's office account or we ought to pay it out of the Navy's account.  Nobody on this floor, nobody, has demeaned the Vice President. I have not heard one adverse word about the Vice President on this floor. This is a legitimate objective of legislators. You may disagree with the amendment, but it is not a demeaning amendment.
