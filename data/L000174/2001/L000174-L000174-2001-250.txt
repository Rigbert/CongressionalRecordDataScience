We cannot vote on final passage until the managers' package is here. I thank the majority leader for his help. As I said before, I don't think the bill could have gotten as far as it did without that help. I wish the administration had kept to the agreement they made September 30. We would have a more balanced bill. I still am not sure why the administration backed away from their agreement. I am the old style Vermonter: When you make an agreement, you stick with it. But they decided not to, and it slowed us up a bit.
