President, I rise today to recognize the 183rd anniversary of Greek Independence and pay tribute to the contributions of Greece and our Greek-American community. It was on this day in 1821, that Greek patriots rose up against the Ottoman empire and began an 8-year struggle that culminated in a new Greek Republic.  It is fitting that we take this day to reflect on the enormous contributionsthe Greek people have made to the modern world. Our own democratic principles have their very foundation in the practices of the ancient Greek republic. Indeed, the ancient Greeks developed the concept of democracy, in which the supreme power to govern was vested in the people. Our own Founding Fathers modeled the American government on the principles of Greek democracy. Thomas Jefferson studied the Greek classics in his youth and was inspired by their philosophy throughout his life, most dramatically when he crafted the Declaration of Independence. When formulating his vision for this country, Jefferson specifically referred to the integrated assertions, theories, and aims of the classic Greek world.  Today, our admiration for Greece continues. Greece and the United States, partners in NATO, are at the forefront of the effort for freedom, democracy, peace, stability, and human rights, forging a close bond between the two nations. We look forward to working closely with Greece in the coming years as we examine ways to bring full peace, stability, and prosperity to all the nations of Europe and the world.  As we celebrate Greek independence, we must also remember the history of those who sacrificed their lives to preserve American freedom and democracy. Greek Americans have served proudly and honorably in every U.S. engagement and war. It is through their efforts and others that we maintain a Nation committed to fighting and winning this war or terrorism.  Today, we join the world in anticipating the momentous 2004 Summer Olympic Games, which will be held in Athens, the birthplace of the Olympic tradition. This event not only highlights the achievements of thousands of world athletes, but signifies the importance of working together to provide greater opportunity and freedom for the citizens of the world.  I am proud to join many of my colleagues as a cosponsor of S. Res. 308 designating March 25, 2004 as Greek Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and American Democracy. We value our friendship and continuing partnership with the government and people of Greece. I would especially like to offer all Greek Americans my best wishes as they celebrate this day of independence. Finally, I ask all citizens to reflect on the many important contributions to freedom, democracy, peace, and stability Greece and Greek Americans have made to this country and our world.                          ____________________
