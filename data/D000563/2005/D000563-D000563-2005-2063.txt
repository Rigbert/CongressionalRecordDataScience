The Sessions amendment changes S. 256, the bankruptcy bill, in the section where the bill establishes a presumption that people are abusing bankruptcy. In other words, they are not entitled to bankruptcy. The Sessions amendment says that the judge should consider whether the person who has filed for bankruptcy is in the active military service and is therefore a special circumstance. So Senator Sessions leaves the military men and women in the section of this bill where one presumes to be abusing the law. I do not approach it in that way at all, and that is the reason why the military groups and families are supporting my amendment and not the Sessions amendment.  As I said earlier, Senator Sessions certainly respects the military, but we can show our respect for the military by saying if they are activated to serve this country, if they are removed from their family, removed from their job, removed from their business, and terrible things happen and the business fails or their family goes into bankruptcy and they have to go back to America with their life and limbs intact and file in bankruptcy court, we are going to give them special consideration. They did something special for America; we are going to do something special for them. We are not going to make them jump through all the hoops that have been created by this new bankruptcy law that are expensive, time consuming, and loaded with documents that need to be filed. We are going to protect their home for $75,000 worth at least, wherever they happen to be assigned in the military. We are going to protect their basic possessions that they can have after the bankruptcy is over, and we are not going to protect those creditors and lenders which abused them by charging interest rates which were sky high. We will not give them their day in court.
