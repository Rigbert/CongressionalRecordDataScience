Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge the fact that September is Suicide Prevention Awareness Month. This gives all of us a chance to come together to promote awareness about the issue of suicide prevention and how we can all help others talk about suicide. For many families in communities across the country, loved ones are gone far too soon because of suicide.  Suicidal thoughts and action certainly know no bounds. They affect people of all ages, races, sexes, and religions. The statistics are startling. Suicide has become the third leading cause of death among young people and is the 10th leading cause of death here in the U.S. Each year, more than 40,000 Americans die by suicide--more than 100 per day, on average.  A week and a half ago, I was in Kalamazoo's Bronson Park for the Gryphon Place Suicide Prevention Walk. A beautiful young woman by the name of Kait stood before a crowd of more than 100 and read a stirring poem about being bullied and, as a result, how she harbored thoughts of suicide.  Hearing her deeply personal story certainly broke everyone's heart. It really did. As a father of two young adults, my thoughts quickly turned to them and their school experiences. Bullying is a very serious problem in our schools and can lead to depression, psychological issues, and, of course, suicide.  When she finished, I followed up with her and told her that she is not alone. Anyone considering suicide or having suicidal thoughts should know the same. You are not alone, and there are always help and options available.  In our communities, we have got to do more to stop bullying the minute it rears its ugly head. We should do more to reach out to those vulnerable to suicidal thoughts and tendencies, particularly young people, as they grapple with the pressures of growing up. We should also do more to treat mental health issues that can lead to suicide.  Here in the House, we recently were able to pass a very strong bipartisan piece of legislation sponsored by Dr. Tim Murphy, a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, to do just that. We voted to give a much-needed upgrade to our mental health system and deliver real reforms that are going to make a difference for folks suffering with mental health illnesses.  In July, it was advanced through our committee 53-0, and then on the House floor by a 422-2 vote. This landmark vote marks the most significant reform to our Nation's mental health programs in decades, and I was proud to shepherd this important piece of legislation and now work with the Senate to get it done.  Suicide prevention is deeply personal to me. I don't talk about it often, but my uncle, my daughter's college roommate, and my son's dear girlfriend's sister all committed suicide. Those losses have left an indelible impression on my life.  Suicide is not an issue that can linger in the shadows. We have got to confront it and the underlying issues behind it together.  I include in the Record Kait's message of hope and inspiration. It can also be found on my Web site, upton.house.gov.                          My (Survival) Story     I tried to start writing my story, but all that became of it            was complicated comparisons and meaningless metaphors.     I thought that's just what I had do, to connect with people.     Tell some confusing story about a lion and a lamb, or a            turtle and a hare with some hidden cliche reworded            moral of a story, explaining how the inferior character            always wins in the end, and people would just get what            I was trying to say.     But, you see, in reality, I didn't know which character I was            supposed to play and so I played someone different            every single day.     You see it's hard to stand up for yourself, when you don't            even know who you are, and in school, if you didn't            define yourself, others had no problem doing it for            you.     So my name tag read Kait, but the names people called me            sounded nothing like that.     slut, queer, trash, worthless, nothing.     I call them names, because that's what I became. At least in            my mind, so it kept me in line.     for seven years in the hall I looked at the ground, I thought            people wouldn't kick me if I was already down.     And if I didn't look up, I couldn't see the mirror, that way            you and I could both pretend I wasn't even there.     And they decided that popcorn looked even better in my hair,            but when I hid in the bathroom stall during lunch, they            said I was throwing up my food.     Which, I was.     because I was too big, too small, too short, too tall, too            skinny, and too fat.     I was big foot and man hands, with gorilla arm hair.     I took up other people's air and might as well go die in a            hole because no one even wants me here.     But that was okay, I didn't want to be here either.     My mom still thinks I fractured my hand from catching it in            the door, but I had the locker slammed on it because if            you cry, that means you're asking for more.     And I didn't know how to face her, or the fact that I was a            failure.     And even though I just graduated, I still feel I owe her            apologies.     for the messages everyday the principal left on her phone,            for the days she had to get me, because I couldn't            drive myself home, for the permanent art work on my            arms that wouldn't ever be hung on fridge, for always            playing too close to the ledge.     Because I couldn't pass math, but I could calculate just how            many pills it took me to get sick without passing out            so I didn't have to go to school the next day.     42.     I'm sorry.     Even once they were done with me, I felt like I owed them an            apology.     Like they could hit me in the face, and I would apologize for            standing in the way of their hand.     There were times I didn't believe I would be here today.     But look at me now, look where I stand,     Never did I realize that my own two hands had to the power to            control my life. or end it.     My own principal, looked at me and said there was nothing he            could do, unless I was seriously hurt.     Like to actually be noticed, I'd have to be dead in the dirt.     Because he thought that even if I walked away crying, as long            as I was still alive and walking, it wasn't his            problem.     His position of power told him he could decide when I was in            pain, but he wasn't the one who had to stand in the            rain.     Look in my eyes, look at my arms, read my poetry, can you            still see me?     I lost myself halfway between my current normalcy and my            makeshift reality.     Drowning in a sea of ideas that unless I became just another            number in data about bullying, that I wouldn't actually            make a difference.     because in a world where we focus on problems like gun            control, we over look the fact that people can cause            just as much damage with their words.     An issue is defined as a topic that can be debated or            discussed, Like the ``issue'' I had with bullying was            something that could be compromised.     Like my own life, was a thing that could be compromised.     It's like if you see a lamb being slaughtered, you just let            it continue, because you too are a lamb, and it very            well could be you.     I think in a way that's kind of the worlds view, like if i            don't change a number or a statistic. There's nothing I            actually went through.     Tell me why no stories ever make the news, about being a            survivor of bullying.     but if my story was told, after I was six feet under, it            would actually mean something.     It doesn't take 50 cents a day, it literally costs nothing to            be a decent human being, or to simply treat each person            like they have some meaning.     they say charity begins at home, but I think that's where the            love should start too because those that know hurt are            the ones that hurt you and my brothers and sisters who            have walked in my shoes, i'm sorry if it gave you            blisters for the longest time I tried to wear a pair            that didn't fit, when I tried to be a she, that wasn't            me.     Bullying is not just a consequence, the effects I still live            with are alive and real, sometimes they are more real            than I feel.     You can not push me under the rug because I am still here.     I am not just another bullying story.     And I am not just my bullying story.     Put a name to my face and call me, survivor.                            ____________________
