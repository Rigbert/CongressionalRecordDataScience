 President, I must respond to the Senator from Oklahoma because he mischaracterizes the Democratic plan. His statement might be correct if it were taken in an isolated sense. But if you take it with the medical necessity definitions on page 85 of the Democratic plan, you will see that ``a group health plan and a health insurer, in connection with a provision of health insurance coverage, may not arbitrarily interfere with or alter the decision of the treating physician regarding the manner or setting in which particular services are delivered if the services are medically necessary or appropriate for treatment.''  Then it goes on to define medical necessity as a service or benefit which is consistent with generally accepted principles of professional medical practice. It does not give the plan the opportunity in its fine print to throw out medical necessity.
