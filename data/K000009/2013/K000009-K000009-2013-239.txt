Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable American who has proudly served our nation as an Air Force veteran and our Toledo community as a successful entrepreneur, extraordinary philanthropist and a true friend to so many--Mr. Jim Findlay.  Jim Findlay is the epitome of a true gentleman. His influence and compassion have impacted the lives of thousands of people. Jim has been a coach to our youth; a mentor to our young adults. He is always there for those who seek a champion for their cause. His support of local initiatives is deep and legendary as he shares his leadership, connections and incredible financial support earning him innumerable awards including the area's Outstanding Philanthropist Award, The University of Toledo's Blue T and Gold T awards and the highly coveted Jefferson Award. He is a 70- year member of Glenwood Lutheran Church, a board member of the House of Emmanuel and he has served as chairman of many fundraising campaigns for ProMedica, Sylvania Athletics and The University of Toledo and others.  Jim attended Scott High School, then The University of Toledo where he began his lifelong love affair with the UT Rockets--as well as the 1947 Homecoming Queen Celia Koontz Findlay. He and Celia were married for more than 50 years until her passing in 2004. Jim is a dedicated family man to his children Jim Jr, Sarah, Jon, their spouses Cindy, Jack and Linda, a beloved grandfather to Ally and Jonathon Findlay--and wonderful companion to PJ Schaefer.  Jim has proudly been affiliated with the Boy Scouts of America, Toledo Rotary Club, BigBrothers-Big Sisters of NW Ohio, Lutheran Social Services and the Sylvania Athletic Foundation.  At The University of Toledo, he has been involved with The Tower Club, President's Club, Downtown Coaches, UT Alumni Association, College of Business & Family Business Center, Sales Executive of the Day, Honorary Doctorate of Management, Pacemaker of the Year, Catherine Eberly Center for Women, UT Foundation Board and The Findlay Building--the athletic complex at Scott Park--is named in his honor. He established The Celia Koontz Findlay Scholarship, The James R. Findlay Scholarship, and the Jim & Celia Findlay Family Business Award. He chaired The University of Toledo's Council for Academic Excellence to raise funds for scholarships. He also received the UT Athletic Department's 12th Man Award and is an honorary member of the Varsity T Club.  He has also been involved with ProMedica's Wine Event, Autism Fundraising Council, The Goerlich Center Campaign, Flower Hospital's Women's Auxiliary Flower Hospital Cancer and a member of the Stevens Warren Flower Society.  In 2001 he published ``In the Company of Friends'', a book of his life experiences.  Jim has also been awarded an Honorary Degree from Lourdes College, the Newman Award, Servant Leadership Award, Toledo Community Award, ``Grow our Economy--Develop our People'' Award and Ernst & Young Entrepreneur Award.  Jim is the founder of Impact Products and, upon his retirement, in typical Jim Findlay fashion, he gave the company to his employees. The company's name--IMPACT--is a testament to the impact that one person can selflessly make on the lives of so many. We, the family of Toledo and NW Ohio blessed and honored, know and pay tribute to our dear friend, Jim Findlay, who in good time and times of great struggle, teaches us by way of his courageous example.                          ____________________
