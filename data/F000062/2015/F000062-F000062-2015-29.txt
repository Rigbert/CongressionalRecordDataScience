 President, I wish to speak and urge a ``no'' vote on amendment No. 2552, known as the Coons amendment.  This amendment essentially adds another layer of review to the bill's current requirements. We worked this out in an earlier amendment with Senator Carper. This amendment goes further, and it could prevent parts of the government from quickly learning about cyber threats at machine speed because it would require an additional privacy review for any information going through the DHS portal.  The Carper amendment that I spoke about was adopted as part of the managers' package, which made clear that the government should take automated steps to ensure that the real-time information sharing system can both protect privacy and allow for sharing at the speed necessary to stop cyber threats. Because the Coons amendment will slow down sharing via the DHS portal, I ask my colleagues to join me in voting no.
