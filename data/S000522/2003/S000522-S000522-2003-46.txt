Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute to thank my friends and colleagues for their very strong statements and their passion on this issue.  The gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cardin), who is the ranking Democrat on the Helsinki Commission, we work together. There is no division. There is no air between our shoulders as we promote human rights in general and the elimination, or a zero tolerance policy towards torture within the OSCE.  There are 55 countries that make up the OSCE. At the parliamentary assemblies and with bilateral meetings and with country visits, we bring this issue up. We bring it up with the heads of state, we go to gulags, like the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wolf), who is also a member of our commission, and we do all that we can to stop torture in the first place.  But as this bill seeks to do, there are victims, they number in the millions, and their needs are not being cared for in many instances, especially overseas. The lucky ones make it here as emigres and as asylum seekers, and we have to make sure that both domestically and internationally, we try to mitigate that enormous pain and the nightmares they carry with them. As we know from our hearings and from our site visits from talking to these victims, maybe they cannot be cured fully and completely, but the pain can be eliminated to a great extent, and they can develop coping mechanisms and the like in order to deal with it and live a more normal life despite the fact that they have suffered so horrifically.  So I want to thank my friends and colleagues. And again, the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos), who knows this personally, who is a Holocaust survivor and is always out front on human rights. It is always great to work as a teammate with him. And, again, I thank the gentleman from Maryland for his kinds words, as well as my friend and colleague from Minnesota, I want to thank her as well.
