President, I would like to engage the chairman in a colloquy. As the chairman knows, the Senate provided $100 million from the Land and Water Conservation Fund for the stateside matching grant program. I want to thank the chairman for recognizing the interests of over 30 Senators to revitalize this program. When the Land and Water Conservation Fund was created, the State matching program was launched to assist States in the acquisition of parks and recreation facilities. This is as it should be. The Land and Water Conservation Fund was created on the premise that revenues generated by the depletion of our Nation's energy resource should be reinvested in the conservation of our resources through land acquisition for Federal, State and local priorities. The matching grants have helped finance over 37,500 park and recreation projects throughout the United States. These are projects each one of us can identify in our home States that are now used as ballparks, hiking trails, river access, and greenspace. Although the conference report does not set aside funds for the State matching program, the Interior Department may use part of the $700 million appropriation for this purpose. Is that correct?
