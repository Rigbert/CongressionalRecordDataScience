I want to be clear about what is at issue in this debate.  The debate about boilers stems from the fact that the EPA did not originally get the boiler rules right. The agency admitted they did not get them right, and the agency said they needed 15 months to fix the boiler rules. But the courts said the agency could not have the time. They said that EPA could have 30 days to fix the rules.  As colleagues have said, this debate has gone on for so long there is no way it is going to be turned around in 30 days. So I joined in the legislation to give the EPA 15 months to rewrite the rules so as to protect good-paying jobs and communities that are affected by the boiler rules, while ensuring the health of our people and the protection of our environment.  That was 15 months ago. EPA got the time it said it needed to rewrite the rules, and the new final rules will be out within 90 days. I wish to outline for the Senate what the new rules will do.  First, the new rules, as proposed in the legislation, change what constitutes solid waste so that boiler fuels, for example, that are wood waste can be used for fuels such as biomass; and waste from steel mills, as another example, can be used as a fuel, as they are today, rather than to be regulated out of existence as a fuel source.  Second, as proposed in the legislation, the new rules will create an open-to-the-public list of what can and cannot be burned in a boiler. This is going to provide important predictability and certainty to American industry, and it will provide new accountability to our communities. All across the United States, folks are going to be able to know, as a result of these new rules, what can and cannot be actually burned in a boiler.  Third, again, just like the legislation, the rules address the fact that because EPA was unable to get the rules right at the outset, more time is needed for compliance.  I know the distinguished Presiding Officer has been interested in this issue as well: the question of compliance andthe time that would be provided for industries to meet the standards.  In the final rule, the compliance clock is reset with a rule providing additional time for industry to comply. This is like what was in the original legislation. So industry will have 4 years to comply, and Administrator Jackson stated in writing that she will assist any hard-hit community, any company facing extra duress in terms of complying. Administrator Jackson has indicated on a case-by-case basis she will provide additional time to help those communities and to help those companies.  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Administrator's letter to me be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                       United States Environmental                                            Protection Agency,                                    Washington, DC, March 5, 2012.     Hon. Ron Wyden,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Wyden: Thank you for your continuing interest      in the air toxics standards for boilers. We are currently in      the process of developing final standards and responding to      additional, useful information we received during the public      comment period on the reconsidered standards we proposed last      December. We intend to finalize the standards this spring. In      the proposal, EPA proposed to ``reset'' the three year      compliance clock to give entities the full amount of time      available under the Clean Air Act upon finalization of the      rule, and, subject to the formal rulemaking process, expects      to do so in the final rule. The Act also gives state and      local permitting authorities the ability to provide up to a      one-year extension of that deadline, on a case-by-case basis,      as necessary, for the installation of controls.       While EPA believes facilities can meet compliance      requirements within the four years described above, I commit      to you that EPA will handle each situation on a case-by-case      basis, and work with facilities to determine the appropriate      response and resolution. We have authority available to us to      resolve concerns that might arise at individual facilities as      long as appropriate and timely steps are being taken towards      compliance.       Additionally, as required by the Clean Air Act, we proposed      and will finalize air toxic standards for boilers based on      real-life data that industry has provided to us about the      level of emissions from their facilities. As EPA reviews the      public comments and data as we finalize these standards, we      will pay close attention to their achievability. We intend to      set standards that can be met by plants operating in the real      world.       Again, thank you for your continued attention to this      matter. It is important to ensure that we achieve these key      public health standards in a way that is sensitive to      legitimate needs of business interests. If you have      additional questions, please feel free to contact me or have      your staff contact Arvin Ganesan, Associate Administrator for      Congressional and Intergovernmental Relations at (202) 564      5200.           Sincerely,                                                  Lisa P. Jackson.
