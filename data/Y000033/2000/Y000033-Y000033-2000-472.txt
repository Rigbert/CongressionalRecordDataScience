Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I appreciate the gentleman's comments; but I would suggest again with my amendment, the administration and the agency itself had said that they will reach the $19 million and we will only lose, if anything, none this time, all existing programs continue, and next year 10 people are lost, 10 after that, 20 in total; but we will have an accounting, and they will not have this fund which they can use. Remember, this is for the next administration. If there is a problem they cannot implement it because of this legislation, we always can address that. But I do not want anybody to be able to get into that cookie jar. As we remember in 1992, only 2 percent was used for administrative costs; and beginning in 1993 and on, it went up to the full 14 percent. So I do not want that to occur, because there is no justification for that.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from South Dakota (Mr. Thune).
