 President, I support Senator Chafee's proposal to extend the Medicare Select Program, which currently provides Medigap health benefits to roughly 400,000 older Americans by using a managed care model.  Like many of the other original cosponsors of this legislation, I come from one of the 15 States where the Medicare Select demonstration program has proved its popularity during the last 3 years.  Medicare Select, which currently provides 100,000 Californians with low-cost Medigap insurance using a managed care model, was enacted in 1990 as a 3-year demonstration program and has proved to be extremely popular, enrolling 400,000 seniors in 15 States.  This program used a network of providers to cut premium costs by 10-30 percent over fee for service Medigap products--those services and costs not covered by Medicare--according to several reports.  In California, roughly 100,000 seniors have signed up for the program, and Blue Cross of California alone is enrolling an additional 2,200 per month. These Medicare enrollees are signing up because the Medicare Select Program can provide low-cost, high-quality health benefits, while still retaining a high degree of choice over their physician.  The reason for the program's popularity are simple. In order to save money or receive added benefits, more and more older Americans are enrolling in managed care plans.  In fact, Consumer Reports lists many Medicare Select products as its highest rated values, and extension of the Medicare Select Program is strongly endorsed by California Insurance Commissioner Garamendi, as well as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.  In addition, the Mainstream plan--and nearly every other health reform proposed this Congress--provided for a continuation and expansion of Medicare Select and other forms of managed Medicare.  Certainly, managed Medicare programs like Medicare Select must be implemented carefully, in order to ensure that Medicare enrollees are appropriately informed of the benefits of this program, provided with high-quality services, and ensured access to highly trained physicians. In addition, managed care programs must be shown to provide lower costs to the Federal Government in addition to consumer discounts.  However, without the extension of the Medicare Select Program, which [[Page S799]] has already proven its initial success, new enrollments will be cut off in July 1995--before additional health care reform will have been enacted.  In the absence of national health care reform, I believe that this successful and popular managed Medicare program should be allowed to continue.                                 ______      By
