Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.  The text of the amendment is as follows:       At the end of the bill, add the following (and conform the      table of contents accordingly):                   TITLE VI--MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS     SEC. 6001.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 419, the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, much of the majority's argument here is based on providing relief to the American consumer, and this amendment would provide a real and potentially immediate relief to American consumers.  Two years ago in the Senate, in the spring when we were having a big run-up in oil prices, they had the head of Exxon Mobil testify. He said, Hey, don't blame us for those high prices. He said, Blame Wall Street. He basically said that 60 cents to 70 cents per gallon at the pump is going to Wall Street speculators. So if we want to provide real relief to the American people, we need to rein in speculation.  But the Republicans only have one watchdog out there--the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. They are supposed to set up position limits for nonparticipants, people just speculating on price, not people actually utilizing these commodities. That hasn't been done, and they are otherwise under relenting attack, including a $10 million cut in their budget by the Republicans.  So if we really wanted to do something to help consumers, we would pass this amendment, get a few more watchdogs downtown, put in place those position limits on speculators, and next May you wouldn't see prices run up $1, $1.25, $1.50 a gallon like we see every May. That has to do with two things: refinery manipulation by the industry and speculation by Wall Street. We are not addressing either of those things.  Today, we are talking about putting more land up for leasing. And today, we have a total of 35,397,010 acres of active leases, and the nonproducing leases are 30,019,256, i.e., that is about 85 percent of the leases that are nonproducing leases.  They have got plenty of places to go now. It is in their interest to constrain supply somewhere along the way. It hasn't been on the side of production because we are exporting crude oil. We are still exporting gasoline, even. It has been on the refinery side and has been speculation by Wall Street that has driven up the price.  I urge adoption of this amendment and reserve the balance of my time.
