 President, I rise today to introduce, and now send to the desk, the Illegal Immigration Control and Enforcement Act of 1995. This bill incorporates many of the concepts in the immigration package that I introduced in the last session of Congress. New proposals have been added, however, after consultation with many, including California's law enforcement officials and others interested in curbing illegal immigration.  Mr. President, I offer this legislation not to compete with Senator Simpson's S. 269, which he introduced on January 24, but rather to complement it. Little in this bill is duplicative of Senator Simpson's legislation. I am convinced that, combined, these two bills could offer a strong, straightforward program to stop illegal immigration.  There simply is no time to lose. The crisis of illegal immigration continues in California and throughout the Nation.  Too many people are still able to illegally cross our borders, and too few States, most notably California, carry the burden of having to support, educate, and often incarcerate the hundreds of thousands who enter this country illegally each year.  There is no doubt in my mind that our border enforcement has improved in the last 2 years and I want to thank this administration for an unprecedented commitment to that end. I am equally convinced, however, that steps already taken have been insufficient to fully address the problem.  Despite its major flaws and probable unconstitutionality, proposition 187 in California was overwhelmingly approved by voters last November. The message was clear: Stop illegal immigration. If Congress does not heed this warning, I fear an even more serious backlash nationwide against all immigrants, including those who want to come to our country legally.                          Impact on California  One reason proposition 187 passed by such a large margin is that Californians know the impact of immigration on our State. According to 1993 INS statistics, 45 percent of the Nation's illegal immigrants are now in California. That means between 1.6 and 2.3 million illegal immigrants now reside in our State; 15 percent of California's State prison population--or almost 20,000 inmates--is comprised of incarcerated illegal immigrants; 45 percent of all persons with pending asylum cases reside in California; 35 percent of the refugees to this country claimed residency in California in 1993; and almost 30 percent of the legal immigrants in this have country chosen to live in California.  According to the Governor of our State, illegal immigration in fiscal year 1995-96 will cost California an estimated $3.6 billion, including an $2.66 billion for the federally mandated costs of education, health care, and incarceration. By anyone's estimation, that is a staggering sum, and a tremendous burden on just one State.                    The Need for Immigration Reform  I believe our Federal response to the problem of illegal immigration must address four key goals: First, control illegal immigration at the border; second, reduce the economic incentives to come to the United States illegally; third, deal swiftly and severely with document forgers and alien smugglers; and fourth, remove criminal aliens from our Nation's prisons and jails, while assuring that their sentences are served in their countries of origin.                             Border Control  This legislation requires that at least 700, and up to 1,000, new Border Patrol agents be hired in each of the next 3 fiscal years. It differs from the crime bill in one critical respect. The crime bill authorized the hiring of up to 1,000 new agents in each of Fiscal Years 1996, 1997 and 1998. This bill further requires that a minimum of 700 agents per year be hired. It thus adds a floor to the crime bill which will assure that no fewer than 2,100 new agents, and up to 900 support personnel, will be on board by the end of Fiscal Year 1998 for a total of 7,082 Border Patrol agents.  It mandates the hiring of sufficient INS border inspectors to fully staff all legal crossing lanes at peak periods. The bill also provides for improved border infrastructure and Border Patrol training.                          Reducing Incentives  Second, this legislation substantially expands existing employer sanctions and wage and hour law enforcement programs to reduce the biggest incentives for undocumented persons to come to this country, namely jobs.  Central to this effort is the creation of a counterfeit-proof work and benefits authorization verification system. Any employer--and any provider of federally funded benefits--ought to be 100 percent certain that a candidate is here legally. A counterfeit-proof verification system is the only way this can be achieved.  In addition, this bill dramatically increases the civil fines for anyone who knowingly hires, recruits, or refers illegal aliens for hiring. This is important because today the civil penalties for illegally hiring an illegal immigrant are very low. Fines range between just $250 and $2,000--per alien hired--for a first offense.  This bill would increase that range from $1,000 to $3,000 for the first offense.  Second offenses would carry per alien fines of between $3,000 and $7,000, and third or later offenses would cost $7,000 to $20,000 per alien--that is more than double the current $3,000 to $10,000 liability.  It dramatically increases the criminal penalties for a pattern or practice of hiring illegal immigrants. This bill doubles the maximum criminal fine, and triples the maximum jail sentence, for anyone who facilitates a fraudulent application for benefits by an unlawful alien by counterfeiting the seal or stamp of any Federal agency. If this bill is enacted, the new maximums will be $500,000, or 15 years in jail, or both.  It provides for additional INS and Department of Labor inspectors to enforce existing laws and provides for the hiring of additional assistant U.S. attorneys to more aggressively prosecute these crimes.                      Smuggling and Document Fraud  Shutting down false document mills, counterfeiters, smugglers, and smuggling organizations is the third priority at the core of this legislation.  Smugglers and forgers will find this to be a very tough bill indeed. This legislation broadens current Federal asset seizure authority to include those who smuggle or harbor illegal aliens, and those who produce false work and benefits documents.  It imposes tough minimum and maximum sentences on smugglers, and it imposes those penalties for each alien smuggled. At the moment, penalties are assessed per transaction, no matter how many illegal immigrants a smuggler takes across our borders.  This bill increases the penalty for smugglers in the event that an alien is injured, killed, or subject to blackmail threats by the smuggler.  It makes it easier to deport so-called weekend warriors--legal permanent residents, green card holders, who are in the United States, smuggle illegal immigrants for profit, and then try to use their immigration status to avoid being deported from the United States.  It dramatically increases penalties for document forgers or counterfeiters. First offenders will be sentenced to 2\1/2\ to 5 years, 5 to 10 years with any prior felony conviction, and 10 to 15 years with two or more prior felonies. Currently, document forgers can receive as little as 0 to 6 months for a first offense.                            Criminal Aliens  This legislation is intended to once again signal that the President must have the authority, by treaty, to deport aliens convicted of crimes in this country for secure incarceration in such aliens' home countries.  Although we have prisoner transfer treaty agreements with many nations now, they are subject to the consent of the prisoner to be transferred. If the prisoner does not consent, he is not transferred.  This legislation eliminates that obstacle. It also would speed up the deportation process and make more criminal aliens deportable by broadening the definition of an aggravated felony for which aliens may already be deported to include document fraud crimes not now independent grounds for deportation; it classifies as aggravated felonies certain offenses punishable by 3 years, rather than for which an alien has actually been sentenced to 5 years or more. As a result, it would definitely increase the number of criminals who would qualify for deportation as having committed aggravated felony.  In addition, courts would have the authority to require that, in order to receive a sentence of probation rather than a prison term, an illegal alien convicted of a crime would be required to consent to being deported as a condition of probation. This would give prosecutors the option of ejecting from the country relatively low-level offenders after trial without going through an additional, and often lengthy, deportation hearing.                      Sponsors of Legal Immigrants  Before concluding, let me note just one other feature of the bill which pertains to immigrants who have lawfully come to the United States on the basis of a citizen's--usually an immediate relative's--sponsorship. The legislation would require anyone who sponsors a legal immigrant for admission to the United States to make good on their promise of financial support should the [[Page S4264]] legal alien require assistance before becoming a citizen.  In addition, past proposals to strengthen sponsorship agreements typically exempted sponsors from liability for medical costs.  This legislation would make sponsors responsible for the costs of medical care, requiring them to obtain health insurance for the immigrant they have sponsored. The insurance would be of a type and amount to be specified by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and would be required to be purchased within 20 days of an immigrant's arrival in this country. A safety valve is built into the bill, however, for sponsors who die, or who become impoverished or bankrupt.                          Border Crossing Fee  This bill also provides a funding mechanism for this package with a border crossing fee of $1 per person, which could yield up to $400 million per year. The border control, the infrastructure, the training, the additional narcotics abatement efforts provided in this bill all could be underwritten by such a fee.                               Conclusion  In conclusion, Mr. President, immigration is too much at the core of what America means to each of us individually, and to our society collectively, to politicize and polarize the coming debate. If we are to map common ground together, it is the spirit of compromise that must prevail. We owe America--America the Nation and America the idea--no less.  I look forward to continuing to work closely with the chairman of my subcommittee, Senator Simpson, with Senators Kennedy and Simon, and with all of my Republican colleagues on the subcommittee to present the full Judiciary Committee and the Senate with the best possible comprehensive illegal immigration legislation as quickly as possible.                                 ______      By
