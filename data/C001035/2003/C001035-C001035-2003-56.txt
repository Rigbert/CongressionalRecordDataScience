President, I rise today to call my colleagues' attention to an awards dinner being held in the Lewiston/Auburn communities of Maine. This event, ``Celebrating the Women of L/A,'' honors those women who have demonstrated, through their accomplishments and their caring, a significant impact on their community.  The women honored in the Twin Cities' celebration have accomplished a great deal. Women across the country have soared through space, raised children, developed life-saving medicines, cared for a loved one, established businesses, and quietly improved the lives of those in their families and their communities. This special Maine dinner not only recognizes the business or scientific accomplishments of women, but also, all that these honorees bring to their families and their communities.  Those submitting nominations were asked to describe briefly what it was about the nominee that made her such a special and important part of the community. Here are a few examples: ``She has coordinated charity work of many organizations such as the collection of money, clothing, coal, wood, groceries, stoves, furniture, and toys for the Relief Society; organized the sponsorship for a maternity room and children's room at Central Maine Medical Center; and selected children to receive assistance from churches.''  ``Mom works hard. She helps me. She takes me swimming. She gets me toys. She takes me shopping. We have girl-time. We go to the movie theater. She makes me dinner. She helps me clean. We cuddle on the couch and watch movies.''  ``When you need her, she's there. When you're not sure you want anyone around, she's still there for you--especially with her children. She's had to cope with the tragic death of her mother and had many set backs, and still she has maintained the strength to be there for all of us.''  ``She is a lifeline. She has been there for me through several tough times in my life, lending her support or sometimes just a sympathetic ear. She has never judged me, as others have, for my less than brilliant choices in life. No matter what the cost, she is always there to defend my decisions to anyone who may have something to say. Though her schedule is busy, she always makes time for me and for that I value her friendship.''  ``She is a professional in her field. She takes her job very seriously and always gives it her all to help people. She is a very loyal, dedicated individual who works hard for what she has.''  ``Mothers influence their children's lives in profound ways. My mom's influence has been no exception to that statement. She lived through the nightmare of seeing two brothers seriously injured during World War II and married a man that served during the Korean War. Yet, as far back as I can remember, my Mom was always cheerful and optimistic.''  ``My mother has never had time for herself, and now has her own health needs that she must attend to. Nevertheless, she still tends to the needs of others before taking care of herself. Not only has she mourned her husband, father and mother in law, but she has also had to mourn her mother and her only sibling, a brother. My mother has made the most of the sorrow and hardships and she has been an inspiration to so many people, and a wonderful role model for all of her children.''  There are so many more testimonials that were received on behalf of the honorees. They speak to the importance and influence that these women have had on their families, their friends, and their communities.  I am honored to pay tribute to the following Women of L/A: Judy Merced, Crystal Brissette, Sandy Barnies, Linda Saucier, Gail L. Richard, Lorraine Yvonne Poulin Sheehy, and Etta Y. Mitchell.  They each are so deserving of this recognition, and I congratulate them as they are recognized for their efforts in the home, the workplace, and in the community. These women represent so many others for whom no public praise has been made. I offer my thanks and best wishes to all the women of L/A for making our community such a strong and vibrant place to live, work, and raise a family.                          ____________________
