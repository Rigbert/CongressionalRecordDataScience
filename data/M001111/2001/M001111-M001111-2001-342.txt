 President, I rise to indicate that if I were present last Friday, March 23, I would have voted ``yes'' on the motion to table amendment No. 141, to the campaign finance reform bill, offered by Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina.  I was unable to participate in Friday's session because I flew home to Seattle to attend the funeral services for Grace Cole. Grace served on the Shoreline School Board for 13 years and represented North Seattle in the Washington House of Representatives for 15 years.  Grace was my mentor and led the way for advocates like me to follow her from the local school board to the Washington State legislature. Grace made a difference for thousands of families throughout our State by standing up for education, the environment and social justice.
