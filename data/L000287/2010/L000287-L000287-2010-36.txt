Madam Speaker, I would like to thank my good friend, Jack Kingston, for yielding me time.  As the dean of the Georgia delegation, it is my great pleasure to welcome Tom Graves to the United States House of Representatives. Mr. Graves is not a stranger to Georgia politics. He served in the Georgia State House of Representatives for almost 8 years. Tom, I not only welcome you, but I am proud to welcome your beautiful wife, Julie, and your three lovely and beautiful children.
