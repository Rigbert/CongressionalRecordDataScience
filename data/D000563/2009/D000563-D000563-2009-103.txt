What happened on the floor today, when Senator Coburn of Oklahoma refused to give consent to suspending the reading of the amendment, is that the clerk--clerks, I should say--were forced to start reading. As good as they are at reading, the fact is, it was going to take up to 10 hours to read this amendment. During that 10-hour period of time, nothing could happen--no debate, no amendments--nothing other than listening to the clerks' melodious voices. Fortunately for us, the Senator from Vermont stepped up and said: I withdraw the amendment. But if there was a true interest in debate and amendments on health care, it is inconsistent to say we are going to take a day out of the whole affair and read an amendment.  I can tell you, as I said to the Senator from Oklahoma, I can't believe there is a person in America who sat glued to the C-SPAN television listening to this amendment so they would understand it. It is a very complicated amendment page by page but, in general, understandable. The Senator from Vermont was seeking a single-payer health care system. It was not likely to pass, but it is something he believes in fervently and he wanted to offer it. So I would say the strategy on the floor today belies any request that we have more debate and more amendments.  Before the Senator from Rhode Island continues, I think this has been cleared on both sides, but I ask unanimous consent that the time until 6:15 p.m. be equally divided between the two sides, with Senators permitted to speak for up to 15 minutes each.
