President, today I wish to recognize and pay tribute to GEN Carrol H. Chandler for over 36 years of exceptional service and dedication to the U.S. Air Force. He will be retiring from Active Duty on March 1, 2011.  He currently serves as the Vice Chief of Staff of the U.S. Air Force, Washington, DC. As Vice Chief, he presides over the Air Staff and serves as a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Requirements Oversight Council and Deputy Advisory Working Group. He assists the Chief of Staff with organizing, training, and equipping 680,000 Active-Duty, Guard, Reserve and civilian forces serving in the United States and overseas.  A command pilot with more than 3,900 flying hours in the F-15, F-16, andT-38, GEN ``Howie'' Chandler has commanded a major command, a numbered air force, two fighter wings, a support group and a fighter squadron--a true testament to his exceptional airmanship, leadership, and judgment. His staff assignments include tours at Headquarters Pacific Air Forces, the Pentagon, Headquarters U.S. Pacific Command, Headquarters U.S. Military Training Mission in Saudi Arabia, and Headquarters Allied Air Forces Southern Europe.  General Chandler grew up in Carthage, MS. He entered the Air Force in 1974 after graduating from the U.S. Air Force Academy. Following graduation, he attended undergraduate pilot training at Laughlin AFB, TX. He excelled throughout his training and after earning his wings was selected to remain at Laughlin AFB to teach future pilots as a T-38 instructor pilot and flight examiner. He continued as an instructor pilot and assistant operations officers at Randolph Air Force Base, TX. Then, as a testament to Captain Chandler's achievements as a T-38 instructor pilot, he was selected to fly the Air Force's premier air superiority fighter, the F-15 Eagle. Stationed at Kadena Air Base, Japan with the 67th Tactical Fighter Squadron, he continued to shine in the air and on the ground as a squadron standardization officer, flight commander, and wing flight examiner. His prowess in the air earned him a selection to become the chief of Air-to-Air Tactics Branch at Headquarters Pacific Air Forces, Hickam Air Force Base, HI. His talents were quickly realized, and he was selected to become the aide-de-camp to the commander-in-chief of U.C. Pacific Command at Camp H.M. Smith, HI, and then the Air Force aide to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Pentagon, Washington, DC, positions for which only the elite are selected. Following his assignment at the Pentagon, he was once again stationed at Kadena, where he flourished at every position he held: assistant operations officer of the 44th Tactical Fighter Squadron, chief of standardization and evaluation, operations officer of the 67th Tactical Fighter Squadron, and commander of the 44th Fighter Squadron. Having demonstrated his impeccable leadership, he was selected to be the chief of the Operations Inspection Division at Headquarters Pacific Air Forces at Hickam Air Force Base, HI, and then he deployed to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, as the chief of Air Force Division, U.S. Central Command Forward, from 1992 to 1994.  In 1994, Colonel Chandler was selected for back-to-back-to-back commands, commanding the 554th Support Group at Nellis Air Force Base, NV, the 33rd Fighter Wing at Eglin Air Force Base, FL, and the 56th Fighter Wing at Luke Air Force Base, AZ. Now, Brigadier General Chandler was selected to become the chief of headquarters staff followed by assistant chief of staff for operations, A-3 Division, of Headquarters Allied Air Forces Southern Europe, Naples, Italy. After being promoted, Major General Chandler returned to Washington, DC to become the director for expeditionary aerospace force implementation, followed by the director of operational plans, deputy chief of staff for air and space operations. Moving from the Pentagon to Langley Air Force Base, VA, he became the director of aerospace operations. General Chandler continued to demonstrate excellence and was selected for promotion to lieutenant general and selected to command Alaskan Command, Alaskan North American Aerospace Defense Command Region, 11th Air Force and Joint Task Force, Elmendorf Air Force Base, AK. Following this assignment, he returned to Washington, DC, to lead as the deputy chief of staff for operations, plans and requirements, Headquarters U.S. Air Force. general Chandler was selected for the rank of general and asked to return once again to the Pacific theater to command the Pacific Air Forces at Hickam Air Force Base, HI. Finally, he was selected to become the second highest ranking officer in the Air Force as the Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force, where he has served for over a year.  Under General Chandler's leadership, the Air Force handled some of our most challenging issues, including the $40 billion KC-X acquisition program, creation of Air Force Cyber Command, force structure realignment, and creation of Air Force Global Strike Command. Finally, General Chandler led the drive for what I consider the Air Force's most pressing issue: recapitalization. Through General Chandler's leadership, the Air Force secured a budget of $1.7 billion for bomber and air-to-ground weapons, acquired $8.2 billion for fighter and munitions programs, and laid the foundation for $200 million in supplemental munitions funding. The leadership, insight, and dedication of General Chandler have been instrumental in building lasting and trusting relationships with the U.S. Congress, resulting in an overall increase in U.S. national security.  The breadth and depth of General Chandler's assignments and the professionalism with which he has carried them out reflect a keen intellect, an unwavering dedication to the Air Force mission, and an unrivaled grasp of national security policies developed through both personal experience and academic instruction. General Chandler earned a master's degree in management, attended the Executive Program for General Officers at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, and the Navy Senior Leader Business Course at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. While he has received many distinguished awards and decorations, it is General Chandler's commitment and sacrifice to this Nation that make him stand out among his peers.  I have the utmost trust in and respect for General Chandler, gained over the past several years through our personal interaction during numerous meetings and hearings, including the annual Altus Quail Breakfast and meetings of the U.S. Air Force Academy's board of visitors, which I have been honored to attend. I will miss his honesty and frankness, a trait that has served him, the Air Force, and this Nation well during his time as a senior Air Force leader.  On behalf of Congress and the United States of America, I thank General Chandler, his wife Eva-Marie, and their three children, Carl, Rose-Marie, and Thomas, for their commitment, sacrifice, and contribution to this great Nation. I congratulate General Chandler on the completion of an exemplary Active-Duty career and wish him and his family Godspeed in the next phase of his life.                          ____________________
