 President, this has been another important week here in the Senate. We are moving forward on multiple aspects of the President's agenda.  Later today, the Senate Finance Committee will release its plan for tax reform. I will have more to say on this in a moment, but I would once again like to commend Chairman Hatch for his leadership to get us to this point.
