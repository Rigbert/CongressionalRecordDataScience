 If we want people to share the burden, we have to be willing to have people share the responsibility. Why does the administration propose--by the way, we have every right to look at the details of this $87 billion.  Why does this administration propose to spend $33,000 apiece for pickup trucks when you can get a brand new pickup in the U.S. for $14,000? Our Iraqi friends deserve AC--but not leather seats and a CD changer.  Why does the administration propose to spend $10,000 per student for a month-long business course--more than double the monthly cost of the Harvard Business School?  Why does it propose to spend $50,000 per prison bed, which is double the average cost of a U.S. prison bed?  The bottom line is we have an obligation to closely scrutinize the President's request, to ensure that taxpayers' dollars are spent wisely and, most importantly, that this administration has changed its course because literally the future of our children is at stake if they don't get it right.  I thank my colleagues and I yield the floor.
