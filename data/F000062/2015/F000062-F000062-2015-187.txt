 President, I rise on behalf of myself and Senator Boxer to introduce legislation to further the restoration of the San Francisco Bay.  San Francisco Bay is truly a national treasure. Encompassing approximately 550 square miles, it is the largest estuary on the west coast, and is vital to the Nation for both ecological and economic reasons. It is home to more than 1,000 plant and wildlife species, roughly 77 percent of California's remaining perennial estuarine wetlands, and an important stopover for birds along the Pacific Flyway. Marshes around the bay help prevent flooding, protecting more than 40 cities in nine counties, one of the Nation's busiest seaports, and two international airports. The bay is critical to the region's economy, which if it were its own nation, would be the world's 19th largest economy.  Over the last 150 years, the water quality and health of the San Francisco Bay Estuary have been diminished by pollution, invasive species, loss of wetland habitat and other factors. The degradation has not only impacted fish and wildlife, but has also reduced the estuary's ability to support important economic activities such as commercial and sport fishing, shipping, agriculture, recreation, and tourism.  Federal funding in recent years has started the Bay's recovery process by investing in projects that improve water quality and restore critical habitat. These investments, $43 million between 2008 and 2015, were critical to leveraging $145 million from other partners. But much work remains.  That is why I am pleased to introduce the San Francisco Bay Restoration Act with Senator Boxer, Ranking Member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. Companion legislation has also been introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives by Congresswoman Jackie Speier.  This bill was first introduced in the 112th Congress. The Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works reported favorably on the bill in both the 112th and 113th Congresses and recommended its passage.  This bill recognizes the important restoration work that must be done to restore and protect the iconic San Francisco Bay. It authorizes $5 million a year for restoration work between 2015 and 2019, prioritizing funding for projects that will protect and restore vital estuarine habitat for migratory waterfowl, shorebirds, and wildlife; improve and restore water quality and rearing habitat for fish; and in turn reinvigorate recreation, tourism, and agricultural activities in and around the bay.  I urge my colleagues to join me in their support for this measure.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 596       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``San Francisco Bay      Restoration Act''.     SEC. 2. SAN FRANCISCO BAY RESTORATION GRANT PROGRAM.
