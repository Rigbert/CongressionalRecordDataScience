Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, this bill does have strong bipartisan support in both the House and the Senate. And shortly, we will hear from the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden), my colleague. He and I are the original cosponsors of this legislation in the House.  H.R. 1444 would set up a fish screen construction program for irrigation projects in Idaho, Washington, Montana, Oregon, and California.  This is a bill that is good news for salmon, other fish species which are on the verge of being endangered or threatened, and good news for local economies, for farmers, and good news for the Federal taxpayers.  It requires a local match share of 35 percent. But with the Federal Government investing these funds in the fish screens, ultimately we may avoid the endangerment of numerous species of fish and help promote the recovery of salmon. Today, many of these irrigation diversions are unscreened and salmon smolts do not do too well when they are pulled out of the main stem of the Columbia or one of its tributaries and deposited into an irrigation ditch or an irrigation project which does not return directly to the river or the tributary.  Mr. Speaker, this simple step will prevent that in the future. We should be screening all the diversions on fish-bearing rivers in the Northwest and into California because we are investing hundreds of millions, ultimately billions of dollars elsewhere to help recover these species. But for the lack of a few dollars being spent at each of these diversions on both Federal lands and private lands, many of those dollars are not being spent as effectively as they could.  So, this legislation is a win/win for both the fish and the farmers and the taxpayers, and I recommend it to my colleagues.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
