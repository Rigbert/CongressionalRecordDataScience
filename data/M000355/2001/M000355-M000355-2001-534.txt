m. today be equally divided for debate only between the chairman and ranking member. I further ask unanimous consent that at 3:15 today I be recognized to offer an amendment.  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, reserving the right to object--I will not object--that would not in any way preclude Members from coming down for opening statements. We want to make sure everyone can make their opening statements. I know there are a lot of Members who would like to make opening statements on the bill.  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I believe that is what the time is for. I concur with the Senator from Arizona.  Mr. McCAIN. There may be more than 2 hours, and Members may come down afterwards since some Members are coming back late this afternoon. I would like to make that clear.
