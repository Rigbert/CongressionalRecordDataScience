 President, we often talk about how best to encourage the talents of our young citizens. In my home town of Wilmington, DE, there is a school that fulfills that mission literally, and with great success--the Cab Calloway School of the Arts, which will celebrate its 10th anniversary at a ceremony on Friday, November 22, 2002.  Cab Calloway students have performed in prestigious venues from New York City to Washington, DC. Our colleague, Senator Clinton, has been in their audience, as have Secretary of State Powell and members of the National Governors Association. They have earned recognition in the National Shakespeare Competition, the Delaware Theatre Company's Young Playwright's Festival, and various vocal and band competitions.  In the visual arts, Cab Calloway students have won repeatedly in Delaware's Youth in Art Month Flag Competition, and their work has been included in the Delaware Foundation for the Visual Arts Calendar. When artists were invited to decorate downtown Wilmington with dinosaurs this past spring, a Cab Calloway student designed and made sculpture was in the display. Visual arts students have also worked with the March of Dimes to create educational materials, and they have been honored with Regional Scholastic Art Awards.  That would be impressive as the whole story, but it is just one chapter. Cab Calloway students have excelled academically, earning as many honors for their work in the classroom as for their talents on the stage or in the studio. The school has been recognized for its innovative programs, and it proudly boasts the best attendance record among all secondary schools in the district.  For a decade, Cab Calloway has given many of our State's most talented young citizens a chance to excel as student-artists. It is a true success story in public education, and we in Delaware are very proud to congratulate the administration, faculty, students and their families, as we all join to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Cab Calloway School of the Arts.                          ____________________
