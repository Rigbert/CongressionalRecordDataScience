Speaker, I really appreciate very much appreciate the gentleman yielding just for a question.  It is my understanding that the Community Adjustment and Investment Fund, CAF, which is within NADBank, is basically zeroed out in this proposal, which means that it will have no money. And this is the portion of the bank that deals with loans and grants to the nonborder regions.  Could someone please clarify for me whether my understanding is correct? And I thank the gentleman for yielding.
