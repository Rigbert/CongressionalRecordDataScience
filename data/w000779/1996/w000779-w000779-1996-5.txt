President, passage of a Coast Guard reauthorization bill is a matter of vital importance to Oregon, particularly to smaller communities on the Oregon coast. A strong Coast Guard presence is essential to safeguard the lives of fishermen, recreational boaters, and all others who venture out into the frigid Northwest waters.  Because of the cold temperature of Pacific Northwest waters, a delay in Coast Guard response time by even a few minutes could mean a matter of life and death to capsized boaters. For that reason, I worked with a bipartisan group of coastal State Senators to ensure Coast Guard stations would not be closed unless there are strong safeguards in place to ensure maritime safety will not be diminished.  Specifically, under section 309 of the conference report, the Secretary of Transportation is prohibited from closing any Coast Guard multimission small boat station unless the Secretary determines that closure of a station will not diminish maritime safety in the area of the station, taking into account water temperature and other local conditions.  This section also provides an opportunity for affected communities to have a voice in any decision on a proposed station closure. The Secretary must provide an opportunity for public comment and hold public meetings before closing any small boat station.  The Coast Guard stations in Oregon covered by section 309 are: Coos Bay, Depoe Bay, Siuslaw River, Tillamook Bay, Chetco River, Yaquina Bay, and Umpqua River.  Section 309 also contains a provision I authored to ensure that all small boat stations will have available at least one vessel capable of performing ocean rescues. This provision was included to address a situation that arose last summer when the Rogue River Sardet station near Gold Beach was assigned a 20-foot vessel that was useless for performing ocean rescues. Under my provision, all small boat stations, including seasonally operated facilities like the Rogue River Sardet, will be guaranteed to have at least one vessel capable of performing ocean rescues.  By including these provisions in the conference report, we are giving the Coast Guard the tools needed to protect our citizens' lives and enhancing safety in the waters off Oregon's coast.                          ____________________
