Speaker, reclaiming my time, I appreciate the leader's observation. It is my understanding that the Senate, certainly on the minority side, will agree to go to conference as soon as we are given a number as to what we are going to conference. My understanding is, however, that the gentleman's side of the aisle cannot agree with the White House on what that number ought to be. So in fairness, there seems to be a disagreement on the number that the President will sign, and, I think accurately, that is the reason for the hold-up because I think, frankly, the Senate could agree to the 318 and I would hope we can agree to the 318. I would be for a higher number personally, but I would hope that we could agree to that. The problem is, I understand, the executive does not.  But I would suggest to the leader, with all due respect, that this body can and should act independently and send the legislation that it deems to be appropriate and if the executive disagrees, he has the option of vetoing that bill and sending it back to the House. As one of the Senators on the gentleman's side of the aisle observed, that is the way the process is supposed to work. And I would think, because we share the view that this is very important, we believe it is a jobs bill, that we could pass a bill relatively easily with overwhelming votes and certainly votes significant enough to show the President that at least two-thirds of the Members of this body and the other body believe it is an appropriate bill to pass forthwith.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield?
