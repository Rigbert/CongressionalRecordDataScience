 Dorr escaped prosecution because of the statute of limitations. That is to assume guilt. There were not charges filed, and I think it is wrong for us to assume anybody is guilty, under our system of law that a person is innocent until proven guilty.  I wish to go to some records from people who live within no more than 25 miles of this operation and explain what authorities for the U.S. Department of Agriculture had to say about this, and I will enter these two letters in the Record. One is January 8, 1997, from Michael Houston, county executive director of the Farm Service Administration. It says:       The Cherokee County Committee met on December 19, 1996, and      determined that M.G. Dorr Irrevocable Trust had a shares      violation for the years 1993, 1994 and 1995; that is the      Trust's total contributions to the farming operation were not      commensurate with the claimed shares for the crop years 1993,      1994 and 1995.       The County Committee [meaning the county committee of the      Farm Service Agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture]      determined a refund will be required but there was no      criminal intent.  Then, on February 4, 2002, we have this letter signed by the same Michael Houston. It is entitled ``End of Year Review, 1994-1995.''       The Cherokee County Committee reviewed the End of Year      Review, in particular the worksheet number 9.5, pages 1 and      2--attached. The County Committee determined that there was      no evidence of receiving benefits indirectly or directly that      would exceed the maximum payment limitations. The County      Committee also agrees that there was no evidence that the      Dorr's Pine Grove Farm nor Tom Dorr participated in a scheme      or device to evade the maximum payment limitations      regulations.       The End of Year Review for the year 2000 concluded that the      Dorr's Pine Grove Farms had no deficiencies.  I ask unanimous consent to have those printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                   U.S. Department of Agriculture,                                          Farm Service Agency,                                    Cherokee, IA, January 8, 1997.     Paul R. Dorr,     Ocheyedan, IA.       Dear Sir: The Cherokee County Committee met on December 19,      1996 and determined that M. G. Dorr Irrevocable Trust had a      shares violation for the years 1993, 1994 and 1995; that is      the Trust's total contributions to the farming operation were      not commensurate with the claimed shares for the crop years      1993, 1994, and 1995.       The County Committee determined a refund will be required      but there was no criminal intent.           Sincerely.                                               Michael W. Houston,     County Executive Director.                                  ____                                                 February 4, 2002.     Dorr's Pine Grove Farms,     Marcus, IA.       Dear Mr. Dorr: The Cherokee County Committee reviewed the      End of Year Review, in particular the worksheet #9 5 pages 1      & 2 (attached). The County Committee determined that there      was no evidence of receiving benefits indirectly or directly      that would exceed the maximum payment limitation. The County      Committee also agrees there was no evidence that Dorr's Pine      Grove Farm nor Tom Dorr participated in a scheme or device to      evade the maximum payment limitation regulations.       The End of Year Review for the year 2000 concluded that the      Dorr's Pine Grove Farms had no deficiencies.       Any questions please call (712) 225-5717. Thank you.           Sincerely,                                               Michael W. Houston,                                        County Executive Director,                                       Cherokee County FSA Office.
