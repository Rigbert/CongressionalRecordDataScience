Speaker, I rise in support of passing meaningful and essential health care reform today.  The conference agreement on H.R. 3103 is a positive first step to expanding access to health insurance for Rhode Islanders andAmericans across the nation. This legislation prohibits insurance companies from dropping coverage when an individual changes jobs or denying coverage because of a pre-existing condition. In addition, this bill increases the tax deduction for the self-employed from 30 percent to 80 percent by 2006.  Enactment of this common-sense health reform legislation has been delayed several months due to the insistence by the Republican Majority to attach many controversial provisions, including Medical Savings Accounts (MSA's), to the bill. The conference agreement contains a compromise that would make MSA's available to a limited population for four years. While I am concerned about the potential impact of this provision on our health care system, I am pleased that Congress must pass new legislation to continue or expand this MSA demonstration project.  I am also disappointed that the conference agreement does not contain the Domenici-Wellstone amendment adopted during Senate consideration of this legislation. This amendment would have required insurers and health plans to provide coverage for mental illness equal to that provided for physical health conditions. It is my hope that future Congresses will address this essential issue.  The steps to correct our health care system in H.R. 3103 is minimal, but needed reform which will alleviate the anxiety and suffering of many hard working families. However, more needs to be done to make health coverage affordable and available to more Americans. I remain committed to enacting comprehensive, systemic health care reforms in order to slow cost increases in health care services and ensure that all Americans have access to the quality health care they need.
