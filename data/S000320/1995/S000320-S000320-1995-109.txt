 President, I would like to commend Chairman D'Amato, Senators Domenici, Dodd, and Gramm for their hard work in trying to forge a consensus behind reforming our securities litigation system to weed out abuses and eliminate frivolous suits.  I am concerned and disappointed, however, that the bill before the Senate will do more to impair the rights of the small investor than it will to place checks on abusive conduct and frivolous litigation. For this reason, I continue to oppose S. 240.  Earlier this spring, Senator Bryan and I introduced a bill aimed at striking a balance between preserving the rights of the small investor and eliminating incentives for frivolous and abusive litigation.  Senate bill 667 incorporated many of the widely supported provisions incorporated in the bill before us like prohibiting referral fees, and the payment of attorney fees from the SEC disgorgement fund, increasing fraud detection and enforcement, and ensuring adequate disclosure of settlement terms.  In addition, our bill addressed many of the concerns that Chairman Levitt and the SEC have raised against S. 240 regarding pleading requirements, liability standards, and statute of limitations issues.  While the bill before us responds to some of these concerns--it still fails to ensure adequate protection of the rights of the innocent victim of securities fraud and effectively leaves the little guy who seeks redress for professional wrongdoing out in the cold.  On several key issues, S. 240 fails to preserve the important role that legitimate private securities litigation plays in checking abusive conduct and, in fact, makes it more difficult for the small investor to gain access to the courts and obtain full recovery for securities fraud.  I believe that individual investors, particularly small shareholders, must be assured a full recovery against professional wrongdoers if we are to maintain integrity in our securities markets.  Like Chairman Levitt and many other colleagues, I believe the bill can still be improved.  I, therefore, intend to offer a couple of amendments that I believe will help assure that meritorious claims are not inhibited in our effort to prevent frivolous and abusive ones.  Mr. President, S. 240 makes important reforms, many of which I support. Sadly, however, the bill would come at too great a cost to the small individual shareholder.  I urge my colleagues to oppose S. 240 as currently drafted and supportamendments to reinstate important investor protections against securities fraud.                           Amendment No. 1468 (Purpose: To amend the proportionate liability provisions of the bill)
