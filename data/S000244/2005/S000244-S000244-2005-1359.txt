Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, Federal courts have always reviewed whether or not a person's Federal constitutional or legal rights have been violated, and that is all this bill does. It gives a Federal Court the opportunity to review the Federal questions that are presented here.  Now, if we accepted the position that has been made by the opponents of this legislation, we would not have had a civil rights revolution in this country if rural courts in the South decided Federal questions that were opposed by those who were petitioning to have their civil rights protected. That required Federal judicial action. And this country is better because of that Federal judicial action. That is all that is being proposed here today, and that is why the bill ought to pass.  Now, secondly, I would like to correct some of the representations my colleague from Florida has made. Terri Schiavo is not on life support. She is not on a ventilator. She is not on any kind of artificial heart pump. All she has is a feeding tube, or had a feeding tube until it was removed 2 days ago, and that is not life support. That is simply requiring somebody to have the nutrition and the hydration they need as a living human being.  To starve someone to death or to have them die of dehydration slowly is one of the most cruel and inhumane ways to die, and what this bill does is it requires the reinsertion of the feeding tube for so long as it takes for a Federal Court to determine whether or not her Federal constitutional or statutory rights are violated. And that is reasonable, because she should not be allowed to die while the courts are determining what her legal rights are and whether anybody has violated them.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King).
