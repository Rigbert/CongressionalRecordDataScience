 Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of Virginia Cochran, known to generations of Vermont children as Ginny, who died last week at the age of 74.  In 1961 Ginny Cochran and husband, Mickey, created a ski slope in their backyard and opened it as Cochran's Ski Area. In its early years it was a training course for all four Cochran children, Marilyn, Bobby, Barbara Ann, and Lindy. As everyone in Vermont knows, all four proceeded to compete and win in the Olympics and on the World Cup, FIS, and U.S. national circuits.  While Mickey groomed, maintained and expanded the course, Ginny began an after-school skiing program, which taught generations of Vermont schoolchildren, and countless other families to ski. The 10,000 children who learned to ski at Cochran's all remember with deep fondness the kind, energetic, and passionate woman who taught them.  Ginny's method of teaching was revolutionary. She taught parents to teach their own children to ski. Of course, for every child who was frightened of going down the small instructional hill, for every child who needed help in learning to go up the Mighty Mite ski lift, Ginny was there with advice and support. She encouraged children to extend themselves, to compete not so much against others as with themselves, and to be more than they thought they could be. Every week of the ski season saw Lollipop races at Cochran's, where skiers as young as four and five years of age would compete against Olympic gold medalist Barbara Ann and her mother, Ginny, and World Cup winners Bobby and Marilyn and Lindy.  Today it is no surprise that skiers who learned to ski at Cochran's compete on the U.S. national team, including Ginny's grandson Jimmy, the U.S. National slalom and GS champion, and her granddaughter Jessica, with both silver and bronze in the National championships, have won collegiate championships, like grandson Roger Brown, slalom, and ski for major college ski teams such as Dartmouth, Middlebury and UVM.  More important than such successes, however, are the generations of young people who learned that hard work brings many rewards, including loving what you work at and a maturity which has been shaped by self-discipline as well as joy. Ginny Cochran and her husband, Mickey, knew the importance of combining hard work with pleasure, and taught it to their children and many others. Over the course of decades, with great commitment, Ginny not only taught children to ski, but to take their lives as seriously as she taught them to take skiing. It is a tribute to her as role model that her children, Barbara Ann and Lindy at Cochran's, and Marilyn at Hanover, NH, High School and the Quechee Ski Club, continue the legacy of their mother in teaching young people to ski, and through the lessons learned in skiing, they will reach a rich and fulfilling adulthood. Today, many of her former students are coaches and teachers of skiing.  I know that Cochran's Ski Area, with its Mighty Mite lift and its fast but clearly anachronistic rope tow, will never compete in vertical feet with our State's large ski areas. But Ginny Cochran's work in hewing a ski area out of a forested mountainside in Richmond, Vermont, is not an anachronism: Through the work and commitment and vision she put into it, it remains one of our great Vermont institutions. More importantly, the lives she touched and shaped are part of her enduring legacy to the State of Vermont.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Page E309]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]              ONE OF THE GREAT FIGURES IN AMERICAN SKIING                                 ______                                                           HON.
