The first time was right after 9/11; the last time was a couple of weeks ago.  One of the interesting things is, if you talk to anyone who has been there and served there, you find this is above the standards of any of our Federal prisons. At the current time, the population down there is 245, of which 170 cannot be repatriated; their countries would not take them back.  Out of the 170, 110 are the real hardened ones. When the Senator from Utah talks about they would put them in 15 prisons, they identified my State of Oklahoma, Forest Hill. I went there to see the facility only to find it would not work. But the sergeant major in charge of that facility served a year at Guantanamo Bay and said that of all the prisons she has been in, or worked in, that is the one that has the most humane treatment and is best suited for this kind of detainee. I agree with the Senator and ask if he has given thought as to where these 15 prisons are as alternatives and would they not become magnets for terrorist activity in the United States?
