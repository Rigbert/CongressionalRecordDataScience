BOXER. The Republican side has objected to an agreement reached by myself and Senator Inhofe and I believe the two leaders that would say we are going to replenish the highway trust fund, we are going to repeal the rescission that was done and as a result the States will be shorted $300 million, and it is my understanding that starting tomorrow morning a lot of these contracts will be canceled or delayed unless we fix this. We could fix it at a later date, but every day that goes by, it makes it more difficult because we are operating under a midnight deadline tonight.
