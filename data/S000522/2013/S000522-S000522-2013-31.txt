I thank my good friend and colleague Mrs. Hartzler for her very eloquent statement, for her championing the rights of the unborn and their mothers, and for joining us in this Special Order today.  I'd like to now yield to a medical doctor who has been the leader on conscience rights in the House of Representatives, in the Congress, Dr. Fleming.
