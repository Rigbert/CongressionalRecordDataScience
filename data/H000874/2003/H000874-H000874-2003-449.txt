Leader, the reason I was looking to staff, obviously, as the gentleman well knows, if we are not going to go in until 6:30 and we will probably do suspension bills that night, clearly, if we go to conference, a motion to instruct would be in order; and I think it would be our intention to offer such a motion.  Therefore, having notice at this juncture, or I understand the gentleman's not having specific knowledge of when the papers are going to come over, but I might say to the gentleman that if we can have some specificity, and apparently Tuesday we will have the papers, the gentleman is reasonably confident, perhaps we could agree that it would be then Tuesday so that on our side we could plan to have the motion to which we would be entitled ready and available at that time.                              {time}  1400  Mr. DeLAY. I thank the gentleman for his comment, Mr. Speaker. We want to make sure that the minority protects their rights and reserves their rights to proceed to a motion to instruct.  My assumption is that we will have what we need to go to conference on the floor of this House no later than Tuesday, and we have every anticipation that we will be going to conference on Tuesday, but we would like to go a day earlier. As the gentleman knows, there is a lot of legislation we would like to do in the next 2 weeks, and floor time is at a premium.
