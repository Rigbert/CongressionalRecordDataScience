Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  We come to the end of a long and somewhat torturous time in this House. I congratulate the majority for coming to its conclusion. I think it is an appropriate and correct conclusion.  I regret the rhetoric that is included in the preamble to that conclusion. I think it is erroneous. I disagree with it. For that reason, Mr. Speaker, at the appropriate time I will make, as I said earlier, a motion to recommit with instructions. That motion to recommit will simply provide for the passage of the dismissal of the complainant's contest. That is what we ought to do. That is what facts show. It is time that we do so.  Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson-Lee).  (Ms. Jackson-Lee of Texas asked and was given permission to revise and extend her remarks.)
