President, before I address the issue of Miguel Estrada, as a matter of personal privilege, I note I missed three rollcall votes last night on the three judicial nominees. I would have voted in the affirmative on all three nominees. The reason for my absence has to do with the fact--and I am holding two boarding passes--I boarded a plane in Chicago to come to Washington and we were grounded because of mechanical difficulties. Because of the delay in that flight, it was impossible for me to make the rollcall votes. As I said earlier, I would have voted affirmatively on all three of President Bush's nominees who came before the Senate last night.
