President, pursuant to the unanimous consent request, I wish to speak to a resolution which was just passed, but prior to that time, I would like to commend my colleague from the State of Wisconsin for his dogged determination to have the Senate actually consider an amendment--a substantive amendment--to the PATRIOT Act. He has been more than cooperative in suggesting he would limit the time of that debate to 15 minutes, but he has been stopped every time he has come to the floor and made that request by the majority.  I may disagree with the Senator from Wisconsin, but I am going to stand here and fight for as long as I can that he have this opportunity. Why is the Senate afraid of debate? Why is the Senate afraid of deliberation? What is so frightening about having two Senators present a point of view and then have the Senate vote? It almost sounds like the reason the Senate was created, but the Senator from Wisconsin has been waiting, trying his best to get 15 minutes, day after day, as the majority refuses to give it to him.  As I have said repeatedly, I think there is merit to this PATRIOT Act, as amended with Senator Sununu's efforts and the efforts of many, including myself, but I am going to defend the right of the Senator from Wisconsin to come to the floor any time he wants, as a Senator representing his State and as a coequal Member of this Chamber, and offer an amendment. The majority should not be so frightened of debate, not so frightened of a vote that they would deny the Senator this opportunity.                          ____________________
