 President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 9:30 a.m. on Thursday, October 20. I further ask that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved, and the Senate then resume consideration of H.R. 3058, the Transportation-Treasury appropriations bill.
