President, I rise today to express my congratulations and best wishes to Virginia Davis Gill, Ph.D., on the occasion of her 90th birthday.  Born on July 17, 1913, Dr. Gill has dedicated her life to public service. Her career as a social worker, a school teacher, and a health administrator spanned over seven decades, reflecting Dr. Gill's commitment to serving her community. Indeed, Dr. Gill did not retire until she was 75 years of age.  Throughout her career, Dr. Gill's leadership included active involvement in the American Red Cross and serving as a national board member of United Cerebral Palsy. Following her retirement, Dr. Gill was selected to attend the 1995 White House Conference on Aging.  Dr. Gill lives in my home State of Maine, but she is loved here in Washington, DC, as well. Our own Attending Physician of the Capitol, the distinguished Dr. John Eisold, is presenting an American flag to his longtime friend to honor her birthday.  Together with Dr. Gill's brother, Mr. Wadsworth Davis, and her son, Mr.Walter Gill, I join in saluting the life of this remarkable woman and in wishing her the happiest of birthdays.                          ____________________
