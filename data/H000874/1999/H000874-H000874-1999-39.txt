Chairman, I thank the distinguished gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cardin) for yielding me this time.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in very strong support of this piece of legislation. On Monday, I met with a constituent of mine, Sharyl Asbra of Waldorf, Maryland. She went to the hospital in June complaining of severe abdominal pains. After diagnosing her condition, the doctors recommended she have a hysterectomy, but her insurance company denied the procedure. After weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks of pain, only after Dr. Scott Kelso repeatedly called the insurer on Sharyl's behalf did the insurer relent and let Sharyl get the necessary treatment. This was after she had to be off work, could not care for her children, her mother had to do so, and after she experienced a long period of pain.  This bill is about real people who have a real problem. It is about people who need medical care, as determined by their doctors and by themselves. It is about ensuring that they have access to the medical care that they need, and that that decision will be made by doctors who are trained to make those decisions and who have sworn an oath of personal responsibility to those patients to ensure that they get the kind of quality health care that is available in this country if it will be paid for.  I rise in strong support of this bipartisan bill to help Sharyl and millions and millions of others like her in America.
