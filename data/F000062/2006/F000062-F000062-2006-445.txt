 President, I'm pleased to introduce this bill today to help California drinking water providers address the growing problem of perchlorate contamination.  The California Perchlorate Contamination Remediation Act authorizes funds for perchlorate remediation of contaminated water sources.  The bill provides: $50 million in grants for cleanup and remediation of perchlorate in water sources, including groundwater wells; and $8 million for research and development of new, cheaper, and more efficient perchlorate cleanup technologies.  The bill also expresses the sense of Congress that the Environmental Protection Agency should promulgate a national drinking water standard for perchlorate as soon as practicable.  The Defense Department and NASA use perchlorate in rocket fuel, missiles, and at least 300 types of munitions.  The Defense Department has used perchlorate since the 1950s. Perchlorate has a short shelf-life, and must be periodically replaced in the country's rocket and missile inventories.  Perchlorate readily permeates through soil and can spread quickly from its source. Over the last half century, improper disposal has allowed perchlorate to seep into surface and groundwater supplies.  Perchlorate contamination of drinking and irrigation water is a serious threat to public health.  Perchlorate interferes with the uptake of iodide into the thyroid gland. Since iodide helps regulate thyroid hormone production, perchlorate disrupts normal thyroid function. In adults, the thyroid helps regulate metabolism.  Infants and children are especially susceptible to the effects of perchlorate because the thyroid plays a critical role in proper development. Even unborn babies can be affected by perchlorate. Insufficient thyroid hormone production can severely retard a child's physical and mental development.  Perchlorate first appeared in drinking water wells in Rancho Cordova, CA in 1964. In 1985, the Environmental Protection Agency discovered perchlorate in several wells in the San Gabriel Valley in Southern California.  By 1997, it was detected in 4 counties in California and in the Colorado River, and by 1999 perchlorate was discovered in the water supplies of 12 States.  According to the California Department of Health Services at least 350 water sources in California, operated by 84 different local water agencies, now have perchlorate contamination.  But perchlorate is not just a California problem. A study by Government Accountability Office found perchlorate in the water supplies of 35 States.  The scope and magnitude of the perchlorate problem is still being defined and we are only beginning to discover the extent to which perchlorate has penetrated the food supply.  Recent sampling by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found perchlorate in people living in States without contaminated drinking water. This suggests people all over the country are exposed to at least trace levels of perchlorate.  In November 2004, the Food and Drug Administration released the results of its recent evaluation of perchlorate in the Nation's food. The FDA detected perchlorate in 90 percent of the lettuce samples taken from 5 different States, including California.  The FDA also found perchlorate in 101 out of 104 milk samples taken from retail stores around the country. Samples labeled as organic also contained perchlorate.  Last February, a study by researchers from Texas Tech University found perchlorate in all 36 samples of breast milk they tested. The milk was collected from women in 18 States, including California.  With such widespread contamination in my State and across the country, I have serious concerns about the health and well-being of the most vulnerable among the population--infants, toddlers, pregnant women, and those with compromised immune systems.  Let me speak for a moment about the challenges our water agencies are facing. As the population grows, so do thedemands on our water supply. During times of drought, these demands are particularly challenging.  States and communities rely upon their local water supplies, but are increasingly finding that these supplies are contaminated with perchlorate and other pollutants.  When Federal agencies fail to protect adjacent water supplies from perchlorate contamination, the problem falls to local and regional water agencies to fix.  These agencies already face staggering challenges both in delivering drinking water and managing wastewater services. Compounding these challenges with cleanup responsibilities for Defense Department activities is unfair, unreasonable, and unacceptable.  Perchlorate contamination in California is primarily the result of releases from 12 defense sites and several government contractor sites.  I applaud those contractors that have taken an active role in the cleanup of perchlorate. Unfortunately, clean up has only begun at a handful of contaminated sites.  In many cities and counties around California, wells are being taken out of service because of perchlorate contamination. Sometimes cities and water agencies are forced to bring in water from other sources, often at a much higher price. Other times, they must install costly perchlorate removal equipment.  This bill will provide much needed funds to water agencies for perchlorate remediation projects.  Now that perchlorate has been detected in the water sources of 35 States, it has become a national problem requiring a national solution.  I've approached several of my colleagues with a proposal that would address perchlorate contamination on a national level. My hope is that those representing States facing this problem will work with me on this issue.  Today there is no Federal drinking water standard for perchlorate. In the absence of a Federal standard, States have acted independently to establish health-related guidance or regulatory limits for perchlorate in drinking water.  The result is that each State has adopted a different preliminary guideline for perchlorate.  Let me give you a few examples: California established a Public Health Goal of 6 parts per billion; Texas has a Drinking Water Action Level of 4 part per billion; Nevada has a Public Notice Standard of 18 parts per billion; New York has a Drinking Water Planning Level of 5 parts per billion; Arizona has a Health-Based Guideline of 14 parts per billion; and Massachusetts has an interim public health goal of 1 part per billion.  Each of these States has adopted a different kind of regulatory guideline for perchlorate sending a confusing message to the public about what level is safe. It also frustrates the water agencies that strive to provide safe drinking water to consumers.  Clearly, it is time for the Federal Government to establish a national standard for perchlorate.  This bill would assist California water providers in their efforts to remove perchlorate from contaminated drinking water sources by providing $50 million dollars for 50 percent federally matched grants.  To address the challenge of removing perchlorate from all of our water supplies, we must invest in costeffective and timely remediation solutions. To underwrite this effort, $8 million will be authorized for grants for research and development of new, cheaper, more efficient perchlorate cleanup technologies.  It is time for the EPA to fulfill its obligation to protect public health. This bill expresses the sense of Congress that the EPA should promulgate a national drinking water standard for perchlorate under the timeline of the Safe Drinking Water Act as soon as practicable.  Perchlorate contamination has placed an enormous financial burden on the water agencies who strive to provide high quality, safe drinking water to the citizens of California. Cleaning up contaminated water sources is equivalent to creating new water, a growing need in my state and throughout the West.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2298       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``California Perchlorate      Contamination Remediation Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--       (1) because finite water sources in the United States are      stretched by regional drought conditions and increasing      demand for water supplies, there is increased need for safe      and dependable supplies of fresh water for drinking and      agricultural purposes;       (2) perchlorate, a naturally occurring and manmade compound      with commercial and national defense applications, is used      primarily in military munitions and rocket fuels, and also in      fireworks, road flares, blasting agents, and automobile      airbags;       (3) perchlorate has been detected in fresh water sources      intended for drinking water and agricultural use in 35 States      and the District of Columbia;       (4)(A) perchlorate has been detected in the food supply of      the United States; and       (B) many fruits and vegetables, including lettuce, wheat,      tomato, cucumber, and cantaloupe, contain at least trace      levels of perchlorate, as do wine, whiskey, soy milk, dairy      milk, and human breast milk; and       (5) if ingested in sufficient concentration and for      adequate duration, perchlorate may interfere with thyroid      metabolism, the effects of which may impair normal      development of the brain in fetuses, newborns, and children.       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--       (1) to provide grants for remediation of perchlorate      contamination of water sources and supplies (including      wellheads) in the State;       (2) to provide grants for research and development of      perchlorate remediation technologies; and       (3) to express the sense of Congress that the Administrator      should establish a national drinking water standard for      perchlorate.
