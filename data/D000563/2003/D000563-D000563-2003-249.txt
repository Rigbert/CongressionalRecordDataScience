I never recommend them. Most State courts do not recognize the results, I don't think they are accurate. But it was a pressure tactic by the FBI to try to get Senators on the Intelligence Committee to say publicly whether they would submit to apolygraph. It is an indication of what they can do when they want to.  The question is, Will they do it? Would Attorney General Ashcroft's Department of Justice do that to the highest ranking officials in President Bush's White House? The answer is obvious. So I ask, does that not make the case for a special prosecutor?
