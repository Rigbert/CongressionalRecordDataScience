 President, after we confirm Chad Wolf to serve in a senior position at the Department of Homeland Security, the Senate will turn to President Trump's nominee to serve on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.  Steven Menashi's nomination continues an already distinguished career studying, teaching, and practicing law. After earning degrees from Dartmouth and Stanford, he clerked for Judge Douglas Ginsburg on the DC Court of Appeals and Justice Alito on the Supreme Court. Mr. Menashi has held a research fellowship at the New York University School of Law and taught at George Mason University's Antonin Scalia Law School.  Even the American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary, which has lately--lately made headlines for treating President Trump's nominees in a less-than-evenhanded way, has rated this nominee ``well-qualified.''  Obviously, a majority of our colleagues on the Judiciary Committee concurred, and now the entire Senate will have the opportunity to confirm yet another outstanding jurist to the Federal bench.  I urge each of my colleagues to join me in supporting Steven Menashi's nomination this week.                          ____________________
