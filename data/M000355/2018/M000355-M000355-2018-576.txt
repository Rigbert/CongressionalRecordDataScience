 President, I would like to take a moment to celebrate one of the great public educational resources in my home State of Kentucky. This month, we mark the 50th anniversary of Kentucky Educational Television, KET, which has provided a vital service to the Commonwealth. It is my privilege to take a look back at the distinguished history of this organization and its impact on Kentucky families.  When KET officially signed on the air in 1968 under the leadership of its founding director, University of Kentucky professor O. Leonard Press, it did so during school hours on the second largest land-based network in the world. Its first instructional program was ``Kentucky is My Land,'' which directly addressed KET's mission to deliver quality educational programming for all levels and to explore the beauty and heritage of the Commonwealth of Kentucky. That original goal has animated the remarkable educational and public affairs programming of this network for half a century.  During its first decade on the air, KET continued to expand and provide important services to its viewers, which included the debut of consequential Kentucky journalists such as Al Smith and KET's first nationally distributed instructional series, ``Universe & I.'' In addition, the network began its televised coverage of the proceedings of the Kentucky General Assembly, providing unprecedented access and public transparency to our State's legislature and a valuable civic education to our citizens.  As an affiliate of the Public Broadcasting Service, PBS, KET also brings nationally treasured programs into the homes of thousands of Kentuckians. Programs such as Julia Child's ``The French Chef,'' ``Masterpiece Theatre,'' and many of Ken Burns's historical documentary series have made an indelible impact on our country. As KET has grown, it has expanded its programming around the clock to provide educational opportunities to Kentuckians 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  Throughout the years, KET has also grown its public affairs content, delivering news of the day and critical information to viewers. Staffed with top-notch journalists and featuring interviews with well-known Kentuckians, these programs are an important part of the network's overall mission. Throughout my career, I have enjoyed both viewing and periodically joining these programs to discuss vital issues to the future of Kentucky.  Keeping faith with its educational goals, the network has developed important partnerships with educational institutions and universities in Kentucky. In fact, Morehead State University began offering KET distance learning courses for dual credit, and the KET Fast Forward program has excelled as a learning system for GED test preparation.  I commend KET's 50 years of award-winning service to my home State. It is my privilege to congratulate the network on its success, and I look forward to many more years of quality programming in our Commonwealth. I urge my Senate colleagues to join me in celebrating KET's exemplary work.                          ____________________
