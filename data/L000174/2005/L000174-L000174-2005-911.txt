President, I am disturbed that even though there are some Democrats who support Judge Gonzales, and some who oppose, I have heard some Senators on the other side of the aisle imply that those who oppose this nomination are biased against him based on his ethnic background. I resent that charge.  For somebody to say that those opposed are biased against Judge Gonzales because of his ethnicity is preposterous and deeply offensive.  We have stood here for 2 days explaining our positions. Many of us have said if we were voting on the story and on the achievements of Judge Gonzales, which are commendable, we would be voting for him. If we were voting on what he has overcome in his life and career, we would be voting for him. What we have said clearly, however, is that we are voting against him based upon his conduct as Counsel to the President. We have come to this decision based upon his record.  Let us talk about that record. Judge Gonzales has argued that the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment does not prohibit cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment with ``respect to aliens overseas.'' Reaching this conclusion requires such twisted reasoning that even those who support Judge Gonzales must part company with him on this point.  I am also disturbed by his interpretation of the Geneva Conventions. Judge Gonzales did not follow the advice he received from Secretary of State Powell, the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, or of the State Department lawyers. He did not stand up for the military and interpret our obligations consistent with the Army Field Manual and the decades of sound practice and counsel from the Judge Advocate General's Corps.  That is why I object to this nominee.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article describing Judge Gonzales's interrogation policies, written by Jeffrey Smith and Dan Eggen.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Washington Post, Jan. 5, 2005]    Gonzales Helped Set the Course for Detainees--Justice Nominee's            Hearings Likely To Focus on Interrogation Policies                  (By R. Jeffrey Smith and Dan Eggen)       In March 2002, U.S. elation at the capture of al Qaeda      operations chief Abu Zubaida was turning to frustration as he      refused to bend to CIA interrogation. But the agency's      officers, determined to wring more from Abu Zubaida through      threatening interrogations, worried about being charged with      violating domestic and international proscriptions on      torture.       They asked for a legal review--the first ever by the      government--of how much pain and suffering a U.S.      intelligence officer could inflict on a prisoner without      violating a 1994 law that imposes severe penalties, including      life imprisonment and execution, on convicted torturers. The      Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel took up the      task, and at least twice during the drafting, top      administration officials were briefed on the results.       White House counsel Alberto R. Gonzales chaired the      meetings on this issue, which included detailed descriptions      of interrogation techniques such as ``waterboarding,'' a      tactic intended to make detainees feel as if they are      drowning. He raised no objections and, without consulting      military and State Department experts in the laws of torture      and war, approved an August 2002 memo that gave CIA      interrogators the legal blessings they sought.       Gonzales, working closely with a small group of      conservative legal officials at the White House, the Justice      Department and the Defense Department--and overseeing      deliberations that generally excluded potential dissenters--     helped chart other legal paths in the handling and      imprisonment of suspected terrorists and the applicability of      international conventions to U.S. military and law      enforcement activities.       His former colleagues say that throughout this period,      Gonzales--a confidant of George W. Bush's from Texas and the      president's nominee to be the next attorney general--often      repeated a phrase used by Defense Secretary Donald H.      Rumsfeld to spur tougher antiterrorism policies: ``Are we      being forward-leaning enough?''       But one of the mysteries that surround Gonzales is the      extent to which these new legal approaches are his own      handiwork rather than the work of others, particularly Vice      President Cheney's influential legal counsel, David S.      Addington.       Gonzales's involvement in the crafting of the torture memo,      and his work on two presidential orders on detainee policy      that provoked controversy or judicial censure during Bush's      first term, is expected to take center stage at Senate      Judiciary Committee hearings tomorrow on Gonzales's      nomination to     become attorney general. The outlines of Gonzales's actions      are known, but new details emerged in interviews with      colleagues and other officials, some of whom spoke only on      the condition of anonymity because they were involved in      confidential government policy deliberations.       On at least two of the most controversial policies endorsed      by Gonzales, officials familiar with the events say the      impetus for action came from Addington--another reflection of      Cheney's outsize influence with the president and the rest of      the government. Addington, universally described as      outspokenly conservative, interviewed candidates for      appointment as Gonzales's deputy, spoke at Gonzales's morning      meetings and, in at least one instance, drafted an early      version of a legal memorandum circulated to other departments      in Gonzales's name, several sources said.       Conceding that such ghostwriting might seem irregular, even      though Gonzales was aware of it, one former White House      official said it was simply ``evidence of the closeness of      the relationship'' between the two men. But another official      familiar with the administration's legal policymaking, who      spoke on the condition of anonymity because such      deliberations are supposed to be confidential, said that      Gonzales often acquiesced in policymaking by others.       This might not be the best quality for an official      nominated to be attorney general, the nation's top law      enforcement job, the administration official said. He added      that he thinks Gonzales learned from mistakes during Bush's      first term.       Supporters of Gonzales depict him as a more pragmatic      successor to John D. Ashcroft, and a cautious lawyer who      carefully weighs competing points of view while pressing for      aggressive anti-terrorism efforts. His critics have expressed      alarm at what they regard as his record of excluding      dissenting points of view in the development of legal      policies that fail to hold up under broader scrutiny and give      short shrift to human rights.       His nomination has, in short, become another battleground      for the debate over whether the administration has acted      prudently to forestall another terrorist attack or      overreached by legally sanctioning rights abuses.       One thing is clear: Gonzales, 49, enjoys Bush's trust. He      has worked directly with the former Texas governor for more      than nine years, advising him on sensitive foreign policy and      defense matters that rarely--if ever--fell within the purview      of previous White House counsels.       For example, when the Justice Department formally      repudiated the legal reasoning of the August 2002      interrogation memo last week in another document that      Gonzales reviewed, it was overturning a policy with      consequences that Gonzales heard discussed in intimate      detail--to the point of learning what the physiological      reactions of detainees might be to the suffering the CIA      wanted to inflict, those involved in the deliberations said.       The White House said Gonzales and Addington, a former      Reagan aide and Pentagon counsel, were unavailable to be      interviewed for this article. But asked to comment on whether      Gonzales acquiesced too easily on legal policies pushed by      others, spokesman Brian Besanceney responded that Gonzales      had ``served with distinction and with the highest      professional standards as a lawyer'' in private practice,      state government and the White House, and he ``will      continue to do so as attorney general.''                            a success story       Bush has told people that he was attracted by Gonzales's      rags-to-riches life story. A Texas native and the son of      Mexican immigrants, Gonzales served for two years in the Air      Force before graduating from Rice University and Harvard Law      School. He met Bush during his 1994 gubernatorial campaign,      while Gonzales was a partner at the politically connected      Houston law firm Vinson & Elkins.       Upon election, Bush appointed him as his personal counsel,      later as Texas secretary of state and eventually as a justice      on the Texas Supreme Court. Within weeks of the 2000      presidential election, Bush tapped Gonzales to be his White      House counsel, and Gonzales set about creating what officials      there proudly described as one of the most ideologically      aligned counsel's offices in years.       Bringing only one associate to Washington from Texas,      Gonzales forged his staff instead from a tightknit group of      Washington-based former clerks to Supreme Court or appellate      judges, all of whom had worked on at least one of three      touchstones of the conservative movement: the Whitewater and      Monica S. Lewinsky inquiries of former president Bill      Clinton, the Bush-Cheney election campaign, and the Florida      vote-counting dispute.       ``It was an office of like-minded'' lawyers and ``strong      personalities,'' said Bradford A. Berenson, a criminal      defense lawyer appointed as one of eight associate counsels      in Gonzales's office. ``There was not a shrinking violet in      the bunch.''       ``Federalist Society regulars'' is the way another former      associate counsel, H. Christopher Bartolomucci, described the      Gonzales staff and its ideological allies elsewhere in the      government, such as Deputy Assistant Attorney General John      Yoo and Defense Department General Counsel William J. Haynes      II. All were adherents to the theory that the Constitution      gives the president considerably more authority than the      Congress and the judiciary.       One of the clearest examples of this ambition was      Gonzales's long-running and ultimately futile battle with the      independent commission that investigated the Sept. 11, 2001,      terrorist attacks. Gonzales's office, acting as the liaison      between the White House and the 10-member bipartisan panel,      repeatedly resisted commission demands for access to      presidential documents and officials such as national      security adviser Condoleezza Rice, prompting angry and public      disputes.       Gonzales is ``a good lawyer and a nice guy, and maybe he      was a decent judge for a year, but he didn't bring a lot of      political judgment or strategic judgment to their dealings      with the commission,'' a senior commission official said.      ``He hurt the White House politically by antagonizing the      commissioners . . . and all of it for no good reason. In      the end, the stuff all came out.''       Each morning, Gonzales convened round tables at which his      staff--as well as Addington--related their legal conundrums.      Gonzales was ``not a domineering personality . . . and he      gave us a chance to speak our minds,'' said Helgi C. Walker,      a former clerk for Clarence Thomas who was an associate      counsel from 2001 to 2003.       ``There was often a lively debate, but at the end it was      not clear where Gonzales was,'' another former colleague      said. A second former colleague recalls that in interagency      meetings, Gonzales sat in the back and was ``unassuming,      pleasant and quiet.'' So discreet was Gonzales about his      opinions that one official who worked closely with him for a      year said ``he never made an impression on me.''       But Berenson says Gonzales was hardly pushed around by      officials who thought they had a monopoly on wisdom. ``I      didn't have the sense that he was whipping his horses or that      they were dragging him along behind them,'' he said, adding      that Gonzales was ``neither the tool of an aggressive staff      nor the quarterback of a reluctant team.''       Current and former White House officials interviewed for      this article listed only a few episodes in which Gonzales      forcefully pressed a position at odds with ideological      conservatives. None was in the terrorism field.       Walker said she is aware of criticism that Gonzales      ``should have been saying `I believe this or that' '' about      some of the provocative issues presented to him. ``He did not      see his job as being about him'' but about advocating Bush's      interests, she explained. ``The judge is not consumed with      his own importance, unlike some others in Washington.''                            detainee policy       Unlike many of his predecessors since the Reagan era,      Gonzales lacked much experience in federal law and national      security matters. So when the Pentagon worried about how to      handle expected al Qaeda detainees in the days after the      Sept. 11 attacks and the Oct. 7 U.S. attack on Afghanistan,      Gonzales organized an interagency group to take up the matter      under the State Department's war crimes adviser, Pierre-     Richard Prosper.       Former attorney general William P. Barr suggested to      Gonzales's staff early on that those captured on the      battlefield go before military tribunals instead of civil      courts. But Ashcroft and Michael Chertoff, his deputy for the      criminal division, both adamantly opposed the plan, along      with military lawyers at the Pentagon. The result was that      the process moved slowly.       Addington was the first to suggest that the issue be taken      away from the Prosper group and that a presidential order be      drafted authorizing the tribunals that he, Gonzales and      Timothy E. Flanigan, then a principal deputy to Gonzales,      supported. It was intended for circulation among a much      smaller group of like-minded officials. Berenson, Flanigan      and Addington helped write the draft, and on Nov. 6, 2001,      Gonzales's office secured an opinion from the Justice      Department's Office of Legal Counsel that the contemplated      military tribunals would be legal.       That office, historically the government's principal      internal domestic law adviser, was also staffed by advocates      of expansive executive powers; it had told the White House in      a classified memo five weeks earlier that the president's      authority to wage preemptive war against suspected terrorists      was virtually unlimited, partly because proving criminal      responsibility for terrorist acts was so difficult.       After a final discussion with Cheney, Bush signed the order      authorizing military tribunals on Nov. 13, 2001, while      standing up, as he was on his way out of the White House to      his Texas ranch for a meeting with Russian President Vladimir      Putin. It provided for the military trial of anyone suspected      of belonging to al Qaeda or conspiring to conduct or assist      acts of terrorism; conviction would come from a two-thirds      vote of the tribunal members, who would adjudicate fact and      law and decide what evidence was admissible. Decisions could      not be appealed.       Cut out in the final decision making were military lawyers,      the State Department and Chertoff, as well as Rice, her      deputy, Stephen J. Hadley, and Rice's legal adviser, John      Bellinger. ``I don't think Gonzales felt he was acting      precipitously, but he realized people would be surprised,''      Flanigan said. It amounted to a decision that the president      could act without ``the entire staff's blessing. As it turned      out, they [National Security Council officials] just weren't      involved in the process.''       Berenson, who left the White House for private practice in      2003, said ``there were such     strong shared assumptions at the time [that] we had a      powerful sense of mission.'' He attributes the haste to worry      about another terrorist attack.       But David Bowker, then a State Department lawyer excluded      from the process and now in private practice, called the      order premature and politically unwise. ``The right thing to      do would have been an open process inside the government,''      he said.       The tribunals were halted by U.S. District Judge James      Robertson, who ruled on Nov. 24, 2004, that detainees' rights      are guaranteed by the Geneva Conventions--which the      administration had argued were irrelevant.                           Rebellion at State       Four weeks after Bush's executive order, a similarly      limited deliberation provoked more determined rebellion at      the State Department and among military lawyers and officers.      The issue was whether al Qaeda and Taliban fighters captured      on the battlefield in Afghanistan should be accorded the      Geneva Conventions' human rights protections.       Gonzales, after reviewing a legal brief from the Justice      Department's Office of Legal Counsel, advised Bush verbally      on Jan. 18, 2002, that he had authority to exempt      the detainees from such protections. Bush agreed,      reversing a decades-old policy aimed in part at ensuring      equal treatment for U.S. military detainees around the      world. Rumsfeld issued an order the next day to commanders      that detainees would receive such protections only ``to      the extent appropriate and consistent with military      necessity.''       Secretary of State Colin L. Powell--whose legal adviser,      William H. Taft IV, had vigorously tried to block the      decision--then met twice with Bush to convince him that the      decision would be a public relations debacle and would      undermine U.S. military prohibitions on detainee abuse. Gen.      Richard B. Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,      backed Powell, as did the leaders of the U.S. Central Command      who were pursuing the war.       The task of summarizing the competing points of view in a      draft letter to the president was seized initially by      Addington. A memo he wrote and signed with Gonzales's name--     and knowledge--was circulated to various departments, several      sources said. A version of this draft, dated Jan. 25, 2002,      was subsequently leaked. It included the eye-catching      assertion that a ``new paradigm'' of a war on terrorism      ``renders obsolete Geneva's strict limitations on questioning      of enemy prisoners.''       In early February 2002, Gonzales reviewed the issue once      more with Bush, who reaffirmed his initial decision regarding      his legal authority but chose not to invoke it immediately      for Taliban members. Flanigan said that Gonzales still      disagreed with Powell but ``viewed his role as trying to help      the president accommodate the views of State.''       Thirty months later, a Defense Department panel chaired by      James R. Schlesinger concluded that the president's resulting      Feb. 7 executive order played a key role in the Central      Command's creation of interrogation policies for the Abu      Ghraib prison in Iraq.       A former senior military lawyer, who was involved in the      deliberations but spoke on the condition of anonymity,      complained that Gonzales's counsel's office had ignored the      language and history of the conventions, treating the      question ``as if they wanted to look at the rules to see how      to justify what they wanted to do.''       ``It was not an open and honest discussion,'' the lawyer      said.       For Gonzales's aides, however, the experience only      reinforced a concern that the State Department and the      military legal community should not be trusted with      information about such policymaking. State ``saw its mission      as representing the interests of the rest of the world to the      president, instead of the president's interests to the      world,'' one aide said.                        The Debate Over Torture       This schism created additional problems when Gonzales      approved in August 2002--after limited consultation--an      Office of Legal Counsel memo suggesting various stratagems      that officials could use to defend themselves against      criminal prosecution for torture.       Drafted at the request of the CIA, which sought legal      blessing for aggressive interrogation methods for Abu Zubaida      and other al Qaeda detainees, the memo contended that only      physically punishing acts ``of an extreme nature'' would be      prosecutable. It also said that those committing torture with      express presidential authority or without the intent to      commit harm were probably immune from prosecution.       The memo was signed by Jay S. Bybee, then an assistant      attorney general and now a federal appellate judge, but      written with significant input from Yoo, whom Gonzales had      tried to hire at the White House and later endorsed to head      Justice's legal counsel office. During the drafting of the      memo, Yoo briefed Gonzales several times on its contents. He      also briefed Ashcroft, Bellinger, Addington, Haynes and the      CIA's acting general counsel, John A. Rizzo, several      officials said.       At least one of the meetings during this period included a      detailed description of the interrogation methods the CIA      wanted to use, such as open-handed slapping, the threat of      live burial and ``waterboarding''--a procedure that involves      strapping a detainee to a board, raising the feet above the      head, wrapping the face and nose in a wet towel, and dripping      water onto the head. Tested repeatedly on U.S. military      personnel as part of interrogation resistance training, the      technique proved to produce an unbearable sensation of      drowning.       State Department officials and military lawyers were      intentionally excluded from these deliberations, officials      said. Gonzales and his staff had no reservations about the      legal draft or the proposed interrogation methods and did not      suggest major changes during the editing of Yoo's memo, two      officials involved in the deliberations said.       The memo defined torture in extreme terms, said the      president had inherent powers to allow it and gave the CIA      permission to do what it wished. Seven months later, its      conclusions were cited approvingly in a Defense Department      memo that spelled out the Pentagon's policy for ``exceptional      interrogations'' of detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.       When the text was leaked to the public last summer, it      attracted scorn from military lawyers and human rights      experts worldwide. Nigel Rodley, a British lawyer who served      as the special U.N. rapporteur on torture and inhumane      treatment from 1993 to 2001, remarked that its underlying      doctrine ``sounds like the discredited legal theories used by      Latin American countries'' to justify repression.       After two weeks of damaging publicity, Gonzales distanced      himself, Bush and other senior officials from its language,      calling the conclusions ``unnecessary, over-broad      discussions'' of abstract legal theories ignored by      policymakers. Another six months passed before the Office of      Legal Counsel, under new direction, repudiated its reasoning      publicly, one week before Gonzales's confirmation hearing.
