Mr. Speaker, today the House Subcommittee on Health and Environment conducted an important hearing on the issues surrounding the Montreal Protocol of 1987, which bans the use of ozone depleting substances.  As many of my colleagues know, the Food and Drug Administration [FDA] recently unveiled a proposal to eliminate essential-use exemptions for metered dose inhalers [MDI's]. Mr. Cliff Stearns, my good friend from Florida, and I have introduced legislation [H.R. 2221] aimed at helping those suffering from respiratory conditions, particularly children with asthma and cystic fibrosis [CF], preserve their access to medicines they rely upon to breathe--metered dose inhalers.  H.R. 2221 requires the FDA and the Environmental Protection Agency [EPA] to delay their plans to remove chlorofluorocarbon-based MDI's from the marketplace before 2005. If Congress allows the FDA's ill-advised plan banning CFC MDI's to take effect, the 30 million Americans suffering from respiratory diseases could be placed at risk.  When the symptoms of these diseases strike, patients reach for the safe, effective, and proven medication delivery systems that have kept them alive for years--metered dose inhalers. Quite literally, metered dose inhalers are a matter of life and breath.  Currently, all metered dose inhalers, save one, are powered by chlorofluorocarbon [CFC] propellants. Under the 1987 Montreal Protocol, as amended, CFC's are to be phased-out globally because of the possible negative impact on the ozone layer. It is important to point out, however, that the signatories to the Montreal Protocol explicitly recognized that certain uses of CFC's generate tremendous health and safety benefits. Consequently, MDI's were given a temporary essential-use exemption from the treaty.  Despite this global exemption, the U.S. FDA has unilaterally decided to accelerate the phase-out of CFC-containing metered dose inhalers. Under the FDA's proposed framework, CFC-containing inhalers--used safely and regularly by millions of asthmatic children, adults, and senior citizens--would be banned and consumers would be forced to purchase alternative products, even if there was but a single alternative on the market.  Indeed, as of today, only one company has received FDA approval to manufacture non-CFC MDI's. Although pharmaceutical companies are currently developing CFC-free MDI's, the FDA proposal will force patients to abandon their existing medications and create a de facto monopoly in the substantial MDI market. Respiratory patients will lose the benefits of free-market competition, and the less well-off will be unfairly burdened with higher prices.  While adults may not notice the different taste, smell, or sensation of a CFC-free inhaler, an 8 year-old child might be reluctant to use his or her new MDI because it tastes funny. I have four children, and both of my daughters, Melissa and Elyse, have asthma. Like everybody else, people have different tastes and preferences. Any parent with children knows that it can be difficult to get them to take a medication perceived to be unpleasant. That is why there are dozens of flavors of cough syrups and cold medicines in the pharmacy.  But there is a big difference between cough syrup and MDI's--the failure to properly use an MDI can kill you. Mr. Speaker, it is a well known fact that asthma is currently the number one reason for children's school absences, and that roughly 5,000 Americans die each year from asthma-related complications. Furthermore, for millions of asthma sufferers, the single most important part of successful treatment is maintaining a steady medication routine. Disrupting this routine, which is a certain byproduct of FDA's proposal, will needlessly put the lives and health of our children and senior citizens at risk. That is why the one-size-fits-all policy FDA is pursuing is counterproductive.  In addition, the amount of CFC's used in metered dose inhalers is so small--less than 0.025 kg per inhaler--that the marginal environmental improvement in the ozone layer that would result from the FDA plan would be virtually undetectable. Indeed, MDI's are responsible for less than 1 percent of the risk to the ozone layer as measured by atmospheric chlorine levels.  Equally perplexing about FDA's proposal is that asthma patients in the United States will have their dependable and effective medications taken away from them while consumers in China and Indonesia continue to use CFC's in hair spray and cosmetics until 2010.  There is no doubt that pharmaceutical companies should be encouraged to develop, test, and bring alternative products to market before 2005. However, it is terribly shortsighted to pull the plug on CFC-containing MDI's before there is a free market in tested, proven, and accepted alternative products.  Mr. Speaker, I believe there is an alternative approach for the FDA to follow: allow the existing products to be used until 2005, and encourage the development and use of alternative [CFC-free] metered dose inhalers so that asthma patients can gradually become accustomed to the different medications without undue disruptions and risks. Rather than forcing patients to suddenly switch medications and involuntarily, a more sensible approach would allow environmentally safe products to flourish and attain widespread acceptance.  I call upon my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to reject the FDA's cold-turkey policy--Australia has already rejected that strategy, and they have the highest rate of skin cancer anywhere in the world. If the Australians--who have the most to lose from the destruction of the ozone layer--find the FDA's model objectionable, surely the United States can achieve its goal of zeroing out CFC production in 2005 without the heavy-handed, one-size-fits-all approach that the FDA has proposed. The children and senior citizens who depend on metered dose inhalers to breathe and live normal lives deserve better.                          ____________________
