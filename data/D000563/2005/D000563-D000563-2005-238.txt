President, Sally Moss wrote:       On my kitchen bar sits materials I received in the mail      from Social Security, AARP, and companies advertising their      plans.       Periodically, I sit down to try to make sense of it,      knowing that I need to make a decision before long. This idea      of having to select a drug insurance plan from the private      sector is the most ludicrous thing. . . . I am only 66 years      old, with a major in business administration and a minor in      computer science, and have only been retired for 16 months.      If I am frustrated and confused, imagine those who are much      older and less educated.  What can seniors do at this point if they don't have someone in their family they can turn to, whom they can trust, who will help them work through this morass of Government redtape to get to the plan for them? Turn to a group that doesn't have a financial interest in your situation. Never, ever give out your Social Security number. Go to Government agencies such as the Senior Health Insurance Program in my home State of Illinois, but be prepared for a long wait. We had our office call on behalf of some seniors to find out how long it would take to get information, and it turns out you are put in voice mail and you could wait for a long time.  In Peoria, IL, there are 23 volunteers answering the phones. They tell us they need 100 to get the job done in that one town.  It is not uncommon for seniors to attend two or three informational sessions because this benefit is so complicated. Some seniors get pretty emotional. They don't want to make the wrong decision.  In DeKalb County, there are four counselors for the whole county. Bob Rosemier is so concerned about the lack of staff that he is trying to get the DeKalb County Board to put on counselors to explain this complicated Federal program.  I am cosponsoring with Senator Nelson and Senator Schumer a bill called the Medicare Informed Choice Act of 2005. I ask any of my colleagues in the Senate who are receiving phone calls from seniors in their State facing the same problems I just described--finding it almost impossible to wade through this information and make the right choice, concerned they won't be able to do it even in the few months we have given them, worried over the penalties that could be assessed against them if they miss the next May 16 deadline--to help us pass this bill before we go home for Thanksgiving.  This bill does three things. It delays the late enrollment penalties for an additional 6 months so people have an entire year to sign up without penalty. It gives every Medicare beneficiary the opportunity to make a one-time change in plan enrollment at any point in 2006, so if a senior makes a mistake and chooses the wrong plan, it can be remedied. It also protects employees from being dropped by their former employer's plan during the first year of implementation so that beneficiaries have time to correct enrollment mistakes.  The Medicare Informed Choice Act is a modest, time-limited step we can take to ease the pressure on our senior citizens so that in the first year they get the decision made and made right, and if they make a mistake, they will not be penalized for it.  I urge all my colleagues, if you believed passionately in this bill as it was passed--and I did not--at least be sensitive to the people back home who are struggling to make sense out of this complicated measure. I urge all my colleagues to join me in the effort with Senator Nelson and others to help protect Medicare beneficiaries during the benefits implementation period.                          ____________________
