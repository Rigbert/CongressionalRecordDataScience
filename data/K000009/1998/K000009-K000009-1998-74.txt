Chairman, I thank the gentleman for that statement, but it appears by this 2 hours of debate now that certain people must not have beentalked to, and we should not have been presenting a bill like this which has such a controversial provision in it.  I would hope that, in listening to what has happened here, that perhaps some of these other interests could be accommodated and listened to down the road. But this is atypical of the rest of the bill.
