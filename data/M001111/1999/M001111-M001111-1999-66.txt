 What the other side wants to do is offer a second-degree amendment that offers Senators a false choice. We want to make sure we keep those teachers in place and continue our commitment to reduce class size.  I say to my colleagues, if they want to create a block grant program that provides additional funds, go ahead and tell us what their goals are, tell us what the program is, tell us what the achievements are. But right now we have in place a program we know works, we know what the goals are, and we know it achieves what we want to see achieved in this country, which is increasing the basic skills of our young students and giving them a chance at the economy when they graduate one day.
