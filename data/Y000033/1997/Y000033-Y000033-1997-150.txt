Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the order of business in House Resolution 180 be modified so that it shall be in order for Mr. Young of Alaska to offer the amendment now at the desk in lieu of the amendment numbered 2 in the Congressional Record by Mr. Miller of California, and that the amendment be considered under the same terms as would otherwise be applied to amendment No. 2.
