Chairman, I yield myself the balance of the time.  Mr. Chairman, I described that this amendment is unworkable. We will have a reallocation of resources. I would not want this bill to cost thousands of people in the northern border communities, legitimate, honest, hardworking American citizens as well as their counterparts on the Canadian side of the border to lose their jobs simply because goods cannot get across the border.  I appreciate the thought behind the gentleman's amendment, but it really is not a workable one, and it should be rejected as a result of that.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIRMAN (Mr. Culberson). The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Sullivan).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.
