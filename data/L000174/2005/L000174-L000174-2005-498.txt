Charles Taylor's actions are a breach of his promises to Nigerian President Obasanjo. And, I believe that if Nigeria does not hand over Charles Taylor for trial, it could constitute a threat to Liberian peace, justice in Sierra Leone, and the rule of law throughout West Africa. This is why the provision of law that I mentioned earlier is so important. It is the law of the United States that there shall be no assistance to the central government--including debt relief--for countries harboring fugitives from the Special Court for Sierra Leone. There is strong bipartisan support in the U.S. Congress to reauthorize this provision in fiscal year 2006, which means that unless President Bush issues a waiver, Nigeria will not be eligible for U.S. debt relief or military assistance, or any other assistance to the central government, until it sends Charles Taylor to the Special Court for trial.  I would point out that President Bush can exercise the waiver authority in the law by simply submitting a plan in writing on how the Administration will get Mr. Taylor to the Special Court to stand trial.  Mr. President, it is not in the interests of the people of West Africa, including Nigeria, or the United States, to continue to shelter Charles Taylor from justice. As a strong supporter of debt relief, I believe there is a strong case to be made that Nigeria's debt should be forgiven--but not until President Obasanjo again demonstrates leadership and hands over Charles Taylor for trial. At that point, I will strongly support debt relief for Nigeria and actively lobby the administration and Congress to make it a reality.
