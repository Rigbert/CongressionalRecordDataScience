Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. I just want to set the record straight here. Some of these so-called black ministers and so-called civil rights leaders never supported civil rights. They never marched for one day. They never put their bodies on the line for the cause of civil rights.  Coretta Scott King, the widow of Martin Luther King, Jr. is opposed to this amendment.
