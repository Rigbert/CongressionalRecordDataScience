Speaker, yesterday I submitted a portion of a study performed by the Business Roundtable which details the devastating economic consequences that could occur if the United States ratified the global warming treaty negotiated in Kyoto last December. Today I am submitting the introduction of a similar study performed by the CONSAD Research Corporation, one of the foremost economic research organizations. I would urge all my colleagues to consider this analysis as the debate surrounding the Protocol continues.  Finally, I would encourage all Members to review a report the Department of Energy's own Energy Information Administration released today. The report is just one more warning of the possible disastrous consequences of ratifying the Protocol. The report can be found on the Internet at www.eia.gov.        The Kyoto Protocol: A Flawed Treaty Puts America at Risk             SECTORAL AND REGIONAL ECONOMIC IMPACT ANALYSIS                              Introduction       CONSAD Research Corporation, one of the Nation's leading      economic forecasting firms, conducted a May 1998 economic      analysis of the proposed Kyoto Protocol. Their analysis      parallels findings by other leading economic forecasters      which detail the negative impact this treaty will have on      employment, economic output, and standard of life for working      families, senior citizens, and those who live on fixed or      low-incomes. The study provides a 50 state breakdown of job      losses And economic dislocation due to policies enacted to      implement the Kyoto Protocol.       CONSAD Research's key findings are that, implementation of      the Kyoto Protocol will mean:       Consumers and businesses will be forced to pay higher      energy costs. the resulting increase in energy costs will      also drive up prices on all consumer goods;       Approximately 3.1 million fewer American workers will be      working in the year 2010 as a direct result of this treaty      (assuming high permit fee range);       U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the year 2012 will      decline by the least $177 billion and perhaps by as much as      $318 billion;       Key strategic industries (aluminum, pulp and paper,      chemical, and others) will experience persistent employment      losses as well as losing market share for these products in      international markets;       Every region of the U.S. will experience increased      unemployment due to the treaty, with the greatest loses      occurring in California, Arizona, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and      Texas;       The highest job losses will be in high-skilled, high-wage      employment sectors, with many U.S. workers being forced to      take employment in lower-paying jobs in service-related      industries rather than facing prolonged periods of      unemployment; and       The U.S. standard of living will decrease as working      families are forced to reduce consumption of goods and      services in every major category--including food, energy, and      health care.                               ____________________
