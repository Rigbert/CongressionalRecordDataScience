President, today, those of us who have strongly insisted that no terrorist currently in Guantanamo Bay should or will be transferred to the United States, I think, have won a big victory.  I am going to be very frank about it. Faced with an embarrassing defeat, and listening to the American people, the Democratic leadership has accepted an amendment offered by Senator Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, myself, and many others that prohibits the use of Federal funds to transfer or locate any Gitmo terrorist to the United States.  This is an important, commonsense victory for the security of our country and more especially for Fort Leavenworth, KS. Following President Obama's decision to close Gitmo at the end of this year, there has been much speculation about moving terrorists to Leavenworth, especially in the press, and even on the Senate floor. I responded with remarks several weeks ago: ``Not on my watch.''  The problem is that while we have prohibited the use of funds to transfer terrorists to the United States, the Obama administration still has proposed no plan to meet their own January deadline. That does remain a challenge, and it means that while we won a victory today--no funds--it seems to me we must remain vigilant to make sure future plans do not include locations in the United States, including Leavenworth.  There are simply too many security risks and the possibility of negative impacts on our Kansas citizens and the Intellectual Center of the Army at Fort Leavenworth to even consider moving terrorists to Kansas.  I hope President Obama and his team designated to come up with a plan can come to the realization that closing Gitmo actually poses new problems in terms of security and logistics and legal issues.  Now that we are all on the same page, let's find a better answer and one that does not endanger Leavenworth, KS, or any other community in the United States.  I also wish to associate myself with the remarks of the distinguished Senator from Nebraska, Mike Johanns, who I think summarized the whole situation very well. I wish to thank Senator Inhofe for persevering. I wish to thank my dear friend and colleague, the distinguished Senator from Hawaii, Mr. Inouye, for his leadership in this regard.  But during this debate, and for some time, it seems to me we have seen a change in how those who are incarcerated at Gitmo are now being defined and described in the media, in the administration and, as a consequence, by some Americans.  I understand there is a poor perception of Guantanamo Bay. I think that is a fact we all realize. We heard another Senator from the other side of the aisle describe that in detail--as a matter of fact, ascribed all the problems to the Bush administration. But I do not think that is relevant. To say there are no terrorists there, to say there are not even enemy combatants there, is doing a disservice to us all by trivializing the crimes committed by the men at Guantanamo Bay.  I ask you, when did we start making terror politically correct? This same question was asked by Daniel Pearl's father, Judea Pearl, in an article that ran in the Wall Street Journal this past February. It is called: ``Daniel Pearl and the Normalization of Evil.'' I think every Senator and every American should read it, more especially in regard to this debate on where we locate these terrorists.  As you may know, and we should all remember, Daniel Pearl was the American journalist who was captured and beheaded--beheaded--on a video by the ``nonterrorist, nonenemy combatant'' Khalid Shaikh Mohammed in 2002--beheaded by Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, who is actually sitting at Guantanamo Bay right now.  Listen to what Judea Pearl, a respected professor at UCLA, has to say about that act of terror on his son:       Those around the world who mourned for Danny in 2002      genuinely hoped that Danny's murder would be a turning point      in the history of man's inhumanity to man, and that the      targeting of innocents to transmit political messages would      quickly become, like slavery and human sacrifice, an      embarrassing relic of a bygone era.       But somehow, barbarism, often cloaked in the language of      resistance, has gained acceptance in the most elite circles      of our society. The words ``war on terror'' cannot be uttered      today without fear of offense. Civilized society, so it      seems, is so numbed by violence that it has lost its gift to      be disgusted by evil.  Well, this Senator remains disgusted by evil. I am disgusted by those who target innocent civilians as they spew their hatred. I refuse to adopt what Danny's father calls ``the mentality of surrender.'' And that is weaved throughout this debate in regard to what happens to these terrorists.  It is not too late. We can all refuse to surrender to the idea that terrorism is somehow a tactic, to refuse to believe it is an acceptable tool of resistance.  There is still time for Americans to remember that there are men at Guantanamo who cannot be released and most certainly should not be on American soil.  Mr. President, I yield back.
