President, this is part of the economic stimulus package. It is an amendment agreed to by both sides, Democrats and Republicans, to extend the unemployment insurance benefits to those States which will provide protection, expanded coverage for part-time workers who otherwise would not be eligible for unemployment compensation, and expand coverage to low-wage and recent hires who are also out of work and cannot be covered by unemployment. It also increases benefit levels under unemployment compensation by 15 percent or $25 per week, whichever is greater.
