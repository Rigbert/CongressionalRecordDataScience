 Speaker, in Vermont we are celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the Community Action Programs which have transformed the lives of thousands and thousands of people in our state. These CAP agencies provide citizens with assistance: the young and the elderly, rural residents and urban residents, homeowners and renters and the homeless, those with jobs and those without. These are not programs created to give handouts; instead, they work to develop comprehensive approaches to addressing the root causes of poverty, and to alleviating the consequences of poverty. Nor are they spinoffs of some far-distant Washington bureaucracy: the CAP agencies are locally staffed and their programs result from collaborative efforts with the lower-income people they are meant to serve.  Vermont's Community Action Programs are community-based networks for social and economic development. There are five of them: Southeast Vermont Community Action (SEVCA), Central Vermont Community Action Council (CVCAC), Community Action in Southwestern Vermont (BROC), Northeast Kingdom Community Action Agency (NEKCA) and Champlain Valley Office of Economic Opportunity (CVOEO). Nearly 3,000 individuals (in 1165 families) were provided services through the SEVCA's Community Services department last year. NEKCA serves more than 6,000 moderate-to-low income families. Over 8,000 individuals obtained early childhood education, crisis fuel assistance, meals, and household insulation through CVCAC. CVOEO provides a wide variety of vital services to approximately 8,000 households (just over 19,000 individuals) every year.  But numbers alone, as impressive as they are, do not tell the whole story. From child care to fuel assistance in cold weather, the CAP agencies are always there when people have needs. CAP agencies not only help hard-pressed families find food, they support family farms through the Farm to Family coupon redemption program. They help retrain workers who have lost their jobs, and they provide a sound basis for a lifetime of learning through Head Start. They run micro-business development programs--and help citizens with their tax returns.  In SEVCA's building there is a wonderful version of the Washington mural of men waiting in a breadline in the 1930's, a reminder that economic need is--unhappily--always among us. That mural reminds us too of Franklin Roosevelt's eloquent words, which are painted on the mural itself: ``The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much, it is whether we provide enough for those who have little.'' Those words ring, today, with truth.  Too often the glowing colors of our television and the bold headlines of our newspapers ignore the actuality of life in America: that in the midst of the richest Nation in the history of the world, many go hungry, or are without health insurance, or lack adequateeducation, or search fruitlessly for decent-paying jobs. The CAP agencies of Vermont never forget the realities in which we all live. They know that there are people who can benefit from the help of the government programs established by Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson, programs begun in times when it was the purpose of government to serve all Americans--and not just wealthy Americans. The CAP agencies, and those who work for them, do much to help tens of thousands of Vermonters live the life that should be theirs, a life free from hunger, homelessness, hopelessness and want.  So after 40 years of hard and extraordinarily important work by those who work for and sustain the CAP agencies, let me say on behalf of all the citizens of my state: Congratulations on what you have done! All of us in Vermont are richer for the community you have built and sustained.                          ____________________
