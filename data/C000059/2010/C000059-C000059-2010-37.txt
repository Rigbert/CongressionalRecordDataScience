 The purpose of the Father of the Year Awards is to honor fathers who have remained a positive role model for their children while also making a positive difference in their community.  Marion Ashley is one of those fathers. He has been married to his wife Mary for 54 years, and has 6 children, 19 grandchildren and 3 great-grandchildren. As a lifelong resident of Riverside County, he has worked for decades to improve the lives of his fellow citizens.  After years of working in the private sector, both at a national accounting firm and in real estate investment, Marion decided to become more involved in public service. In 1973, he served on the Riverside County Planning Commission and in 1992 was elected to a seat on the board of the Eastern Municipal Water District. In 2002, he was elected to the Riverside County Board of Supervisors, a position he still holds today.  As Supervisor of the 5th District in Riverside, Marion oversees a budget of $4.5 billion and sets public policy for more than two million people. In addition, he is the only Supervisor who has served as Chairman of: the Board of Supervisors; the Western Riverside Council of Governments; and the Coachella Valley Association of Governments.  Throughout his many roles, Marion has made family and public service his top priorities. His dedication to the people of Riverside County has not gone unnoticed, and he has become a respected leader on critical regional issues. Marion himself has said that he and his wife hope to build a community in which his children and grandchildren enjoy the same quality of life he has known in Riverside County, and I cannot think of someone who has worked so tirelessly in that effort.  I am proud to call Marion a friend, fellow community member and American. And today, I add my voice to the many who will be congratulating him on this well-deserved recognition.                          ____________________
