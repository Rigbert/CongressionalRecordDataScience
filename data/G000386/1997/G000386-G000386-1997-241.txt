 President, we have all heard by now that Ron Fitzsimmons, the executive director of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers, admitted that many pro-abortion groups agreed to a party line to say that partial birth abortions are very rare and performed only in extreme medical circumstances. Mr. Fitzsimmons has now admitted that this party line was a lie.  Recent witness before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Renee Chelian, the president of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers, was quoted in a news article as saying, ``The spin out of Washington was that it was only done for medical necessity, even though we knew it wasn't so.''  She openly admitted that she kept waiting for the National Abortion Federation to clarify it and they never did it. She said, ``I got caught up: What do we do about this secret? Who do we tell and what happens when we tell? But frankly no one was asking me, so I didn't have to worry.''  But the truth came out. Now we know that many, who so desperately were trying to tell us the truth, were right when they declared that this procedure is done thousands of times a year and the majority is done for elective purposes.  I'm saddened to see that a new wave of behavior has begun to permeate our legislative process and for that matter political behavior. What appears to be commonplace is that now the end justifies the means. We've seen the administration use that excuse most recently when they openly admitted that it was necessary to do what it took to raise campaign funds in order to win the Presidency. And now, in this partial-birth abortion debate we have peoplewho admitted they deliberately lied to Members of Congress and more important to the public about the partial-birth abortion procedure to justify a defeat of legislation banning it.  The partial-birth abortion procedure is an assault on women and children. It is more than abortion on demand--it's abortion out-of-control.  This is more than a debate about a woman's right to choose. This is about whether doctors, under the guise of health care, should be allowed to take the life of a child in such a barbarous way.  I plan to support the measure before us, without amendment, which would end this procedure. This form of abortion is senseless, dangerous, and is clear-cut infanticide.  My colleagues have discussed what happens to the mother and child during this type of abortion in graphic detail. Unfortunately, this procedure cannot be sugarcoated. It is a procedure which doctors use to kill unborn babies who in many cases have developed enough to live outside of the womb.  I have been contacted by thousands of people in my State imploring me to support legislation to ban this procedure. Several hospitals from my State and their staffs have urged me to ban this procedure.  Last year, President Clinton stated before he vetoed the original legislative ban on partial-birth abortion, ``I have studied and prayed about this issue, and about the families who must face this awful choice, for many months. I believe that we have a duty to try to find common ground: a resolution to this issue that respects the views of those--including myself--who object to this particular procedure, but also upholds the Supreme Court's requirement that laws regulating abortion protect both the life and the health of American women.''  Although it appears the President and many of my colleagues are concerned about the life and health of the mother, I must question their judgment. This bill would ban partial-birth abortions unless the life of the mother would be endangered. Medical experts have said that this 3-day procedure would not be necessary even then.  Many say that this procedure must be allowed in cases where the health of the mother is at risk. Even that logic has been challenged. We know the Doe versus Bolton case interpreted health very broadly to mean almost anything, including if the mother is a minor or if the mother has depression and so forth. So, what that means in real terms is if the mother doesn't want the child--having the child will detrimentally affect her health and so on--abortion can take place in the third trimester.  Many have testified that partial-birth abortion is almost never the safest procedure to save a woman's life or even her health.  Former Surgeon General, Doctor C. Everett Koop has stated, ``Contrary to what abortion activists would have us believe, partial-birth abortion is never medically indicated to protect a woman's health or her fertility. In fact, the opposite is true: The procedure can pose a significant and immediate threat to both the pregnant woman's health and fertility.''  In the American Medical News, Dr. Warren Hern, who authored a widely used abortion manual, stated, ``I would dispute any statement that this is the safest procedure to use.''  Opponents talk about reproductive rights, but women have been deceived to think if an abortion procedure is legal then it is automatically safe. And I believe many women and men who support abortion in general do so on the basis of this reproductive safety jargon.  Some have accused pro-life individuals of only being concerned about the baby and accused pro-choice individuals of only being concerned about the woman. I am seriously concerned about both the woman and the child. Babies are being victimized and women are being exploited. What kind of Federal or State regulations exist to make sure these abortions are safe? And I ask this question about abortions in general. A person doesn't even have to have a health care license of any kind to assist in the execution of an abortion.  Do we have any uniform health and safety regulations that make sure abortion clinics are safe? I know there aren't Federal ones, because the pro-abortion forces have blocked any attempt to set safety standards and State regulations vary greatly. We saw the ``60 Minutes'' expose on the lack of safety regulations in Maryland that led to the abortion clinic death of at least one woman.  I am concerned about women's health. And although some would say because I am pro-life, I do not care about the reproductive rights of women. That deduction is not accurate. And it exasperates me that women across our country have been led to believe that legality is synonymous with safety.  Women should be outraged that this procedure has been designed and is being performed on them and healthy babies. This particular abortion technique is one of the most dangerous to their reproductive health and runs the great risk of jeopardizing their chances to ever carry a child to full term. As far as being out of touch, the other side is out of touch with protecting these children, many of whom could be the future women and men of America.  And if those in opposition are really interested in protecting women's lives, why can't we enact Federal safety and health standards for abortion clinics? We can't because supporters of abortion don't want even minimum standards. How many women have been killed or maimed getting these so-called legal abortions?  We always hear the mantra that the pro-life side is somehow out of touch and trying to turn the clock back on women. Well, the problem with the other side is they totally disregard the children and the women that are involved in these difficult cases. I'd like to move the clock forward for these children, not back, like the other side would like to do.  Doctors that perform abortions are not required to inform the patient about any of the risks she faces with each specific abortion procedure. Doctors that perform abortions are not required to offer decision-based counseling to their patients. Doctors and those that assist the doctors, such as anesthesiologists, are not required to have an abortion-specific license.  Abortionists can even ask their patients to sign statements saying that they will not sue if injured. Again, this is not a so-called anti-choice issue. Even pro-choice members have voted against this. Many have reiterated my colleague from New York's statement which said it accurately, ``I think this is just too close to infanticide. A child has been born and it has exited the uterus and, what on Earth is this procedure?''  I want to submit for the record a copy of an article from the Argus Leader. It features a family from Hull, IA. At 23 weeks into her pregnancy, Sarah Bartels went into premature labor. Her daughter Stephanie was born at 1 pound, 2 ounces. The doctor who was working the night Stephanie was born said she was small and yet very vigorous, wiggling her arms. Three-months later, her twin sister, Sandra, was born. Each of these were miraculous births.  However, it becomes completely clear that because of location, one sister's life was protected and the other's was not. Over the 88-day period before her twin sister was born, Stephanie's life was protected by law because she was living in an intensive-care nursery. Over the same 88-day period, Sandra was not protected by law because she was living in her mother's womb. George Will pointed out in his column that unless she is completely outside the mother, she is fair game for the abortionist.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have these articles printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 24, 1997]                          The Abortion Coverup                          (By George F. Will)       The accusation that President Clinton cares deeply about      nothing is refuted by his tenacious and guileful battle to      prevent any meaningful limits on the form of infanticide      known as partial-birth abortion. However, that battle proves      that his professed desire to make abortion ``rare'' applies      only to the fourth trimester of pregnancies.       Soon--probably in the first half of May--the battle will be      rejoined in the Senate, where the minority leader, South      Dakota's Tom Daschle, will offer what he will advertise as a      compromise. Truth-in-advertising laws do not apply to      legislators.       Daschle has not published his language yet, but presumably      it will be congruent with Clinton's real, as distinct from      his rhetorical, position. And judging by previous legislative      maneuverings, a ``compromise'' measure will be craftily      designed for the convenience of ``pro-choice'' legislators      who are kept on a short leash by the abortion-maximizing      lobby.       The aim will be to enable such legislators to adhere to      that lobby's agenda while casting a cosmetic vote that will      mollify a public repelled by partial-birth abortion, the      practice of sucking the brains from the skull of a baby      delivered feet first and killed while only the head remains      in the mother's uterus. Senators should consider this issue      in the light cast by the case of Stephanie and Sandra Bartels      of Hull, Iowa.       They are twins born in a South Dakota hospital 88 days      apart by what is called ``delayed-interval delivery.''      Stephanie, born Jan. 5 when her mother went into premature      labor in the 23rd week of her pregnancy, weighed 1 pound, 2      ounces. Sandra, weighing 7 pounds, 10 ounces, was born April      2, by which time Stephanie weighed 4 pounds, 10 ounces.       For 88 days, while her twin sister's life was protected by      the law, Sandra could have been, under the probable terms of      the Daschle ``compromise,'' aborted by any abortionist. This      is because under any language acceptable to the abortion      movement and hence to Clinton and Daschle, a baby does not      warrant legal protection merely because she is medically      ``viable,'' referring to the point at which she can survive      with good medical assistance, a point that now begins at      about 23 weeks. Location is the key factor: Unless she is      completely outside the mother, she is fair game for the      abortionist.       Daschle has at times said his measure will not put any      restrictions on abortions in the second trimester of      pregnancy, when about 90 percent of partial-birth abortions      occur, involving thousands of babies a year, many of them      potentially less precariously viable than Stephanie was. And      Daschle's language will contain a provision pertaining to      ``health,'' perhaps even an apparent limitation to      considerations of ``physical'' health. However, this will be      meaningless if the language grants the abortionist an      unreviewable right to determine when the exception applies.       During the 1996 campaign, Clinton, who had vetoed a ban on      partial-birth abortions, said he would support the ban if      there were a ``minor'' amendment creating only a ``very      stringent'' exception. It would allow such abortions to      prevent ``severe physical damage'' to the mother. Note the      word ``physical.''       However, the White House reportedly has told congressional      Democrats that Clinton's views are compatible with      ``compromise'' language proposed last month by Maryland Rep.      Steny Hoyer, co-chairman of the House Democratic Steering      Committee. Hoyer's language would permit post-viability      abortions whenever, ``in the medical judgment of the      attending physician'' (the abortionist), not performing the      abortion would have ``serious adverse health consequences.''       Does that include ``mental health'' consequences? Said      Hoyer, ``Yes, it does.''       To allay suspicions that this might be an infinitely      elastic loophole, he said, ``We're not talking about a      hangnail, we're not talking about a headache.'' However, a      suspicion unallayed by such flippancy is this: The      abortionist will be free to decide that not performing an      abortion will cause, say distress and depression sufficient      to constitute serious health consequences.       Daschle, following Hoyer's precedent, may leave the      definitions of ``viability'' and ``health'' up to the      abortionist. If so, this will be, says Douglas Johnson of the      National Right to Life Committee, akin to a law that      ostensibly bans ``assault weapons'' but empowers any gun      dealer to define an assault weapon.       So the Daschle ``compromise'' probably will aim to confer      on the supposedly restricted person, the abortionist, an      uncircumscribed right to define the critical terms of the      supposed restrictions. If enacted, such a ``compromise''      would be a remarkable confection, a law that is impossible to      violate.                                  ____         [From the Argus Leader, Sioux Falls, SD, Apr. 2, 1997]      88-Day-Old Girl Awaits the Expected Birth Today of Her Twin                           (By Joyce Terveen)       Three-month-old Stephanie Bartels is expecting a twin baby      brother or sister any day now.       At 23 weeks into her pregnancy, Sarah Bartels, 23, of Hull,      Iowa, went into premature labor. Stephanie was born Jan. 5 at      Sioux Valley Hospital, fighting for life at 1 pound, 2      ounces.       While doctors were unable to stop Stephanie's birth, they      have been successful in holding off the second birth.       The world record for what's called a delayed-interval      delivery is 92 days. Bartels is on day 88.       Her home since Stephanie's birth has been a hospital room.      But those days have been bearable, she said, because she can      go to the intensive-care nursery to help care for 4\1/2\-     pound Stephanie.       ``When I first saw Stephanie, she was skin and bones. Now      she's really a little chunk,'' said Bartels as she rested in      her hospital bed Tuesday.       Babies born at 23 weeks are on the statistical edge of      life, with one out of five making it. Forty weeks is      considered full term.       ``I remember that delivery vividly,'' said Dr. Martin      Vincent, the neonatologist who was working the night      Stephanie was born. ``The baby came out small and yet very      vigorous, wiggling her arms.''       The Bartels say it was difficult not being able to hold      their first-born for the first six weeks while she was on a      ventilator.       ``The first time I held her, it made me feel like a natural      dad,'' said David Bartels, a draftsman for an electrical      engineering firm in Sioux Center, Iowa. ``Before, she didn't      feel like she was mine.''       Stephanie is doing well and gaining weight. So is the      second twin, who is estimated to weigh 7 pounds, 13 ounces.       ``Since it was at the extreme of life, we tried to do what      we could to keep the second baby inside,'' said Dr. William      J. Watson, a perinatologist who handled Sarah's case because      her diabetes made her a high-risk patient. ``We've tried this      a number of times and have been unsuccessful.''       To delay the second birth, Watson stitched Bartels' cervix      to keep it closed. She was given antibiotics to fight off the      infection that had infected the membrane of the first twin.      She also took medications to prevent contractions.       The Bartels don't care if they break any records.       ``I just want to have my baby and go home,'' Bartels said.       They haven't worried yet about dealing with the question,      ``Why are we twins and born three months apart?''       ``We're just hoping the kids won't ask us that,'' Bartels      said.                                  ____                    [From Roll Call, Feb. 27, 1997]   Partial-Birth Betrayal: Democrats Seething As Activist Admits Lie                          (By Charles E. Cook)       A quiet fight within the Democratic party went public      earlier this week with the statement by the leader of a major      pro-choice organization that he ``lied through [his] teeth''      about the frequency and circumstances of the ``partial      birth'' abortion procedure during the 1995 debate on the      issue.       In an American Medical News article to be published March 3      and quoted in Wednesday's New York Times, Ron Fitzsimmons,      executive director of the National Association of Abortion      Providers, said the procedure is performed far more often      than he and other pro-choice leaders had told the public and      Congress. His previous assurances had encouraged      Congressional Democrats to oppose a ban on the procedure,      which President Clinton vetoed.       The National Association of Abortion Providers is an      organization of more than 200 independent abortion clinics.      Fitzsimmons told the Times that he remains pro-choice and      still opposes a ban on the procedure, but was quoted as      saying that the lying, particularly in an appearance on ABC's      ``Nightline,'' ``made me physically ill.''       He said he told his wife the next day, ``I can't do it      again.''       Privately. Congressional Democrats and their strategists      have been seething for some time, feeling that they had been      set up by the pro-choice community. They say they were led to      believe that the procedure--in which a fetus is partially      delivered and then its skull is crushed before removal from      the birth canal--is quite rare and only used under      extraordinary circumstances, such as to save the life or      preserve the health of the mother, or when the fetus is      severely deformed.       The partial-birth abortion issue, though not widely used in      the 1996 elections, was extremely potent where it did come      up. It almost cost Democrats two Senate seats: in Iowa, where      Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin saw a comfortable lead evaporate      in a matter of days; and in Louisiana where it cost Democrat      Mary Landrieu 4 or 5 points, turning the race into the      closest Senate contest in Louisiana history.       Just a couple of days before the Fitzsimmons statement, a      Democratic strategist told me to expect Senate Democrats to      bring the issue back up to allow their Members to get on the      record against this procedure. They are bitter that they were      misled by pro-choice lobbyists--and that it almost cost them      dearly on Election Day.       To be sure, Democrats are not having second thoughts about      the abortion issue in general, but they now see that this      aspect of the debate is a certain political loser. They      concede that even many voters who otherwise are adamantly      pro-choice are squeamish about this particularly gruesome      procedure.       There is some evidence that the percentage of Americans who      are pro-choice under all circumstances has declined a few      points in the last couple of years. It's possible that      corresponds to the rise of this partial birth issue, which      until recently was unknown to the general public.       Should Democrats decide to backtrack on the partial-birth      issue, there is some question as to whether it will be a      meaningful retreat. The National Right to Life Committee      argues that while Clinton and Senate Minority Leader Tom      Daschle (D-SD) have ``indicated a willingness to accept a ban      on partial birth abortions if a `narrow' exception were added      for various serious health circumstances,'' the exceptions      amount to little, if any, change.       The pro-life forces maintain that the Clinton-Daschle      proposal would only apply from the seventh month of pregnancy      onward, while most partial-birth abortions occur they say,      during the fifth and sixth months.       Furthermore, the NRLC opposes an exemption that would allow      the procedure to be performed to ``Protect a mother's future      fertility.'' They point to a statement former Surgeon General      C. Everett Koop and 400 other physicians that ``partial-birth      abortion is never medically necessary to protect a mother's      health or future fertility,'' and that it ``can pose a      significant threat to both her immediate health and future      fertility.''       Interestingly, this all comes on the heels of Congress      voting to release family planning funding for international      organizations. While that money technically isn't supposed to      be used to fund abortions, it has the effect of freeing up      other funds that can.       The pro-choice cause, in general, has not lost ground. But      this one extreme position has caused it significant harm--     especially in terms of credibility. Some of the movement's      best friends on Capitol Hill feel betrayed.       One of the most basic rules of lobbying is, ``Never lie to      a Member of Congress, particularly one of your friends.''      Another is, ``Never ask a Member to do something that will      later jeopardize his seat.''       The pro-choice movement did both and will pay a price for      it.
