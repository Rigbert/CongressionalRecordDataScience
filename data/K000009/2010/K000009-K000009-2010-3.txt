And the most important reason is that this bill will not translate into job creation in the United States of America. All it does is put our taxpayers on the hook for another trillion dollars of borrowed debt that will be from places like China, and from Saudi Arabia, in order to give more tax cuts to the rich over the next 10 years. There is no guarantee that that money will even be invested in the United States of America.  You know, the Dow is up 42 percent. NASDAQ is up 78 percent. Wall Street is on track to see its second-highest profitable year on record with a projected $144 billion in bonuses going out the door. Couldn't they take some of that and make sure this goes to those who are unemployed and still seeking to earn their way forward in this economy?  This bill will not be a real stimulus. In fact, it will only yield 33 cents of economic impact for every dollar that is borrowed to pay for it. It will not create real robust growth and jobs in this country. There is not even a ``Buy America'' provision in the bill. I'm so sad for our Nation that we can't do better and help put America's unemployed back to work.
