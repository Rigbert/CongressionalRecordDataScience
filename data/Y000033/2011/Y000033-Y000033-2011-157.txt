Mr. Speaker, today I rise in recognition of National Business Women's Week, Business and Professional Women, North to the Future, and YWCA.  Working women constitute 72 million, or almost half of the nation's workforce and strive to serve their communities, their states, and their nation in professional, civic and cultural capacities. Women-owned businesses constitute 30 percent of all U.S. business generating in $1.9 trillion in sales and employing 9.2 million people.  Working women should be applauded for their contributions to the workplace and the financial stability of their families especially during the economic downturn when more women have become their family's breadwinner. Since 1928, National Business Week has honored the contributions of working women and employers who support working women and their families.  North to the Future is a professional local organization with more than thirty five years of active community service within Anchorage. BPW NTTF remains committed to reducing Alaska's staggering statistics on sexual assault and domestic violence and has organized activities programs and events to educate and uplift women.  For these reasons, I rise in support, recognition and congratulations during National Business Women's Week.                          ____________________
