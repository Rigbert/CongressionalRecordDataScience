 President, I rise today with Senator Collins, Senator Durbin, Senator Feingold, Senator Kennedy, and Senator Casey to introduce legislation to authorize a comprehensive review of our nuclear weapons policy and posture.  Before we ramp up funding for the Reliable Replacement Warhead program as the administration has requested, we should have a clear, bipartisan consensus on the role nuclear weapons will play in our national security strategy and the impact they will have on our nuclear nonproliferation efforts.  The Nuclear Policy and Posture Review Act of 2007 does three things.  First, it authorizes the President to conduct a nuclear policy review to consider a range of possible roles of nuclear weapons in U.S. security policy. The administration may reach out to outside experts and conduct public hearings to get a wide range of views. The policy review will provide options and recommendations for a nuclear posture review.  This report is due on September 1, 2009.  Second, following the completion of the nuclear policy review, it authorizes the Secretary of Defense to conduct a comprehensive review of the nuclear posture of the U.S. to clarify U.S. nuclear deterrence policy and strategy. This report is due March 1, 2010.  Finally, it zeros out funding for the Reliable Replacement Warhead program until the policy review and posture review reports have been submitted to Congress.  In his testimony on March 29, 2007, before the House Energy & Water Appropriations Subcommittee, former Senator Sam Nunn, Chairman of Nuclear Threat Initiative, noted that:       On the [Reliable Replacement Warhead] itself, if Congress      gives a green light to this program in our current world      environment, I believe that this will be: misunderstood by      our allies; exploited by our adversaries; complicate our work      to prevent the spread and use of nuclear weapons and . . .      make resolution of the Iran and North Korea challenges all      the more difficult.  I could not agree more.  Indeed, I remain deeply concerned about this administration's nuclear weapons policy.  As a U.S. Senator, I have worked with colleagues in the House and Senate to stop the re-opening of the nuclear door and the development of new nuclear weapons.  Together, we have eliminated funding for the Advanced Concepts Initiative, the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator, and the Modern Pit Facility.  These were consequential victories but the fight is far from over.  For fiscal year 2008, the administration requested $118 million for the Reliable Replacement Warhead program; $88 million in the National Nuclear Security administration's budget and $30 million in the Department of Defense's budget.  These funds would be used for Phase 2A activities: design definition and cost study.  This would represent approximately a four-fold increase over fiscal year 2007 funding of $24.7 million.  The House, however, rejected the administration's request and zeroed out funding for RRW in its fiscal year 2008 Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill. In its report accompanying the legislation, the House cited the lack of a definitive nuclear weapons policy review as a key reason for withholding funding for what will be a costly new nuclear warhead program. It stated:       The lack of any definitive analysis or strategic assessment      defining the objectives of a future nuclear stockpile makes      it impossible to weigh the relative merits of investing      billions of taxpayer dollars in new nuclear weapon production      activities when the United States is facing the problem of      having too large a stockpile as a Cold War legacy. Currently,      there exists no convincing rationale for maintaining the      large number of existing Cold War nuclear weapons, much less      producing additional warheads, or for the DoD requirements      that drive the management of the DOE nuclear weapons complex.  While the Senate bill did not follow suit, it did cut $22 million from the administration's request, for a total of $66 million, and restricted activities to Phase 2A.  I believe we can match the House's action and this bill would do just that.  The administration is clearly getting nervous about the prospects for funding for RRW.  On Wednesday, the Secretaries of Energy, Defense, and State released a 4-page white paper on nuclear weapons strategy: ``National Security and Nuclear Weapons: Maintaining Deterrence in the 21st Century''. It affirmed the importance of maintaining a credible nuclear deterrent and sought to justify funding for the Reliable Replacement Warhead program. Among other things, it stated that the Reliable Replacement Warhead program is critical to sustaining long-term confidence in the nuclear stockpile and will help reduce the stockpile and move us away from nuclear testing; and any delay to the program will force the U.S. to maintain a larger stockpile, invest in costly and risky Life Extension Programs, and increase the likelihood that we will have to resume nuclear testing.  These arguments simply do not stand up to scrutiny.  Indeed the evidence clearly shows that there is no need to rush forward with increased funding for RRW. Let us take a close look at the status of our nuclear weapons arsenal.  Are there currently problems with the safety and reliability of our nuclear arsenal?  No, for each of the past 11 years the Secretary of Energy and Secretary of Defense have certified that the nuclear stockpile is safe and reliable.  Has the Pentagon asked for a new warhead for new missions?  No, there is no new military requirement to replace existing, well-tested warheads.  What about the plutonium pit, the ``trigger'' of a nuclear weapon? In past years, the administration requested funding for a Modern Pit Facility that could build up to 450 pits a year arguing that the pits in our current stockpile were reaching the end of their life-span.  Is our stockpile at risk due to aging pits?  No, a December 2006 report by the National Laboratories showed that plutonium pits have a life-span of at least 85 years, and possibly up to 100 years.  That report validated Congressional action to eliminate funding for the Modern Pit Facility. I am pleased that the administration listened and did not request funding for the facility in fiscal year 2007 and fiscal year 2008.  Are we at risk for resuming nuclear testing?  No, as I have argued our stockpile is safe and secure and will clearly remain so for the foreseeable future.  If the likelihood of resuming nuclear testing is increasing it is due to the fact that the administration has, in past years, requested funding to lower the time to test readiness at the Nevada test site from 24-36 months to 18 months and, above all, refused to support ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, CTBT.  What about costs? I find it interesting that the administration would cite the costs of successful Life Extension Programs as a reason to ramp up funding for the RRW.  Has the administration shared with us what it will cost to replace the warhead on our deployed nuclear arsenal with a new Reliable Replacement Warhead?  The answer is no. The administration has remained silent about when the supposed cost savings from RRW will ultimately kick in.  In fact, the development of a new nuclear warhead will likely add billions of dollars to the American taxpayer's bill at a time when, as noted above, the stockpile is safe and reliable. As the House Energy and Water Appropriations report argued:       Under any realistic future U.S. nuclear defense scenario,      the existing legacy stockpile will continue to provide the      nation's nuclear deterrent for well over the next two to      three decades. The effort by the NNSA to apply urgency to      developing a significant production capacity for the RRW      while lacking any urgency to rationalize an oversized complex      appears to mean simply more costs to the American taxpayer.  Before we move any further with this program which would add a new warhead to the stockpile, we should have a better understanding of the role nuclear weapons will play in our security policy in a post-Cold War and post 9/11 world.  If we as a country are going to move away from massive stockpiles of nuclear weapons and explore more conventional alternatives, does it make sense to add a new warhead to the stockpile?  If we are committed to strengthening the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and stopping the proliferation of nuclear weapons, what impact would a Reliable Replacement Warhead have on those efforts?  If the Stockpile Stewardship Program and the Life Extension Program can certify the safety and the reliability of our existing nuclear stockpile, should we shift resources from RRW to more pressing concerns?  It is common sense to ask these questions and engage in comprehensive review and debate about these options before we make the decision on manufacturing new warheads.  As it stands now, we are addressing this issue backwards and behind closed doors.  That is, we are rushing to develop a new warhead without an understanding of the role it will play in our nuclear weapons policy and national security strategy and without public input that will lead to a bipartisan policy.  Let us be clear: a rushed, four page white paper is simply not sufficient to answer these questions and make decisions about developing new nuclear warheads.  The administration has promised a more detailed report but its haste to put out this paper suggests that it is more intent on rushing the development of the Reliable Replacement Warhead program than in taking a sober,unbiased look at our nuclear weapons policy and posture.  A lack of a substantive debate and review means we are not paying sufficient attention to the potential negative consequences of RRW.  Speeding up the development of a new nuclear warhead may send the wrong message to Iran; North Korea; and other would-be nuclear weapon states and encourage the very proliferation we are trying to prevent.  What to us may appear to be a safer, more reliable weapon could appear to others to be a new weapon with new missions and a violation of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.  The American Association for the Advancement of Science issued a report last month acknowledging that a Reliable Replacement Warhead ``could lead to a final selected design that is certifiable without a nuclear test.''  Yet, the report also concluded that absent a comprehensive review of nuclear policy and stockpile needs, the purpose and intention of RRW could be widely misinterpreted abroad.  Pointing out that there has been no high level statement about nuclear weapons policy since the 2001 Nuclear Posture Review, it called on the administration to develop a bipartisan policy on the future of nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons policy before moving ahead with RRW. It stated:       In the absence of a clear nuclear posture, many      interpretations are possible [about U.S. nuclear weapons      policy] and the lack of a national understanding and      consensus on the role of U.S. nuclear weapons puts any new      approach at considerable risk at home and abroad. For      example, an RRW plan that emphasizes the goal of sustaining      the deterrent without nuclear testing could be perceived      quite differently from one that focuses on future flexibility      to develop and deploy nuclear weapons for new military      mission.  It goes on to state:       . . . nuclear weapons are ultimately an instrument of      policy and strategy rather than of war fighting, and only      with the leadership of the president can there be major      changes in that instrument.  Unfortunately we have not seen such leadership from this administration.  Because it pursued the development of low-yield nuclear weapons and a Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator, because it sought to lower the time-to-test readiness at the Nevada test site from 24-26 months to 18 months, because it sought to build a Modern Pit Facility that could produce up to 450 pits a year, this administration has lost the credibility to take a fresh and open look at nuclear weapons policy and posture.  Only a new administration, free from the constraints of the heated debates of the past, will have the authority to conduct a comprehensive review of our nuclear weapons policy and posture.  A bipartisan consensus on this policy is essential. It will let the world know exactly where we stand on these important issues and help clear up any confusion about our intentions.  Friend and foe alike will know that regardless of who holds power in Congress or the White House, the role of nuclear weapons in our security strategy will not change.  It will strengthen our efforts to convince other states to forego the development of nuclear weapons and make the world safer from the threat of nuclear war.  I believe that bipartisan policy is beginning to emerge.  In a January 4, 2007 op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, ``A World Free of Nuclear Weapons'', George Schultz, William Perry, Henry Kissinger, and Sam Nunn laid out a compelling vision for a world free of the threat of nuclear war.  They laid a set of common sense steps the U.S. and other nuclear weapon states can take to make this happen including: taking nuclear weapons off high-alert status; substantially reducing the size of nuclear stockpiles; eliminating short-ranged nuclear weapons; ratifying the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty; securing all stocks of weapons, weapons-usable plutonium, and highly enriched uranium around the world; getting control of the uranium enrichment process; stopping production of fissile material for nuclear weapons globally; resolving regional confrontations that encourage the development of nuclear weapons.  They conclude:       Reassertion of the vision of a world free of nuclear      weapons and practical measures toward achieving that goal      would be, and would be perceived as, a bold initiative      consistent with America's moral heritage. The effort could      have a profoundly positive impact on the security of future      generations. Without that bold vision, the actions will not      be perceived as fair or urgent. Without the actions, the      vision will not be perceived as realistic or possible.  We should pay close attention to these words.  In conclusion, let me say that there is a big difference between an RRW program that increases the reliability of the existing stockpile and one that leads to a resumption of nuclear testing.  Congress should ask the tough questions to ensure that this is not a back door to new nuclear weapons with new missions and new rounds of testing.  I firmly believe we should zero out for the Reliable Replacement Warhead program until the next administration takes a serious look at our nuclear weapons programs and issues a bipartisan policy on the size of the future stockpile, testing, and nuclear nonproliferation efforts.  I look forward to working with my colleagues and the administration to craft that sensible, bipartisan nuclear weapons policy that will make Americans safe and allow us to reclaim a leadership role in the fight against nuclear proliferation.  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be placed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1914       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
