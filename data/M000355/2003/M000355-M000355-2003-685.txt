 President, I say to my friend from Mississippi, I do not know the exact figure--maybe my staff does--but clearly it has had an impact on the cost to the Federal Government. In addition, these doctors are moving back and forth across State lines seeking a place where they can practice their profession without basically giving away their services.  Kentucky happens to be next to Indiana which adopted standards similar to California some two decades ago. I have met a number of doctors in Louisville and Henderson who are contemplating simply moving across the river to even afford to continue to practice their profession.  At least in two ways it impacts at the Federal level, with interstate movement of doctors seeking a place to go where they can practice their profession, and the direct costs to the Federal Government under Medicare.
