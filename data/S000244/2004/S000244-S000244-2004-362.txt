Speaker, pursuant to the previous order of the House, I call up the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 414) expressing the sense of the Congress that, as Congress recognizes the 50th anniversary of the Brown v. Board of Education decision, all Americans are encouraged to observe this anniversary with a commitment to continuing and building on the legacy of Brown, and ask for its immediate consideration.  The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.  The text of H. Con. Res. 414 is as follows:                            H. Con. Res. 414       Whereas on May 17, 1954, the United States Supreme Court      announced in Brown v. Board of Education (347 U.S. 483) that,      ``in the field of education, the doctrine of `separate but      equal' has no place'';       Whereas the Brown decision overturned the precedent set in      1896 in Plessy v. Ferguson (163 U.S. 537), which had declared      ``separate but equal facilities'' constitutional and allowed      the continued segregation of public schools in the United      States on the basis of race;       Whereas the Brown decision recognized as a matter of law      that the segregation of public schools deprived students of      the equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth      Amendment to the Constitution of the United States;       Whereas the Brown decision stood as a victory for plaintiff      Linda Brown, an African American third grader who had been      denied admission to an all white public school in Topeka,      Kansas;       Whereas the Brown decision stood as a victory for those      plaintiffs similarly situated to Linda Brown in the cases      that were consolidated with Brown, which included Briggs v.      Elliot (103 F. Supp. 920), Davis v. County School Board (103      F. Supp. 337), and Gephardt v. Belton (91 A.2d 137);       Whereas the Brown decision stood as a victory for those      that had successfully dismantled school segregation years      before Brown through legal challenges such as Westminster      School District v. Mendez (161 F.2d 774), which ended      segregation in schools in Orange County, California;       Whereas the Brown decision stands among all civil rights      cases as a symbol of the Federal Government's commitment to      fulfill the promise of equality;       Whereas the Brown decision helped lead to the repeal of      ``Jim Crow'' laws and the elimination of many of the severe      restrictions placed on the freedom of African Americans;       Whereas the Brown decision helped lead to the enactment of      the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination      on the basis of race, religion, or national origin in      workplaces and public establishments that have a connection      to interstate commerce or are supported by the State;       Whereas the Brown decision helped lead to the enactment of      the Voting Rights Act of 1965 which promotes every American's      right to participate in the political process;       Whereas the Brown decision helped lead to the enactment of      the Fair Housing Act of 1968 that prohibits discrimination in      the sale, rental, and financing of dwellings, and in other      housing-relating transactions, on the basis of race, color,      national origin, religion, sex, familial status, or      disability; and       Whereas in 2004, the year marking the 50th anniversary of      the Brown decision, inequalities evidenced at the time of      such decision have not been completely eradicated: Now,      therefore, be it       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate      concurring), That the Congress--       (1) recognizes and celebrates the 50th anniversary of the      Brown v. Board of Education decision;       (2) encourages all Americans to recognize and celebrate the      50th anniversary of the Brown v. Board of Education decision;      and       (3) renews its commitment to continuing and building on the      legacy of Brown with a pledge to acknowledge and address the      modern day disparities that remain.
