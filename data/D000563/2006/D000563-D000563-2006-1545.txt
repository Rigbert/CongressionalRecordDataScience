President, I commend my colleague for raising this important issue which affects every State in the Union. Of our National Guard in Illinois, 80 percent have been deployed overseas, and more this year. At this point, they have come home to empty parking lots where they used to have vehicles and equipment which they trained on and would use at times of national emergency.  We cannot allow this Guard to become a hollow Army. It must be a viable force. I look forward to reviewing the bill the Senator introduced to see if I can join him in this effort to strengthen our Guard nationwide.                                 ______                                       By
