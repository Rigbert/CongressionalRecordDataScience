President, I again thank the distinguished chairman for working very closely with the floor managers on this amendment.  It provides thoughtful clarifications to the establishment of an analytic review unit under the Collins-Lieberman bill. I believe the changes made by this amendment would strengthen the bill. I urge its adoption.
