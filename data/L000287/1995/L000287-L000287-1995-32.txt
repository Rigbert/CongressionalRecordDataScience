Madam Speaker, on Saturday night in Atlanta, Justice was served--served a high fastball he parked in the right field seats.  That was all the help Tom Glavine would need. With one of the greatest pitching performances of all time, the Atlanta Braves won the World Series--they are world champions.  Since day one, the Braves were on a mission--a quest. They dug deep within themselves to find the courage, the raw courage, to win the NL East--to beat the Rockies, the Reds, and, finally, the Cleveland Indians--the second best team in baseball.  The old saying--great pitching beats great hitting--held true. The Braves' pitchers were too much for the Indians. But another old saying did not hold true. Nice guys do not always finish last. Congratulations to the World Champion Atlanta Braves. Go Braves, go Braves, go Braves.        INTRODUCTION OF LEGISLATION TO REINFORCE OUR COMMON BOND  (
