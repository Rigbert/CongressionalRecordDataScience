 President, I ask unanimous consent that my letter dated May 18, 2009, to Medtronic, Inc. be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                      U.S. Senate,                                         Committee on Finance,                                     Washington, DC, May 18, 2009.     Bill Hawkins,     President and Chief Executive Officer, Medtronic, Inc.,          Medtronic Parkway, Minneapolis, MN.       Dear Mr. Hawkins: The United States Senate Committee on      Finance (Committee) has jurisdiction over the Medicare and      Medicaid programs. As a senior member of the United States      Senate and as Ranking Member of the Committee, I have a      special responsibility to protect the health of Medicare and      Medicaid beneficiaries and safeguard taxpayer dollars      authorized by Congress for these programs. This includes the      responsibility to conduct oversight of the health care      industry, including makers of medical devices, which receive      hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars every year for the      care of Americans.       In carrying out this duty, I have been examining the      substantial financial ties between the device industry and      practicing physicians. I have also been examining the safety      and cost of medical devices that are sold to the American      public. As the largest medical device company in the United      States, the practices of Medtronic, Inc. (Medtronic) have a      profound impact on American healthcare.       Last October, I sent you a letter asking Medtronic to      disclose payments to ``all physicians with whom Medtronic has      consulting agreements for Infuse.'' This request was spurred      by an article in the Wall Street     Journal (WSJ), which reported on allegations of financial      incentives provided to doctors that included ``entertainment      at a Memphis strip club, trips to Alaska and patent royalties      on inventions they played no part in.''       With the exception of one individual who is now deceased,      listed below is the financial information documenting all      consultants who received compensation, which Medtronic      provided to me [Attached].       I am concerned that Medtronic did not include Dr. Timothy      Kuklo in response to my written request. It is clear that Dr.      Kuklo had some sort of consulting agreement with Medtronic      and was named as a Medtronic consultant for Infuse in an      article that ran in the New York Times on May 13, 2009. There      is of course the possibility that Dr. Kuklo had a more      general type of consulting agreement with Medtronic that may      have included Infuse, as well as other Medtronic products. In      the future, I hope that instead of not providing me with the      name of the physician involved in Infuse, or any other matter      that I am looking into, that Medtronic contact me to avoid      the situation in which we find ourselves.       In light of the issues set forth above, I would greatly      appreciate Medtronic explaining why Dr. Timothy Kuklo was not      listed in the information provided me earlier.       Thank you in advance for your continued cooperation in this      matter and commitment to transparency. I look forward to      hearing from you by no later than June 1, 2009. All documents      responsive to this request should be sent electronically in      PDF format to [emailÂ protected] If you      have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact Paul      Thacker.           Sincerely,                                              Charles E. Grassley,                                                   Ranking Member.       Attachment. MEDTRONIC INC.
