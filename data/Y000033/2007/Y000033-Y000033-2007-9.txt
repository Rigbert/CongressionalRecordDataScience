I want to thank the ranking member, Mr. Mica, and congratulate him on his good work on this legislation.  This is a good bill. I want to thank Mr. Oberstar and Ms. Johnson for the work that you've done on this bill.  This bill has been passed out of this House approximately three times, two times while I was chairman, and now Mr. Mica and Mr. Oberstar have got the bill to the President's desk. All the previous speakers are not here to beat up the President. I am here to say this bill should be passed; we should override the President's veto because it's right for America.  It is an investment, and we are way behind in this investment. Some have said, well, we started out with a certain amount of money on the House side, the Senate had a certain amount, and we came out with more. Frankly, I think it should be about $40 billion. And I say this from a little bit of experience. We did the same thing in the Highway bill, it should have been $375 billion, not $285 billion, because it is an investment in the future and the infrastructure to provide the economy for this country that creates the jobs and makes us competitive worldwide.  Without this bill, we will lose. Without this bill, we will not be able to achieve those goals. We will not save people's lives. But more than that, the next crisis we will face in this country is our water, the use of our water, the water to be used correctly, for transportation, for recreation and for the good of man.  This bill is right. Let's override the President. Let's do something for America.
