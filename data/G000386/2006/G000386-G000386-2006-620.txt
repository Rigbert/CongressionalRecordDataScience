 President, I appreciate hearing from all my colleagues, both Republicans and Democrats, about everything that is wrong with the AMT because there is a lot wrong with the AMT. But I take great pleasure in trying to remind, particularly my Democrat colleagues, that a Republican-controlled Senate and House in 1998 completely repealed the alternative minimum tax.
