President, Senator Kerry and I are pleased to introduce the ``Fair and Independent Judiciary Act of 2003.'' This legislation arises from our belief that we must remain steadfast in our commitment to preserving the vitality of our third branch of government. Ensuring a fair and independent judiciary is critical to preserving the system of checks and balances established in our Constitution. The Fair and Independent Judiciary Act includes measures to respond to the shortfall in real judicial compensation, to repeal the link of judicial pay to congressional pay, to improve survivorship benefits, and to instill greater public confidence in our courts.  The National Commission on Public Service, a blue-ribbon panel of experts headed by Paul Volcker, recently concluded that Congress' budgetary treatment of this co-equal branch threatens its ability to perform its essential mission. This legislation addresses a problem that the Chief Justice has repeatedly brought to our attention--the decline in real judicial salaries.  As a member of both the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State and the Judiciary, I have worked hard to help preserve a fair and independent judiciary. I was very disappointed that the Continuing Resolutions approved by Congress failed to give the Federal judiciary a cost-of-living adjustment, COLA, for fiscal year 2003.  Earlier this year, Senator Hatch and I were joined by Senator DeWine and Senator Specter to cosponsor legislation in the Senate to provide the Federal judiciary with a COLA for the present fiscal year. House Judiciary Chairman Sensenbrenner was joined by that Committee's Ranking Democratic Member, Congressman Conyers, and others to introduce identical legislation. Congress eventually passed a measure to give the Judiciary their cost of living adjustment for fiscal year 2003 but this effort failed to compensate the judiciary for many other previously skipped COLAs.  The Fair and Independent Judiciary Act would correct the earlier failures to provide COLAs and prevent this situation from happening again.  It is important to put our budgetary treatment of this co-equal branch in historical context. In 1975, Congress enacted the Executive Salary Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act, intended to give judges, Members of Congress and other high-ranking Executive Branch officials automatic COLAs as accorded other Federal employees unless rejected by Congress. In 1981, Congress enacted Section 140 of Public Law 97-92, mandating specific congressional action to give COLAs to judges.  Five times in the last decade Congress failed to provide the Judiciary with a COLA. We believe that this treatment was unfair to the judiciary and that we should restore their salaries to what they would be had the COLAs been granted. In order to have their salaries reflect the current cost of living we should unlink the salaries of Members of Congress and Members of the Judiciary by repealing Section 140.  In their thorough report, the Volcker Commission recommended that Congress unlink judicial salaries from those of Members of Congress. The Commission explained that due to ``the reluctance of members of Congress to risk the disapproval of their constituents . . . Congress has regularly permitted salaries to fall substantially behind cost-of-living increases.'' Urgent Business for America: Revitalizing the Federal Government for the 21st Century, January 2003, Recommendation 10. Therefore, the Commission found that ``executive and judicial salaries must be determined by procedures that tie them to the needs of the government, not the career-related political exigencies of members of Congress.''  The Fair and Independent Judiciary Act would restore the skipped cost of living adjustments that occurred in 1995, 1996, 1997, 1999 and 2002 so that the salaries of our judges and justices are not outpaced by inflation.  Chief Justice Rehnquist has called judicial pay ``the most pressing issue'' facing the courts.  We look forward to Senate consideration of the Fair and Independent Judiciary Act to restore previously skipped cost of living adjustments for the Justices and judges of the United States. We hope we can all work together to preserve the vitality of our third branch of government and to instill even greater confidence in our federal courts.  I ask unanimous consent that the January 6, 2003 editorial from the Washington Post, and the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill and additional material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                         Mr. Rehnquist's Pleas       Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist made two pleas in his      year-end report. Neither is much of a surprise, because on      both judicial salaries and the process by which judges get      nominated and confirmed Mr. Rehnquist has spoken before. Yet      familiarity should not obscure the importance of the      subjects. The chief justice is correct, and the failure year      after year of the political branches to remedy the problems      of which he complains is harmful.       Mr. Rehnquist once again stressed that the need to increase      judicial salaries is ``the most pressing issue'' facing the      courts. There is something demeaning about the chief justice      of the United States having to beg for the same cost-of-     living adjustments for judges that other federal employees      get as a matter of course. Congress's frequent failure in      recent years to increase judicial compensation contravenes      the promise it made in 1989, when it banned judges from      making outside income and promised regular raises in      exchange. Between 1969 and 2000, according to one study, real      salaries for lower-court judges declined by 25 percent. And      while judges got a raise last year, this year's cost-of-     living increase is, Mr. Rehnquist notes, very much in doubt.       The problem is that Congress has irrationally linked      judicial pay to the salaries of members of Congress, who face      a political problem whenever they seek to jack up their own      paychecks. The judges end up hostage to congressional      cowardice. This disparity between their salaries and other      lawyer compensation is enormous and growing. This encourages      judges to leave the bench, and provides a substantial      disincentive for first-rate people to become federal judges      in the first place.       Mr. Rehnquist also gave a timely reminder that the judicial      nominations process needs work. The chief justice is one of      the few people who has advocated for a reasonable process      irrespective of which party controls the presidency or the      Senate. So Mr. Rehnquist speaks with unusual moral authority      on this subject. And while he notes approvingly the 100      judges the 107th Congress confirmed, he warns that the      problem has not gone away. Having unified government may      temporarily ease the vacancy problem, he writes, but `there      will come a time when [unified government] is not the case,      and the judiciary will again suffer the delays of a drawn-out      confirmation process.'' Mr. Rehnquist rightly urged that the      political branches use this respite to ``fix the underlying      problems that have bogged down the . . . process for so many      years.'' On both pay and nominations, one can only wonder how      many more years the chief justice will have to repeat himself      before reason prevails.
