 President, I rise to introduce the Border Tunnel Prevention Act of 2011 with my colleagues and friends, Senator Jon Kyl, Senator Mary Landrieu and Senator Claire McCaskill. This bill will provide law enforcement and prosecutors with important tools to locate border tunnels, identify criminals and punish those involved.  As the U.S., Mexico border has become more secure, criminals have sought out new ways to transfer drugs and people across the border. For years, smugglers have tried to go around our border checkpoints. Now, they are trying to go under them to evade border enforcement. There is an increasing number and sophistication of tunnels along the Southwest border.  Tunnels range from anything from a shallow dirt crawl way to sophisticated concrete structures with shoring, ventilation and electricity. One tunnel found in San Diego even had a makeshift elevator.  Underground tunnels present a serious national security threat. The first tunnel was discovered in May of 1990. However, beginning in 2001, tunnels began to increase dramatically. Between September 2001 and today, an astonishing 125 completed tunnels have been discovered making a total of 137 completed tunnels since 1990.  Border tunnels are most often used to transport narcotics from Mexico to the United States, but assumingly are also used to smuggle weapons and people. Just as tunnels can be used to transport drugs across the border, they could be used to smuggle a terrorist into the United States.  In recent years, there has been a striking increase in the sophistication of these tunnels. To date, authorities have discovered 61 sophisticated tunnels, 37 of which were constructed in California.  In San Diego in February of 2006, I had the occasion to visit a very sophisticated tunnel discovered by the multi- agency San Diego Tunnel Task Force, led by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The Department of Homeland Security has established these tunnel task forces in San Diego, El Paso, Nogales, Yuma and Imperial Valley.  The tunnel was 2,400 feet long, close to half of a mile, stretching from an abandoned warehouse near the southern border of California through to Tijuana, Mexico. It remains the longest cross-border tunnel discovered in U.S. history, more than nine stories below ground at its deepest point, and had ample ventilation and groundwater drainage systems, cement flooring, lighting, and a pulley system.  Authorities seized over 4,200 pounds of marijuana in the tunnel, and have attributed the operation to the Arellano Felix Organization.  The exit of the tunnel in the United States was concealed in a small office inside a massive empty warehouse, covered only by four square tiles.  After seeing this tunnel, I introduced the Border Tunnel Prevention Act of 2006. The bill became law in 2007 and criminalized the construction, financing or use of an unauthorized tunnel or subterranean passage across an international border into the United States. It also imposes a punishment for anyone who negligently permits others to construct or use an unauthorized tunnel or subterranean passage on their land.  The first prosecution under this law was in connection to a December 2009 partially-built tunnel found in Calexico, California. An investigation resulted in the arrest of Daniel Alvarez, a United States citizen. Alvarez eventually pled guilty to criminal violations put into place by the Border Tunnel Prevention Act and was sentenced to 15 months in federal prison.  Today, I am introducing a bill to enhance the 2007 law. Specifically, it will make the use, construction or financing of a border tunnel a conspiracy offense. This would punish the intent to engage in tunnel activity, even in cases where a tunnel was not fully constructed.  The bill will include illegal tunneling as an offense eligible for Title III wiretaps even when there are not drugs or other contraband to facilitate a wiretap; specify border tunnel activity as unlawful under the existing forfeiture and money laundering provisions to allow authorities to seize assets in these cases.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1236       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Border Tunnel Prevention Act      of 2011''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds the following:       (1) As the international border between the United States      and Mexico becomes more secure, trafficking and smuggling      organizations intensify their efforts to enter the United      States by increasing the number of tunnels and other      subterranean passages between Mexico and the United States.       (2) Border tunnels are most often used to transport      narcotics from Mexico to the United States, but can also be      used to transport people and other contraband.       (3) Between May 1990 and May 2011, law enforcement      authorities discovered 137 tunnels, 125 of which have been      discovered since September 2001. While law enforcement      authorities discovered only 2 tunnels in California between      1990 and 2001, there has been a dramatic increase in the      number of border tunnels discovered in California since 2001.       (4) Section 551 of the Department of Homeland Security      Appropriations Act, 2007 (Public Law 109-295) added a new      section to title 18, United States Code (18 U.S.C. 555),      which--       (A) criminalizes the construction or financing of an      unauthorized tunnel or subterranean passage across an      international border into the United States; and       (B) prohibits any person from recklessly permitting others      to construct or use an unauthorized tunnel or subterranean      passage on the person's land.       (5) Any person convicted of using a tunnel or subterranean      passage to smuggle aliens, weapons, drugs, terrorists, or      illegal goods is subject to an enhanced sentence for the      underlying offense. Additional sentence enhancements would      further deter tunnel activities and increase prosecutorial      options.     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.       In this Act:       (1) National security zone.--The term ``national security      zone'' means any Southwest Border land designated by the      Secretary as being at a high risk for border tunnel activity,      as authorized under section 8(b).

(3) Southwest border land.--The term ``Southwest Border      land'' means all parcels of real property in the United      States that--       (A) are located within 1 mile of the international border      between the United States and Mexico; and       (B) are not owned by a Federal, State, tribal, or local      government entity.
