Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to recommit and ask the Members to vote no on this motion.  This motion to recommit proposes an amendment that does not deal with the Bankruptcy Code whatsoever, but amends the truth-in-lending act, as has been described by its proponents.  In most States of this country, including my home State of Wisconsin, the age of majority is 18. When one achieves the age of 18, one is responsible for one's contracts, one can sue and be sued, one can vote, and in many cases can run for and be elected to public office.  What this amendment proposes to say is that in terms of receiving solicitations for credit cards and receiving applications for credit cards, these adults are considered children for 3 more years. What it does is it paints with a broad brush every 18-, 19-, and 20-year-old and says, ``You have to go run to your parents or show independent financial means before you can apply for a credit card.''  So the good kids who would use credit responsibly and learn how to use credit responsibly are not able to get credit cards, just like the bad kids who would use credit irresponsibly.  I would submit to each Member of the House of Representatives that weshould not be tarring kids with this broad brush; we should not be telling 18-, 19-, and 20-year-olds that they are adults for every purpose except just this one.  I think what we should be doing is empowering our young people and giving them the educational tools to make good credit decisions, rather than simply saying, The door is shut for you.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Oxley).
