I will read one sentence out of that letter.       I share your opinion that the understanding reached in 1985      between President Reagan and Senator Byrd cited in your      letter remains a fair and constructive framework which my      Administration will follow.  Once again, what is he following? He is saying, prior to any recess, the White House will inform the majority leader and the minority leader of any recess appointments which might be contemplated during such recess? Would they do so in advance sufficiently to allow leadership on both sides to perhaps take action to fill whatever vacancies might be imperative during such break? He agreed to it.  I have not seen such a document, but I think in anticipation of the recess we are going in, it is my understanding that the President merely sent a list of some 150 nominees he has. Again, I didn't see it. It was never officially received by the majority leader. It was sent back to the White House.  If he thinks this is a loophole in the commitment he made, it certainly is not a loophole.  Anticipating that this President--who quite often does things he doesn't say he is going to do and who quite often says things that aren't true--is going to in fact have recess appointments, we wrote a letter. It is not just on my letterhead signed by me, but also I believe there are 16 other Senators saying that if you make recess appointments during the upcoming recess, which violates the spirit of your agreement, we will respond by placing holds on all judicial nominees.       The result would be a complete breakdown in cooperation      between our two branches of government on this issue which      could prevent the confirmation of any such nominees next      year.  I want to make sure there is no misunderstanding and that we don't go into a recess with the President not understanding that we are very serious about that. It is not just me putting a hold on all judicial nominees for the remaining year of his term of service, but 16 other Senators have agreed to do that.  It would be very easy for the President to just go ahead and comply with that agreement he has in his letter of June 15, 1999, rather than feeling compelled to make judicial appointments during this recess.  I want to serve notice to make it very clear.  I received a letter from the President. He did not honor me with a personal letter. It came from John Podesta, Chief of Staff to the President. Without reading the whole letter, because it is rather lengthy, it says that they might not comply with this.  I want to make sure it is abundantly clear without any doubt in anyone's mind in the White House--I will refer back to this document I am talking about right now--that in the event the President makes recess appointments, we will put holds on all judicial nominations for the remainder of his term. It is very fair for me to stand here and eliminate any doubt in the President's mind of what we will do.                               Exhibit I                                                      U.S. Senate,                                Office of the Majority Leader,                                    Washington, DC, June 10, 1999.     Hon. William Jefferson Clinton,     The White House, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. President: I appreciate our conversation this      morning, and our mutual desire to come to an understanding      about recess appointments. We have often worked together to      help promote the smooth operation of the government, and I      believe that we can once again come to an agreement.       As you know, the recent recess appointment of the U.S.      Ambassador to Luxembourg has caused great concern to many      members of the Senate. I believe that it would be      constructive for us to reach an understanding in principle on      how we will now proceed to ensure that we avoid similar      sparring between the Executive Branch and the Senate in the      future.       I agree that we will use the understanding reached between      President Reagan and Senator Byrd in 1985, cited by your      Chief of Staff today. That understanding, described in the      Congressional Record of October 18, 1985, states ``. . .      prior to any recess breaks, the White House would inform the      Majority Leader and [the Minority Leader] of any recess      appointment which might be contemplated during such recess.      They would do so in advance sufficiently to allow the      leadership on both sides to perhaps take action to fill      whatever vacancies that might be imperative during such a      break.''       I believe that this is both a reasonable and a constructive      framework. Following this precedent will help us to proceed      in a cooperative and expeditious manner on future nominees.       Mr. President, I appreciate your stated desire to work with      me on this issue, and I look forward to hearing from you      soon.           Sincerely,     Trent Lott.                                  ____                                              The White House,                                        Washington, June 15, 1999.     Hon. Trent Lott,     Majority Leader,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Leader: I was pleased to learn from your letter of      June 10 that you agree with my Chief of staff on the matter      of recess appointments. As Mr. Podesta indicated in his      letter to you, my Administration has made it a practice to      notify Senate leaders in advance of our intentions in this      regard, and this precedent will continue to be observed.       I share your opinion that the understanding reached in 1985      between President Reagan and Senator Byrd cited in your      letter remains a fair and constructive framework, which my      Administration will follow. I also appreciate your view that      our nominees merit expeditious consideration through      bipartisan cooperation among Senators; I sincerely hope that      this spirit will prevail in the days to come.           Sincerely,     Bill Clinton.                                  ____                                                  U.S. Senate,                                Washington, DC, November 10, 1999.     The President,     The White House, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. President: We write to urge your compliance with      the spirit of our recent agreement regarding recess      appointments and to inform you that there will be serious      consequences if you act otherwise.       If you do make recess appointments during the upcoming      recess which violate the spirit of our agreement, then we      will respond by placing holds on all judicial nominees. The      result would be a complete breakdown in cooperation between      our two branches of government on this issue which could      prevent the confirmation of any such nominees next year.       We do not want this to happen. We urge you to cooperate in      good faith with the Majority Leader concerning all      contemplated recess appointments.           Sincerely,         Jesse Helms, Wayne Allard, Michael Crapo, Michael B.            Enzi, Bob Smith, George Voinovich, Pete B. Domenici,            James M. Inhofe, Phil Gramm, Mitch McConnell, Craig            Thomas, Rod Grams, Tim Hutchinson, Conrad Burns, Chuck            Grassley, Richard Shelby.                                  ____                                              The White House,                                    Washington, November 12, 1999.     Senator James Inhofe,     Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Inhofe: Thank you for your recent letter of      November 10, 1999 on the need for cooperation between the      Legislative and Executive branches and the President's right      to recess appoint as defined by the Constitution.       We appreciate and thank the Senate, especially the Majority      and Minority Leaders, for the 84 confirmations from Wednesday      November 10, which includes eight republican nominees      recommended by the Majority Leader. These confirmations      reduce the number of nominees awaiting confirmation to 153      for this year. While nominees wait an average of six months      to be confirmed, we thank you for confirming 62% of nominees      this year.       We look forward to working with you on the 153 remaining      nominees and new nominations this session and next session.      They are important to the public, because they include      nominations critical to the safety of our citizens and the      integrity of our criminal justice system (US Marshals, US      Attorneys and judges).       Compared with previous administrations, the President has      used his authority to make recess appointments infrequently.      President Reagan made 239 recess appointments. During      President Bush's four-year term, 78 persons were recess      appointed. We have made only 59 in 7 years, fewer than      President Bush in four years. Several of our recess      appointees have been republican nominees, done with the      cooperation of the Senate leadership.       Because of the importance of filling these positions and      pursuant to an agreement with the Majority Leader, we      continue to notify the Majority and Minority Leaders of any      effort the President may make a appoint temporarily a person      into a vacancy, while awaiting confirmation by the Senate.       We will continue to meet with the Majority Leader's Office      to accomplish our goal of confirming and appointing these      nominees. We want to cultivate a cooperative relationship      with you, and ask for your continued help in expeditiously      confirming nominees so important to the US public.           Sincerely,                                                     John Podesta,                                  Chief of Staff to the President.
