President, my wife Marcelle and I have been privileged to know Bill and Dorothy McSweeny during the time I have been in the Senate.  During my conversations with them, I have especially appreciated their sense of history. When Mr. McSweeny writes an op-ed piece, based on his knowledge and experience, I think we should pay special attention.  Recently, he wrote one for the Washington Post. Nothing I could say would add to the value of this fine statement, so I ask unanimous consent it be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, Aug. 18, 2004]                      No Debating a Sense of Duty                         (By William McSweeny)       I am from that generation of younger brothers who just      missed World War II and went to war against communism in      Korea in 1950. Many of us became fathers to those who fought      in Vietnam and grandfathers to those fighting in Iraq.       I would not presume to speak for a whole generation, but as      a veteran of that combat, I say it is time to tell both      presidential campaigns to cease their macho posturing and get      on with real programs to run--or save--our country.       In our long-ago time, we went to war reluctantly against an      unknown enemy in an unknown land.       But, we went.       The conditions were harsh. The fighting--pre-instant TV--     was ferocious at the front and mostly unseen at home. When we      came back, no one particularly cared, and only one film      (``Pork Chop Hill'') and a handful of books remain to mark      our passing.       That and a free South Korea.       We weren't noticeably upset at men who deferred service and      went to college (except those who stole our girls). We didn't      come home with rows of medals--although many of us came home      with injuries that still warn us of changes in the weather.      We didn't do any complaining. We just came home and got on      with our lives.       Why did we go? Why did we allow our young bodies and our      young psyches to be subjected to a war so forgotten that even      today it has not been mentioned by either candidate, both of      whom failed to notice the anniversary of its June beginning      and July ending?       I believe it was because we knew that we should. Some of us      enlisted as regular Army infantry privates and later became      combat officers because other men of the ``greatest      generation'' had done it and we should too. It is a young      man's reaction to a sense of responsibility and duty, done      without much forethought.       That, I believe, is the key ingredient in John Kerry's      service in Vietnam--and why both campaigns should drop this      contrived issue.       He did not have to go--because he had been. His tour on a      destroyer was overseas time enough. But he went to the boats      because other young men were there. The men and the boats had      a mission--and he commanded, because he could. That is enough      for me. I couldn't care less whether he received a medal. The      rest of it is frosting. There is no honor in this debate for      our country. We need to know whether a man can save the      economy and slow terrorism, not listen to harangues about who      was a shooter and who was a dodger.       Most of the real heroics are performed by young kids and      young officers who just accept it as a cost of doing business      in the peculiar exchange that is a combat battleground. The      whole place--and it does not matter which war we describe--is      one of fear, noise, smoke, confusion and a strange      comradeship where you might risk your life for someone you      will never see again. I don't know what the expression is in      the Navy, but the Army's bittersweet joke is that the two      most dangerous words in the English language are ``follow      me.'' It takes courage to utter those words and to follow      that command--something any veteran of any combat will      recognize.       It is time for some of us older veterans to take one last      stand and call on both parties to drop this base and      meaningless debate. At the end of the day, and the end of the      battle, medals are just symbols. And the bravery of thousands      of our soldiers has passed into history unheralded by stars      and ribbons. By engaging in mudslinging over this issue, both      campaigns undermine the bravery and honor of all who serve in      times of war and peace. And they distract us from the real      issues of this election.       John Kerry heard the siren song of his moment--that fragile      call on the wind that is the call to the colors. He went. He      came back. I give him credit for that. If he threw some      ribbons over the fence, he's welcome to mine. They lie      quietly in a desk drawer, entombed with memories of better      men who lie in the dirt of faraway fields, where there really      is no glory, but where courage and compassion came with the      C-rations.       They believed ours was a great country, one that fought not      for conquest or for gain but because freedom isn't free and      someone has to pay for it. The bill comes due again in this      election. Let's hope these two candidates don't leave us      paupers.                          ____________________
