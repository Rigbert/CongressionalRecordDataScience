  Mr. President, I begin my comments by rebutting some of the points made by colleagues on the other side of the Brad Smith nomination. One of the quotes used against Professor Smith out of context was that he said:       The most sensible reform is the repeal of the Federal      Election Campaign Act.  Using this quotation to imply that Professor Smith would repeal the FECA exemplifies the meritless arguments being used to block the nomination of the most qualified FEC nominee in the history of the Federal Election Commission.  When this statement is read in context and the ellipsis are removed, it is clear that Professor Smith is only talking about the contribution limits in the Federal Election Campaign Act. On that point he is in pretty good company: Chief Justice Warren Burger and Justice Hugo Black also held that view. Justices Scalia and Thomas hold that view. Professor George Priest of the Yale Law School, Professor John Lott of Yale Law School, Dean Kathleen Sullivan at Stanford Law School, Dean Nelson Polsby at George Mason Law School, and former Solicitor General and Justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Court and now Harvard law professor, Charles Fried, have all espoused this view on campaign contribution limits.  I assume all of them would by that argument be barred from serving on the Federal Election Commission. Of course, they would not be barred from serving on the Federal Election Commission, and neither should Professor Smith.  In holding this view, Mr. Smith is no more in disagreement with the law than the Brennan Center and Common Cause, Professor Neuborne, and others who think the law should allow expenditure limits. These people at the Brennan Center and Common Cause advocate a position contrary to the law as declared by the Supreme Court in Buckley and affirmed in Shrink PAC. Under the standard being applied to Mr. Smith, all of them are barred also from serving on the FEC. Clearly, that would be an absurd result.  The Democratic nominee before the Senate, Mr. McDonald, disagrees even more sharply with the Supreme Court than Professor Smith. In open and recorded meetings of the FEC on August 11, 1994, in response to a recitation of election laws interpreted by the Supreme Court, Mr. McDonald declared: The Court just didn't get it.  He doesn't care what the courts say. Clearly, we can't confirm him if disagreement with the law disqualifies an FEC nominee. If there is anyone who has displayed contempt for the law, it is Danny McDonald, not Brad Smith.  Mr. Smith has acknowledged that his view that there should be no contribution limits is no more the law than is the view of the Brennan Center and Common Cause and some of my colleagues that there should be expenditure limits. Moreover, he has made clear he would have no problem enforcing contribution limits.  When asked if he would pledge to uphold his oath, he said he would proudly and without reservation take that oath, and everyone who knows him, including Dan Lowenstein, former national board member of Common Cause, has no doubt that Brad Smith will faithfully enforce the laws written by Congress and interpreted by the courts.  Professor Smith's detractors fail to note that he has made clear in his testimony before the Rules Committee that if the Shrink Missouri case had been a Federal case and come before the FEC for an enforcement action, he would have had no problem voting for enforcement action in that kind of case.  So the notion that Smith ignored Shrink PAC in his testimony is completely unfounded. I refer my colleagues to page 40 of the Rules Committee Hearing Report dated March 8 of this year. Opponents argue Professor Smith says problems with election law have been ``exacerbated or created by the Federal Election Campaign Act'' as interpreted by the courts.  So what? Supreme Court Justices have expressed concern that the Federal Election Campaign Act as interpreted by the courts has had unintended consequences which have exacerbated or created problems with our campaign finance system. The Supreme Court Justices have said that. In Shrink PAC, Justice Kennedy opined: It is the Court's duty to face up to adverse, unintended consequences flowing from our prior decisions.  He goes on to assert, FECA and cases interpreting it have ``forced a substantial amount of political speech underground.'' Noting the problems created by the Federal Election Campaign Act, Justice Kennedy explained that under existing law ``issue advocacy, like soft money, is unrestricted--see Buckley at 42 to 44--while straightforward speech in the form of financial contributions paid to a candidate, speech subject to full disclosure and prompt evaluation by the public, is not * * * This mocks the First Amendment. Our First Amendment principles surely says that an interest thought to be the compelling reason for enacting a law is cast into grave doubt when a worse evil surfaces than the law's actual operation.  In my view, that system creates dangers greater than the one it has replaced.  So, I guess this passage would disqualify Justice Kennedy of the Supreme Court from serving on the Federal Election Commission. So, are we to punish Professor Smith for telling the truth? Professor Burt Neuborne of the Brennan Center has written that at least three extremely unfortunate consequences flow from Buckley.  Neuborne also writes that:       Reformers overstate the level of downright dishonesty      existing in our political culture; furtherer deepening public      cynicism.  Then is Professor Neuborne prohibited from serving on FEC? We all know that many of the problems with the current system are caused by excessively low contribution limits. President Clinton, other Democrats, and many people from my own party have publicly acknowledged this reality and the need for raising hard money limits. So I guess all of those folks would also be disqualified from serving on the FEC.  Professor Smith is opposed also because he has written that the Federal election law is profoundly undemocratic and profoundly at odds with the first amendment.  It has been said that Professor Smith is unfit for the FEC because he believes that the Federal election law is profoundly at odds with the first amendment. Quoting his 1995 policy study from Cato Institute:  Here is the Supreme Court in Buckley. Justice Brennan, in fact, who is known to have written the opinion:       The Supreme Court's decisions in Mills v. Alabama and Miami      Herald Publishing v. Tornillo held that legislative      restrictions on advocacy of the election and defeat of      political candidates are wholly at odds with the first      amendment.  So, now we are keeping Professor Smith off the FEC, it is argued, for quoting from the majority opinion in the Buckley case? From quoting from the majority opinion in the Buckley case? Before reformers began attacking Justice Brennan for authoring this quotation that Mr. Smith has cited, let me note that Justice Brennan's observation has been borne out by the fact that provisions of FECA are still being declared unconstitutional as recently as the first week of May, when the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals declared unconstitutional the party-coordinated expenditure limits.  It is worth noting this was in a 1996 case on remand from the Supreme Court, a case known as Colorado Republican, in which the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional the partyindependent expenditure limits in the Federal Election Campaign Act, despite reformer assertions that they were undoubtedly constitutional.  So, it is simply absurd to attack Professor Smith for quoting from a majority opinion in a Supreme Court case. But that is what Professor Smith's detractors are doing. They are saying he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court--in this case the Federal Election Commission--because he quotes majority opinions that are binding laws and factually correct statements of how FECA has been treated by the courts.  I might also note that efforts to paint this quotation as an absolute statement of his views on the entire Federal Election Campaign Act also lack any merit. If one reads the article in which Bradley Smith recites this quotation by the Court, he makes clear that he supports many aspects of the Federal Election Campaign Act, including the statute's disclosure provisions. Arguments being asserted against Professor Smith are, at best, half truths constructred by reform groups, but many simply misstate Smith's position and reformers and their allies at the New York Times and the Washington Post persist in advancing these specious arguments, even after they have been shown to lack any merit whatsoever.  It seems that Professor Smith's detractors will say anything to get what they want without any regard for either facts or logic.  I also note even the intellectual leader of the reform movement, Burt Neuborne, has written that:       The arguments against regulation are powerful and must be      respected.  Professor Smith's opponents conclude he should not be confirmed because he has said:       People should be allowed to spend whatever they want on      politics.  Well, so what? Under current law, people can spend whatever they want in the form of independent expenditures. Parties can spend whatever they want in the form of independent expenditures and coordinated expenditures. Wealthy candidates such as Jon Corzine in New Jersey can spend whatever they want from their personal fortunes. Moreover, this statement clearly refers to expenditure limits. Since Buckley, the Supreme Court has consistently held expenditure limits unconstitutional. Although so-called reformers wish this were not the law, it is the law. So, again, we are punishing Professor Smith for stating what the law is, not what the reformers would like it to be.  I would also like to note that Burt Neuborne of the Brennan Center agrees with Brad Smith that contribution and spending limits have undemocratic effects. Neuborne has written:       Contribution and spending limits and unfair allocation of      public subsidies freeze the political status quo, providing      unfair advantage to incumbents.  Even the Brennan Center acknowledges that disagreement over Buckley does not disqualify a person from interpreting Buckley. The Brennan Center has come under fire for its book ``Buckley Stops Here,'' and its views that the current Federal Election Campaign Act is flawed. I wonder if my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would vote against the executive director of the Brennan Center or the legal director of the Brennan Center who have criticized the current campaign finance law and the Supreme Court's decision in Buckley? The Brennan Center has committed blasphemy, equal to that of Professor Smith, by actually criticizing the reformers.  For example, Burt Neuborne, the Brennan Center's legal director, has stated:       Reformers overstate the level of downright dishonesty      existing in our political culture, further deepening public      cynicism.  Moreover, Neuborne has written that:       Contribution and spending limits freeze the political      status quo by providing unfair advantages to incumbents.  Neuborne has gone after the Holy Grail here. He has actually criticized Congress and the Federal Election Campaign Act. Would those who oppose Brad Smith also oppose the Brennan Center?  I would hope not. In fact, the Brennan Center's own web page acknowledges that this type of reasoning is invalid. Let me quote the Brennan Center regarding disagreements over Buckley and the Federal Election Campaign Act:       The fact that a person believes that the Court should      revise its constitutional rulings does not mean that either      side disrespects the law or is disqualified from interpreting      Buckley. Moreover, there is no direct correlation between      attitudes towards Buckley and constitutional analysis of      proposed campaign finance reforms.  One of the most troubling solutions asserted during this confirmation debate is that if a nominee has personally questioned the law of Congress, then somehow that nominee is disqualified from government service. Implementing these new type of litmus tests for government service seems shortsighted and ill advised, to put it mildly. Certainly most Members of Congress would be disqualified from future service in the executive or judicial branch under this new test, since nearly everyday we question the wisdom of our laws and regularly vote in opposition to various laws.  This new litmus test barring government service for those who question the law would clearly exclude many fine and capable men and women. For example, it is not uncommon for Federal judges to personally disagree with Congress' efforts to establish mandatory minimum sentences or uniform sentences through the use of the Federal sentencing guidelines. Judge Jose Cabranes, of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, is a widely respected legal scholar who has been mentioned by both Democrats and Republicans as a possible Supreme Court nominee.  Judge Cabranes, however, has been a frequent and outspoken critic of the law he follows every day. He has written a book and law review articles arguing that current Federal sentencing laws and guidelines are ill conceived and ``born of a naive commitment to the ideal of rationality.'' Judge Cabranes has stated:       The utopian experiment known as the U.S. Sentencing      Guidelines is a failure. . ..  Moreover, the respected Judge Cabranes disagrees with what has been popularly referred to as reform. Specifically, the judge explains that the sentencing reformers' ``fixation on reducing sentencing disparity. . .has been a mistake of tragic proportions. . ..[T]he ideal [of equal treatment] cannot be, and should not be, pursued through complex, mandatory guidelines. We reject the premise of [the] reformers. . ..''  Does this mean Judge Cabranes is unfit to be a Federal judge because he does not personally agree with the sentencing law he must follow every day from the bench? Is Judge Cabranes, who is an otherwise widely respected judge, unfit to serve because he disagrees with the reformers, the wisdom of Congress, and the sentencing laws? Of course not.  Let's look to the Supreme Court for a moment on the specific issue of campaign finance law where reasonable people have and do disagree.  In the landmark case of Buckley v. Valeo, the Court had the difficult task of harmonizing the Federal Election Campaign Act with the First Amendment to the Constitution. Ultimately, the Court's decision in Buckley established what has been the law of the land now for the past quarter-century. I think it is worth noting, however, that every Supreme Court Justice sitting in that case disagreed with the law Congress had passed.  Several of these renowned Justices even questioned the law that was ultimately established by the Court's interpretation in Buckley. For example, Justice Thurgood Marshall dissented in part. Justice Blackmun dissented in part. Justice White, Chief Justice Burger, and the current Chief Justice Rehnquist--all of these jurists disagreed with both the law Congress passed and the law the Court created through its interpretation in Buckley.  Several years after Buckley, Justice Marshall continued to question the law established in Buckley. Does that mean the Senate would have denied Justice Thurgood Marshall a seat on the FEC if he had desired such a seat? Would Justice Marshall be unfit to serve a fixed term on a bipartisan commission?  What about Chief Justice Burger who argued Congress did not have the power to limit contributions, require disclosure of small contributions, or publicly finance Presidential campaigns? If theChief Justice had wanted a seat on the FEC, would the Senate have rejected Chief Justice Burger as unfit to serve? After all, Chief Justice Burger's opinion is in contrast with that of the New York Times. Would Chief Justice Burger have been unfit to serve a fixed term on a bipartisan commission?  What about my fellow colleagues who question the Court's decision in Buckley? The junior Senator from California, for example, said on the floor of the Senate only a few months ago:       I am one of these people who believe the Supreme Court      ought to take another look at Buckley v. Valeo because I      think it is off the wall.  Would my colleagues on the other side of the aisle oppose the junior Senator from California if she retired from the Senate and wanted to become an FEC Commissioner? After all, she disagrees with the law and with the Court's decision in Buckley. Would she be unfit to serve?  What about noted scholars such as Joel Gora, the associate dean of the Brooklyn Law School, who has criticized the Federal Election Campaign Act? Or Ira Glasser of the American Civil Liberties Union? Both Gora and Glasser were lawyers in the original Buckley case. Or Kathleen Sullivan, the dean of the Stanford Law School? Or Lillian BeVier of the University of Virginia Law School? Or Professor Larry Sabato of the University of Virginia and a former member of the 1990 Senate Campaign Finance Reform Panel named by Majority Leader George Mitchell? Would these respected scholars, who question the law and share many of Professor Smith's election law views, be disqualified from Government service at the FEC?  Professor Smith's sin, in the eyes of the reform industry, is twofold: One, he understands the constitutional limitations on the Government's ability to regulate political speech, and, two, he has personally advocated reform that is different from the approach favored by the New York Times.  Let me say loudly and clearly, I believe that neither an appreciation for the first amendment nor disagreement with the New York Times and Common Cause should disqualify an election law expert for service on the Federal Election Commission.  As the numerous letters that have been flooding to me at the committee establish, Professor Smith's views are well within the mainstream of constitutional jurisprudence and commend, not disqualify, him for Government service at the FEC. Personally, I think Professor Smith's views would be a breath of fresh air at a Commission whose actions have all too frequently been struck down as unconstitutional by the courts.  Let me point out that the world of campaign finance is generally divided into two camps of reasonable people who disagree with the Supreme Court's interpretation of the First Amendment in Buckley. One camp prefers more regulation; another camp prefers less regulation. Neither camp is perfectly happy with the current state of the law.  One camp is made up of the New York Times, Common Cause, the Brennan Center, and scholars such as Professors Ronald Dworkin, Daniel Lowenstein, and Burt Neuborne. I might add that reformers Neuborne and Lowenstein have both written strong letters in support of Brad Smith's scholarship and writings on campaign finance.  The other camp is occupied by citizen groups ranging from the ACLU to the National Right to Life Committee, and scholars such as Dean Kathleen Sullivan, and Professors Joel Gora, Lillian BeVier, and Larry Sabato. It is probably fair to say Danny McDonald is in one camp and Brad Smith is in the other. I definitely agree with one camp more than I do the other, but I do not think agreement with either camp makes a person a lawless radical or a wild-eyed fanatic. And, I certainly do not think membership in either camp should disqualify a bright, intelligent, ethical election law expert from service on a bipartisan Federal Election Commission.  Finally, and most importantly, the overwhelming letters of support for Brad Smith and his unequivocal testimony before the Rules Committee convince me without a doubt that Brad Smith understands that the role of an FEC Commissioner is to enforce the law as written and not to remake the law in his own image.  As I mentioned earlier, critics who have philosophical differences with Professor Smith should heed the words of Professor Daniel Kobil, a former board member of Common Cause. This is what he had to say:       I believe that much of the opposition--  Referring to Professor Smith--     is based not on what Brad has written or said about campaign      finance regulations, but on crude caricatures of his ideas. .      . . Although I do not agree with all of Brad's views on      campaign finance regulations, I believe that his scholarly      critique of these laws is cogent and largely within the      mainstream of current constitutional thought. . . . I am      confident that he will fairly administer the laws he is      charged with enforcing. . . .  Let me add the sentiments of Professor Daniel Lowenstein of UCLA Law School, also a former board member of Common Cause. This is what he had to say:       Smith possesses integrity and vigorous intelligence that      should make him an excellent commissioner. He will understand      that his job is to enforce the law, even when he does not      agree with it.  Let me say a few words about the Democrats' nominee to the FEC, Commissioner Danny McDonald. First, the obvious: McDonald and I are in different campaign finance reform camps. If I followed the new litmus test that is being put forth by some in this confirmation debate, then I would have no choice but to vigorously oppose his nomination.  I have serious questions about McDonald's 18-year track record at the FEC. Commissioner McDonald's views and actions have been soundly rejected by the Federal courts in dozens of cases.  One of these cases, decided earlier this year, Virginia Society for Human Life v. FEC, resulted in a nationwide injunction against an FEC regulation that Commissioner McDonald has endorsed for years.  Let me point out that this McDonald-endorsed regulation had already been struck down by several other Federal courts. Yet McDonald has continued to defy the Federal court rulings and stubbornly refuses to support changing the regulation. Two other cases, FEC v. Christian Action Network and FEC v. Political Contributions Data, Inc. resulted in the U.S. Treasury paying fines because the action taken by McDonald and the FEC was ``not substantially justified in law or fact.''  Just last Friday, the Tenth Circuit struck down yet another FEC enforcement action as unconstitutional.  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a list of a dozen cases where the Federal courts have rejected the actions of McDonald and the FEC as unconstitutional.  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:       Commissioner Mcdonald's views have been soundly rejected by      the federal courts in dozens of cases. The following twelve      cases are examples of the court's rejection of Mcdonald's      views as unconstitutional.       One of these cases, decided earlier this year, Virginia      Society for Human Life v. FEC, resulted in a nationwide      injunction against an FEC regulation that Commissioner      Mcdonald has endorsed for years--in refinance of several      court rulings declaring it unconstitutional.       Two of these cases, FEC v. Christian Action Network and FEC      v. Political Contributions Data, Inc. resulted in the U.S.      Treasury paying fines because the action taken by Mcdonald      and the FEC was ``not substantially justified in law or      fact.''        1.

The list certainly does not contain all the cases where McDonald's views have been rejected by the Federal courts, but it should give Members on both sides of the aisle a sense for which nominee is truly out of step with the law, the courts, and the Constitution.  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a copy of a letter from a first amendment lawyer, Manuel Klausner, who has been honored with the Lawyer of the Year award for the Los Angeles Bar Association. Mr. Klausner details serious concerns about Commissioner McDonald's voting record at the FEC.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                            Law Offices of Manuel S. Klausner,                               Los Angeles, CA, February 29, 2000.     Senator Mitch McConnell,     Chairman, United States Senate Committee on Rules and          Administration, Senate Russell Bldg., Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: I am an attorney in Los Angeles,      and my practice emphasizes First Amendment, election law and      civil rights litigation. By way of background, I am a      founding editor of REASON Magazine and a trustee of the      Reason Foundation. I serve as general counsel to the      Individual Rights Foundation. This letter is written on my      own behalf, and is not intended to reflect the views of      Reason Foundation or the Individual Rights Foundation.       I was formerly a member of the faculty of the University of      Chicago Law School and am a past recipient of the Lawyer-of-     the-Year Award from the Constitutional Rights Foundation and      the Los Angeles Bar Association. I have written and spoken on      First Amendment and election law issues at law schools and      conferences in the United States and Europe.       As an attorney well versed in the First Amendment, I am      writing to urge you to reject the nomination of Danny Lee      McDonald to the Federal Election Commission.       As you well know, for many years the FEC has sought to      expand the scope of its jurisdiction beyond the limitations      the First Amendment places on the agency's authority to      regulate political speech. This has resulted in the FEC      having the worst litigation record of any major government      agency. It has also resulted in many citizens and citizen      groups being needlessly persecuted for exercising their First      Amendment rights. Some have blamed an overzealous general      counsel for the FEC's long history of contempt for the First      Amendment. But it must be remembered that, under the FECA,      the general counsel cannot pursue litigation that      impermissible chills free speech--unless commissioners      such as Danny Lee McDonald vote to adopt and enforce      unconstitutional regulations.       Commissioner McDonald's disregard for the rule of law in      our constitutional system of government is illustrated by his      role in the FEC's ongoing efforts to expand the definition of      express advocacy. In Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 44 (1976),      the Supreme Court ruled that the FECA could be applied      consistent with the First Amendment only if it were limited      to expenditures for communications that include words which,      in and of themselves, advocate the election or defeat of a      candidate. This clear categorical limit served a fundamental      purpose: It provided a way for people wishing to engage in      open and robust discussion of public issues to know ex ante      whether their speech was of a nature such that it had to      comply with the regulatory regime established by the FECA.      The Court did not want people to have their core First      Amendment right to engage in discussion of public issues      (even those intimately tied to public officials) burdened by      the apprehension that, at some time in the future, their      speech might be interpreted by the government as advocating      the election of a particular candidate. Ten years after      Buckley, in FEC v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc., 479      U.S. 238 (1986), the Court reaffirmed the objective, bright-     line express advocacy standard.       Despite these clear,unequivocal precedents from the Supreme      Court regarding the bright-line, prophylactic standard for      express advocacy, it is my view that Commissioner McDonald      has flouted the rule of law. He has consistently supported      FEC enforcement actions and regulations that seek to      establish a broad, vague and subjective standard for express      advocacy. In doing so, Commissioner McDonald seeks to create      exactly the type of apprehension among speakers that the      First Amendment (as interpreted by the Supreme Court)      prohibits.       After the 1992 presidential election, Commissioner McDonald      voted to pursue an enforcement action against the Christian      Action Newtwork (CAN) for issue ads it ran concerning      Governor Bill Clinton's views on family values. McDonald      supported the suit against CAN despite the fact that the      General Counsel conceded that CAN's advertisement ``did not      employ `explicit words,' `express words' or `language'      advocating the election or defeat of a particular candidate      for public office.'' FEC v. Christian Action Network, 110      F.3d 1049, 1050 (4th Cir. 1997). McDonald voted for the case      to proceed on the theory that the ad constituted express      advocacy--not because of any express calls to action used in      it, but rather because of ``the superimposition of selected      imagery, film footage, and music, over the non-prescriptive      background language.'' Id. This was basically an effort to      blur the objective standard for express advocacy into a      vague, subjective ``totality of the circumstances'' test.       The United States District Court for the Western District      of Virginia dismissed the FEC's complaint against CAN on the      grounds that it did not state a well-founded legal claim. FEC      v. Christian Action Network, 894 F. Supp. 946, 948 (1995).      This was because the agencies's subjective theory of express      advocacy was completely contrary to the bright-line standard      articulated in Buckley and MCFL. Id. After this stern rebuff      by the district court, Commissioner McDonald voted to appeal      the case to the United States Fourth Circuit Court of      Appeals. The Circuit Court summarily affirmed in a per curiam      opinion. FEC v. Christian Action Network, 92 F.3d 1178 (4th      Cir. 1996).       The Christian Action Network subsequently asked the court      to order the FEC to pay the expenses it had incurred in      defending against the FEC's baseless lawsuit. The Fourth      Circuit ruled in CAN's favor, explaining that:       ``In the face of unequivocal Supreme Court and other      authority discussed, an argument such as that made by the FEC      in this case, that `no words of advocacy are necessary to      expressly advocate the election of a candidate,' simply      cannot be advanced in good faith (as disingenuousness in the      FEC's submissions attests), much less with `substantial      justification.' ''       Commissioner McDonald's vote to authorize the CAN      litigation was unfortunate, because taxpayers ended up      footing the bill for CAN's defense of meritless litigation.      His vote was particularly disturbing, because the CAN case      was not the last time Commissioner McDonald voted to pursue      litigation based on an impermissibly broad and subjective      definition of express advocacy. See, e.g., FEC v. Freedom's      Heritage Forum, No. 3:98CV-549-S (W.D. Ky September 29,      1999). Sadly the CAN litigation did not cause Commissioner      McDonald to question his broad and subjective theory of      express advocacy. While the CAN case was being litigated,      Commissioner McDonald voted to enact a regulation that      defines express advocacy in exactly the same broad and      subjective terms that the courts have rejected. And despite      this regulation being declared unconstitutional on several      occasions, see, e.g., Maine Right to Life Committee v. FEC,      98 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 1996), Commissioner McDonald has      repeatedly voted against amending the agency's definition of      express advocacy to comply with the law as declared by the      courts of the United States. Earlier this year, the United      States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia      issued a nationwide injunction against the FEC's enforcement      of the broad and subjective definition of express advocacy      that Commissioner McDonald has consistently supported.      Virginia Society for Human Life, Inc. v. FEC, No.      3:99CV559 (E.D. Va. Jan. 4, 2000). Nevertheless, just a      few weeks ago, Commissioner McDonald voted against      reconsidering the agency's definition of express advocacy.       It must be noted that Commissioner McDonald cannot      reasonably assert that his support for a broad and subjective      definition of express advocacy is grounded in the Ninth      Circuit's decision in FEC v. Furgatch, 807 F.2d 857 (9th Cir.      1987). As more than one court has made clear, Furgatch is an      inherently suspect decision because it does not discuss or      even mention the Supreme Court's ruling in MCFL, which was      decided a month before Furgatch. But, even to the extent      Furgatch is good law, the broad definition of express      advocacy that Commissioner McDonald consistently supports      goes beyond what even the Furgatch court permitted. The      Fourth Circuit has aptly summarized the discrepancy between      the broad FEC regulation defining express advocacy (which      Commissioner McDonald voted to approve) and the loose      definition used in Furgatch:       ``It is plain that the FEC has simply selected certain      words or phrases from Furgatch that give the FEC the broadest      possible authority to regulate political speech * * * and      ignored those portions of Furgatch * * * which focus on the      words and text of the message.''       Moreover, the FEC itself has acknowledged that its broad      definition of express advocacy is not fully supported by      Furgatch. In its brief in opposition to Supreme Court review      of Furgatch the FEC described as dicta the portions from      Furgatch that made their way into the agency's express      advocacy regulation. See FEC Brief in Opposition to      Certiorari in Furgatch at 7. And just last year in FEC Agenda      Document No. 99-40 at 2, the FEC's General Counsel conceded      that the broad view of express advocacy Commissioner McDonald      endorses is not completely supported by Furgatch, but only      ``largely based'' on Furgatch. In short, neither the courts      nor the FEC view Furgatch as fully justifying the definition      of express advocacy that Commissioner McDonald endorses.       Unfortunately, the history of the FEC's express advocacy      rulemaking is just one of many examples I could proffer of      Commissioner McDonald's disregard for the Constitution and      the rule of law. By supporting the agency's willful efforts      to disregard the law as pronounced by the courts of the      United States, Commissioner McDonald has     helped to create a situation in which an individual's First      Amendment rights vary--depending upon where they happen to      live in the United States. Of course, even people who reside      in regions of the country where the controlling court of      appeals has rejected the FEC's efforts to expand its      jurisdiction over political speech, are still chilled from      conveying their views on issues. After all, if they fund a      public communication that is broadcast into a neighboring      state that is in a federal circuit which has not ruled on the      FEC's novel theories, they may find themselves the test case      for that Circuit and be exposed to lengthy and costly      litigation.       When federal agencies are allowed to create such a      patchwork system of speech regulation, public confidence in      the competence and integrity of the administrative state      declines. People come to feel that their rights extend no      further than the capricious whims of government bureaucrats.       It is for Congress in its capacity as the body charged with      overseeing independent agencies to take the lead in remedying      such problems and reining in agencies that are out of      control. You can start reining in the FEC by making public      officials such as Commissioner McDonald accountable for      disregarding the rule of law and the constitutional rights of      citizens. By rejecting the nomination of Danny Lee McDonald,      Congress can signal that it will not tolerate FEC      Commissioners who arrogantly refuse to honor their oath to      uphold and defend the Constitution. By rejecting Danny Lee      McDonald--a man who has for almost twenty years demonstrated      contempt for the rights of ordinary Americans and the rulings      of federal courts--Congress can begin to restore confidence      that the Federal Election Commission will not continue to      trample on core First Amendment rights.           Very truly yours,                                               Manuel S. Klausner.  Mr. McCONNELL. I think Commissioner McDonald's voting record has displayed a disregard for the law, the courts, and the Constitution. It has hurt the reputation of the Commission, chilled constitutionally protected political speech, and cost the taxpayers money.  Equally troubling is the fact that Commissioner McDonald apparently chose to pursue the chairmanship of the Democratic National Committee while serving as a Commissioner to the Federal Election Commission.  On August 22, 1997, the General Counsel to the Democratic National Committee, Joseph Sandler, testified under oath that it was his understanding that Commissioner McDonald had pursued the ``chairmanship'' of the DNC in late 1996 or 1997. I must say I am very troubled by the fact that an FEC Commissioner, who is charged with displaying impartiality and good judgment, would seek the highest position in the Democratic National Committee while regulating the Democratic Party and its candidates and, I might add, while regulating the archrival of his party; that is, the Republican Party, and its candidates.  As the distinguished Minority Leader stated in a floor speech on February 28 of this year:       [The] law states that [FEC] Commissioners should be      ``chosen on the basis of their experience, integrity,      impartiality and good judgment.''  I have serious questions about whether an FEC Commissioner exhibits ``impartiality and good judgment'' when he seeks the highest position in his political party and simultaneously regulates that party and its candidates and regulates the competitor party and its candidates.  All that being said, I am prepared to reject this new litmus test whereby we ``Bork'' nominations to a bipartisan panel based on their membership in a particular campaign finance camp. I am prepared to follow the tradition of respecting the other party's choice and to support Commissioner McDonald's nomination, assuming that McDonald's party grants similar latitude to the Republican choice.  In fact, I believe it is the very presence of Commissioners such as Mr. McDonald who make Professor Smith all the more necessary at the FEC. The FEC needs Brad Smith's constitutional expertise to help prevent the string of unconstitutional FEC actions which McDonald supported. As Dean Kathleen Sullivan stated in support of Brad Smith:       I think it is a good thing . . . to have people who are      very attuned to constitutional values in government      positions[.]  So I say to my colleagues, I personally believe that Professor Smith's intelligence, his work ethic, his fairness, his knowledge of election law, and, to quote from the statute, his ``experience, integrity, impartiality and good judgment'' will be a tremendous asset to the FEC and to the American taxpayers who have been forced to pay for unconstitutional FEC actions.  Professor Smith is a widely respected, prolific author on Federal election law and, in my opinion, the most qualified nominee in the 25-year history of the Federal Election Commission. I am firmly convinced he would faithfully and impartially uphold the law and the Constitution as a Commissioner at the FEC, and I wholeheartedly support his nomination.  In the words of the Wall Street Journal:       This Mr. Smith should go to Washington.  Mr. President, how much of my time do I have remaining?
