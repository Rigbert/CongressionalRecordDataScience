President, I rise today to congratulate Katy Lesser of Underhill, VT, for being named Vermont's 2010 Small Business Person of the Year by the U.S. Small Business Administration.  Lesser is the owner of Healthy Living, a natural and organic food store in South Burlington, VT. In its 23 years of business, Healthy Living has grown from humble beginnings into a new 33,000-square-foot market with a staff of 130 employees. Healthy Living also is a leader in Vermont's sustainability movement by promoting a diverse and vibrant selection of locally grown foods and locally made products.  I had the pleasure of meeting Katy and her adult children, Eli and Nina, when they were in Washington this week for the national awards ceremony. Working at the store is a family affair, and they all put in long hours to make it go. I wish them well when they take a much needed vacation to Ireland.  Once again, I commend Katy Lesser on this well-deserved honor. I ask unanimous consent that a March 29 article from The Burlington Free Press on Katy's accomplishments be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:            [From the Burlington Free Press, Mar. 29, 2010]  Healthy Living Owner Katy Lesser Named Vermont's SBA Person of Year                         (By Myra Mathis Flynn)       It's your neighborhood grocery store that packs a healthy      punch. Located at 222 Dorset St., Healthy Living is the      natural and organic food store with a well-known community      outreach program, cooking classes and fully stocked bulk      section.       Starting at 1,200 square feet with only one employee and      average earnings of $300 a day, Healthy Living has grown over      a period of 23 years into a 33,000-square-foot market with a      staff of 130 employees, and average daily sales of $50,000.      Leading the market to success has been owner Katy Lesser.      Now, she is being recognized for it.       Lesser has been named the U.S. Small Business      Administration's 2010 Vermont Small Business Person of the      Year. Nominated by David Blow Jr., vice president of Granite      State Development Corp. in Burlington, Lesser was selected      for outstanding leadership related to her company's staying      power, employee growth, increase in sales, innovative      ingenuity and contributions to the community, the SBA said.      Recession aside, Lesser's sales for 2009 were more than $17      million.       Lesser was quick to share the credit.       ``I attribute my passion for food and people, tenacity,      patience, being part of a terrific industry, willingness to      learn, being a risk-taker, and a fabulous, amazing staff to      my success,'' Lesser said. ``Bottom line, you have to want to      get up and do it all over again every day.''       Healthy Living was also at the forefront of the localvore      movement as Lesser's long-term relationships with local      farmers has stocked the market with local fruits, vegetables,      meats, poultry, dairy products and more. The market also acts      as an incubator for small, local culinary producers and      carries products from more than 1,000 Vermont producers.       In 2008, Healthy Living uprooted and moved to its current      location. The move and expansion was a risk, but one that      Lesser was not shy to take.       ``I believe it's just as risky to be too small as it is to      be too big. So when I decided to expand, I did a lot of      research all over the country to see what other natural foods      markets were up to,'' Lesser said. ``I traveled all over the      country and got a good sense of what was working and what was      not. I wanted space for more product, of course, but I also      wanted space for customers to meet, eat, hang out, learn and      have a sense of community meeting place. I think I did      that.''       Lesser is gradually turning the business over to her two      children, both of whom returned to Vermont following college      and jobs elsewhere. Lesser's 32-year-old son, Eli, a graduate      of Brandeis University, is Healthy Living's chief operating      officer. Her 26-year-old daughter, Nina, a graduate of George      Washington University and the French Culinary Institute in      New York, is the store's education coordinator and director      of the market's newest venture, the Healthy Living Learning      Center.       As Vermont's Small Business Person of the Year, Lesser will      compete for the national title at National Small Business      Week ceremonies May 23-25 in Washington, D.C. The U.S. Small      Business Administration will honor her locally June 17 at a      ceremony sponsored by the SBA and Vermont Business Magazine      at the Shelburne Farms Coach Barn.       ``More than ever, I believe a good leader serves--serves      her customers, her staff, her vendors and her truck drivers.      Love of true service makes every day a joy because there is a      never-ending list of people to help in many, many ways,''      Lesser said. ``It's an honor to serve a community like ours.      I've experienced more loyalty and energy from our community      than I ever dreamed possible.''                          ____________________
