 President, I rise today to introduce a bill that will help fight class action lawsuit abuses. This bill, which Senator Kohl and I are introducing today, will go a long way toward ending class action lawsuit abuses where the plaintiffs receive very little and their lawyers receive a whole lot. It will also preserve class action lawsuits as an important toll that bring representation to the unrepresented and result in important discrimination and consumer decisions.  My Judiciary Subcommittee held a hearing last Fall that exposed and discussed the problem of certain class action lawsuit settlements. Let me give you an example of a class action lawsuit settlement that I find particularly disturbing. In an antitrust case settled in the Northern District of Illinois in 1993, the plaintiff class alleged that multiple domestic airlines participated in pricefixing beginning at least as early as January 1, 1988. This pricefixing resulted in plaintiffs paying more for airline tickets that they otherwise would have had to pay.  The settlement in this case gave a coupon book to all of the plaintiffs. These coupons varied in amount andnumber, according to how many plane tickets the plaintiffs had purchased. These coupons can be used toward the purchase of future airline tickets. The catch is that the plaintiff still has to pay for the majority of any new airline ticket out of his or her own pocket. This means that only $10 worth of coupons can be used towards the purchase of a $100 dollar ticket; up to $25 worth of coupons can be used towards the purchase of a $250 ticket; up to $50 worth of coupons can be used towards the purchase of a $500 ticket, and so on. In addition, these coupons cannot be used on certain blackout dates, which seem to include all holidays and peak travel times.  The attorneys, interestingly enough, did not get paid in coupons. The plaintiffs' attorneys got paid in cash. They got paid $16 million dollars in cash. If the coupons were good enough for their clients, I wonder why coupons were not good enough for the lawyers.  Another egregious class action lawsuit settlement was discussed by one of the witnesses in my subcommittee hearing. Ms. Martha Preston was a member of the class in Hoffman versus BancBoston, where some of the plaintiffs received under $10 dollars each in compensation for their injuries, yet were docked around $75 or $90 for attorneys' fees. This means that attorneys that they had never met, who were supposed to be representing their best interests, agreed to a settlement that cost some of the plaintiffs more money than they received in compensation for being wronged.  These lawsuit abuses happen for a number of reasons. One reason is that plaintiffs' lawyers negotiate their own fees as part of the settlement. This can result in distracting lawyers from focussing on their clients' needs, and settling or refusing to settle based on the amount of their own compensation.  During our hearing, evidence was presented that at least one group of plaintiffs' lawyers meets regularly to discuss initiating class action lawsuits. They scan the Federal Register and other publications to get ideas for lawsuits, and only after they have identified the wrong, do they find clients for their lawsuits. Rather than having clients complaining of harms, they find harms first, and then recruit clients with the promise of compensation.  The defendants are not always innocent, though. Plaintiffs' lawyers say that they are approached by lawyers from large corporations who urge them to find a class and sue the corporation. The corporations may use this as a tool to limit their liability. Once this suit is initiated and settled, no member of the class may sue based on that claim. In other words, if a corporation settles a class action lawsuit by paying all class members $10 as compensation for a faulty car door latch, the plaintiffs can no longer sue for any harm caused by the faulty door latch. this is one way of buying immunity for liability.  The Preliminary Results of the Rand Study of Class Action Litigation states that, ``It is generally agreed that fees drive plaintiffs' attorneys' filing behavior, that defendants' risk aversion in the face of large aggregate exposures drives their settlement behavior. . . . In other words, the problems with class actions flow from incentives that are embedded in the process itself.''  The Glassley/Kohl Class Action Fairness Act does the following:                             plain english  Notice of proposed settlements (as well as all class notices) in all class actions must be in clear, easily understood English and must include all material settlement terms, including the amount and source of attorney's fees. One thing that I knew before our hearing, but that witness testimony confirm, is that the notice most plaintiffs receive are written in small print and confusing legal jargon. Even one of the lawyers testifying before my subcommittee said that he couldn't understand the notice he received as a plaintiff in a class action lawsuit. Since plaintiffs are giving up their right to sue, it is imperative that they understand what they are doing and the ramifications of their actions.                   notice to state attorneys general  The Class Action Fairness Act requires that State Attorneys General be notified of any proposed class settlement that would affect residents of their states. The notice give a state AG the opportunity to object if the settlement terms are unfair.                attorneys' fees based on actual damages  Our bill requires that attorney's fees in all class actions must be a reasonable percentage of actual damages and actual costs of complying with the terms of a settlement agreement.          removal of multistate class actions to federal court  This bill provides that class acting lawsuits may be removed to a federal court by a defendant or unnamed class member if the total damages exceed $75,000 and parties include citizens from multiple states. Currently, only defendants can seek removal, and only if each name plaintiff has at minimum a $75,000 claim and complete diversity exists between all named plaintiffs and defendants, even if only one class members is from the same state as a defendant. The bill also eliminates the ability of a lone class action defendant to veto removal, and it forecloses class attorneys from avoiding removal by raising a class action claim for the first time only after the suit already has been pending for a year. Removal still must be sought within 30 days from when there is notice of the class claim.                mandatory sanctions for frivolous suits.  This section of our bill will reduce frivolous lawsuits by requiring that a violation of Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which penalizes frivolous filings, will require the imposition of sanctions. The nature and extent of sanctions will remain discretionary.  We need this bill. We need this reform. Both plaintiffs and defendants are calling for reform in his area. This bill is not just procedural reform; this is substantive reform of our courts system. This bill will remove the conflict of interest that lawyers face in class action lawsuits, and ensue the fair settlement of these cases.
