I ask the Senator from Iowa, is the Senator hearing the same thing I am hearing as you visit school districts in Iowa and sit down with school board members and principals and teachers, regarding No Child Left Behind, which is imposing a requirement for testing kids to find out the progress they are making--and there is nothing wrong with that--but then when they find the kids are falling behind, does the Senator hear in Iowa the same as I do in Illinois, hear that these educators are asking, Why did the Federal Government fail to fund this mandate? Why are you sending us the No Child Left Behind mandate and failing to send the money to help educate the children?  Again, we find this President's budget is not funding his education program. It is underfunding his mandate. Does the Senator find the same thing as he travels through Iowa?  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from New Hampshire.  The time of the Senator is expired.
