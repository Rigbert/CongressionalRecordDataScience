With Korea they promised, they said, we will be able to sell 50,000 American cars in Korea.  Well, what has happened is they have sold, the Koreans have sold 500,000 here. We never got the 50,000 in there, didn't get it--closed market, deal not kept.  I have a bill that I have introduced in several Congresses called the Balancing Trade Act, which basically says to the executive branch, for any country with which the United States has amassed a $10 billion trade deficit, let's go back and figure out what is the problem? Why do we have a deficit rather than a balance or a surplus? And before we pass any more trade deals, fix that first.
