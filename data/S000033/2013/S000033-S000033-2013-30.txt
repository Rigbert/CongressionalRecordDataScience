 It is the same thing with Medicare. It is interesting.  I would say to the majority leader that despite all of the anti-Affordable Care Act rhetoric we hear--you would think nobody would be interested in getting into the program--the first day out, over 2 million people went to the Federal Government's Web site. I am not quite sure why our Republican friends think that millions of Americans on the first day should not have the right to take advantage of a program that was passed by Congress.
