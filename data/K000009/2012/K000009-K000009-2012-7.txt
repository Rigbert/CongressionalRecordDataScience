Speaker, I would like to rise in support of my dear colleagues from Connecticut and throughout our Nation in extending deepest sympathy and affection to the people of Newtown, Connecticut, as they bear the pain of human loss in the recent Sandy Hook Elementary School tragedy. Despite the heavy burden of grief they are carrying, the citizens of Newtown have truly inspired our entire Nation. Their spirit has lifted ours as they pay tribute to their children and the heroic teachers and school personnel who so nobly acted to save lives. Surely their extraordinary grace under pressure exemplifies what President John Kennedy defined as courage.  Mr. Speaker, I am including in the Record the remarks of Liza Long in an article she published about her son, Michael. We must listen to her. And we must listen to the people of Newtown in memory of each of the precious spirits that have graced it, for their highest aspirations, for an America where this never happens again.  In aiding us in this journey of faith, this article poignantly describes the condition of so many children in our country who are hurting and ill with unquiet minds that even medical science cannot fully explain. I commend President Obama for proposing a special commission to listen to mothers like Liza and to the people of Newtown as we shape a better future for us all.  Mr. Speaker, I also wish to commend the new Senator-elect from Hawaii for her very poignant tribute of Senator Daniel Inouye with whom we had the privilege of serving these many years.       [From The Blue Review, Dec. 16, 2012]``I Am Adam Lanza's Mother'': A Mom's Perspective on The Mental Illness                         Conversation in America                             [By Liza Long]       Friday's horrific national tragedy--the murder of 20      children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in      Newtown, Connecticut--has ignited a new discussion on      violence in America. In kitchens and coffee shops across the      country, we tearfully debate the many faces of violence in      America: gun culture, media violence, lack of mental health      services, overt and covert wars abroad, religion, politics      and the way we raise our children. Liza Long, a writer based      in Boise, says it's easy to talk about guns. But it's time to      talk about mental illness.       While every family's story of mental illness is different,      and we may never know the whole of the Lanza's story, tales      like this one need to be heard--and families who live them      deserve our help.       Three days before 20 year-old Adam Lanza killed his mother,      then opened fire on a classroom full of Connecticut      kindergartners, my 13-year old son Michael (name changed)      missed his bus because he was wearing the wrong color pants       ``I can wear these pants,'' he said, his tone increasingly      belligerent, the black-hole pupils of his eyes swallowing the      blue irises.       ``They are navy blue,'' I told him. ``Your school's dress      code says black or khaki pants only.''       ``They told me I could wear these,'' he insisted. ``You're      a stupid bitch. I can wear whatever pants I want to. This is      America. I have rights!''       ``You can't wear whatever pants you want to,'' I said, my      tone affable, reasonable. ``And you definitely cannot call me      a stupid bitch. You're grounded from electronics for the rest      of the day. Now get in the car, and I will take you to      school.''       I live with a son who is mentally ill. I love my son. But      he terrifies me.       A few weeks ago, Michael pulled a knife and threatened to      kill me and then himself after I asked him to return his      overdue library books. His 7 and 9 year old siblings knew the      safety plan--they ran to the car and locked the doors before      I even asked them to. I managed to get the knife from      Michael, then methodically collected all the sharp objects in      the house into a single Tupperware container that now travels      with me. Through it all, he continued to scream insults at me      and threaten to kill or hurt me.       That conflict ended with three burly police officers and a      paramedic wrestling my son onto a gurney for an expensive      ambulance ride to the local emergency room. The mental      hospital didn't have any beds that day, and Michael calmed      down nicely in the ER, so they sent us home with a      prescription for Zyprexa and a follow-up visit with a local      pediatric psychiatrist.       We still don't know what's wrong with Michael. Autism      spectrum, ADHD, Oppositional Defiant or Intermittent      Explosive Disorder have all been tossed around at various      meetings with probation officers and social workers and      counselors and teachers and school administrators. He's been      on a slew of antipsychotic and mood altering pharmaceuticals,      a Russian novel of behavioral plans. Nothing seems to work.       At the start of seventh grade, Michael was accepted to an      accelerated program for highly gifted math and science      students. His IQ is off the charts. When he's in a good mood,      he will gladly bend your ear on subjects ranging from Greek      mythology to the differences between Einsteinian and      Newtonian physics to Doctor Who. He's in a good mood most of      the time. But when he's not, watch out. And it's impossible      to predict what will set him off.       Several weeks into his new junior high school, Michael      began exhibiting increasingly odd and threatening behaviors      at school. We decided to transfer him to the district's most      restrictive behavioral program, a contained school      environment where children who can't function in normal      classrooms can access their right to free public babysitting      from 7:30-1:50 Monday through Friday until they turn 18.       The morning of the pants incident, Michael continued to      argue with me on the drive. He would occasionally apologize      and seem remorseful. Right before we turned into his school      parking lot, he said, ``Look, Mom, I'm really sorry. Can I      have video games back today?''       ``No way,'' I told him. ``You cannot act the way you acted      this morning and think you can get your electronic privileges      back that quickly.''       His face turned cold, and his eyes were full of calculated      rage. ``Then I'm going to kill myself,'' he said. ``I'm going      to jump out of this car right now and kill myself.''       That was it. After the knife incident, I told him that if      he ever said those words again, I would take him straight to      the mental hospital, no ifs, ands, or buts. I did not      respond, except to pull the car into the opposite lane,      turning left instead of right.        ``Where are you taking me?'' he said, suddenly worried.      ``Where are we going?''       ``You know where we are going,'' I replied.       ``No! You can't do that to me! You're sending me to hell!      You're sending me straight to hell!''       I pulled up in front of the hospital, frantically waiving      for one of the clinicians who happened to be standing      outside. ``Call the police,'' I said. ``Hurry.''       Michael was in a full-blown fit by then, screaming and      hitting. I hugged him close so he couldn't escape from the      car. He bit me several times and repeatedly jabbed his elbows      into my rib cage. I'm still stronger than he is, but I won't      be for much longer.       The police came quickly and carried my son screaming and      kicking into the bowels of the hospital. I started to shake,      and tears filled my eyes as I filled out the paperwork--     ``Were there any difficulties with... at what age did your      child.., were there any problems with.. has your child ever      experienced.. does your child have...''       At least we have health insurance now. I recently accepted      a position with a local college, giving up my freelance      career because when you have a kid like this, you need      benefits. You'll do anything for benefits. No individual      insurance plan will cover this kind of thing.       For days, my son insisted that I was lying--that I made the      whole thing up so that I could get rid of him. The first day,      when I called to check up on him, he said, ``I hate you. And      I'm going to get my revenge as soon as I get out of here.''       By day three, he was my calm, sweet boy again, all      apologies and promises to get better. I've heard those      promises for years. I don't believe them anymore.       On the intake form, under the question, ``What are your      expectations for treatment?'' I wrote, ``I need help.''       And I do. This problem is too big for me to handle on my      own. Sometimes there are no good options. So you just pray      for grace and trust that in hindsight, it will all make      sense.       I am sharing this story because I am Adam Lanza's mother. I      am Dylan Klebold's and Eric Harris's mother. I am James      Holmes's mother. I am Jared Loughner's mother. I am Seung-Hui      Cho's mother. And these boys--and their mothers--need help.      In the wake of another horrific national tragedy, it's easy      to talk about guns. But it's time to talk about mental      illness.       According to Mother Jones, since 1982, 61 mass murders      involving firearms have occurred throughout the country. Of      these, 43 of the killers were white males, and only one was a      woman. Mother Jones focused on whether the killers obtained      their guns legally (most did). But this highly visible sign      of mental illness should lead us to consider how many people      in the U.S. live in fear, like I do.       When I asked my son's social worker about my options, he      said that the only thing I could do was to get Michael      charged with a crime. ``If he's back in the system, they'll      create a paper trail,'' he said. ``That's the only way you're      ever going to get anything done. No one will pay attention to      you unless you've got charges.''       I don't believe my son belongs in jail. The chaotic      environment exacerbates Michael's sensitivity to sensory      stimuli and doesn't deal with the underlying pathology. But      it seems like the United States is using prison as the      solution of choice for mentally ill people. According to      Human Rights Watch, the number of mentally ill inmates in      U.S. prisons quadrupled from 2000 to 2006, and it continues      to rise--in fact, the rate of inmate mental illness is five      times greater (56 percent) than in the non-incarcerated      population.       With state-run treatment centers and hospitals shuttered,      prison is now the last resort for the mentally ill--Rikers      Island, the LA County Jail and Cook County Jail in Illinois      housed the nation's largest treatment centers in 2011.       No one wants to send a 13-year old genius who loves Harry      Potter and his snuggle animal collection to jail. But our      society, with its stigma on mental illness and its broken      healthcare system, does not provide us with other options.      Then another tortured soul shoots up a fast food restaurant.      A mall. A kindergarten classroom. And we wring our hands and      say, ``Something must be done.''       I agree that something must be done. It's time for a      meaningful, nation-wide conversation about mental health.      That's the only way our nation can ever truly heal.       God help me. God help Michael. God help us all.                          ____________________
