President, I wish to commend my colleague from Rhode Island for his statement on the unemployment situation facing our country and also join in his remarks with some concern and dismay over the opposition of the Republican Senators to extending unemployment benefits.  Tens of thousands of people in my home State of Illinois and all across the United States have been unemployed for long periods of time and have now reached the end of their eligibility for unemployment compensation.
