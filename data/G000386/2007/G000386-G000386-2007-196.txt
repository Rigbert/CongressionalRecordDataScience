 President, I visited with the managers about speaking on some amendments.  The first amendment I am going to reference, I will just speak about it because it is still in Legislative Counsel, but we will have it shortly. That probably means tomorrow. But I wish to alert people to a problem we have with Homeland Security that I would like to fix through amendment. The amendment would restrict the Department of Homeland Security from using any funds appropriated in this bill for the enforcement of interim final chemical security regulations relating to the stored quantity of propane gas between 7,500 pounds and 100,800 pounds. I will put this in language that people, at least in rural America, can understand.  We have a situation where you don't have natural gas, and that is on most farms, a lot of small businesses, and small towns. Homes are heated with propane, 500-gallon tanks that are somewhere on the property, usually behind the house or, in the case of a farm, out by the grain bins where you dry your corn or other grains using propane gas. Things of that nature are what I am talking about.  Let me be very clear; my amendment is limited and narrowly tailored in that it only limits use of funds for enforcing one listed chemical. That one listed chemical is propane. Some people refer to it as LP gas, liquid propane gas--one and all the same.  It would allow the Department to use funds to enforce the regulation for larger facilities, things that can honestly be said could be used for terrorist activity, but not the propane tank behind some farmhouse or by some grain bin. This amendment is necessary to ensure that these regulations truly protect our homeland but not burden farmers and small businesses and create a bigger problem with regard to propane security that I will mention in a minute.  This final rule was published by the Department of Homeland Security on April 9, 2007, and became effective June 8 of this year. These regulations were required by Congress as part of the Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill of 2007 and are known as the chemical facility antiterrorism standards. The regulations include an appendix that lists chemicals of interest to the Department and the stored quantities that will trigger reporting and screening requirements for those who house the listed chemicals. Included in the list of chemicals of interest is propane stored in quantities greater than 7,500 pounds.  Propane is used by virtually every arm of agriculture, from small family farms to large agribusinesses across the country. Propane is used to dry grain, to heat facilities for livestocks and poultry, and to heat thousands of rural homes across the country. This listed quantity of 7,500 pounds is roughly 1,785 gallons.  For those who are not from rural America, the typical rural home has at least one thousand-gallon tank for heating and maybe has two or three of these tanks for home heating and cooking, depending upon the size of the home. Some family farms may have a home tank and multiple farm tanks. Under the current regulation and thresholds, these rural homes and farms would qualify as a chemical facility and would have to complete what is known as the ``top screen'' process to register the site as a chemical facility. These are not homes in large metropolitan areas; they are rural homes where the nearest neighbors could be miles away. But under the current regulation, counting all tanks on oneproperty, they would be subject to the screening requirements and also subject to penalties if they failed to complete the screen.  Most people listening to me are probably saying: So what. If the Department lists the chemicals, these folks should register. Well, in its own regulatory analysis--I am quoting from the Department now--the Department calculates that the average cost to complete the top screen process will be between $2,300 and $3,500 per screen. That is not a lot of money to some large chemical facility, but to John Q. Public who owns three tanks on his farm to heat his home as well as to heat his sheds and barns and maybe dry grain, $2,300 to $3,500 is very real money.  Further, the top screen requires individuals to fill out a lengthy form that is highly detailed and may require help from attorneys to ensure that the forms are filled out properly. Once this is completed, the Department then makes a determination if the site will need to complete a security vulnerability assessment. If this assessment is necessary, the Department then determines if a site needs a site security plan for chemical security.  The bottom line is that many rural homes, farms, and small businesses could be required to pay $2,300 to $3,500 as just a preliminary step to determine whether they are ``high risk'' for a terrorist attack. These lengthy forms, complex requirements, and high costs pose a harsh, undue burden upon rural America; hence my amendment and hence my begging for consideration of this from my colleagues.  I also believe this regulation has a possibility of increasing threats to our country as opposed to making it safer. As written, this rule and the current quantities of propane may lead many homeowners, farmers, small businesspeople to limit how full they might keep their onsite storage tanks. For example, a home with multiple tanks may only fill a backup tank part of the way to stay under the threshold so they do not have to fill out the top screen.  Now, as a result of that, that home, that small business, that farm may have to increase the number of times its tanks are filled once or twice during the winter months. This increase in the number of tank fills--because they are only going to be partially filled--means the number of trips propane trucks make is very much increased, leading to more propane tankers per business and more propane tankers going down our highways.  Now, I ask all of you to consider, what is a more vulnerable threat to America, John Q. Public's family home in rural Iowa--or in any other State--or an increase in hundreds, maybe thousands, of extra propane tankers on America's highways and roads?  Now, I tried to solve this problem before this amendment. On June 25, 2007, I sent a letter to Secretary Chertoff asking him to consider the impact of including propane in quantities of 7,500 pounds in the regulations. I asked Secretary Chertoff to consider including an exemption for rural homes, farms, and small businesses that store and provide propane in excess of 7,500 pounds. To date, I have only received a response saying the Department is ``giving careful consideration'' to my letter.  Now, I appreciate the careful consideration being given to my letter, but I wish to know what is being done to ensure there is no undue burden placed upon rural Americans and that these rules have the impact that is intended. We all want to ensure our homeland is as safe as possible, but we need to do so without overburdening rural Americans and threatening the growth of a small business.  Further, as I pointed out, there is an additional possible safety concern that may be a consequence of the regulation. As such, I will offer an amendment that would prohibit the use of any funds to the Department to enforce the current regulations for propane when the site of that propane has more than 7,500 pounds but less than 1,800 pounds, until it amends these regulations to provide an exemption for rural homesteads, agricultural producers, and small business concerns.  Again, this amendment is narrowly tailored only toward propane and does not impact enforcement of the regulations for other listed toxic chemicals. Additionally, this amendment includes safety provisions to ensure that if a threat is imminent to rural America, the Department can inform Congress of such threat and continue with its current regulations. This amendment is necessary to ensure that Government regulations meet a commonsense test and do not unduly burden rural America.                Amendment No. 2444 to Amendment No. 2383  Mr. President, I am now going to go to an amendment I do have written and would like to offer. I send amendment No. 2444 to the desk and ask for its consideration. Mr. Inhofe should be listed as a cosponsor.
