  Mr. DeFAZIO. George Bush and the Republicans have spent our country to the verge of bankruptcy. They have doubled our foreign debt. They have increased our national debt by 60 percent. George Bush has accumulated more debt than every President who preceded him in the United States of America and they have done it on the credit card.  And guess who is going to get the bill in their world after they eliminate taxes for the wealthy? It's going to be the middle class, and they're going to get hit twice. They're going to get the bill, and their kids and grandkids are going to get the bill. And the programs that middle-income Americans need like tuition assistance for their kids to go to college, the Bushies cut those. That's their sense of fiscal responsibility.  The other side over here, the gentleman from North Carolina is saying, oh, the largest tax increase in history.  No. We're allowing the tax cuts for the wealthiest among us, people who earn over $250,000 a year, people who have estates worth more than $5 million, we're asking that once again they pay their fair share. There will not be a penny increase on middle-income families. They can make up anything they want, but it's not true.  But, yes, the wealthy would pay a little bit more. That's why they're squealing so much, because the Republicans get their money from the wealthy to try and maintain control of our country.                          ____________________
