I see the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Inouye of Hawaii, on the Senate floor. He is the only person standing on this floor who has served longer in this Senate than I have. I have been on that committee for 35 years. These are things that are always done. Whether it is a Republican majority or a Democratic majority, they have always been done, almost in a pro forma fashion. If somebody wants to vote against it, they can vote against it. But with all of the tremendous bipartisan work that is done in the Appropriations Committee--nobody has worked harder than the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. Nobody has worked harder than he has to get a bipartisan bill to the floor. To have it delayed, especially Military Construction, especially matters that help our military at a time when they desperately need it, to have that held up just makes no sense. I share the leader's frustration.  I want to note for the record that nobody has worked harder to get a bipartisan bill on the floor than the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. In years past, that would go through in no time at all. I cannot understand this kind of partisanship.  I yield the floor.
