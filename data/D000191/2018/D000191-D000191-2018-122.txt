Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ward W. McCarragher, who has served in many capacities with the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure for the last quarter century, including the last 20 years as the Chief Democratic Counsel to the Committee. As a Member of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, I have had the privilege of working with Ward for the last 25 years, and most closely since 2015 when I took over as Ranking Member of the Committee. As Ranking Member, I have come to rely on his expertise in both transportation policy and Congressional process in advancing important policy measures to improve the lives of American families.  Hailing from Kenosha, Wisconsin, and a proud Wisconsin Badgers and Green Bay Packers fan, Ward started his Congressional service back in 1989 as a foreign policy analyst for the Congressional Research Service. After subsequently attending law school and serving as a legal intern to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, Ward returned to Washington, D.C. in 1993 as an intern for Chairman Norman Y. Mineta (D-CA) and the Committee on Public Works and Transportation. That same year, he was appointed by Chairman Mineta as Associate Counsel of the Committee's Economic Development Subcommittee and, in 1995, hewas appointed Counsel to the Public Buildings and Economic Development Subcommittee and the Surface Transportation Subcommittee. In 1998, Ranking Member James L. Oberstar (D-MN) appointed Ward to be the Chief Democratic Counsel to the Committe, where he has served with distinction ever since, including under Chairman Oberstar and Ranking Member Nick J. Rahall (D-WV) prior to me.  Ward has helped guide virtually every transportation law enacted over the last two decades through the legislative process and the last four major reauthorizations of surface transportation programs, including the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) in 1998, the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU) in 2005, and the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act (FAST Act) in 2015. He also worked tirelessly over the last two decades to combat efforts to eliminate funding for, and privatize, Amtrak, our Nation's passenger railroad.  Ward was also integral in negotiating Federal policy following the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington, D.C., including the enactment of the Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001, which created the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and enhanced aviation security overall, the Homeland Security Act of 2002, and the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002.  Ward is the consummate public servant who possesses the rare combination of vision and grit. He has spent his career working vigorously to ensure that government works for the greater benefit of hard-working American families, while still attending to the minor, but certainly necessary, details. He has been a tireless internal advocate for Congressional oversight of Federal agencies, under both Democratic and Republican administrations, ensuring that Federal resources are utilized consistent with Congressional intent and for the betterment of the Nation. He is also a rare master on the internal workings of the Committee structure and the Congress, meticulously ensuring that established processes are followed, and that the views of elected officials, whether in the majority or minority, are respected. And he does this all while ensuring that no Committee document is missing a comma.  As the longest currently serving staffer on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Ward's dedication to the Committee, his institutional memory and his constant professionalism will be greatly missed by Members on both sides of the aisle. While Ward is leaving the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, he will remain a strong advocate for smart, effective public transportation policy through his positon with the American Public Transportation Association. His expertise and counsel will be missed by all who follow transportation policy on Capitol Hill, but will greatly benefit all those who rely on public transportation.  I want to thank Ward for his years of service and his dedication to public service. I wish him, his wife, Marie, and his children, Ryan, Colin, and Megan all the best in the years to come.                          ____________________
