I think we are going to be in a position soon where we are going to have a series of votes.  I ask unanimous consent that prior to each of the votes we will be having on this legislation there be 4 minutes equally divided under the control of the distinguished Senator from Kentucky and myself, so that the proponent and opponent would have 2 minutes prior to each vote.
