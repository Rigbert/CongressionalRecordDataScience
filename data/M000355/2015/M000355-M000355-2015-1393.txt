 So what you have is an effort to characterize our NSA programs, and the officials who conduct them cannot discuss the classified activities. So they are clearly at a disadvantage.  Since September 11, 2001, FISA has been critically important in keeping us safe here in America. According to the CIA, had these authorities been in place more than a decade ago, they would likely--likely--have prevented 9/11. Not only have these tools kept us safe, there has not been a single incident--not one--of an intentional abuse of them.  The NSA is overseen by the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of our government. They are not running rogue out there. The NSA is overseen by the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of our government. The employees of NSA are highly trained, supervised, and tested.  The expiring provisions of FISA are ideally suited for the terrorist threats we face in 2015. These provisions work together to protect us from foreign terrorists abroad who use social and other media to conspire and eventually plan attacks inside the United States.  ISIL uses Facebook, uses Twitter, its online magazine, and other social media platforms to contact and eventually radicalize recruits online. If our intelligence community cannot connect the dots of information, we cannot stop this determined enemy from launching attacks.  Under section 215 authority, the NSA can find connections--find connections--from known terrorists overseas and connect that to potential terrorists in the United States. But the NSA cannot query the database, which consists of call data records such as the number calling, the number called, and the duration, without a court order.  Let me say that again. NSA cannot query the database, which consists of call data records such as number calling, the number called, and the duration, without a court order. Under section 215, the NSA cannot listen to phone calls of Americans at all. Under section 215, the NSA cannot listen to the phone calls of Americans at all.  Despite the value of the section 215 program and the rigorous safeguards that govern it, critics of the program either want to do away with it or make it much more difficult to use. Many of them are proposing a bill--the USA FREEDOM Act--that they say will keep us safe while protecting our privacy. It will do neither. It will neither keep us safe nor protect our privacy. It will make us more vulnerable and it risks compromising our privacy.  The USA FREEDOM Act would replace section 215 with an untested, untried, and more cumbersome system. It would not end bulk collection of call data. Instead, it would have untrained--untrained--corporate employees with uncertain supervision and protocols do the collecting. So it switches this responsibility from the NSA, with total oversight, to corporate employees with uncertain supervision and protocols. They get to do the collecting. It would establish a wall between the NSA analysts and the data they are trying to analyze. At best, the new system envisioned by the USA FREEDOM Act would be more cumbersome and time consuming to use when speed and agility are absolutely crucial. At worst, it will not work at all because there is no requirement in the legislation that the telecoms hold the data for any length of time. Put differently, section 215 helped us find the needle in a haystack, but under the USA FREEDOM Act, there may not be a haystack to look through at all.  In short, the opponents of America's counterterror programs would rather trust telecommunication companies to hold this data and search it on behalf of our government. These companies have no programs, no training or tools to search the databases they would need to create, and if that isn't bad enough, we would have to pay them to do it. The taxpayers would have to pay them to do it.  In addition to making us less safe, the USA FREEDOM Act would make our privacy less secure. The section 215 program is subject to rigorous controls and strict oversight. Only a limited number of intelligence professionals have access to the data. There are strict limits on when and for what purpose they can access the data. Their access to the data is closely supervised with numerous--numerous--levels of review. These safeguards will not apply to the untried and novel system under the USA FREEDOM Act, and rather than storing the information securely at NSA, the information would be held by private companies instead.  There was an excellent editorial today in the Wall Street Journal pointing out the challenges we face. It was entitled the ``Snowden Blindfold Act.'' The ``Snowden Blindfold Act'' was the headline in the Wall Street Journal today.  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of that article.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:              [From the Wall Street Journal, May 7, 2015]                       The Snowden Blindfold Act       Congress moves to weaken antiterror surveillance while      France expands it.       At least one of the gunmen who shot up a Texas free speech      event on Sunday was known to the FBI as a potentially violent      radical and was convicted in 2011 on a terror-related charge.      The Islamic State claimed credit for this domestic attack,      albeit an unproven connection. So it is strange that Congress      is moving to weaken U.S. surveillance defenses against the      likes of shooters Elton Simpson and Nadir Soofi.       Two years after the leaks from Edward Snowden's stolen      dossier, a liberal-conservative coalition is close to passing      a bill that would curtail the programs the National Security      Agency has employed in some form for two decades. Adding to      this political strangeness, France of all places is on the      verge of modernizing and expanding its own surveillance      capabilities for the era of burner cell phones, encrypted      emails and mass online jihadist propaganda.       The Patriot Act expires at the end of the month, and a      fragile House-negotiated compromise on reauthorization would      end NSA sweeps of telephone metadata--the date, time stamps      and duration of calls. The content of those calls isn't      collected without a separate warrant. The measure also      includes mostly cosmetic nuisance changes such as a panel of      outside amicus lawyers to advise the secret Foreign      Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) that supervises and      approves NSA activities.       But the metadata eulogies are premature before what ought      to be a sturdy debate in the Senate. Majority Leader Mitch      McConnell introduced a ``clean'' extension of current law as      a base bill that the chamber will open to amendments later      this month. The Senate narrowly defeated a bill similar to      the House measure last year, and we hope it does so again.       Senators should think carefully about the value of metadata      collection, and not only because the technical details of the      House bill are still being parsed by security experts. In      January 2014, President Obama     tried to suppress the Snowden wildfire by pronouncing the end      of ``bulk metadata program as it currently exists,'' via      executive order. Civil libertarians rejoiced. Yet NSA      transparency disclosures show the FISC court approved 170      search applications of the database in the same calendar      year.       Presumably the NSA continued to analyze metadata--despite      pro forma White House opposition--because these details      provide intelligence that is useful for uncovering plots,      preventing attacks and otherwise safeguarding the country.      The NSA must demonstrate to FISC judges a ``reasonable,      articulable suspicion'' to gain approval for each      ``selector,'' or search query.       In other words, there is little invasion of privacy because      the searches are narrow. The NSA isn't even using automated      algorithms to reveal suspicious patterns the way that credit      card companies and retailers mine consumer data every day.      The NSA's 170 metadata searches involved merely 160 foreign      targets and 227 known or presumed U.S. citizens.       There is still no evidence that the data have been abused.      The Supreme Court has held since Smith v. Maryland in 1979      that the Constitution provides no guarantee of metadata      privacy. Domestic police and prosecutors in routine criminal      investigations enjoy more warrantless access to metadata well      beyond even the NSA status quo.       The House bill pretends not to undermine intelligence      collection by requiring telecom and tech companies to retain      metadata business records. The NSA could then request these      documents with FISC consent or unilaterally in an emergency.      But assembling this information retroactively may be too slow      in a true crisis--in return for little or no added privacy      protection. After the hacking breaches at Sony, Target and a      string of health insurers, Americans may reasonably wonder if      their data are safer fragmented across many private third-     party repositories.       The Members of Congress who know the most about      intelligence know all this, but they say that ending metadata      collection is the price of blocking a political stampede that      might also kill more important provisions such as Section 702      that authorizes foreign-to-foreign wiretaps. That might have      been true immediately after the Snowden heist, but it may not      be true after the attacks on Charlie Hebdo and in Texas by      Islamic State-inspired jihadists.       Those shootings show that surveillance is more crucial than      ever to prevent mass murder on U.S. soil by homegrown or      foreign radicals. The French understand this, which is why      they are widening their intelligence reach. No prevention can      ever be perfect. But the House measure is a deliberate effort      to know less and blind U.S. spooks to potentially relevant      information. This self-imposed fog may be politically      satisfying now, but deadly if there is another attack.  Mr. McCONNELL. Finally, I would like to ask the senior Senator from North Carolina, who is the chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence, the following question: Why was it necessary to enact the provisions of the PATRIOT Act after the attacks of 9/11/2001, and why are they relevant today given the threat we face from ISIL and Al Qaeda?
