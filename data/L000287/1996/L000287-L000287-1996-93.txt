Madam Speaker, the entire world has been shocked, appalled, and reviled by the latest wave of terrorist attacks by Hamas in Israel. More than 50 innocent men, women, and children have been killed by suicide bombings in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.  So I was similarly shocked and reviled to hear a comment made on the House floor last week in the course of debate on the so-called antiterrorist bill. The gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Hyde], the chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary, said this: ``Early in the day standing back there, I heard a dear friend of mine, a great Republican say, `I trust Hamas more than I trust my own Government.' ''  He went on to say those words hurt. Those words do hurt indeed. But who, Madam Speaker, who, Mr. Hyde, who on the Republican side really believed they could trust Hamas more than our own Government? Who among my colleagues truly believes they can trust a terrorist organization that sends suicide bombers to rob innocent children more than the U.S. Government?  Madam Speaker, the American people have a right to know who among their elected Representatives trusts Hamas more than the United States. Until that person steps forward, or is identified, a cloud hangs over each and every Republican Member of this House.                          ____________________
