 President, I rise in opposition to this amendment. While I understand how important the notch issue is to millions of senior citizens, this is neither the time nor the place to address this issue.  The bill before us today provides much needed tax relief to hard working Americans. The amendment offered by Senator Reid is not germane to this bill.  This amendment has never been reviewed by any committee of jurisdiction, nor scored by the Congressional Budget Office. No one has any idea how much it would cost or what new benefit inequities it would create. In addition, the proposed offset contained in the amendment is an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority to the Secretary of the Treasury. This is not a serious amendment.  If Congress is going to seriously consider this issue, it must be done in the context of overall Social Security reform so we can carefully consider the costs and benefits of any proposed change.
