President, first of all, I thank the Senator from Nevada for responding to questions. I would like to make an observation.  I had the occasion to be sitting in the chair for the past hour before the current occupant of the chair, and I listened to the discussion that took place in the Chamber. It occurred to me that maybe some people for the first time realize how truly difficult it is to balance the budget.  I had an occasion last night to see on C-SPAN the Democratic whip in the House of Representatives standing up and talking and stating over and over and over again that they are requesting reductions in taxes for the very wealthy people and that those reductions in taxes will be paid by what has always been referred to as the working people. And I have always found that to be a little offensive. It is kind of implying that other people are not working. I think it is a very clever way to state it because everyone identifies with that.  But we are at a defining moment right now. There was truly a revolution that took place on November 8, 1994, and everyone agrees with this. I know there are others who do not like the way it turned out, but the conservatives did, in fact, win.  And while there is a lot of confusion over this as to how it must be done, the message that came in November 1994 was: ``We demand change. We don't want the status quo.''  Now we are seeing the defenders of the status quo on this floor talking about, ``Well, we can't do this. We can't have a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. We can't adopt the budget as proposed by the Republicans because it might incur a hardship on some of the people in this country.''  I would suggest, first of all, that we make it abundantly clear that the budget that is going to be proposed in both the other body and in this body does not have a cut in Medicare. As a matter of fact, it adds a bit in growth in Medicare. That growth is somewhere around 7.1 percent.  The President had a report from his trustees on Medicare. There are six of them. He appointed them. We are talking about people like Donna Shalala and people like the other Cabinet members. They reported to the President of the United States that if we do not do something about Medicare, Medicare will start into a deficit in the fiscal year of 1997 and will be broke, bankrupt, in the year 2002.  Now, there are a lot of people watching right now who, like me, will reach the age of 65 by the year 2002, and they have to understand that this is not a Republican suggestion or study that has developed the conclusion that it will go broke by the year 2002. These are the trustees of the Medicare system that were appointed by the President.  Now what has the President done since then? Where is the President? He has not even responded to that. And yet, he is adhering to his budget. Only yesterday, he announced he was going to veto the rescissions bill, which was a reduction in spending of $16.4 billion, the largest single reduction, I believe, in the history of this country. He says he is going to veto this reduction, the spending reductions.  I think it is just inconceivable that someone who ran for office on reducing spending, someone who ran on a balanced budget for this country, would now come up and say, in this fiscal year of 1995, the rescissions bill that has been proposed and that was passed by a majority of votes in the House and the Senate will be vetoed by the President of the United States.  I also think it is necessary for us to reaffirm our commitment to children. I hear over and over again about this program is going to be cut, or that program is going to be cut.  Yes, some programs are going to be cut and there are going to be some hardships if we do successfully balance the budget by the year 2002. But we cannot stand up here on the floor, as the Senator from Nevada did a few moments ago, and talk about the fact that every Senator, every one of the 100 Senators here in the U.S. Senate, wants to have a balanced budget by the year 2002 and not do anything today to bring it about.  You know, this is an exciting time. Right now, this week, we are going to be debating, and next week we probably will have a vote in both bodies on a budget that will eliminate the deficit by the year 2002.  I heard Congressman DeLay talk about the fact that he has been waiting his entire life for this moment to come. And all of those who voted for a major change on November 8, 1994, this is the change. Of all the things that that mandate said to Congress from the American people, it said we want less Government intrusion in our lives. It said that we want to do something about keeping America strong in its defense. But, first and foremost, it said, we want to balance the budget.  I had an experience the other day when we had our National Prayer Breakfast. When I left the House, I was president of the House Prayer Breakfast, so I was kind of in charge, I say to the Senator, of the international visitors.  There was a gentleman who came into our National Prayer Breakfast from Moldavia. He was beaming from ear to ear. He came up to me and he said, ``Senator, we are so proud. We now have a free economy. We have been under communism for all these years, now we have democracy. But I have a question to ask you. In America, how much can you keep?"  And I said, ``I'm sorry, I don't think I understand your question.'' He said, ``In America, how much does the Government take from you?"  Then I understood what he was saying, and so I gave him a figure that I would hate to have to stand here and try to justify.  But he said, very proudly, ``In Moldavia, when we go out and we earn a dollar, we get to keep 20 cents.''  They have some kind of a periodic collection. At the end of every month, they have to give 80 cents out of every dollar they earn to the Government. He was so proud they had reached that point.  I thought how fortunate we are in this country, until I realized and looked at the picture of my two grandchildren. And the CBO, and others in every study, no one has disagreed, said that if we do not do something to change the trend in this country of deficit spending, that anyone who is born today will have to spend 82 percent of his or her lifetime income to support the Government. And that is worse off than they are in Moldavia.  So I would just caution you, Mr. President, and others who may hear the stories of the bleeding hearts talking about all these Government programs that are going to be cut, to stop and realize, in most cases, that is not true at all. It is not the case of Social Security, it is not the case of Medicare, it is not the case of Medicaid.  And if, in fact, we could actually put a growth cap on Government, as I think one amendment by Senator Gramm is going to attempt to do, of 3.2 [[Page S6853]] percent, we end up balancing the budget without cutting one Federal program and without reducing one Federal program by merely putting caps on.  So I think we have to ask ourselves a question, Mr. President, not should we do this this week or next week, but what happens if we do not. Are we going to have another opportunity in the U.S. Senate or the other body to actually come up with a balanced budget? And we have to ask the question: Where will our children be if we do not vote properly?  I know there are well-meaning people on the other side of this. They say we want a balanced budget, they want to do something by the year 2002. I would like to do it sooner. Most of us would. But talking is one thing and doing is another thing.  It is not going to be easy, but I suggest to you, Mr. President--I know that my time is up and morning business up--I suggest to you, if we do not do it this time, we will probably not be able to do it in our lifetimes.  I yield back the remainder of my time.                          ____________________
