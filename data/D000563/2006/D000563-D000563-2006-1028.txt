This was Executive Order 13166, issued by President Clinton, which implemented the same title of the Civil Rights Act that I referred to. The Executive Order said that agencies of our Government had to make efforts to provide their services and materials to people with limited English proficiency.  Is it your intention with your amendment to, in any way, diminish the responsibilities and rights created by Executive Order 13166?
