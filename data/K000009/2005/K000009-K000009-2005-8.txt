Speaker, USA Today on the front of the business page has a major story: `` `Fundamentally broken' pension system in `crying need' of a fix: Even companies that play by the rules face shortfalls.'' It goes on to say that David Walker, the chief of Congress's nonpartisan Government Accountability Office, describes the pension system as ``fundamentally broken.''  Mr. Speaker, workers who dedicate years of service to a company should be able to count on a decent retirement and a measure of economic security. Yet in this time when more and more companies are reducing or dropping their defined benefit pension plans and retiree health coverage, worker earned benefits are often not guaranteed. This Congress must step up with meaningful pension reform to help shore up pension plans and encourage companies to continue providing them.  Unfortunately, a bill authored by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Boehner), who chairs the committee here in the House, is not that needed legislation.  It pays lip service to pension reform for workers, but continues to protect big corporate interests and executives at the expense of workers. It is my sincere hope that this Congress will produce legislation that is truly needed by America and by America's workers. Private pension plans are supposed to be one leg of a three-legged stool of retirement security for all American workers, along with Social Security. However, we live in an era when personal savings are virtually nonexistent, and Social Security's future is menaced by the specter of Republican plans to privatize Social Security. Therefore, workers have to try even harder to shore up increasingly fragile private pension plans.  Unfortunately, the Republican leaders in this Congress want to pass legislation which would actually further destabilize and underfund private pension plans. How in the world can they defend that approach?  Doehler-Jarvis, a company in my district, several years ago was the victim of a takeover where they had to cancel retiree health benefits, and they just did it over one weekend. They never even told the workers they were going to do it. When they filed liquidation bankruptcy, they pushed their obligations onto the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, which is going further and further into the red as I speak here this evening.  Though that was not a perfect solution, that was the only one that existed at that time. Recently, we have heard the announcement by Delphi, the largest U.S. automotive manufacturer, that they are going to declare bankruptcy; and that it is the largest filing of bankruptcy ever in the history of the automotive industry. It will have a significant impact on thousands and thousands of workers. And under the terms of their bankruptcy filing, Delphi is attempting to require its employees to take pay cuts as high as 63 percent and benefit cuts of up to 77 percent just, they say, to keep a few of their U.S. plants open.  The current Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation has a several billion dollar shortfall already. How in the world are they going to be able to try to hold things together without thatfund being shored up, whether it is to help Delphi or anyone else. Frankly, this Congress should have legislation passed that would disallow the bankruptcy system to be used by companies to abdicate their pension and health responsibilities.  However, given the recent flood of companies that have experienced pension problems or breakdowns, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation is no longer as fail-safe as it used to be. It had a $23 billion deficit last year, and since the time of President Clinton has continued to fall from a position of surplus to greater and greater deficit. The chairman of the committee, Mr. Boehner, dubs his plan the Pension Protection Plan; but it does nothing to prevent runaway pension plan terminations, nothing to provide meaningful disclosure and transparency, or ensure fairness to workers, while rewarding corporate executives. And it does nothing to adequately protect the workers pension plans.  Mr. Speaker, true pension reform legislation would repeal special protections for executives where they can receive these so-called golden parachutes while employees suffer deep cuts in their promised benefits. And the bill currently authored here says if an employer does not fund its pension plan above 80 percent, then workers cannot receive any increases in benefits or take a lump sum at retirement. No similar restriction is placed on executives.  And as the amount of guaranteed benefit goes down, for example if the employer does not fund above 60 percent, the workers' plan must be frozen with no new benefits allowed.  Mr. Speaker, America can do better than this. We ought to deep six the Boehner bill and allow the workers of this country to be able to receive the deferred compensation that was part of the contract that they signed when they went to work for America's largest corporations.                  [From the USA Today, Nov. 15, 2005]   ``Fundamentally Broken'' Pension System in `Crying Need' of a Fix                           (By Marilyn Adams)       Washington.--Most surviving American steelmakers long ago      abandoned costly pensions plans. But AK Steel still covers      most of its 7,500 workers with a plan that pays retirees a      monthly benefit based on tenure and past wages--a coveted      defined-benefit plan.       AK has never missed a benefit payment to a pensioner or a      payment to fund the plan. That's a source of pride for the      105-year-old Middletown, Ohio, company.       Nonetheless, the assets of the AK pension plan fall $1.3      billion short of meeting estimated future obligations. The      plan's long-term survival isn't assured.       Much of the attention in the raging pension-reform debate      in Congress and the executive branch focuses on big companies      such as United Airlines and other corporate giants that have      used Chapter 11 bankruptcy-court reorganization to dump      defined-benefit pension plans on the already overburdened      government insurer, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. But      it's also cases such as AK Steel--a relative corporate good      guy that has seen assets fall short of liabilities even while      the company follows the rules--that have reformers fearing a      possible financial catastrophe on the scale of the savings-     and-loan meltdown 15 years ago.       David Walker, chief of Congress' non-partisan Government      Accountability Office, describes the pension system as      ``fundamentally broken.'' He's frustrated that policymakers      so far have been unable to solve a problem that's been      documented over and over.       ``There's a crying need,'' he says.       Business, Congress and the Bush administration agree that      the U.S. system of private pensions is badly in need of      fixing. What they haven't agreed on is how to fix it. Despite      alarming statistics, years of studies and urgent calls for      reform from advocates on all sides, Rep. John Boehner, R-     Ohio, a sponsor of the pending House bill on pension reform,      rates chances of passage by both houses of Congress this year      as slim. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tenn., said      Monday that the Senate bill might reach that chamber's floor      by next week.       If Congress fails to act, ``The problem will become much      worse,'' said Bradley Belt, PBGC executive director. ``To      call upon taxpayers--most of whom don't have defined-benefit      pensions--to pay for the benefits of those who do would be      fundamentally unfair.''       In total, defined-benefit pension plans offered by private      employers are underfunded by $450 billion, up from $39      billion just five years ago. The PBGC itself has a deficit of      at least $23 billion. PBGC numbers coming out today are      expected to paint an even bleaker picture: The high number of      failed plans has left it without enough assets to cover      future benefits. As more plans fail, the agency's deficit      will grow.       In recent years, Huffy bicycles, Big Bear supermarkets,      Polaroid, Kaiser Aluminum, Bethlehem Steel, WestPoint      Stevens, Archibald Candy and United Airlines have terminated      their plans and transferred responsibility for them to the      PBGC. What worries PBGC officials now is how many other large      companies are out there with ailing plans covering tens of      thousands of workers.       The PBGC last year calculated that financially weak      companies with a reasonable chance of terminating their      pensions are $96 billion short of covering promised benefits.                              gm a concern       The PBGC won't say whether General Motors, whose pension      plan is the biggest in U.S. industry, is among them. But the      PBGC estimates that if financially troubled GM had to      terminate its plan soon, it would be underfunded by $31      billion, an estimate first reported by The New York Times.      Using a different accounting method, Credit Suisse First      Boston estimates the underfunding at $12.3 billion.       GM, whose plan covers 600,000 participants, disputes those      figures but declined to provide its own estimate. It is not      required by law to do so. ``We don't think it's appropriate      to view the pension plan on a termination basis,'' because GM      has no plan to end it, said GM spokesman Jerry Dubrowski.       The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, meanwhile, is      investigating how GM reports pension-plan liabilities in its      financial statements as part of a broader look into the      automaker's accounting.       PBGC director Belt fears the mounting pension crisis could      approach the scope of the savings-and-loan debacle that      pushed the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. into      insolvency in 1989 and cost taxpayers $200 billion.       If the PBGC, which is supported by insurance-premium      payments from pension-plan sponsors, were to sink too deeply      into red ink, a giant taxpayer bailout might be the only way      to keep millions of pensioners from losing their checks.       Stopgap pension relief for companies expires Dec. 31.      Without comprehensive reform legislation this year, temporary      rules will take effect that will increase the contributions      companies must make to their plans as well as the insurance      premiums they must pay the PBGC. U.S. Labor Secretary Elaine      Chao says the price of doing nothing about reform will be      ``very bad'' for plan sponsors.       The pension system in Corporate America is in trouble for      many reasons, some within the control of Washington      policymakers and some not.       Not the least of the problems is Americans' lengthening      life spans. Retirees are living longer than ever and will      draw pension checks longer than ever. The biggest generation      in history, the baby boom, starts hitting 65 in 2011. Making      things worse is that many pension plans let workers start      drawing benefits after 30 years of work. For many retirees,      that means benefits start in their 50s.       Another factor: Pension funds rely on assets that grow      through investments in stocks and bonds. For five years,      markets have produced lackluster returns.                          loopholes in the law       But Congress can do nothing about demographics or      investment returns. So reformers are focusing on loopholes in      the law--and some companies' willingness to exploit them to      avoid or reduce payments.       Private pensions are governed by the Employee Retirement      Income Security Act, passed in 1974 after the collapse of      automaker Studebaker a decade earlier, which left its      retirees almost empty-handed.       The law established the PBGC insurance program, which      covers benefits up to specific annual dollar limits--up to      $45,600 this year for someone retiring at 65--and requires      companies to pay premiums. Over the years, changes have crept      into the law designed to make it easier for firms to comply.       Among the issues that reform proposals address:       PBGC premiums. Almost everyone agrees that without higher      premiums and stricter funding rules, pension problems will      get worse. The Bush administration proposed $30 per worker      per year, up from $19 now.       Skipped payments. Rules allow employers to skip plan      payments by applying excess contributions from an earlier      year as an offset to the minimum requirement for a later      year--even if the plan is underfunded.       ``The combination of rules allows companies to go for years      on end without putting any money into their pension plans,''      says Belt.       US Airways, for example, made no contributions to its      pilots' pension plan for years before it was terminated in      2003.       Overpromising. Employers with underfunded plans are allowed      under current rules to sign labor contracts that promise      union members larger benefits that the companies can't      necessarily afford.       Secrecy. Every employer with a troubled plan is required to      tell the PBGC each year how underfunded the plan would be if      it had to be terminated. But the company is not required to      tell the people directly affected: workers and pensioners.      The PBGC is not allowed to tell.       Inadequate funding. PBGC's Belt says funding rules today      simply don't ensure that pension plans are fully funded.       Most controversial is an administration proposal to      penalize companies with poor credit ratings and underfunded      plans by accelerating their plan payments. The thinking is      that those companies are at higher     risk for pension default and should be required to do more to      keep plans afloat.                          `sky is not falling'       Boehner, The Ohio congressman, says such tough medicine      would ``kill the patient'' and prompt some employers to drop      their plans.       AK Steel, for example, says its credit rating has been      below investment grade for years, yet it has never missed a      payment.       Business groups such as the National Association of      Manufacturers acknowledged pension rules require tightening.      But they question the administration's alarming projections      and say companies with pension problems don't represent the      majority.       ``Our message is the pension sky is not falling,'' says NAM      spokesman Darren McKinney. ``The problem is not as big as      some would have you believe.''       He says the PBGC's statistics show only 15% of private      defined-benefit plans were funded below 70% in 2002, the      latest data available.       What seems to gall reformers most is the recent pattern of      big companies using Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code to      jettison the debt of underfunded pension plans, then exit      bankruptcy and survive. U.S. Airways did it, and United is in      the process. Huff and Big Bear did the same in the bankruptcy      court.       Now, reformers fear Delta Air Lines, Northwest Airlines and      auto-parts maker Delphi, all of which filed Chapter 11 cases      recently, will make the same argument to their bankruptcy-     court judges.       ``People are using the pension system and bankruptcy code      as a business strategy,''charges Walker of GAO.                        ak steel feels penalized       AK Steel agrees. It has seen plenty of competitors unload      their plans. AK says its pension and retiree medical costs      make its steel at least $40 a ton more costly to produce than      some of its competitors'.       ``We are penalized because we didn't go bankrupt,'' says      Vice President Alan McCoy.       So, AK has been going to its unions during contract talks,      asking them to agree to freeze members' pension plans so      benefits don't keep growing and so new employees aren't      covered. Three unions, representing 20% of AK's unionized      workforce, have agreed.       ``They told us they needed that relief to stay competitive      and stay out of bankruptcy,'' says Tim Imes, president of the      United Steelworkers union in Ashland, KY, that represents AK      workers there. Given pension-plan terminations at Bethlehem      Steel, National Steel and elsewhere, the union knew ``the      monster was real.''       AK officials say they still believe in good pensions but      can't ignore their competition.       ``We are disturbed that the bankruptcy system allows what      has happened to happen,'' says McCoy. ``We don't think that's      right.''                          ____________________
