President, I am honored to rise today to acknowledge and celebrate the 179th anniversary of Greek Independence. On March 25, 1821, courageous Greeks, poorly armed but imbued with an ancient calling for democracy, initiated a revolution that would successfully end 400 years of oppression by the Ottoman Empire. I am proud to join my distinguished colleagues as a cosponsor of Senator Specter's Senate Resolution 251 which designates Saturday ``Greek Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and American Democracy.''  The achievements of Greek civilization in art, architecture, science, philosophy, mathematics, and literature became legacies for succeeding generations living around the world. But it was the idea of democracy, born in Athens over two thousand five hundred years ago, that signaled the beginning of a lasting revolution to which we as Americans are eternally grateful.  As citizens of the United States, we are proud to recognize the contributions of Greek culture in the creation of our great nation. The Founding Fathers, deeply inspired and influenced by Hellenic ideals, developed our representative democracy from the example of the ancient Greeks. As U.S. democracy flourished, its principles inspired citizens in other nations, sparking revolutions across time and space, from France in 1789 to Portugal in 1974.  As vital as the culture of ancient Greece was to the formation of our nation, modern Greek culture continues to enrich our society today. I can speak firsthand of the significant contributions that Greek-Americans make in my home state of Rhode Island. They serve our communities in many professions and continue to contribute to the state through their hard work and active citizenship.  Greece's commitment to democracy has been essential in fostering stability and supporting the ideals of freedom and equality among its neighbors in the Balkans and in the Mediterranean region. Today, the United States supports Greece in its call for fellowship and peace in the Balkan peninsula and on the divided island of Cyprus. I applaud the Greek people for their commitment to the protection of democratic principles in these regions.  Therefore, on the day marking the 179th anniversary of the revolution for independence, I congratulate all Greeks and Greek-Americans and express my appreciation for their contributions and those of their ancestors.                          ____________________
