 President, I am a cosponsor of amendment No. 2268 to S. Con. Res. 86 introduced by Senator kempthorne, expressing the Sense of the Senate that funding for the Market Access Program (MAP) should be fully maintained as authorized and aggressively utilized by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to encourage U.S. agricultural exports, strengthen farm income, counter subsidized foreign competition, and protect American jobs.  The MAP is an important trade promoting program that truly benefits the diverse agriculture of Washington state and the nation. The MAP is a partnership with private agriculture to promote U.S. agricultural goods around the world. It helps to level the playing field for our growers in a global marketplace made increasingly competitive by subsidies foreign governments provide to their growers.  This Sense of the Senate resolution corrects the misguided direction of the Budget Committee to cut the MAP. This proposed cut was one among many reasons that I voted against this Budget Resolution when it was passed out of the Budget Committee.  Since moving towards market-based agricultural programs under the 1996 FAIR Act, research and trade have become the new safety net for our growers. Without continuous and vigorous trade promotion, our growers will see market share decline and farmgate prices drop. Our growers are already suffering under depressed prices, they need us to maintain the MAP and other agricultural trade initiatives to remain competitive. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
