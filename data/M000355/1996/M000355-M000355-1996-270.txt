 President, I rise today to congratulate the members of Southeast Christian Church on the success of their first newspaper, the Southeast Outlook. The Outlook was created because the church's newsletter could no longer communicate sufficiently to the 10,000 members of Southeast Christian.  The first issue of the paper was published September 1, 1995, and averages about 20 to 28 pages a week. The Outlook lets people who are part of the congregation get to know each other--which is not easy in a church that is, as an elder of the church put it, ``larger than most towns in Kentucky.'' The paper focuses on church events, ministries, and members of the congregation, as well as issues of State, local, and national interest.  The Outlook has profiled everyone from its elders to the chief custodian to a church member who turned to God after a suicide attempt. Church members can also keep informed about the congregation's wall-to-wall activities. Publisher and editor Ninie O'Hara has said, ``Now that we have a product, our phone rings off the hook. We have 10,000 people at Southeast, and they're all out in the world doing things.''  O'Hara has been a newspaper publisher and editor in Kentucky since 1979. Steve Lowery, who hired O'Hara for her first job in journalism, said of her, ``She is in my opinion the best writer that we had at our company and one of the best writers in the State of Kentucky.'' O'Hara turned down a better paying job from the Lexington Herald-Leader to take the job at Southeast last summer.  O'Hara said of the Outlook:       [The paper] lets the outside world look into Southeast      Christian Church and see hey, these people . . . have the      same pressures and stresses as us. But they're dealing with      it differently because of the presence of God. If they like      what they see . . . maybe they'll come and join us.  Mr. President, I ask you and my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to the congregation of Southeast Christian Church and congratulating them on the success of their newspaper.                          ____________________
