President, this amendment would raise the LIHEAP spending to the authorized total of $5.1 billion. I wish to recognize the work of Senator Specter and Senator Harkin, who earlier today passed an amendment that increased LIHEAP funding. I have worked very closely with my colleagues, especially Senator Collins.  Let me point out what is obvious to everyone today: Oil reached $111 a barrel. That translates very quickly into excruciatingly high prices for seniors or low-income Americans. LIHEAP is a program that can help them. I would urge passage.  I see my colleague, Senator Collins, on the other side.
