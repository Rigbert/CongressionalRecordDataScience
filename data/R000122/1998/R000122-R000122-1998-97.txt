President, I am proud to join with my colleague from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold, submitting this resolution which addresses the unfolding events in Indonesia.  On Thursday, President Suharto resigned his position after leading Indonesia for thirty-two years. His action was a response to civil unrest and economic turmoil which reached a crescendo in the past few weeks. President Suharto is to be commended for heeding the call of the Indonesian people for change, for avoiding further bloodshed, and for permitting a change of leadership in accordance with the constitutional processes of Indonesia.  Now, it is time for change. The people of Indonesia and the world have called for it. The United States should do everything in its power to encourage and support the new political leadership of Indonesia to implement reforms.  Most importantly, we are on the threshold of the chance to resolve the question of East Timor. In 1975, Indonesia invaded East Timor. For over two decades that land has been wracked by fear, suppression, torture and death. Approximately one third of the population has been killed. The United Nations has called again and again for a just, comprehensive and internationally acceptable solution in East Timor, but to no avail.  Mr. President, we must seize this opportunity. The oppression of East Timor must end. The people of East Timor have a right to self-determination. They, and the people of Indonesia, deserve to live securely in economic, political and physical freedom.  Against overwhelming odds, the people of Indonesia and East Timor have bravely fought for their rights and caused a powerful leader to resign. The United States if obligated to support them and encourage the new leadership of Indonesia to institute genuine democratic and economic reforms, promote and protect the human rights of the citizens, and respect the right of the people of East Timor to self-determination. I join Senator Feingold in urging the Senate to adopt this resolution.                          ____________________
