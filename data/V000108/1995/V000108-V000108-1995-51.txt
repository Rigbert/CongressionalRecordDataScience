Speaker, I urge adoption of House Resolution 80.  As an original cosponsor of the Kaptur resolution of inquiry, I am very concerned about maintaining the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches of government. I am also very concerned about safeguarding this institution's prerogative of the purse.  Today's vote is our first real opportunity to protect America's wallets and reclaim our constitutional authority regarding the Mexican bailout. Given the magnitude of the Mexican bailout and the exposure of the American taxpayers I believe that congressional approval should have been sought originally. Sure, it would have been a tough sell. But coming in after something goes wrong will be impossible.  Barring that, the disclosure called for in this resolution of inquiry is eminently reasonable.  I urge passage of the resolution so that we can find out what the Mexican bailout really means for the American taxpayers.
