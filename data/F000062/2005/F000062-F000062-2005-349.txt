 Let me give you an example, a case in point of what that means. That case in point was presented by Senator Kennedy on the Fall River placement of an LNG facility in the heart of river territory in Massachusetts. Three schools are in the area, with 9,000 people in the immediate area. It was opposed by the State government and every local city and town. But the FERC staff recommended the project go forward in the final environmental impact report.  FERC is no guardian of safety. This is a case in point to give Governors some authority.
