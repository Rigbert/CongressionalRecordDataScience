 President, I do not think there is any issue which we deal with that more clearly sums up the differences of the two parties toward American participation in politics than the issue of campaign finance reform.  Make no mistake about it, Mr. President, this is a partisan issue. The Republican National Committee opposes the bill. The Democratic National Committee supports the bill. So there is nothing particularly bipartisan about the bill. There are a few Republicans who support it and a few Democrats who oppose it, but the heart of the matter is, this is a very partisan matter as currently presented to the Senate.  Why is it partisan? It is partisan, Mr. President, because Republicans for the most part, accompanied by some interesting allies, from the ACLU to the National Education Association, believe there is nothing inappropriate about American citizens participating in the political process. We think that ought to be applauded, not condemned. We are not offended by those exercising their rights to petition the Congress, those exercising their right to engage in free speech. We do not think that is bad for America, Mr. President. We think it is good for America.  Whether our opponents on the other side of the aisle like it or not, the Supreme Court has been very clear that the speech of political candidates cannot be restricted. Thank God for Buckley versus Valeo, one of the great decisions in the history of the Supreme Court.  The speech of candidates should not be restricted. That is an extremely important principle, Mr. President. After all, if we make the candidates shut up and if we make the people who want to support them shut up, who controls the discourse, the debate? Why, someone else. Where will this transfer of power go? One place it will go, obviously, is to the newspapers, most of whom love this legislation because they realize it will enhance their power as the campaigns' power to communicate is diminished. So they think this is a terrific idea.  Many of the large membership interest groups are not particularly worried about this legislation because they know you cannot constitutionally restrict their ability to communicate with their own members, what we call nonparty soft money, or in any real way restrict their ability to communicate with the public, what we call independent expenditures, both of which, or the latter of which is certainly protected by the Buckley case.  So what this is all about, Mr. President, is who gets to speak and how much--who gets to speak and how much--and whether or not private citizens can continue to band together and support candidates of their choice.  It is said that too much is spent, which means to say there is too much speech in the American political system. My view is that it is not inappropriate to ask, when you say too much is being spent--compared to what? In the last cycle we spent about as much on political speech as we did on bubble gum. Put another way, $3.74 per voter in the last cycle. I would argue, Mr. President, that is not too much political speech--not too much political speech.  Then they say, the public is clamoring for this reform. A comprehensive poll by the Tarrance polling group back in April of 1996 asked that question in a variety of different ways. Suffice it to say, one person out of the 1,000 interviewed thought this was an important issue confronting the country. There is no clamoring for this. Theinterest in this all depends on how you ask the question. If you ask the question: Do you think it is a good idea to restrict my right to participate in the political process? Obviously, people are not in favor of that.  There has been some debate about whether this is constitutional. Let me say maybe the other side has been able to scrape up a few people with a law degree calling this constitutional, but the heavies in this field do not think it is. The American Civil Liberties Union--sometimes we love them; sometimes we hate them, but, boy, do they know a lot about the first amendment and have had a lot of success over the years in this country. They believe this matter is clearly and unambiguously unconstitutional.  Assuming it could get past the constitutional problems, Mr. President, pushing all these people out of the process and putting a speech limit on the campaigns, how would those speech limits be enforced? By, of course, the Federal Election Commission, which would soon be the size of the Veterans Administration trying to restrict the free speech of not only 535 additional political races, but also of a bunch of outsiders who might inadvertently band together and try to speak. So the FEC is given injunctive relief, so it can go into court and shut people up who are engaging in speech that the Government does not want to be expressed.  That is what this bill is about--building a massive Federal bureaucracy to restrict the speech of candidates and of groups in this country. This is one of the worst ideas we have debated around here since the last time a proposal like this was up on the Senate floor.  The Court said very clearly, if you want to try to entice campaigns into shutting up, and the Government wants to say it is not good for candidates to speak more than a certain amount--we see that in the Presidential system and the nightmare that has become. As Senator Gorton pointed out yesterday, there is only one person in America who is told to shut up at that point, and that is one of two candidates who is running for President, Bob Dole. That is what we ought to be reforming, the Presidential system.  But the Court said, if you want to entice people into shutting up, not speaking too much, you can offer them some kind of subsidy, a Federal subsidy. So the Presidential system says to the candidates running for President: You can only raise $1,000 per person. So, when looking at that difficult task of trying to put together a nationwide campaign at $1,000 a person, every candidate virtually, except Ross Perot and John Connally, has said, ``OK. I'll shut up. You bought me off. There is no way I can possibly raise enough money to run at $1,000 a person.'' Then they get the Federal subsidy.  In this bill, in order to allow the sponsors to claim that there is no taxpayer money in it, they shift the subsidy to a couple of private industries. They say, we are going to call on the broadcasting industry to reduce the prices for political ads by 50 percent. What will happen? Why, of course, they will pass on the cost of that to all the other people advertising. So those taxpayers are going to have to pay more for their product because of the Government-mandated program.  There is a second industry that is affected by this as well, Mr. President. That is the people who use the mails. There is a postal subsidy in here. The Postmaster General wrote me yesterday saying he opposed this. Of course, the Direct Marketing Association opposes this. Of course, the National Association of Broadcasters opposes this. They are not particularly interested in having to reach into the coffers of their businesses to pay for political views with which they might disagree.  So getting back to the direct mail subsidy, the rates of everybody else who uses the Postal Service are going to be increased so a subsidy can be provided by those taxpayers to support the expression of views with which they may disagree.  So, Mr. President, spending limits are not free. There is no way to concoct, under the Buckley case, any effort to shut people up that does not have some cost. You can shift it around and kind of claim it is not part of the Treasury. You can assess a business maybe. But they are not free.  So what is wrong with this bill? Just about everything you can think of. It is based on the fallacious assumption that too much is being spent. It is based on the notion that the public is clamoring for it. Neither of those propositions is true. It assumes there is some way to level the political playing ground for everyone, which is impossible to achieve. It is unconstitutional, clearly and obviously. It would create a gargantuan Federal Election Commission with the mission to shut people up all across America. It would call upon two industries, the broadcast industry and the direct mail postal users, to pay for the price of all of this big Government.  For all of these reasons, obviously, Mr. President, this bill should be defeated. The way to defeat this bill is to vote ``no'' on cloture.  Mr. President, I have a variety of magazine articles that have come out against this bill, including Weekly Standard, the Wall Street Journal, Rollcall, the National Review, and the Baltimore Sun, and I ask unanimous consent that the editorials be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Wall Street Journal, Nov. 16, 1995]                      The Man Who Ruined Politics       So Colin Powell is not running for President. Neither is      Jack Kemp, Bill Bradley, Dick Cheney, Sam Nunn or William      Bennett. Voters are left with the likely choice between two      rather tired war horses, Bill Clinton and Bob Dole. No other      Democrat is challenging an obviously vulnerable incumbent,      and Republican contenders such as Phil Gramm, Pat Buchanan      and Lamar Alexander hover in single digits. In this second      rank we now also have millionaire publisher Steve Forbes, who      started from nowhere to grab the first rung on the ladder.      And of course, billionaire Ross Perot still haunts the scene.       If you don't like the remaining field, blame Fred      Wertheimer and Common Cause, the organization he until      recently ran and still animates, are the principal architects      of the cockamamie financial gauntlet we inflict on our      potential leaders. Common Cause is point-lobby for the goo-     goos, that is, the earnest folks always trying to jigger the      rules to ensure good government. One of their conceits is      that money is the root of all political evil, so they seek      salvation in the Sisyphean task of eliminating its influence.      The chief result of this is a rule outlawing individual      political contributions of more than $1,000, and a      bureaucracy called the Federal Election Commission to count      angels on pinheads in deciding, for example, what counts as a      contribution.       A serious Presidential campaign is likely to cost $20      million. This means a potential Presidential has to start by      persuading 20,000 different people to pony up a grand. Take      an arbitrary but probably generous hit rate of 5%, and he (or      she) has to pass the tin cup 400,000 times. Admittedly these      numbers oversimplify, but they give you the idea. Mr.      Wertheimer's brainstorm means fund-raising is so consuming      that candidates have no time for anything else. Even more      important, it is a process virtually designed to drain a      potential President of any residue of self-respect.       This may not be the only thing General Powell means when he      says running requires a fire he does not yet feel, but it is      certainly a big one. His adviser Richard Armitage explicitly      said, ``Colin Powell going out and asking people for money      and then spending all that money wasn't attractive.'' Mr.      Kemp was similarly explicit in not wanting to undertake the      fund-raising exercise, and it no doubt inhibited Mr. Cheney      as well. On the Democratic side, finding 20,000 donors to      challenge an incumbent is an even more daunting challenge;      Senator Bradley and Senator Nunn decided to quit rather than      fight.       It is no accident that the dropouts are precisely the types      the goo-goo crowd would like to keep in politics, which is to      say, those motivated by principle instead of sheer ambition.      In 1988, to take an earlier example, the exploratory field      included Don Rumsfield, who had been a Congressman, White      House Chief of Staff, Defense Secretary and a spectacularly      successful corporate chief executive. But he threw in the      towel rather than run up possibly unpayable debts--``as a      matter of principle, I will not run on a deficit.''       The doleful effect of such limitations were entirely      predictable; indeed, they were predicted right here. As early      as 1976, when the Supreme Court partly upheld the 1974      Federal Election Campaign Act, we wrote that the law ``will      probably act like the Frankenstein's monster it truly is. It      will be awfully hard to kill, and the more you wound it, the      more havoc it will create.'' In the face of hard experience,      of course, the goo-goos prescribe more of the same, to the      point where ``campaign finance reform'' has become the Holy      Grail.       To be fair, the Wertheimer coven hasn't had its way      entirely. The logic of the goo-goo impulse is public      financing of political campaigns, an idea mostly hooted down      by the same taxpayers who eagerly embrace term limits--though      in Presidential campaigns public finance serves as the carrot     getting candidates to accept the FEC nit-picking. And the      Supreme Court, while backing away from the obvious conclusion      that limiting political expenditures is prima facie an      infringement of free speech, couldn't bring itself to say      someone can't spend his own money on his own campaign.       Thus the millionaire's loophole. Mr. Perot was able to use      his billions to confuse the last Presidential elections,      going in, out and back in at will. So long as he doesn't      accept public money, he can spend as he likes.       Mr. Forbes is an even more interesting case, since he was      chairman of Empower America, the political roost of both Mr.      Kemp and Mr. Bennett. Who would have guessed a year ago, the      latter asks, that the Empower America candidate would be      Steve Forbes. On the issues Mr. Forbes is perhaps an even      better candidate than his colleagues--backing term limits      where Mr. Kemp opposes them, for example--and without his      message his money wouldn't do much good. Still, to have a      better chance at ultimately winning, it would have been      logical for him to bankroll one of his better-known      colleagues. But that's against the law, thanks to Mr.      Wertheimer, so Mr. Forbes has to hit the stump himself.       With widespread disaffection with the current field, and      especially in the wake of the Powell withdrawal, the lunacy      of the current rules is coming to be recognized. The emperor      has no clothes, think tank scholars are starting to say--     notably Bradley A. Smith of the Cato Institute, whose views      were published here Oct. 6. Following Mr. Smith, Newt      Gingrich said last weekend we don't spend too much on      political campaigns but too little. This heresy was applauded      this week by columnist David Broder, which may herald a      breakthrough in goo-goo sentiment itself.       Formidable special interests, of course, remain opposed to      change in the current rules. Notably political incumbents who      want campaigns kept as quiet as possible and have learned to      milk other special interests who want access. So rather than      having some maverick millionaire funding his pet candidate on      reasons that might relate to ideas and issues, we have all      parties funded by Dwayne Andreas and his sisters and his      cousins and his aunts, better to protect ethanol subsidies.      Finally, of course, we have Mr. Perot and his United We Stand      hell-bent for further restrictions on campaign finance,      better to protect the political process for billionaires like      himself.       Not so, thankfully, Mr. Forbes, who sees campaign spending      limits as an incumbent protection device. He recently told an      Iowa audience, ``If Congress abolished the franking      privilege, then I'd be impressed.'' Lift the caps on giving      and spending, but make sure everything is disclosed, he says.      ``That's real reform.''                                                                    ____              [From the Wall Street Journal, Feb. 2, 1996]                          Ruining Politics--II       Not long ago these columns described how the crazy      campaign-finance reforms dreamed up by the likes of Fred      Wertheimer and Common Cause have been ruining politics.      Oregon voters just got another such lesson in their special      Senate election this week.       Democrats are understandably pleased with their narrow      (less than 1% margin) victory, but so too are the Sierra      Club, the League of Conservation Voters (LCV), the Teamsters,      the gay and lesbian lobby, the public-employee unions, NARAL      (the abortion rights outfit), the National Council of Senior      Citizens and the AFL-CIO. All of these liberal groups weighed      in with what campaign finance laws call ``independent      expenditures'' on behalf of Democrat Ron Wyden. Call this the      Common Cause loophole.       In the world of campaign reformers, money is the root of      all evil. So they spend their time denouncing candidates who      raise it for bending to ``special interests.'' Yet what the      reformers won't advertise is that there's nothing much they      can do about the special interests who decide to spend money      on their own.       As they did to great effect in Oregon. The AFL says it      devoted 35 full-time professionals and sent out 350,000      pieces of partisan mail for the cause. The Sierra Club and      LCV spent $200,000 on 30,000 postcards, 100,000 telephone      calls and very tough TV and radio spots accusing Republican      Gordon Smith of ``voting against . . . groundwater      protection, clean air, pesticide limits, recycling.''       The topper was a Teamster radio spot, run on seven stations      in five cities, that in effect accused Mr. Smith of being an      accomplice to murder because a 14-year-old boy died in an      accident at one of his companies. ``Gordon Smith owns      companies where workers get hurt and killed. He has      repeatedly violated the law. Those are the facts.''       In fact, the young worker had died after a fall in a grain      elevator while being supervised by his father, who still      works for Mr. Smith and doesn't blame him. An analysis of the      ad in the liberal Oregonian newspaper essentially concluded      that the whole thing was false. (By the way, the ad was the      work of consultant Henry Sheinkopf, who is part of Bill      Clinton's re-election team this year and likes to say he      believes in the politics of ``terror.'' We trust Mr. Clinton      will soon give him his post-Oklahoma City ``civility'' speech      to read.)       Even Mr. Wyden felt compelled to criticize the rhetoric of      the ad, but since it wasn't run by his campaign, he couldn't      be blamed for it, even as it cut up his opponent. That's the      beauty of these ``independent expenditures'': They work for a      candidate without showing his fingerprints. Mr. Wyden even      took the high road earlier this month and announced that both      candidates should stop negative campaigning, while his allies      kept dumping garbage on Mr. Smith through the mail and on the      airwaves!       Now, we understand that Republicans do this, too. The NRA      doesn't play beanbag. And as a millionaire businessman, Mr.      Smith was able to spend enough of his own money to answer      this stuff in his campaign. But candidates who aren't      millionaires have to find money somewhere else, which means      from people and interests that have money. Yet if Mr.      Wertheimer and Common Cause get their way, nonrich candidates      would find their ability to raise that money drastically      limited. The special interests would still be able to sling      their junk, while a candidate would lack the cash to respond.       Something very much like this probably cost Republicans the      governorship last year in Kentucky, where the AFL spent      lavishly for the Democrat but the Republican was hemmed in by      spending limits. And, of course, operations such as the AFL      or the teachers unions have an unlimited supply of money from      forced union dues, while other liberal special-interest      groups get taxpayer subsidies that Republican Senators like      Vermont's Jim Jeffords are refusing to kill. (Question: What      does Mr. Jeffords have against electing other Republicans?)      If Congress tried to restrict such ``independent'' spending      in some new reform, the Supreme Court would probably (and      rightly) strike it down as a violation of the First      Amendment.       The bigger point here is that John McCain, Fred Thompson,      Linda Smith and other Republicans who've joined up with      Common Cause need to rethink their allegiances. They're      lending credibility to an exercise that is sure to backfire      on their party, if not on them, and probably on our      democracy. How ironic it would be if, in the name of      controlling special interests, our sanctimonious reformers      merely made them more powerful.  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record testimony on the constitutionality of the broadcast provisions in the bill prepared for the National Association of Broadcasters.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:     Constitutional Infirmities of Pending Political Broadcasting                               Legislation   (Prepared for National Association of Broadcasters by P. Cameron  DeVore, Gregory J. Kopta, Robert W. Lofton, of Davis Wright Tremaine)                                summary       Pending Congressional campaign finance reform legislation      would substantially expand federal political candidates'      ``reasonable access'' to broadcast time, raising fundamental      issues under both the First and Fifth Amendments to the      United States Constitution. Several bills would require      broadcasters to provide free and/or heavily discounted time      to political candidates as an incentive for candidates to      voluntarily comply with campaign spending limits. The goal of      this legislation apparently is to reduce the cost of federal      election campaigns for House and Senate seats and thereby      enhance the integrity of the electoral process.       By requiring broadcasters to finance political candidates,      the pending legislation would compel broadcasters to engage      in protected speech. Such a requirement could only be      justified by compelling necessity, and then only if precisely      tailored to the government's interest. Mandating that      broadcasters, rather than candidates, pay to communicate      partisan political messages would not advance the      government's interest in enhancing the integrity of the      electoral process. In addition, the government could advance      that interest more effectively through numerous alternatives      that do not involve encroachments on First Amendment      freedoms.       Broadcasters historically have been subject to more      restrictions than have other media on their constitutionally      protected editorial discretion, but the traditional rationale      of spectrum scarcity no longer justified singling out      broadcasters for reduced First Amendment protection,      particularly in light of the multiplicity of other outlets      for diverse viewpoints. The pending legislation nevertheless      could not survive even the ``intermediate scrutiny''      requirements of narrow tailoring to a substantial      government purpose. Compelling broadcasters to finance      political campaigns would bear no relationship to      broadcasters' public interest duties, and would upset the      delicate balance between their journalistic freedoms and      their obligations as licensees of the public airwaves. By      singling out broadcasting from other media and usurping      broadcast facilities and time, the proposed legislation      also denies broadcasters equal protection of the law and      takes their property without just compensation, in      violation of the Fifth Amendment.       For all of these reasons, it is our view that those aspects      of the pending legislation that require broadcasters to      provide free or subsidized time for political candidates'      speech would likely be held unconstitutional by the courts.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printedin the Record a constitutional analysis conducted for the National Right to Life Committee.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                          Bopp, Coleson & Bostrom,                                             Attorneys at Law,                                Terre Haute, IN, November 7, 1995.     Re: Senate Campaign Finance Reform Act of 1995.     David O'Steen, Ph.D.,     National Right to Life Committee,     Washington, DC.       Dear Dr. O'Steen: You have asked me, as General Counsel for      the National Right to Life Committee (``NRLC''), to evaluate      the proposed Senate Campaign Finance Reform Act of 1995      (``The Act''). We have done so.       Based on our evaluation, we recommend that NRLC oppose the      Act because of the effects it would have on NRLC activities.      These are set forth below.                              SECTION 201       Section 201 would abolish connected political action      committees (``PACs''). The Act prohibits membership      corporations, such as National Right to Life, from having a      connected PAC. This would abolish National Right to Life PAC.      This would severely affect the ability of NRLC to influence      federal elections because NRLC would not have a connected      PAC.       Section 201 also permits only individuals or political      committees organized by candidates and political parties to      solicit contributions or make expenditures ``for the purpose      of influencing an election for Federal office.'' This appears      to do two things.       First, it appears to prohibit independent PACs, so that      persons associated with NRLC couldn't create an independent      PAC to do express advocacy for or against candidates.       Second, it also appears to bar nonprofit, nonstock,      ideological organizations--which under FEC v. Massachusetts      Citizens for Life, 479 U.S. 238 (1986), could do independent      expenditures--from making such independent expenditures on      behalf of or in opposition to candidates.                              section 251       Assuming that under the Act independent expenditures can be      done by someone other than an individual,\1\ so that NRLC      still could have a PAC capable of making contributions and      expenditures to influence an election, there remains a      problem. The problem is with the definition of independent      expenditure in the Act.---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \1\ There is a way this could happen. Apparently due to      concerns about the constitutionality of what Section 201 of      the bill does (Sec. 324 of the FECA), the Act creates a fall-     back position for times when those provisions might not be in      effect, i.e., might be enjoined for unconstitutionality. This      fall-back provision is that during the time when the ban on      connected and independent PACs might be enjoined from      enforcement the total that a candidate can receive from a      ``multicandidate'' PAC is ``20 percent of the aggregate      Federal election spending limits applicable to the candidate      for the election cycle.'' Thus, the fallback is that if      connected and independent PACs cannot be abolished      altogether, then the total contributions from such PACs would      be capped. Under this provision, the ability of NRL PAC to      contribute to federal candidates would be severely affected.---------------------------------------------------------------------------       The Act defines ``independent expenditure'' as an      expenditure containing ``express advocacy'' made without the      participation of a candidate. ``Express advocacy'' is defined      extremely broadly:       ``18(A) The term ``express advocacy'' means when a      communication is taken as a whole and with limited reference      to external events, an expression of support for or      opposition to a specific candidate, to a specific group of      candidates, or to candidates of a particular party.       ``(B) The term ``expression of support for or opposition      to'' includes a suggestion to take action with respect to an      election, such as to vote for or against, make      contributions to, or participate in campaign activity, or      to refrain from taking action.''       This extremely broad definition of ``express advocacy''      would sweep in protected issue advocacy which NRLC does, such      as voter guides. For example, criticizing a candidate for his      or her proabortion stand near an election time would fall      within the express advocacy definition because it would      constitute ``an expression of . . . opposition to a specific      candidate.'' This phrase goes far beyond what the United      States Supreme Court said was permissible to regulate as      electioneering in the case of Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1      (1976). In Buckley, the Supreme Court held that in order to      protect issue advocacy (which is protected by the First      Amendment), government may only regulate election activity      where there are explicit words advocating the election or      defeat of a clearly identified candidate.       In sum, these provisions of the Act would prevent NRLC from      engaging in constitutionally-protected issue advocacy.                              section 306       Section 306 of the Act authorizes an injunction where there      is a ``substantial likelihood that a violation . . . is . . .      about to occur.'' Thus, the FEC would be authorized to seek      injunctions against expenditures which, in the FEC's      expansive view, could influence an election. Such a      preemptive action against speech is an unconstitutional prior      restraint and is unconstitutional except in the case of      national security or similarly weighty situations. Prior      restraint should never be allowed in connection with core      political speech. There simply is no governmental interest of      sufficient magnitude to justify the government stopping      persons from speaking. Because prior restraints of speech are      so repugnant to the Constitution, the usual remedy is to      impose penalties after the speech is done, if a violation of      law occurred in connection with the speech.       Therefore, under the Act, the Federal Election Commission      would be authorized to pursue injunctions against the      political speech of persons or organizations suspected of      violating the Act. This means that NRLC would be subject to a      prior restraint of its speech, even issue advocacy, on the      eve of an important election. Given its history of expansive      readings of its powers to regulate constitutionally-protected      speech, the Federal Election Commission should never be      handed the weapon of prior restraint.       As stated at the beginning, there are severe problems with      the Act. The Act would profoundly alter NRLC's ability to      affect federal elections. Therefore, we recommend that      National Right to Life Committee oppose the Act.           Sincerely,     James Bopp, Jr.     Richard E. Coleson.  Mr. McCONNELL. In addition, I have individual columnists like George Will and David Broder who have expressed opposition to various parts of this measure, and I ask unanimous consent that those columns be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                     [From Newsweek, Apr. 15, 1996]                       Civic Speech Gets Rationed                          (By George F. Will)       Surveying the constitutional and political damage done by      two decades of campaign finance ``reforms,'' friends of the      First Amendment feel like the man (in a Peter De Vries novel)      who said ``In the beginning the earth was without form and      void. Why didn't they leave well enough alone?'' Reformers      should repent by repealing their handiwork and vowing to sin      no more. Instead, they are proposing additional constrictions      of freedom that would further impoverish the nation's civic      discourse.       The additions would be the Forbes-Perot Codicils, abridging      the right of a rich person to use his or her money to seek      elective office. This will be called ``closing a loophole.''      To reformers, a ``loophole'' is any silence of the law that      allows a sphere of political expression that is not yet under      strict government regulation.       Jack Kemp, Bill Bennett, Dan Quayle, Dick Cheney and      Carroll Campbell are among the Republicans who were deterred      from seeking this year's presidential nomination in part by      the onerousness of collecting the requisite funding in      increments no larger than $1,000. You may or may not regret      the thinness of the Republican field this year, but does      anyone believe it is right for government regulations to      restrict important political choices?       There are restrictions on the amounts individuals can give      to candidates and on the amounts that candidates who accept      public funding can spend. Limits on individuals' giving force      candidates who are less wealthy than Forbes or Perot to      accept public funding. Such restrictions are justified as      necessary to prevent corruption and promote political      equality. But Prof. Bradley A. Smith of Capital University      Law School in Columbus, Ohio, demolishes such justifications      in an article in The Yale Law Journal, beginning with some      illuminating history.       In early U.S. politics the electorate was small, most      candidates came from upper-class factions and the candidates      themselves paid directly what little campaign spending there      was, which went for pamphlets, and for food and whisky for      rallies. This changed with Martin Van Buren's organization of      a mass campaign for Andrew Jackson in 1828. Democratization--     widespread pamphleteering and newspaper advertisements for      the increasingly literate masses--cost money. Most of the      money came from government employees, until civil service      reform displaced patronage.       Government actions--Civil War contracts, then land and cash      grants to railroads, and protectionism--did much to create      corporations with an intense interest in the composition of      the government. Then government created regulations to tame      corporate power, further prompting corporate participation in      politics. Smith says that in 1888 about 40 percent of      Republican national campaign funds came from Pennsylvania      businesses, and by 1904 corporate contributions were 73      percent of Teddy Roosevelt's funds. Democrats relied less on      corporate wealth than on the largesse of a small number of      sympathetic tycoons: in 1904 two of them provided three      quarters of the party's presidential campaign funds. By 1928      both parties' national committees received about 69 percent      of their contributions in amounts of at least $1,000 (about      $9,000 in today's dollars).       Only a few campaigns have raised substantial sums from      broad bases of small donors. These campaigns have usually      been ideological insurgencies, such as Barry Goldwater's in      1964 ($5.8 million from 410,000 contributors), George      McGovern's in 1972 ($15 million from contributions averaging      about $20) and Oliver North's 1994 race for a U.S. Senate      seat from Virginia (small contributors accounted for almost      all of the $20 million that enabled North to outspend his      principal opponent 4 to 1 in a losing effort).       The aggressive regulation of political giving and spending      began in 1974, in the aftermath of Watergate. Congress,      itching to ``do something'' about political comportment, put      limits on giving to candidates, and on spending by      candidates--even of their personal wealth. Furthermore,      limits were placed on total campaign spending, and even on      political spending by groups unaffiliated with any candidate      or campaign. In 1976 the Supreme Court struck down the limits      on unaffiliated groups, on candidates' spending of personal      wealth and on mandatory campaign spending ceilings. The Court      said these amounted to government stipulation of the      permissible amount of political expression and therefore      violated the First Amendment.       But in a crucial inconsistency, the Court upheld the limits      on the size of contributions. Such limits constitute      deliberate suppression by government of total campaign      spending. And such suppression constitutes government      rationing of political communication, which is what most      political spending finances. Furthermore, in presidential      campaigns, limits on the size of contributions make fund      raising more difficult, which coerces candidates (at least      those less flush than Forbes or Perot) into accepting public      funding. Acceptance commits candidates to limits on how much      can be spent in particular states during the nominating      process, and on the sums that can be spent in the pre- and      post-convention periods.       Now, leave aside for a moment the question of whether the      ``reformers'' responsible for all these restrictions remember      the rule that Congress shall make no law abridging the      freedom of speech. But why, in an era in which the United      States has virtually eliminated restrictions on pornography,      is government multiplying restrictions on political      expression? (Here is a thought rich in possibilities: Would      pornographic political expression be unregulatable?)       When reformers say money is ``distorting'' the political      process, it is unclear, as Smith says, what norm they have in      mind. When reformers say ``too much'' money is spent on      politics, Smith replies that the annual sum is half as much      as Americans spend on yogurt. The amount spent by all federal      and state candidates and parties in a two-year election cycle      is approximately equal to the annual sum of a private      sector's two largest advertising budgets (those of Procter &      Gamble and Philip Morris). If the choice of political leaders      is more important than the choice of detergents and      cigarettes, it is reasonable to conclude that far too little      is spent on politics.       The $700 million spent in the two-year election cycle that      culminated in the November 1994 elections (the sum includes      all spending by general-election candidates, and indirect      party-building expenditures by both parties, and all indirect      political spending by groups such as the AFL-CIO and the NRA)      amounted to approximately $1.75 per year per eligible voter,      or a two-year sum of $3.50--about what it costs to rent a      movie. In that two-year cycle, total spending on all      elections--local, state and federal--was less than $10 per      eligible voter, divided among many candidates. And because of      the limits on the size of contributions, much of the money      was not spent on the dissemination of political discourse but      on the tedious mechanics of raising money in small amounts.      Furthermore, the artificial scarcity of money produced by      limits on political giving and spending has strengthened the      incentive for the kind of spending that delivers maximum bang      for the buck--harsh negative advertising.       Does a money advantage invariably translate into political      potency? Try telling that to Forbes, who spent $440 per vote      in finishing fourth in the Iowa caucuses. True, the candidate      who spends most usually wins. But as Smith notes, correlation      does not establish causation. Money often follows rather than      produces popularity: many donors give to probable winners. Do      campaign contributions purchase post-election influence?      Smith says most students of legislative voting patterns agree      that three variables are more important than campaign      contributions in determining legislators' behavior--party      affiliation, ideology, and constituent views. ``Where      contributions and voting patterns intersect, they do so      largely because donors contribute to those candidates who      are believed to favor their positions, not the other way      around.''       Smith argues that limits on campaign giving and spending      serve to entrench the status quo. As regards limits on      giving, incumbents are apt to have large lists of past      contributors, whereas challengers often could best obtain      financial competitiveness quickly by raising large sums from      a few dedicated supporters. If today's limits had been in      place in 1968, Eugene McCarthy could not have mounted his      anti-war insurgency, which depended heavily on a few six-     figure contributions. As regards spending limits, the lower      they are the better they are for incumbents: incumbents are      already well known and can use their public offices to seize      public attention with ``free media''--news coverage.       The rage to restrict political giving and spending      reflects, in part, the animus of liberals against money and      commerce. There are, after all, other sources of political      influence besides money, sources that liberals do not want to      restrict and regulate in the interests of ``equality.'' Some      candidates are especially articulate or energetic or      physically attractive. Why legislate just to restrict the      advantage of those who can make or raise money? Smith notes      that one reason media elites are apt to favor restricting the      flow of political money, and hence the flow of political      communication by candidates, is that such restrictions      increase the relative influence of the unrestricted political      communication of the media elites.       To justify reforms that amount to government rationing of      political speech, reformers resort to a utilitarian rationale      for freedom of speech: freedom of speech is good when it      serves good ends. This rationale is defensible; indeed, it      has a distinguished pedigree. But it has recently been      repudiated in many of the Supreme Court's libertarian      construings of the First Amendment. Those decisions, taking      an expansive view of the First Amendment in the interest of      individual self-expression, have made, for example, almost      all restrictions on pornography constitutionally problematic.      And such libertarian decisions generally have been defended      by liberals--who are most of the advocates of restrictions on      campaign giving and spending.       But liberals of another stripe also advocate campaign      restrictions. They are ``political equality liberals'' rather      than ``self-expression liberals.'' They favor sacrificing      some freedom of speech in order to promote equal political      opportunity, as they understand that. Such liberal      egalitarians support speech codes on campuses in the name of      equality of status or self-esteem for all groups, or to bring      up to equality groups designated as victims of America's      injustices. Liberal egalitarians support restrictions on      pornography because, they say, pornography deprives women of      civic equality by degrading them. And liberal egalitarians      support restrictions on political expression in order to      achieve equal rations of political communication for all      candidates.       Prof. Martin Shapiro of the University of California's Law      School at Berkeley writes that ``almost the entire first      amendment literature produced by liberal academics in the      past twenty years has been a literature of regulations, not      freedom--a literature that balances away speech rights . . .      Its basic strategy is to treat freedom of speech not as an      end in itself, but an instrumental value.'' And Bradley Smith      says that ``after twenty years of balancing speech rights      away, liberal scholarship is in danger of losing the ability      to see the First Amendment as anything but a libertarian      barrier to equality that may, and indeed ought, to be      balanced away or avoided with little thought.       Fortunately, more and more people are having second      thoughts--in some cases, first thoughts--about the damage      done to the political process, and the First Amendment, by      the utilitarian or ``instrumentalist'' understanding of      freedom of speech. Campaign ``reforms'' have become a blend      of cynicism and paternalism--attempts to rig the rules for      partisan advantage or the advantage of incumbents' or to      protect the public from what the political class considers      too much political communication. Any additional ``reforms,''      other than repeal of the existing ones, will make matters      worse.                                                                    ____               [From the Washington Post, Nov. 14, 1995]                           Gingrich's Heresy                          (By David S. Broder)       Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) knew he was headed into a      test of wills with the president that might force a shutdown      in the government and boost his already high negative      ratings. The last thing he needed was another fight--     especially one in which his position would guarantee      denunciation from all respectable quarters.       Nonetheless, when Gingrich testified the other day at a      congressional hearing on campaign finance, he deliberately      committed heresy. He argued that too little money--not too      much--is going into campaigns.       The editorial pages and columnists issued the predictable      squawks. The speaker also took fire from the rear: The      freshman Republicans who have been his shock troops were in      shock. They wanted to hear him say, as everyone from Common      Cause to Ross Perot regularly intones, that American politics      is ``awash'' in special-interest money.       That is the operative premise of all the favorite      ``reforms'': abolition of PACs (political-action committees);      allowing only people from the home state or home district to      contribute to a candidate; getting rid of ``soft-money''      corporate contributions, which pay for political party      facilities and grass-roots operations.       All of this Gingrich challenged in his testimony on Nov. 2.      The total amount spend on House and Senate races in 1994 was      $724 million--a record sum and shocking to many. But the cost      of 435 House races and 33 Senate campaigns was, he pointed      out, roughly double what the makers of the three leading      antacids budgeted for advertising last year. This is a      scandal?       Ah, but it said, the candidates and office-holders were      forced to spend an inordinate amount of time dialing for      dollars, going hat in hand to prospective contributors. True      enough, but the main reason is that contribution limits have      not been adjusted for inflation in 21 years. In 1974 the      limit on individual contributions was set at $1,000. That is      worth $325 today. If you really want politicians spending      less time fund-raising, Gingrich suggested, lift that limit      to $5,000 and index it for inflation.       If this were not heretical enough, the speaker had one      other idea. Instead of thinking of campaign finance as a      separate problem, screaming for solution, think about a way      to pay for the cost of politics that would     actually serve the interests of voters and of governing.       Do that, he said, and you may find that the best remedy is      not to legislate limits on contributions or spending but to      enable greater activity by the political parties--     Republicans, Democrats and any third force that may emerge to      challenge them.       The biggest problem in our campaign finance system, he      said, is the gross disparity between what House incumbents      can raise and what most challengers can muster. The PACs are      a big part of this problem for they use their contributions      to ensure access to legislators handling their issues. The      PAC system, as Gingrich said, ``has become an arm of the      Washington lobbyists'' and needs to be reduced in      significance.       But limiting PAC contributions is likely to be an empty      gesture. Increasingly, organized interest groups are mounting      independent expenditure campaigns, boosting their friends and      targeting their enemies, which they can do without limit.       Since we cannot effectively stifle these special-interest      voices, Gingrich said, let us submerge them in appeals from      the parties. Increase substantially the limits on what people      can give to political parties, he said. And allow those      parties to contribute far more than they do now to help      challengers offset the many advantages incumbents enjoy--not      only greater leverage on the PACs but all the staff, office      and communications facilities that are provided at taxpayers'      expense.       Barring such changes, Gingrich rightly said, we are almost      certain to see a continuation of the trend to millionaire      candidates. Because the wealthy are allowed (by Supreme Court      decision) to spend whatever they wish on their own campaigns,      the Senate has become a millionaires' club and the House is      moving in the same direction.       All of this was a challenge to conventional wisdom. But      Gingrich is not, in fact, alone. In the same week that he      testified, the libertarian Cato Institute and the liberal      Committee for the Study of the American Electorate published      essays arguing that the supply of political money should be      increased, not decreased. As Curtis Gans, the author of the      latter study, pointed out, ``The overwhelming body of      scholarly research . . . indicates that low spending limits      will undermine political competition by enhancing the      existing advantages of incumbency.''       Gingrich has been accused of foot-dragging on the handshake      agreement he struck with President Clinton last June to form      a bipartisan commission on campaign finance.* * *                                                                    ____               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 17, 1996]                        A Senate of Millionaires                          (By David S. Broder)       Want a perfectly safe bet on the November election results?      Bet that there will be even more millionaires in the U.S.      Senate.       What once was called ``The World's Most Exclusive Club''      increasingly requires personal wealth as a condition for      membership. The combination of rising campaign costs and      foolishly frozen limits on individual contributions has      increased the advantage of self-financed candidates. The 1996      candidate lists are full of them.       In Georgia, for example, all three Republicans seeking      nomination to the vacancy created by the retirement of      Democratic Sen. Sam Nunn are men of substantial means. In      Minnesota, former Republican senator Rudy Boschwitz, a      wealthy retired businessman, is trying to reclaim the seat he      lost to populist professor Paul Wellstone six years ago. And      in a half-dozen other states, Republicans either have or are      trying to recruit challengers who can afford to pay their own      way.       What is more striking is the extent to which the      Democrats--the self-styled party of the people--have begun to      rely on affluence as the criterion for picking their Senate      candidates.       In Colorado, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Virginia,      the favored candidates for the Democratic nomination are all      men of independent means, and in many cases, without wealth      would not be considered to have Senate credentials. In      Illinois, North Carolina, Oklahoma and Oregon, men of similar      backgrounds are given a chance of winning nomination because      of their bankrolls. It is not a new pattern. Among the      Democratic senators seeking reelection this year is John D.      (Jay) Rockefeller IV of West Virginia, who spent more than      $10 million of his own money to be elected in 1984.       Retiring Sen. Bill Bradley (D-N.J.), a banker's son who      earned big money as a New York Knicks basketball star, writes      about the advantage wealth confers on a politician in his      newly published memoir, ``Time Present, Time Past.'' Bradley      recounts how he decided he could afford to give or lend a      quarter-million dollars to his first Senate campaign in      1978--about one-fifth of his budget. ``It assured me that I      could compete even if I didn't raise as much as I had      hoped,'' he says. ``With the existence of that self-generated      cushion, I was able to raise more. When potential      contributors see a campaign with money, they assume it's      well-run, and they are more likely to make contributions.      Everyone likes to be with a winner, whether in basketball or      politics.''       Bradley points out that he was a piker compared with many      of his colleagues. ``Four years later in New Jersey, Frank      Lautenberg, a wealthy computer executive with no elective      experience, would spend over $3.5 million of his own money to      win a U.S. Senate seat. . . . In Wisconsin in 1988, Herb Kohl      promised to spend primarily his own money in his Senate      campaign; $7.5 million later, he won.''       Financial disclosure statements show that at least 28 of      the 100 sitting senators have a net worth of $1 million or      more--many of them much more. Michael Huffington, a Texas oil      man, spent $28 million of his own money in trying for a      California Senate seat in 1994--but still lost. The price is      going up.       Wealth is not a determinant of votes in the Senate. There      are liberals like Rockefeller and Ted Kennedy along with      conservatives. But wealth confers an unfair advantage in the      campaigns for the Senate, and makes it much harder than it      should be for people of talent, but no wealth, to compete.       The main reason for this disadvantage is the      unrealistically low limit on individual contributions. The      law, as Bradley notes, provides that ``whereas a candidate      could contribute as much of his own money as he chose, he      could accept individual contributions of only $2,000 from      others--$1,000 of it for the primary and $1,000 for the      general election.''       The contribution limits were set 22 years ago and never      have been adjusted; inflation has eroded their value by two-     thirds since then. Raising contribution limits is far down      the list of proposals of most campaign finance reformers;      many want to freeze them or reduce them.       But all the contribution limits are accomplishing today is      to create an ever-greater advantage for self-financed      millionaire candidates. Steve Forbes's rivals in the      Republican presidential race are complaining that his wealth      is tilting the odds in the contest, where he is the only one      who is paying his own way and therefore spending as much as      he wants. But the Senate picture is not very different.       If we really want to be ruled by a wealthy elite, fine; but      it is a foolish populism that insists it despises the      influence of wealth, and then resists liberalizing campaign      contribution limits.       Rich men understand that. It's too bad the reformers can't      figure it out.                                                                    ____               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 31, 1996]                ``Frontline's'' Exercise in Exaggeration                          (By David S. Broder)       As if the cynicism about politics were not deep enough      already, PBS's ``Frontline'' last night presented a      documentary called ``So YOU Want to Buy a President?'' whose      thesis seems to be that campaigns are a charade, policy      debates are a deceit and only money talks.       The narrow point, made by Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.), an      early dropout from the 1996 presidential race, about      millionaire publisher Malcolm S. (Steve) Forbes Jr., is that      ``somebody is trying to buy the White House, and apparently      it is for sale.''       The broader indictment, made by correspondent/narrator      Robert Krulwich, is that Washington is gripped by a ``barter      culture'' in which politicians are for sale and public policy      is purchased by campaign contributions.       The program rested heavily on a newly published paperback,      ``The Buying of the President.'' Author Charles Lewis, the      head of the modestly titled Center for Public Integrity, was      a principal witness, and Kevin Phillips, the conservative      populist author who wrote the book's introduction, was also a      major figure in the documentary.       It dramatized the view asserted by Lewis in the conclusion      of his book: ``Simply stated, the wealthiest interests      bankroll and, in effect, help to preselect the specific major      candidates months and months before a single vote is cast      anywhere. . . . We the people have become a mere afterthought      of those we put in office, a prop in our own play.''       Viewers say a number of corporate executives--no labor      leaders, no religious leaders, no activists of any kind, for      some reason--who have raised and contributed money for      presidents and presidential candidates and thereafter been      given access at dinners, private meetings or overseas trade      missions.       It is implied--but never shown--that policies changed      because of these connections. As Krulwich said in the      transcript of a media interview distributed, along with an      advance tape, with the publicity kit for the broadcast, ``We      don't really know whether these are bad guys or good guys. .      . . I'm not really sure we've been able to prove, in too many      cases, that a dollar spend bought a particular favor. All      we've been able to show is that over and over again, people      who do give a lot of money to politicians get a chance to      talk to those politicians face to face, at parties, on      planes, on missions, in private lunches, and you and I      don't.''       If that is the substance of the charge, the innuendo is      much heavier. At one point, Krulwich asked Lewis, in his most      disingenuous manner, ``Do you come out convinced that      elections are in huge part favors for sale, or in tiny      part?''       And Lewis replied that while ``there are a lot of wealthy      people that do want to express broad philosophical issues,''      the ``vested interests that have very narrow agendas that      they want pursued see these candidates as their handmaidens      or their puppets. The presidential campaign is not a horse      race or a beauty contest. It's a giant auction.''       That is an oversimplified distortion that can do nothing      but further alienate a cynical electorate. Of course, money      is an important ingredient in our elections and its use      deserves scrutiny. But ideas are important too, and grass-     roots activism even more so. The Democratic Leadership      Council's Al From     and the Heritage Foundation's Robert Rector have had more      influence in the last decade than any fund-raisers or      contributors, because candidates have turned to them for      policy advice.       John Rother of the American Association of Retired Persons      and Ralph Reed of the Christian Coalition work for      organizations that are nominally nonpartisan and make no      campaign contributions at all. But their membership votes--so      they have power.       The American political system is much more complex--and      more open to influence by any who choose to engage in it--     than the proponents of the ``auction'' theory of democracy      understand, or choose to admit.       By exaggerating the influence of money, they send a clear      message to citizens that the game is rigged, so there's no      point in playing. That is deceitful, and it's dangerously      wrong to feed that cynicism.       Especially when they have nothing to suggest when it comes      to changing the rules for the money game.       At one point, Phillips said that the post-Watergate reforms      succeeded only in having ``forced them [the contributors and      politicians] to be more devious.'' That is untrue. Those      reforms, which mandated the disclosure of all the financial      connections on which the program was based, also created      publicity which, even Krulwich and Co. admitted, foiled the      ``plots'' of some contributors.       And Krulwich, for his part, suggested very helpfully that      ``every high-profile politician agrees that some things have      got to change. Change the limits. Change the rules. Change      the primaries. Change the ads. Change enforcement. You gotta      change something.''       How about changing the kind of journalism that tells people      that politicians are bought-and-paid-for puppets and you're a      sucker if you think there's a damn thing you can do to make      your voice heard?  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, over the years working on this issue I have written several pieces which I ask unanimous consent to have printed--one in the Washington Post and one in the USA Today--in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 21, 1996]                    Just What Is A Special Interest?                          (By Mitch McConnell)       President Clinton, in his State of the Union address,      beseeched Congress to enact campaign finance reform to reduce      ``special interest'' influence. Campaign finance reforms that      the president favors would constrict fundamental democratic      freedoms to participate in the political process. In other      words: speech would be limited and some citizens' freedom to      participate in elections beyond voting would be ``reformed''      out of existence based on their alleged status as ``special      interests.'' But if ``special interest'' is not defined, how      are we to know just whose influence should be curbed?       Judging from the fervent bipartisan (and third party) scorn      heaped on ``special interests,'' the casual observer would      logically assume that this scourge of democracy was readily      identifiable. The Congressional Record, newspaper editorials      and campaign speeches are replete with diatribes against the      ``special interests.'' A recent search of newspapers on the      Nexis database found more than 60,000 articles and editorials      containing the phrase ``special interest.''       ``Special interest'' is the most pejorative phrase in the      American political lexicon since ``communist-pinko.'' Judging      from the reformers' scathing rhetoric, rooting out these      special interests is a job for a new Senate Committee on Un-     American Activities.       In fact, the special interest tag depends on the viewer's      vantage point rather than on any objective criteria. So-     called good government groups would have people believe that      the antonym is ``public'' interest--as defined by them. These      groups usually construe good government to mean big      government and therefore deem big government to be in the      public interest. By this logic, opposition to any government      regulation or tax virtually guarantees a special interest      charge.       Capitalism should not be a dirty word in a free society,      but having observed the enmity directed toward its      practitioners in many quarters, one could reasonably wonder.      Some nonprofit so-called ``good government'' groups readily      pin the special interest label on profit-seeking enterprises.      Yet behind corporate balance sheets are employees, families,      shareholders and communities of which they are part.       Does the special interest connotation extend to employees      and their families? To the legions of Americans whose      retirement funds and investments are keyed to the stock      market? By such extrapolation does the ``special interest''      smear cut a wide swath.       What happens when a purported public interest organization      is funded by a group that is universally regarded as a      ``special interest,'' such as the plaintiffs' lawyers? Are we      to conclude that the special interest in this instance is      subsumed in the nobler public interest? Or is the public      interest group simply laundering the special interest      influence money and acting as a front organization? Or is it      merely coincidence when their interests converge on, say,      lawsuit reform?       Most people would probably conclude that a special interest      is contrary to the majority interest. Should special interest      be defined as being not immediately relevant to more than      49.9 percent of American citizens? Must its membership      comprise a majority of the country to be legitimate? If so,      such a qualification should be carefully pondered, as      ``special interests'' could be equated with any narrow or      minority interest, thus automatically tarnishing what could      be a very worthy cause.       Being a senator from Kentucky, I regularly go to bat for      Kentucky industries (and their employees, suppliers and      subcontractors) threatened by onerous regulations and      taxation. These industries may, in the minds of some people,      epitomize ``special interest.'' To me, they and the      Kentuckians whose livelihoods depend on them are      constituents, and my assistance to them is in the public's      interest.       Is a Pacific Northwest lumber company automatically a      special interest? The company's employees? How about the      Washington-based environmentalists who would sacrifice jobs      and disrupt human lives for the sake of an owl? Are owls      special interests?       The truth is that the special interest label is a political      weapon utilized, often reflexively and perhaps thoughtlessly,      by people throughout the ideological spectrum. It can be      found in statements I have made in the past. Using it is a      hard habit to break. Nevertheless, in the interest of more      honest and civil public discourse, the invocation of the      ``special interest'' mantra to propel a reform agenda or      wound an opponent is a habit that should be broken.       All Americans have a constitutional right to petition the      government and participate in the political process, however      unpopular the cause or narrow its appeal may be. Americans do      not forfeit those rights because they have been tagged with      the special interest label.       The campaign finance reform debate, in particular, is      advanced on the premise that special interest influence is      pervasive, corrosive, and must be abated at all costs. But      the cost of the alleged reforms in terms of constitutional      freedom for all Americans is high. And the special interest      premise is deeply flawed. So the next time you hear someone      hail campaign finance reform as the answer, ask them what is      the question. And when they say special interest influence is      the problem, ask them: What is a special interest?                                                                    ____                    [From USA Today, June 11, 1996]                   Disaster for Taxpayers, Candidates                          [By Mitch McConnell]       The most talked-about campaign-finance schemes are      unconstitutional, undemocratic, bureaucratic boondoggles.      Further, their sponsors think taxpayers should foot the bill.      And for good measure, these ``reform'' schemes also would      greatly increase the power of the media.       Perhaps that is simply a fortunate happenstance for the      liberal newspapers pushing them. In any event, the media      clearly have a ``special interest'' in campaign finance      ``reforms'' which would increase their power by limiting the      speech of every other participant in the political process.       Because political campaigns exist to communicate with      voters, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled two decades ago that      campaign spending must be accorded First Amendment      protection. Ergo, campaign spending limits are      unconstitutional speech limits.       The simple fact is that communication with America's nearly      200 million eligible voters is expensive. For instance, one      full-page color campaign ad in a Friday edition of USA TODAY      would cost $104,400. Television and mail are also essential      means of communicating with voters.       These are expensive venues, but they are the only way to      reach all the voters in large, modern electorates. Limiting      campaign spending would limit political discourse by      candidates, thereby enhancing the power of the media. That is      bad public policy.       For all the whining, the fact is that congressional      campaign spending (less than $4 per eligible voter in 1994)      is paltry relative to what Americans spend on consumer items      like bubble gum and yogurt.       What we should do is adjust the individual contribution      limit for inflation.       The contribution limits candidates must abide by in 1996      were set over two decades ago (when a new Ford Mustang cost      $2,700). These inflation-eroded limits benefit the well-off      (rich candidates who can fund entire campaigns out of their      own pockets) and the well-known (principally incumbents) who      have a large base from which to draw contributions.       Enhanced public disclosure of all campaign-related spending      is also a worthy reform that would enable voters to make      informed decisions on Election Day.       By comparison, the so-called ``good government'' groups'      campaign-finance schemes would be disasters. Delay is      preferable to the enactment of such constitutional      monstrosities.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, some information about the cost to the Postal Service, estimated by this postal rate subsidy, and I ask unanimous consent that be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                          U.S. Postal Service,                                    Washington, DC, June 24, 1996.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: I am writing to voice my concerns      about campaign finance reform legislation, S. 1219, which      would place an unfair financial burden on the Postal Service      and its ratepayers.       Let me first say that the Postal Service takes no position      on the general merits of campaign finance reform. This issue      appropriately rests with the Congress. However, S. 1219, as      well as several other campaign finance reform bills in the      House and Senate, provide for reduced postage rates for      eligible candidates. These bills do not contain a funding      mechanism through which the Postal Service would be      reimbursed for the difference between regular rate postage      and the reduced rate used by the candidates. In essence, the      legislation creates an unfunded mandate, and the costs would      have to be absorbed by our customers, the postal ratepayers.      Testimony at campaign finance reform hearings estimated the      reduced postage costs for S. 1219 to be $50 million per      election. Estimates for other campaign finance bills with      reduced postage provisions range from $50 to $150 million per      election.       I would also like to point out that it is very unlikely      that the Postal Service and its customers would be made whole      even if a funding mechanism were included in campaign finance      reform legislation. After years of underfunding our annual      appropriation for Congressionally mandated reduced rate      mailings, Congress enacted the 1993 Revenue Forgone Reform      Act. In eliminating future funding for reduced rate mailings,      this law mandates that the Postal Service receive a series of      42 annual appropriations of $29 million as partial      reimbursement for past funding shortfalls. Even this      ``partial'' relief is now threatened as our House Treasury,      Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations      Subcommittee proposed that this appropriation be reduced by      over $5 million during their markup of our FY '97      appropriations bill.       I recognize the importance of the campaign finance reform      issue in Congress this year, and it is with reluctance that I      express these concerns to you. Nonetheless, S. 1219, as well      as others, would offer political candidates reduced postage      costs at the expense of the Postal Service and its customers.      I urge you and your colleagues to identify alternate      provisions that would not require postal ratepayers to bear      the burden of campaign finance reform.           Best regards,     Marvin Runyon.                                                                    ____                           Direct Marketing Association, Inc.,                                    Washington, DC, June 19, 1996.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: It now appears that S. 1219,      campaign finance legislation sponsored by Senators McCain and      Feingold, is scheduled for debate next week.       We strongly urge you to cast a no vote on the cloture      motion that will be offered during the debate.       As I have written to you before, DMA is opposed to S.1219,      largely because of the provisions for low cost mailings for      Senatorial candidates, without compensation to the Postal      Service for lost revenues.       We estimate that, should the House pass similar      legislation, these provisions could cost the Postal Service      as much as $350 million dollars over a two-year election      cycle. Every penny of this will ultimately come out of the      pocket of the businesses and consumers who use the mails.       The Postal Service finds itself in an increasingly      competitive environment. In order to survive, the Postal      Service must be able to price its products competitively. It      cannot do this if costs are arbitrarily added to its rate      base. Legislation such as this endangers the financial base      of the Postal Service and the service it can provide to      American businesses and consumers.       Again, we urge you to vote no on the cloture motion.           Sincerely,     Richard Barton.                                                                    ____                                       National Association of                                                 Broadcasters,                                   Washington, DC., June 24, 1996.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: First, I would like to thank you      for the leadership role you have taken in opposing S. 1219,      the campaign finance reform legislation introduced by      Senators John McCain and Russ Feingold.       As originally introduced, this legislation would require      broadcasters to offer qualified Senate candidates an      additional 50% discount off the discounted television      advertising rates candidates currently receive. The      legislation further requires broadcasters give candidates      free advertising time. We believe these provisions are      unconstitutional and impose significant financial burdens on      local broadcasters and we must oppose the legislation.       We understand Senators McCain and Feingold have introduced      a substitute to S. 1219. At your request we have reviewed the      broadcast provisions of the substitute. We have done so and      have determined that for the most part the broadcast      provisions are the same as those in S. 1219. There is,      however, new language in the broadcast section which causes      us great concern.       The new provision would give to the U.S. Court of Federal      Claims exclusive jurisdiction over challenges to the      constitutionality of the broadcast rate and free time      provisions. Further, by its terms it precludes any injunctive      relief, providing only for money damages. It is unclear      whether this is an attempt to somehow deny us the opportunity      to bring a First Amendment claim against these provisions. No      other section of the bill appears to have the same      requirement and we do not understand why the broadcast      provisions are given a different avenue for judicial review.       We must oppose the substitute to S. 1219, and we continue      to support your efforts in opposing this legislation. If I      can be of further assistance, please do not hesitate to      phone.           Sincerely,                                                 Edward O. Fritts,                                                        President.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, calling the McCain-Feingold voluntary does not make it so, its proponents protestations to the contrary. Anyone who dared not to comply with its voluntary limits would have to: pay twice as much as their opponent for TV ads and more for postage; with half the contribution limit; and forgo 30 minutes of free time.  All this and their complying opponent's spending limit would be increased up to 100 percent to counteract any excessive spending. Moreover, the complying candidate could spend unlimited amounts to counteract--dollar-for-dollar--independent expenditures.  So I say again, technically, mugging victims had options, too. That does not mean that handing over their wallets to muggers were voluntary acts. And I should stress here that the essential point in regard to the voluntariness of the candidate spending limits is not--as the Senator from Wisconsin stated yesterday--that candidates who did not comply with spending limits would be giving up benefits they do not currently enjoy such as the 50 percent discount and the free TV time. What makes the provision unconstitutional is the severe handicapping candidates would experience if they did not comply with the limits.  This is a crucial distinction from the presidential system. Steve Forbes did not have to pay twice as much for TV ads as the complying presidential candidates. He did not forego free time and Bob Dole's spending limit did not increase when independent expenditures were made against him. And his spending limit did not increase when Forbes spent over the limit. Had the presidential system had the inducements of the McCain-Feingold bill, Steve Forbes might very well have elected not to get into the race, at all.  It simply would not make sense for a candidate not to comply with the McCain-Feingold bill unless he or she were so extraordinarily wealthy they could spend many times the spending limit for their own wallet. So you could have two extreme types of campaigns under McCain-Feingold--very low spending ones complying with the limits and extremely expensive campaigns. What would disappear is the middle ground--not as cheap as the McCain-Feingold model but not at the extreme high-end, either.  If you looked long and hard enough and had common cause and public citizen helping, even a tiny needle in a giant haystack could be found. And so it is that at long last--after a decade of debate on this scheme--some people with law degrees have been located to say the McCain-Feingold/common cause spending limit structure is constitutional. How expert they are remains to be seen and their submittals on the subject will certainly be scrutinized.  In any event objective liberals and conservatives can agree that the American Civil Liberties Union is the repository of expertise on first amendment issues. The ACLU led, and triumphed, in the fight against mandatory spending limits 20 years ago in the Buckley versus Valeo case. And the ACLU will be in front again--along side me--should anything resembling the McCain-Feingold bill ever become law. The ACLU is singularly focused on constitutional freedom and has probably aggravated just about everybody at sometime with unpopular stands. But they have a remarkable record of success in this area.  At this point I will read excerpts from the ACLU's testimony--given by professor and Buckley versus Valeo attorney Joel M. Gora--before the Senate Rules Committee on February 1 of this year.       The provision for ``voluntary'' spending limits in Senate      campaigns violates the free     speech principles of Buckley v. Valeo. The outright ban and      severe fall back limitations on PACs violate freedom of      speech and association, as do the limitations on      ``bundling.'' The unprecedented controls on raising and      spending ``soft money'' by political parties and even non-     partisan groups intrude upon First Amendment rights in a      manner well beyond any compelling governmental interest. The      revised provisions governing the right to make independent      expenditures both improperly obstruct that core area of      electoral speech and impermissibly invade the absolutely      protected area of issue advocacy. The reduced recordkeeping      threshold for contributions and disbursements, from $200 down      to $50, invades associational privacy. And the new powers      given to the Federal Election Commission to go to court in      the midst of a campaign to enjoin ``a violation of this Act''      pose an ominous and sweeping threat of prior restraint and      political censorship.       S. 1219 suffers from many of the same flaws as the original      statute at issue in Buckley v. Valeo. There the ACLU      contended that the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1974 was      bad constitutional law because it cut to the heart of the      First Amendment's protections of political freedom. It      limited the ability of groups and individuals to get their      message across to the voters. The very essence of the First      Amendment is the right of the people to speak, to discuss, to      publish, to join together with others on issues of political      and public concern. This constitutional protection of the      right of the people to join together to form groups and      organizations and societies and associations and unions and      corporations to articulate and advocate their interests is      the genius of American democracy. And this is particularly      vital in connection with political election campaigns when      issues, arguments, candidates and causes swirl together in      the public arena. Yet, the 1974 Act imposed sweeping and      Draconian restraints on the ability of citizens and groups,      candidates and committees, parties and partisans to use their      resources, to make political contributions and expenditures,      to support and embody their freedom of speech and      association.       The ACLU also insisted the Act was poorly crafted      ``political restructuring'' rather than real ``political      reform'' because it exacerbates the inequality of political      opportunity, enhances dependence upon money and moneyed      interests in politics and magnifies the power of incumbency      as the single most significant factor in politics. Limits on      giving and spending make it harder for those subject to the      restraints to raise funds and easier for those outside the      restraints to bring their resources to bear on politics.      Limiting individual contributions to $1,000 per candidate,      while allowing PACs, made legitimate by the ``reforms,'' to      contributes $5,000 per candidate, would make it harder to      raise money from individuals and make candidates more      dependent on PACs. And PACs, often representing entrenched      interests, would be more likely, though far from inevitably,      to prefer incumbents to challengers as beneficiaries of their      largesse. The Act would stifle not expand political      opportunity. What you had, we warned, was an unconstitutional      law, enacted by Congress, approved by the President, enforced      by an agency, the Federal Election Commission, beholden to      each, and designed to restrain the speech and association of      those who would criticize or challenge or oppose the elected      establishment. Talk about the powers of incumbency. That's      why we called the Act an ``Incumbents Protection Act.''       In Buckley v. Valeo, the Supreme Court held that any      government regulation of political funding--of giving and      spending, of contributions and expenditures--is regulation of      political speech and subject to the strictest constitutional      scrutiny. The Act's limitations on political expenditures--by      committees, campaigns and candidates, no matter how      wealthy--flatly violated the First Amendment. Nothing can      justify the government telling the people how much they      could spend to promote their candidacies or causes. Not in      this country. Nothing. ``In the free society ordained by      our Constitution it is not the government, but the      people--individually as citizens and candidates and      collectively as associations and political committees--who      must retain control over the quantity and range of debate      on public issues in a political campaign.'' Buckley v.      Valeo, 424 U.S. 1,57 (1976).       Nor could the Congress try to help ``equalize'' political      speech and the ability to influence the outcome of elections      by imposing restraints on some speakers: ``. . . the concept      that government may restrict the speech of some elements of      our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others      is wholly foreign to the First Amendment.'' Buckley v. Valeo,      424 U.S. at 48-49.       Unfortunately, the decision in Buckley upheld the Act's      contribution limits of $1,000 for individuals and $5,000 for      political committees. The Court did this because of its      stated concern that unlimited gifts to candidates was a      recipe for corruption, a ruling that ensured the two decades      of frustration and unfairness that have ensured. With no      limits on overall campaign spending or on wealthy candidates,      and with independent campaign committees, issues groups and      the press free to use their resources to comment on      candidates and causes without limit; but with less well-     funded candidates hampered in their ability to raise money      from family, friends and supporters, the stage was set to      make two factors dominant: the advantages of incumbency and      the dependency on PACs.       The advantages of incumbency meant that public resources      such as franking privileges, government funded newsletters      and free television coverage (C-Span) made it easier for      Members of Congress to communicate with the voters, while      challengers have to spend restricted amounts of money in      order to achieve the same visibility.       The dependency on PACs resulted from severe limitations on      the amounts of money that individuals can contribute directly      to candidates, coupled with the markedly increased cost of      campaigning, which made PAC contributions a very important      source of campaign funding. And the individual contribution      limit was kept at $1,000, which, adjusted for inflation, is      probably worth about $400 in real dollars today.       That is why for twenty years candidates have had to look      more to PACs order to raise funds and incumbents, in      particular, have had an easier ability to do so.       And for twenty years, the ACLU has suggested the way to      solve these various disparities and dilemmas is to expand      political participation, by providing public financing or      support for all legally qualified candidates, without      conditions and restrictions, not to restrict contributions      and expenditures which enable groups and individuals to      communicate their message to the voters.       Unfortunately, in all of its critical aspects, S. 1219, The      Senate Campaign Finance Reform Act of 1995 fails to      facilitate broader political participation and it also      unconstitutionally abridges political expression.  Mr. President, the proponents of this bill are very mistaken if they believe the spending limits are constitutional. The ACLU differs:       Title I of the bill, providing ``spending limits and      benefits'' for Senate election campaigns, is an attempt to      coerce what the law cannot command: limitations on overall      campaign expenditures and on the use of personal funds for a      candidate's own campaign. It is a backdoor effort to impose      campaign spending limits--which inevitably benefit      incumbents--in violation of the essential free speech      principles of Buckley v. Valeo and the doctrine of      unconstitutional conditions. And it should be observed      that what triggers benefits for some candidates and      burdens for others is not that a candidate approaches or      exceeds relevant spending limits, but simply refuses to      agree to be bound by them.       The ACLU believes that the receipt of public subsidies or      benefits can never be conditioned on surrendering      constitutional rights. To do so would be to penalize the      exercise of those rights. See Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S.      593, 597 (1972); FCC v. League of Women Voters, 468 U.S. 364      (1984). Since candidates have an unqualified right to spend      as much as they can to get their message to the voters, and      to spend as much of their own funds as they can, and to raise      funds from supporters all over the country, they cannot be      made to surrender those rights in order to receive public      benefits.       In Buckley the Court suggested that Congress could      establish a system whereby candidates would choose freely      between full public funding with expenditure limits and      private spending without limits, ``as long as the candidate      remains free to engage in unlimited private funding and      spending instead of limited public funding.'' Republican      National Committee v. Federal Election Commission, 487 F.      Supp. 280, 284 (S.D.N.Y.), aff'd mem., 445 U.S. 955 (1980).      See Buckley at 57, n. 65. Contrary to its supporters' claims,      S. 1219 does not establish such a regime of voluntary      campaign spending limits. Rather, the bill denies significant      benefits to and imposes burdens on those candidates who      refuse to agree to limit their campaign expenditures, while      conferring a series of advantages upon those candidates who      agree to the limits.       First, by banning PAC contributions entirely, the bill      makes it more difficult for candidates to raise and spend      money at all, which will make them more susceptible to      accepting the expenditure and other limitations. Candidates      who refuse to accept spending limits have to work harder to      raise funds because the limits on contributions to their      opponents are raised automatically from $1,000 to $2,000. And      then such disfavored candidates have to pay full rates for      broadcasting and postage. Finally, the expenditure ceilings      of their opponents are raised by 20% to make it easier to      counter the messages of ``non-complying'' candidates.       In short, this scheme does everything possible to help the      candidate who agrees to spending limits to overwhelm the      candidate who does not. That is not a level playing field.       Indeed, in Buckley the Court upheld public funding of      Presidential campaigns because its purpose was ``not to      abridge, restrict or censor speech, but rather to use public      money to facilitate and enlarge public discussion and      participation in the electoral process, goals vital to a      self-governing people.'' 424 U.S. at 92-93. S. 1219 fails      this test, for its purposes and effect are to limit speech,      not enhance it. Recent cases have invalidated other schemes      for making candidates ``voluntarily'' agree to expenditure      and other restraints by penalizing those who do not, see      Shrink Missouri Government PAC v. Maupin,--F.3d--, 64 Law      Week 2409 (8th Cir. 1995) (restricting funding sources of      those who refuse to agree to abide by expenditure limits      violates the First Amendment) (``We are hard-pressed to      discern how the interests of good government could possibly      be served     by campaign expenditure laws that necessarily have the effect      of limiting the quantity of political speech in which      candidates for public office are allowed to engage.'' Id.      at--);       Moreover, even if the Act did create a level playing field,      the incumbent starts the game 10 points ahead because of      greater fund-raising ability, name recognition, access to the      news media and other benefits of incumbency. All things being      equal, the incumbent starts out ahead. Any law which imposes      financial penalties and disincentives on speech because of      the interaction between the status of the speaker and the      content of the speech is constitutionally suspect. See      Simon & Schuster, Inc. v. Members of the New York State      Crime Victims Board, 502 U.S. 105 (1991) (law improperly      escrowed profits from writings about a criminal's crime);      United States v. National Treasury Employee's Union, 516      U.S.--(1995) (invalidating overbroad honorarium ban on      moonlighting speeches and articles by federal employees).      Schemes of public benefits for political action which are      structured in such a fashion that the government seems to      be showing favoritism to certain categories of candidates      and penalizing others also have been held to be a form of      unconstitutional political discrimination, violative of      both free speech and equality principles. See Greenberg v.      Bolger, 497 F. Supp. 756, 774-78 (E.D.N.Y. 1980)      (preferential mailing rates for major parties struck down      as violative of the First Amendment); Rhode Island Chapter      of the National Women's Political Caucus v. Rhode Island      State Lottery Comm'n, 609 F. Supp. 1403, 1414 (D.R.I.      1985) (allowing major parties but not other groups to      conduct fundraising lottery events violated the First      Amendment); McKenna v. Reilly, 419 F. Supp. 1179, 1188      (D.R.I. 1976) (state parties' allocation of tax check off      funds to endorsed candidates and exclusion of funds to      unendorsed candidates violated First Amendment).       Finally, some of the strings attached to the benefits      offered would impose unprecedented controls on political      speech by dictating the format of campaign speech. The      requirement that free air time cannot be used for campaign      commercials of less than 30 seconds is an impermissible      interference with the content of political speech. See      McIntyre v. Ohio Election Commission, 115 S. Ct. 1511, 1518      (1995). The only conceivable purpose for this restriction is      that Congress thinks 10 second spot commercials are      politically objectionable. That is the kind of content-based      judgment that Congress cannot make, even when it is      conferring a benefit; nor can Congress compel the structure      of speech in that fashion. See McIntyre, supra; Wooley v.      Maynard, 430 U.S. 705 (1977); Riley v. National Federation of      the Blind, 487 U.S. 781, 797 (1988).       The McIntyre and Riley decisions also call into question      the provisions of the Bill (Section 302, Campaign      Advertising) that mandate certain specific identifications      and disclosures in the text of print, display or broadcast      political advertisements. In McIntyre the Court reaffirmed      the historic right of political anonymity and invalidated a      requirement that leaflets on referenda issues state the name      of the person responsible for the publications. And in Riley,      the Court struck down a compulsory disclosure statement on      charitable solicitation literature, finding a violation of      the settled principle that the First Amendment encompasses      ``the decision of both what to say and what not to say.'' 487      U.S. at 797.       2. The complete ban on, as well as the ``fallback''      restrictions of, Political Action Committees are invalid      under clear Supreme Court precedent.       Subtitle A of Title II, the Draconian provision which      proudly proclaims that it enacts ``Elimination of Political      Action Committees from Federal Election Activities'' and      which bans PAC political activity, is flatly      unconstitutional. In outlawing all political expenditures and      contributions ``made for the purpose of influencing an      election for Federal office''--except those made by political      parties and their candidates,--Section 201 of the bill cuts      to the heart of the First Amendment's protection of freedom      of political speech and association. It gives a permanent      political monopoly to political parties and political      candidates, and would silence all those groups that want to      support or oppose those parties and candidates.       ``PACs'' of course have become a political dirty word. We      tend to think of the real estate PACs or the Trial Lawyers'      PAC or the insurance and medical PACs or the tobacco-related      PACs. But the ACLU's first encounter with a ``PAC'' was when      we had to defend a handful of old-time dissenters whom the      government claimed were an illegal ``political      committee.'' The small group had run a two-page      advertisement in The New York Times, urging the      impeachment of President (and re-election candidate)      Richard Nixon for bombing Cambodia and praising those few      hardy Members of Congress who had voted against the      bombing. In the summer of 1972, before the ink was dry on      the brand new Campaign Act of 1971, the Justice Department      used that ``campaign reform'' law to haul the little group      into court, label them a ``political committee'' and      threaten them with injunctions and fines unless they      complied with the law--all for publicly speaking their      minds on a key political issue of the day. The Court of      Appeals quickly held that the group was an ad hoc issue      organization, not a covered ``political committee.'' But      we got an early wake-up call on what ``campaign reform''      really meant.       Of course, ``real'' PACs, i.e., those that give or spend      money to or on behalf of federal candidates, come in all      sizes and shapes. They can be purely ideological or primarily      self-interested, or both simultaneously. And they span the      political spectrum. Labor PACs were organized first, in the      1940's, usually to provide funds, resources and personnel to      assist political candidates, usually Democrats. Corporate      PACs came on line in the early 1970's, usually on the      Republican side. And both corporate and labor PACs were      legitimized and liberated by the ``reforms'' of the FECA,      which allowed those and all other PACs to contribute five      times as much money to federal candidates as individuals      could. All this turned the Federal Election Campaign Act into      the PAC Magna Carta Act.       We think all that PAC activity is simply a reflection of      the myriad groups and associations that make up so much of      our political life. And so many of them are an effective way      for individuals to maximize their political voice by giving      to the PAC of their choice. While many PAC contributors and      supporters probably do fit the stereotype of the glad-     handing, Washington-based influence peddler, millions of PAC      supporters contribute less than $50 and expect nothing from      the candidates in return. Indeed, for millions of Americans,      writing a check to the candidate, committee or cause of their      choice is a fundamental political act, second in importance      and meaning only to voting.       Proposals to restrict, restrain or even repeal PACs would      suppress the great variety of political activity those PACs      embody. Most of those proposals are doomed to defeat as      unconstitutional. All of them are doomed to defeat as futile.                       Banning PAC Contributions       There is not a word in Buckley v. Valeo or any of the other      relevant cases on regulation of PACs which suggests that the      Court would uphold a total ban on PAC contributions to      federal candidates. Political contributions are fundamentally      protected by the First Amendment, as embodiments of both      speech and association. PACs do amplify the political voices      of their contributors and supporters across the entire      spectrum of American politics, and the Court is not likely to      let you still all those voices.       Moreover, banning PAC contributions is futile as a reform.      All the PAC money that cannot be contributed directly to      candidates will go instead into an upsurge of independent      expenditure campaigns for favored or against disfavored      candidates.                        Banning PAC Expenditures       The Supreme Court made it clear that independent PAC      expenditures are at the core of the First Amendment and      totally off limits to restrictions. Federal Election      Commission v. National Conservative Political Action      Committee, 470 U.S. 480 (1985). It may be a little less      tidy to run an independent campaign, than to write a check      to your favored candidate, but PACs will adapt. They're      good at that. And little will have been gained-except      making it harder for candidates to raise money since you      will have deprived them of a major source of resources,      without providing any alternatives. Candidates of moderate      means will be particularly vulnerable to campaigns by      personally wealthy opponents.                       reducing pac contributions       The ``fallback'' provision, which goes into effect when the      flat ban is ruled unconstitutional, as it surely will be,      would lower PAC contributions from $5,000 to $1,000 per      candidate per election. This might be a closer constitutional      question. But the Court threw out a $250 limit on      contributions to a referendum campaign committee. See      Committee Against Rent Control v. Berkeley, 454 U.S. 290      (1981). Indeed, just recently the Eighth Circuit likewise      invalidated a $300 contribution limitation for donations to      statewide candidates. Carver v. Nixon, -- F.2d -- ,64 Law      Week 2407 (8th Cir. 1995). And Meyer v. Grant, 486 U.S. 414      (1988) held that people had a right to spend money to hire      others to gather election petition signatures, strongly      reaffirming the right of a person to use his or her resources      to enlist others to advance their causes. In any event, this      provision is fatally overbroad because it treats all PACs      alike, even those made up only of small contributors.       Finally, apart from the First Amendment issues, what      purpose is served by reducing the ability of candidates to      raise money without providing alternatives?  Mr. President, earlier I mentioned Col. Billie Bobbit (USAF), the EMILY's List member who is quiet certain the first amendment protects her right to participate in elections via bundling. Colonel Bobbitt's instincts are right on the mark as the ACLU testimony observes:                                bundling       The same objections pertain to the ban on ``bundling'' of      individual PAC contributions. This fallback proposal would      abridge freedom of association which the Supreme Court has      recognized as a ``basic constitutional freedom.'' Kusper v.      pontikes, 414 U.S. 51, 57 (1973). And the Court has pointedly      observed that ``the practice of persons sharing common views      banding together to achieve a common end is deeply embedded      in the American political process.'' Citizens Against Rent      Control v. Berkeley, 454 U.S. 290, 294 (1981). The practice      of bundling reflects broad issue support to a candidate,      indicating that continued support is dependent on     continued adherence to the views represented by the group.      The proposed bill would severely restrict ideological groups      like Emily's List, which have made a critical contribution to      expanding political opportunity and opening up political      doors to candidates and groups so long excluded.                      receiving pac contributions       The fallback provision would also prohibit any PAC from      making a contribution which raises a candidate's PAC receipts      above 20% of the campaign expenditure ceilings applicable to      that election. But this restraint also seems overbroad. The      corruption concern becomes very attenuated in this setting,      and the rationale for the overall 20% limit seems weak      against First Amendment standards. Once the limit is reached,      candidates and PACs, in effect, would be banned totally from      political interaction with one another, which would seem as      constitutionally vulnerable as a total ban and have the      effect of a limitation on campaign expenditures. And what of      new groups that wanted to support a candidate after the      candidate's PAC quota had been reached, especially if the      campaign turns on an issue--abortion for example--of great      moment to that group?       Finally, all of this begins to resemble yet another      backdoor effort to limit overall campaign expenditures, in      violation of Buckley's core principles.             limiting out-of-state political contributions       Somehow, I have always found particularly troublesome those      proposals to limit the amount of out-of-district or out-of-     state contributions to candidates. Section 241 does not seem      to operate as a direct ban on out-of-State contributions.      Rather it provides that a candidate must receive not less      than 60% of their overall contributions from in-state      individuals in order to remain in compliance with the      spending limits and receive the statutory benefits.      Obviously, this is a backdoor effort to limit PAC      contributions to candidates, since so many PAC contributors      come from States different from the candidates their PACs      contribute to, as do the PACs themselves. It also seems to be      an effort to insulate incumbents from well-funded challenges      supported from another State.       Any potential justification for this ban seems highly      unlikely to pass constitutional muster. Analogizing this      restriction to a voter's residency requirement falls short      after McIntyre v. Ohio Board of Elections,--US--(1995) which      held that restrictions on political speech about candidates      or referenda cannot be upheld on the grounds that they are      merely ballot or electoral regulations, because, in reality,      they are free speech limitations. Indeed, a federal court in      Oregon recently so held in overturning a requirement that      state and local candidates had to raise all their campaign      funds from individuals who resided within their election      districts. Vannatta v. Keisling,--F. Supp.--(D. Ore. 1995).       Moreover, in-state limitations could deprive particular      kinds of underfinanced, insurgent candidates of the kind of      out-of-state support they need. Just as much of the civil      rights movement was funded by contributors and supporters      from other parts of the nation, so, too, are many new and      struggling candidates supported by interests beyond their      home states. This proposal would severely harm such      candidacies. Perhaps, that is its purpose.       Finally, Congress is our national legislature, and although      its representatives come and are elected from separate      districts and states, the issues you deal with are, by      definition, national issues that transcend district and state      lines and may be of concern to citizens all over the nation.      When such issues become central in certain campaigns, people      and groups from all over the country should be entitled to      have their views and voices heard on those issues. Any other      approach takes a disturbingly insular and isolated view of      political accountability and the obligations of a Member of      Congress.       3. The new controls on ``soft money'' contributions and      expenditures are unprecedented and unjustified restraints on      political parties.       The new sweeping controls on ``soft-money'' contributions      to and disbursements by political parties and other      organizations, federal, state or local, would expand the      reaches of the FECA into unprecedented new areas and far      beyond any compelling interest would require.       For the first time, any amounts expended or disbursed by a      political party in an election year ``for any activity which      might affect the outcome of a Federal election, including but      not limited to any voter registration and get-out-the-vote      activity, any generic campaign activity and any communication      that identifies a Federal candidate. . .'' would be subject      to regulation. See Section 212. The full panoply of FECA      compliance and control would be brought to bear on the      enormous amount of political party activity which heretofore      has been exempt from controls because it was not directly and      explicitly focused on specific federal candidates. And even      beyond that, ``soft money'' spending by persons other than      political parties is also for the first time subject to      comprehensive regulation, with reporting, disclosure and      notification requirements mandated as well as a required      certification of whether the disbursement ``is in support      of, or in opposition to, one or more candidates or any      political party.''       The reach of these new proposals is breathtaking. Starting      with Buckley v. Valeo, the Court has recognized a fundamental      constitutional distinction between candidate-focused      expenditures and contributions, which can be subject to      certain specific regulation, and all other non-partisan,      political and issue-oriented speech, advocacy and      association. See Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. at 14-15, 78-80,      First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765      (1978); FEC v. Massachusetts Citizens For Life, 479 U.S. 238,      249 (1986). The reason for this First Amendment Continental      Divide is to insure that the permissible regulation of      candidate-focused political campaign funding remains confined      to that area, and does not expand to encompass all the      funding of all political issues and groups. These regulations      of funding which is not candidate-focused transgresses this      boundary and requires, at the very least, the demonstration      of the most compelling governmental interests, necessarily      and narrowly achieved by the sweeping new controls.       Moreover, any regulation of political parties is a      regulation of a quintessential First Amendment      instrumentality and likewise requires compelling      justification, at a minimum. See Tashjian v. Republican      Party, 479 U.S. 208 (1986); Eu v. San Francisco Democratic      Party, 489 U.S. 214 (1989). Political parties play a vital      role in galvanizing the political life of the nation. Indeed,      many political scientists have expressed mounting concern      that one consequence of the current regime of candidate-     focused political funding and activity is unfortunately to      undermine the role of parties, special interest groups or ad      hoc coalitions as instruments for political activity and      vitality. For that reason, an expanded amount of party      spending on voter registration, party identification, get-     out-the-vote drives, and partisan-based issue discussion      (``The Republicans want to cut Medicare and Medicaid. Don't      let them do it.'' or, ``The Democrats support a welfare      state. Say no to government dependents.'') should be a      welcome development, rather than the target for new and      overbearing regulatory restrictions. It is also a      constitutionally-derived right: ``. . . Discussion of public      issues and debate on the qualifications of candidates are      integral to the operation of the system of government      established by our Constitution . . . In a republic where the      people are sovereign, the ability of the citizenry to make      informed choices among candidates for office is essential.''      Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. at 14-15.       Finally, to some extent the motivations for the new      restraints on party activity may reflect a concern about the      source of the ``soft money'' funding, namely, from      corporations and large individual donors. In that regard, it      should be observed that Buckley upheld the $1,000 limit on      individual contributions to candidates in part because there      would be so many other ways in which people and organizations      could bring their financial resources to bear on politics.      See 424 U.S. at 28-29, 44-45. The bill would block avenues of      advocacy that the Buckley Court assumed would remain open.       These issues are presently before the Supreme Court in an      important case in which certiorari was granted in early      January. See Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee      v. Federal Election Commission, O.T. 1995, No. 95-489,      reviewing, 59 F.3d 1015 (10th Cir. 1995). At the very least,      any action on this section of the bill should await the      Court's resolution of the Colorado case. For your      information, the ACLU plans to file an amicus curiae brief in      support of the Colorado Republican Federal Campaign      Committee.       4. The new provisions governing the right to make      independent expenditures improperly intrude upon that core      area of electoral speech and impermissibly invade the      absolutely protected area of issue advocacy.       Two basic truths have emerged with crystal clarity after      twenty years of campaign finance regulations. First,      independent electoral advocacy by citizen groups lies at the      very core of the meaning and purpose of the First Amendment.      Second, issue advocacy by citizen group lies totally outside      the permissible area of government regulation.       In Buckley the Court upheld the speech and association      rights of individuals to engage in independent campaign      expenditures expressly advocating the election or defeat of      political candidates. In Federal Election Commission v.      National Conservative Political Action Committee, 470 U.S.      480 (1985), the Court assured the same rights to political      action committees. And in Federal Election Commission v.      Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc., 470 U.S. 238 (1986)      the same right of express electoral advocacy was extended to      certain kinds of non-profit advocacy groups despite their      corporate form, although a later case held that other      corporate entities could be restricted in this regard. See      Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, 494 U.S. 652 (1990).       S. 1219 abridges these rights in two ways. First, Section      201 of the bill completely bans independent expenditures by      PACs, which is flatly unconstitutional, as noted above. On      the ``fallback'' assumption of such likely invalidation,      Section 251 redefines independent expenditures so narrowly      and ``coordinated'' expenditures so broadly that the area of      freedom of speech and association is drastically reduced and      abridged in the process.       Under current law, an independent expenditures is one made      without the knowledge or permission of a candidate, his or      her agent or campaign committee. See 2 U.S.C. section 431(17)      (``The term `independent expenditure' means an expenditure by      a person expressly advocating the election or defeat of a      clearly identified candidate which is made without     cooperation or consultation with any candidate, or any      authorized committee or agent of such candidate, and which is      not made in concert with, or at the request or suggestion of,      any candidate or any authorized committee or agent of such      candidate.''). Coordinated expenditures are treated like and      limited like contributions to a candidate.       The proposed bill, however, so broadly defines coordination      that virtually any person who has had any interaction with a      candidate or any campaign official, in person or otherwise,      is barred from making an independent expenditure. For      example, under Section 251, any expenditure is deemed      coordinated, and not independent, if the person making it      ``has advised or counseled'' the candidate or his agents on      any matter relating to the campaign or election. If you use      the same political consultant or firm as the candidate you      are likewise deemed coordinated.       These restrictions embody a new and impermissible version      of ``guilt by association,'' and a new kind of ``gag rule''      by association. See De Jonge v. Oregon, 299 U.S. 353 (1937)      (A speaker cannot be punished for organizing a meeting and      appearing on the same public platform where radicals were      also speaking). Indeed, it could have some perverse effects.      A disaffected campaign worker or volunteer, who leaves a      campaign because he or she thinks a candidate has acted      improperly, is barred from making independent expenditures      against that candidate, for, ironically, they will be deemed      a contribution.       The other way in which the provision governing independent      expenditures is fatally flawed is in its expanded definition      of ``express advocacy,'' which is defined as a communication      that ``taken as a whole and with limited reference to      external events'' communicates ``an expression of support for      or opposition to'' a specific candidate or groups of      candidates. ``Expression of support'' includes ``a      suggestion to take action with respect to an election,''      including ``to refrain from taking action.'' ``Throw the      rascals out'' has just become express advocacy.       This broadened definition of ``express advocacy'' would      sweep in the kind of essential issue advocacy which Buckley      and cases predating Buckley by a generation, see Thomas v.      Collins, 323 U.S. 516 (1945), have held to be immune from      government regulation and control. It seems to be targeted      exactly against the kind of voting record ``box score''      discussion that emanates from the hundreds and thousands of      issue organizations that enrich our public and political      life. In Buckley, the Court adopted a bright line test of      express advocacy (words that in express terms advocate the      election of defeat of a candidate) in order to immunize issue      advocacy form regulation: ``So long as persons or groups      eschew expenditures that in express terms advocate the      election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate, they      are free to spend as much as they want to promote the      candidate and his views.'' Id. at 45. Indeed, the 1975 Act      contained a similar provision regulating issue groups and      their ``box score'' activities, and that section was      unanimously held unconstitutional by the en banc Court of      Appeals, without any further appeal by the government. See      Buckley v. Valeo, 519 F.2d 817, 832 (D.C. Cir. 1975). The      expanded definition of ``express advocacy'' is similarly      flawed.       5. The bill gives unacceptable new powers of prior      restraint and political censorship to the Federal Election      Commission.       With all of these problems with the bill, particularly      those that pertain to issue advocacy and independent      expenditures, giving the Federal Election Commission sweeping      new powers to go to court to seek an injunction on the      allegation of a ``substantial likelihood that a violation . .      . is about to occur'' is fraught with First Amendment peril.       As indicated earlier in this testimony, the very first suit      brought under the brand spanking new campaign reforms in 1972      was against a small group of dissenters who sponsored an ad      in The New York Times criticizing the President and praising      a handful of his Congressional critics. Reminiscent of some      of the language in the bill before you, the government's      claim was that the advertisement was an electioneering      message because it was ``in derogation of'' candidate Nixon      and ``in support of'' the praised Members who were also up      for re-election. While the courts quickly and sharply      rebuffed those efforts to use political campaign laws to      control issue advocacy, see United States v. National      Committee for Impeachment, 469 F.2d 1135 (2d Cir. 1972);      American Civil Liberties Union v. Jennings, 366 F. Supp. 1041      (D.D.C. 1973), the Commission's record of sensitivity to      First Amendment values in the area of issue advocacy was once      described as ``abysmal.'' See National Committee for      Impeachment, supra, 469 F.2d at 1141-42 (Kaufman, C.J.      concurring). And ever since then, non-partisan, issue-     oriented groups like the ACLU, the National Organization for      Women, the Chamber of Commerce, Right-to-Life Committees and      many others, have had to defend themselves against charges      that their public advocacy rendered them subject to all of      the FECA's restrictions, regulations and controls. And the      problem persists. See Federal Election Commission v. Survival      Education Fund, 65 F.3d 285 (2d Cir. 1995) (holding, 2 to 1,      that 1984 fund-raising mailings critical of President      Reagan's foreign policies constituted a solicitation of a      contribution subject to FECA requirements).       The kind of ``chilling effect'' that such enforcement      authority generates in the core area of protected speech      makes the strongest case against giving the Commission      additional powers to tamper with First Amendment rights.
