The amendment, which we want to offer and which the Republicans are resisting, deals with workers already in America, many of whom are asking to be treated fairly under our immigration laws. Business and labor, as well, are saying they deserve to be treated fairly.  As an example, the Senator from Nevada has talked about those who came to this country, started families, started working, paid their taxes, never once committed a crime, building their communities and their neighborhoods, and are now caught in this snarl, this tangle, this bureaucratic nightmare of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. They are asking for their chance, as many of our parents and grandparents had, to become American citizens legally and finally.  It strikes me as odd that those of us in the Senate who understand how bad this immigration battle is for individuals and families would resist this amendment, the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act.  In my office in Chicago, in my senatorial office, two-thirds of the casework is on immigration. We are in a constant battle with the INS. What our amendment seeks to do is to say these people deserve fair treatment. For goodness' sake, you can call yourself a compassionate conservative or a compassionate liberal or a compassionate moderate, but if you believe in compassion, how can you resist an amendment that is going to give to these families here in America--working hard, building our Nation--a chance to be treated fairly under the law?
