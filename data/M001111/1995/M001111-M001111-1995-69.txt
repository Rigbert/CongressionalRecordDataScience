  I just want to point out, because I think this is the family who has been forgotten--we talked about them in the welfare debate. We said their mother has to go to work in this country. We passed that bill out of the Senate. It is passed out of the House. This is the single mother with two children who earns $12,000 a year. This is how this budget will impact this mother. She is going to lose her earned income tax credit. She is going to lose $373 a year under this budget. This mother is going to lose $300 a year on food stamps. This mother is going to lose $2,400 a year that pays for Medicaid and health care coverage for her children. And she is going to have to pay $480 to her State in order to collect child support from her missing husband.  This budget will cost this single mother with two young children $3,553. As my colleagues have pointed out, she is going to lose. And who is going to win? The richest 1 percent of Americans will get a tax break every single year.  I ask my colleagues. Who do we value in this country? Do we value a young mother who is working and trying to raise her kids? Are we going to ignore her in this budget process? I think it is critical that we take the time to evaluate it, and it is critical that we listen to the people across this country about the priorities that we are going to set in the future.  I join my colleagues on the Budget Committee in expressing our outrage at what is occurring. I thank my colleague.  I yield the floor.
