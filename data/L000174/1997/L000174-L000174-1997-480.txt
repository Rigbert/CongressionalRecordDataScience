President, I rise to introduce the Anti-Gang and Youth Violence Control Act of 1997. This is the President's juvenile justice bill, and I am pleased to introduce it on behalf of the administration.  Like the Democratic leadership bill, S. 15, the President's Anti-Gang and Youth Violence Control Act includes important provisions to address the increases in juvenile crime and gang violence that we have seen over the past decade.  Just as we proposed measures in S. 15 to streamline the procedures for prosecuting violent juveniles, the President's bill would take steps to ensure that serious juvenile offenses are addressed quickly and efficiently by the courts.  In addition, the President's bill targets many of the same problems we addressed in S. 15, such as increasing the penalties for witness intimidation--a particular problem for prosecutors in gang cases--and improving the rights of the victims of juvenile crime to include restitution, notification of disposition, and greater public access to juvenile proceedings.  The President's bill also addresses the Federal Government's grant authority in the area of juvenile justice and delinquency prevention. I applaud the President for his reform-minded effort for improving the Federal Government's role in helping State and local authorities prevent juvenile crime and juvenile victimization. I look forward to working with the President and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle on this issue. It is important that we reach a bipartisan agreement on the role the Federal Government should play in this area as we move forward into the next century.  Certain sections of the administration's bill differ from S. 15, and I look forward to sorting out this and other differences in the proposals.  I commend President Clinton and the Department of Justice on their efforts to address the problems of gang and youth violence with the concrete proposals in this bill. I urge my colleagues to put partisan politics aside, to work together on finding constructive solutions to these problems. Our challenge is to resolve any differences in approach in ways that make sense and will work to reduce youth and gang violence.  As we proceed to meet this challenge, I know we will depend heavily on Senator Biden, our former chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee and now the ranking member on the Youth Violence Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee. He has worked hard and effectively on these issues in the past and, I thank him in advance for continuing to share his expertise on these important issues.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: ANTI-GANG AND YOUTH VIOLENCE ACT OF 1997--SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS       The Anti-Gang and Youth Violence Act of 1997 is a      comprehensive federal effort to address the nation's youth      and juvenile crime problem. This legislation contains many of      the proposed amendments to the federal code that were      contained in legislation introduced, but not enacted into law      during the 104th Congress. This legislation also redesigns,      refocuses, and enhances the federal government's role in      relation to state, local and Indian tribal governments in      combating and preventing juvenile and youth crime, violence,      gang involvement, and drug use. Additionally, this      legislation includes the authorization for several programs      submitted by the President in his fiscal year 1998 budget      request.               Title I--Findings, Policies, and Purposes       This title enumerates findings regarding juvenile crime and      violence, as well as purposes tied to the various provisions      of the legislation. Additional definitions are provided as      needed.         Title II--Targeting Violent Gang, Gun and Drug Crimes Subtitle A--Federal Prosecutions Targeting Violent Gangs, Gun Crimes                    and Illicit Gun Markets, and Drugs            Part 1--Targeting Gang and Other Violent Crimes     Section 2111.  Increased penalties under the RICO law for          gang and violent crimes.       This amendment would boost the penalty for certain crimes      typically committed by gangs and other violent crime groups      by eliminating an anomaly in the penalty provisions of the      federal Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations      statute (18 U.S.C. 1963(a)). Specifically, the amendment      would increase the maximum penalty from twenty years to the      greater of twenty years or the maximum term applicable to a      racketeering activity on which the defendant's violation is      based. This principle already applies under the RICO statute      where the predicate racketeering activity carries a maximum      life sentence. The present twenty-year maximum applicable to      all other predicate racketeering offenses is anomalous in      light of the fact that several of the predicate offenses that      constitute ``racketeering activity'' themselves carry more      than twenty-year (but less than life) maximum prison terms,      e.g., 18 U.S.C. 1344 (bank fraud) and 21 U.S.C. 841(b)(1)(B)      (large-scale drug trafficking).     Section 2112.  Increased penalty and broadened scope of          statute against violent crimes in aid of racketeering.       This amendment would close loopholes in 18 U.S.C. 1959, the      law punishing violent crimes in aid of racketeering. The      statute presently and anomalously reaches threats to commit      any crime of violence (with the requisite intent) but only      the actual commission of some such crimes. The amendment also      would clarify that the term ``serious bodily injury'' in 18      U.S.C. 1959 shall be defined as provided in 18 U.S.C. 1365.       This proposal also would increase penalties for certain      violent crimes in aid of racketeering in recognition of the      serious nature of such crimes and to bring the penalties in      line with other penalties for similar crimes in title 18.      First, the amendment would increase from a maximum of ten      years' imprisonment to a maximum of life imprisonment a      conspiracy or attempt to commit murder or kidnapping, in      violation of 18 U.S.C. 1959. That statute punishes various      violent offenses committed in aid of racketeering activity.      The present ten-year maximum penalty for a conspiracy or      attempt to commit murder or kidnapping in aid of racketeering      is clearly inadequate. The maximum penalty for a conspiracy      to commit a murder within the special maritime and      territorial jurisdiction of the United States is life      imprisonment, 18 U.S.C. 1117, as is the maximum penalty for a      conspiracy to commit kidnapping, 18 U.S.C. 1201(c). Such acts      when performed with the additional intent of furthering      racketeering activity deserve no lesser punishment. Moreover,      an attempt warrants an equivalent sanction as a conspiracy.      Second, the amendment would increase from five years to ten      years the maximum penalty for committing or threatening to      commit a crime of violence under paragraph (4). Finally, the      amendment would increase from three years to ten years the      maximum penalty for attempting or conspiring to commit a      crime involving maiming, assault with a dangerous weapon or      assault resulting in serious bodily injury under paragraph      (6).     Section 2113.  Facilitating the prosecution of car-jacking          offenses.       This section would eliminate an unjustified and unique      scienter element created for the offense of carjacking by the      enactment of section 60003(a)(14) of the Violent Crime      Control and Law Enforcement Act. The carjacking statute, 18      U.S.C. 2119, essentially proscribes robbery of a motor      vehicle. It punishes the taking of a motor vehicle that has      moved in interstate or foreign commerce ``from the person or      presence of another by force and violence or by      intimidation.'' The basic penalty is up to fifteen years'      imprisonment but rises if serious bodily injury or death      results.       Prior to the enactment of VCCLEA, the offense applied only      if the defendant possessed a firearm. Section 60003(a)(14) of      that law appropriately deleted the firearm requirement, as      had been proposed in the Senate-passed bill, but in      conference a new scienter element was added that the      defendant must have intended to cause death or serious      bodily injury. This unique new element will      inappropriately make carjackings difficult or impossible      to prosecute in certain situations. Robbery offenses      typically require only what the carjacking statute      formerly required by way of scienter, i.e., that property      be knowingly taken from the person or presence of another      by force and violence or by intimidation. The Hobbs Act,      18 U.S.C. 1951, the quintessential federal robbery law      which carries a higher maximum penalty     than the carjacking statute, essential defines ``robbery''      in this manner. The new requirement of an intent to cause      death or serious bodily harm will likely be a fertile      course of argument for defendants in cases in which no      immediate threat of injury occurs, such as where a      defendant enters an occupied vehicle while it is stopped      at a traffic light and physically removes the driver. Even      when a weapon is displayed, the defendant may argue that      although it was designed to instill fear, he had no intent      to harm the victim had the victim in fact declined to      leave the car.       Carjacking is one of the most serious types of robbery      precisely because, unlike other person property, a car is a      place where people are accustomed to feel safe and where they      and their family spend hours of their lives. To give      defendants who take cars from the person or presence of their      occupants by force and violence or intimidation a new legal      tool with which to resist their prosecution is unjustified.      This new element should be eliminated as soon as possible      from Section 2119. The proposed amendment would do so.     Section 2114.  Facilitation of RICO prosecutions.       This amendment is intended to overcome decisions in the      First and Second Circuits that require proof that a RICO      conspiracy defendant agreed personally to commit at least two      acts of racketeering activity. United States v. Ruggiero, 726      F. 2d 913, 921 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 831 (1984);      United States v. Winter, 663 F. 2d 1120, 1136 (1st Cir.      1981), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1011 (1981). See also United      States v. Sanders, 929 F. 2d 1466, 1473 (10th Cir.), cert.      denied, 112 S. Ct. 143 (1991). Virtually all other circuits      have more recently rejected these holdings and have concluded      that it is sufficient to show that the defendant joined the      conspiracy and agreed that two or more racketeering acts      would be committed by some conspirators on behalf of the      enterprise. See, e.g., United States v. Pryba, 900 F. 2d 748,      759-60 (4th Cir. 1990); United States v. Traitz, 871 F. 2d      368, 395-96 (3 d Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 821 (1989);      United States v. Neapolitan, 791 F. 2d 489, 491-98 (7th Cir.      1986), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1101 (1987); United States v.      Joseph, 781 F. 2d 549, 554-55 (6th Cir. 1986; United States      v. Tille, 729 F. 2d 615, 619 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 469      U.S. 845 (1984); United States v. Carter, 721 F. 2d 1514,      1528-31 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 819 (1984).       There is no reason to require that a defendant charged with      RICO conspiracy personally commit racketeering acts. Standard      conspiracy law does not contain such a requirement. See,      e.g., Pinkerton v. United States, 328 U.S. 640, 645-48      (1946). It should be sufficient to show that the defendant      joined the overall conspiracy and agreed to the commission of      a pattern of racketeering activity by others on behalf of the      conspiracy. This amendment resolves this conflict in the      circuits.     Section 2115.  Elimination of the statute of limitations for          murder and Class A felonies.       This section makes important changes in federal law and      will enhance the ability of federal prosecutors to bring      serious offenders to justice. The first proposal relates to      the prosecution of certain murders. Current law provides that      no statute of limitations shall apply for the commission of a      federal crime punishable by death. 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3281. This      statute should be amended to further eliminate the statute of      limitations for any federal offense involving murder, even if      the crime does not carry the death penalty. The rationale      behind this proposal is straightforward. Most states have no      statute of limitations for murder. Moreover, the act of      killing another person is so serious that no murderer should      go unpunished simply because the government was unable to      develop a case for many years.       By virtue of the 1994 Crime Act, most murders committed      during the course of a federal offense are now punishable by      the death penalty--and thus already have no statute of      limitations. The 1994 Crime Act only applies, however, to      murders committed on or after the Crime Bill was passed on      September 13, 1994. The proposed legislation will help bridge      this gap by eliminating the statute of limitations for      murders committed within five years of the date of passage of      the legislation and September 13, 1994. Furthermore, the      Crime Act did not provide for the death penalty for murders      committed in violation of the RICO statute. 18 U.S.C.      Sec. Sec. 1961 et seq. The proposed legislation would bridge      another important gap by eliminating the statute of      limitations for RICO offenses when murders are committed in      furtherance of a racketeering enterprise.       The second proposal relates to the prosecution of certain      violent crimes and drug trafficking crimes. Current law      provides that the general federal five-year statute of      limitations applies to non-capital crimes of violence and      drug trafficking crimes. 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3282. This proposal      extends to 10 years the statute of limitations for all crimes      of violence and drug trafficking crimes (except for cases      involving murder) currently classified as Class A felonies.      Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3559, Class A felonies are      the most serious federal crimes, which carry a maximum      sentence of life imprisonment or death.       This proposal is necessary for several reasons. First,      evidence of gang-related and other violent crimes, as well as      drug trafficking crimes, often develops years after the      crimes were committed because the organizations, gangs, and      racketeering enterprises that typically perpetrate such      crimes enforce strict codes of silence--through violence and      threats of violence--on their members. Thus, some violent      crimes and drug trafficking crimes are not solved until      imprisoned defendants begin to cooperate after spending years      behind bars--years in which the five-year statutes of      limitations may have lapsed. Second, society's interest in      repose and fairness to prospective defendants is greatly      outweighed by society's interest in punishing those      individuals who commit crimes that are so serious that      Congress has imposed a maximum sentence of life imprisonment      or death. Under current law, theft of major art work carries      a 20-year statute of limitations (18 U.S.C. Sec. 3294), and      most white-collar crimes involving financial institutions      (e.g., theft of money by a bank teller) carry a 10-year      statute of limitations (18 U.S.C. Sec. 3293). Given that      Class A crimes of violence and drug trafficking crimes      generally are at least as harmful to society as these      offenses, there is no reason for these Class A felonies to      carry such a relatively short statute of limitations.     Section 2116.  Forfeiture for crimes of violence,          racketeering, and obstruction of justice.       This section extends the forfeiture statutes to cover all      crimes of violence plus the racketeering crimes set forth in      Chapter 95 (18 U.S.C. Sec. 1951-60), including extortion,      murder-for-hire, and violent crimes in aid of racketeering,      and the obstruction of justice offenses set forth in Chapter      73 (18 U.S.C. Sec. 1501-17). Presently, there is no      forfeiture authority for such offenses except when they are      included in a RICO prosecution. Part 2--Targeting Serious Gun Crimes and Protecting Children from Gun                                 Violence     Section 2121.  Gun ban for dangerous juvenile offenders.       This amendment would make it unlawful for any person      adjudicated a juvenile delinquent for serious violent      felonies or drug crimes to receive or possess firearms. It      would also make it unlawful for any person to sell or      otherwise dispose of any firearm to any person knowing or      having reasonable cause to believe that the recipient has      been adjudicated a juvenile delinquent for such crimes. Under      current law, persons adjudicated juvenile delinquent, even      for the most serious crimes, e.g., murder, may receive and      possess firearms as adults. This amendment will ensure that      such juveniles will be ineligible to possess firearms after      the finding of juvenile delinquency.       The disability will only apply to the most serious drug      offenses and violent crimes, as enumerated in the recently      enacted ``three-strikes'' law (but because it would otherwise      be impossible to administer, the proposed statutory reference      incorporates the basic offenses enumerated in paragraph      (c)(2) of section 3559, without the exceptions set forth in      paragraph (3)). In addition, this amendment will only apply      to findings of acts of juvenile delinquency that occur after      the effective date of the statute. Thus, persons who have      acted or been adjudicated delinquent prior to the effective      date will not be subject to this disability. Adjudicated      delinquents would be permitted under the proposal to have      their firearms rights restored based upon an individualized      determination by an appropriate authority of the state of      their suitability for such restoration.       The proposal also would make a conforming change to the      restoration of rights statute affecting adult convictions.      One of the most serious problems today hindering enforcement      of a federal firearms statutes arises from the definition of      ``conviction'' in 18 U.S.C. 921(a)(20). Under 18 U.S.C.      922(g), it is unlawful for a convicted felon to possess a      firearm. Section 922(g) violations also serve as the basis      for the mandatory penalties applicable under the Armed Career      Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. 924(e), for 922(g) violators with      three or more crime of violence or serious drug trafficking      convictions. What is a ``conviction'' is therefore vital to      the enforcement of these important provisions.       Prior to the 1986 Firearms Owners' Protection Act, a      conviction for purposes of federal firearms prohibitions was      a question of federal, not state, law. Federal law provided      that once an individual was convicted of a felony, that      person remained under a federal firearms disability      irrespective of state laws purporting to restore the person's      rights to possess firearms. Offenders could apply for relief      from firearms disabilities to the Secretary of the Treasury.      The 1986 Act, however, changed this policy and provided, in      18 U.S.C. 921(a)(20), that a conviction for which a person      has had civil rights restored generally ``shall not be      considered a conviction'' under federal firearms statutes.       The 1986 amendment has had adverse effects from the      standpoint of public safety. This results from the fact that      about half the states have laws that provide for some form of      automatic firearms rights restoration, including several      states that provide for such restoration after a waiting      period, and at least one state that automatically restores      firearms possession rights immediately upon completion of a      felon's sentence, so that the felon is enabled to walk      directly out of prison into a gun dealer's establishment and      legally arrange to purchase a firearm. Other states make      restoration of rights automatic except for certain categories      of felons (typically those convicted of violent crimes),      while still other states make restoration automatic for      some types of firearms but not others.       Under the proposed amendment, state laws restoring firearms      rights would continue to be recognized for federal firearms      enforcement purposes, but only if the restoration of     rights was done on an individualized rather than an automatic      basis, including a determination that the circumstances of      the person's conviction, and his or her record and      reputation, make it unlikely that the person will endanger      public safety. The Federal Government should not give effect      to state restoration of rights statutes that provide for no      individualized consideration of the offender's likelihood of      committing future crimes. About half the states currently      restore firearms rights only after such an individualized      review. The remaining states need not change their laws if      they do not wish to do so, but the Congressional policy      underlying the federal felon-in-possession prohibition in 18      U.S.C. 922(g) should not be deemed superseded by a state law      that automatically restores a felon's firearms rights. Such      automatic restoration laws insufficiently protect the public      safety, not only in the states that provide for such      automatic restoration but in other states to which the      convicted felon may travel.       The proposed amendment also includes a provision, in the      final sentence, that would reverse the outcome in United      States v. Indelicato, 97 F.3d 627 (1st Cir. 1996). The Court      there held, contrary to other courts of appeals, that where a      state had never deprived a convicted felon of his or her      civil rights as a result of the conviction, that person was      to be considered as if the state had ``restored'' such      rights. Whether or not this interpretation is deemed correct      under the current law, as a matter of policy it makes sense      to require a state to make an individualized determination of      suitability to possess firearms in every case involving a      conviction of a state crime punishable by more than one year      in prison.     Section 2122.  Locking devices for firearms.       The amendment would require Federal firearms licensees,      other than licensed collectors, to provide a locking device      with every firearm sold to a nonlicensee. The term ``locking      device'' would be defined as a device that can be installed      on a firearm that prevents the firearm from being discharged      without removing the device. It would also include firearms      being developed which can ``identify'' their lawful possessor      by the use of a personal electronic ``key'', palmprint, or      other identifier. The provision is intended to provide added      safety to gun owners and to prevent accidental discharges      that can result when children gain access to firearms.     Section 2123. Enhanced penalties for discharging or          possessing a firearm during a crime of violence or drug          trafficking crime.       In Bailey v. United States, __ U.S. __, 116 S. Ct. 501, 133      L. Ed. 2nd 472 (1995), the Supreme Court put a restrictive      interpretation of the verb ``use'' in relation to a firearms      violation under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(c), finding that an      offender only ``uses'' a firearm if the weapon is ``actively      employed'' in connection with a criminal act. The legislative      proposal makes it clear that the statute punishes possession      of a firearm, as well as its ``use.'' Under the proposal,      possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent      crime or drug felony will result in a 5-year mandatory      minimum penalty. Offenders will receive a 10-year mandatory      minimum penalty if during the commission of a drug felony or      violent crime, the offender discharges the firearm or uses it      to inflict bodily harm.     Section 2124.  Juvenile handgun possession.       This proposal would increase the penalties for violations      of 18 U.S.C. 922(x), which makes it unlawful for a person to      transfer a handgun to a juvenile or for a juvenile to possess      a handgun. Existing law provides a penalty of not more than      one year for violations of Sec. 922(x) and, if the person      transferring the handgun to the juvenile knew that the      handgun would be used in a crime of violence, a penalty of      not more than 10 years. Existing law also provides for      probation by juvenile offenders, unless the juvenile has been      previously convicted of certain offenses or adjudicated as a      juvenile delinquent.       The proposal would eliminate probation as a mandatory      sentence for juveniles. Thus, juveniles would be sentenced to      a penalty of not more than one year or, if previously      convicted under this section or adjudicated delinquent for an      act that would be a serious violent felony under 18 U.S.C.      3559(c) if committed by an adult, sentenced to up to five      years' imprisonment. The proposal also increases the penalty      for adults who transfer handguns to juveniles knowing that      they intend to use it in the commission of a crime of      violence to not less than three years nor more than 10 years      (currently only the ten-year maximum applies).     Section 2125.  Increased penalty for firearms conspiracy.       This section would amend the firearms chapter of title 18      to provide that a conspiracy to commit any violation of that      chapter is punishable by the same maximum term as that      applicable to the substantive offense that was the object of      the conspiracy. An identical amendment was enacted to the      explosives chapter of title 18 by section 701 of the Anti-     Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-     132). This also accords with several other recent      congressional enactments, including 21 U.S.C. 846 (applicable      to drug conspiracies) and 18 U.S.C. 1956(h) (applicable to      money laundering conspiracies). This trend in federal law,      which is emulated in the penal codes of many States,      recognizes that, as the Supreme Court has observed,      ``collective criminal agreement--partnership in crime--     presents a greater potential threat to the public than      individual delicts.'' Callanan v. United States, 364 U.S.      587, 593 (1961); accord, United States v. Feola, 420 U.S.      671, 693-94 (1975).                 Part 3--Targeting Illicit Gun Markets     Section 2131.  Certain gang-related firearms offenses as RICO          predicates       The proposed amendment would add a number of title 18      firearms offenses that are related to gang activity to the      RICO statute. A brief description of the covered offenses is      as follows: 922(a)(1) (illegally engaging in business of      dealing in firearms); (922(a)(6) (knowingly making false      statement to a licensee in order to acquire a firearm);      922(i) (transporting a firearm in interstate or foreign      commerce knowing it to have been stolen); 922(j) (possession      or disposition of a firearm or ammunition knowing it to have      been stolen); 922(k) (transporting or receiving a firearm      interstate with an obliterated serial number); 922(o)      (unlawful possession or transfer of a machinegun); 922(g)      (unlawful possession of a firearm that affects or has moved      in interstate commerce in a school zone); 922(u) (theft from      a licensee of a firearm that has moved in interstate      commerce; 922(v) (illegal transfer or possession of a      semiautomatic assault weapon); (922(x)(1) sale or transfer of      a firearm to a person known to be a juvenile); 924(b)      (transporting or receiving a firearm in interstate commerce      with intent to commit therewith a felony); 924(g) (traveling      interstate to acquire a firearm, with intent to commit a      crime of violence, drug trafficking offense, or other      enumerated felony); (24(h) (transferring a firearm with      knowledge it will be used to commit a crime of violence or      drug trafficking offense); 924(k) (smuggling a firearm into      the United States with intent to commit a crime of violence      or drug trafficking offense); 924(l) (theft of a firearm from      a licensee); and 924(m) (traveling in interstate or foreign      commerce to acquire a firearm, with intent to engage      illegally in business of dealing in firearms).     Section 2132.  Felony treatment for offenses tantamount to          aiding and abetting unlawful purchases       This proposal would increase the punishment for the most      serious record keeping violations committed by federal      licensees, which are tantamount to aiding and abetting      unlawful deliveries or purchases of firearms, to the same      level of offense as that committed by the unlawful provider      or receiver. Sections 922(b) (1) and (3) proscribe sales of      firearms known to be juveniles or to reside out of State,      respectively. Each carries a five-year maximum sentence for a      willful violation under 18 U.S.C. 924(a)(1)(D). Sections      922(a)(6) and (d) proscribe, respectively, making false      statements to a licensee in relation to the acquisition of a      firearm, and knowingly selling a firearm to a convicted felon      or other prohibited category of firearm recipient. Each is      punishable by up to ten years' imprisonment.       At present, all record keeping violations by licensees are      misdemeanors carrying a maximum of one year in prison. This      is insufficient in the above situations, where the knowingly      false record keeping entry is very serious and closely      associate with or in the nature of aiding and abetting a      violation involving the provision of a firearm to a person      not entitled to obtain it. Accordingly, the amendment would      increase the penalty for such record keeping violations to      the same as that would attach to the underlying violation.     Section 2133.  Secure storage of firearms inventories       This amendment would require Federal firearms licensees      other than collectors and gunsmiths to store their firearms      inventory in accordance with regulations issued by the      Secretary. The purpose of the amendment is to provide      security requirements for the firearms industry. Thefts of      firearms from dealers is a growing problem and contributes to      the number of firearms available to juvenile youth gangs and      other criminals. In issuing the storage regulations, the      Secretary would be required to consider the standards of      safety and security used by the firearms industry. The      industry, as well as other interested persons, could      participate in the rulemaking process and have input into the      regulations.     Section 2134.  Suspension of federal firearms licenses and          civil penalties for willful violations of the Gun Control          Act       Under current law, the only available administrative      remedies to deal with licensees' violations are the extreme      measures of denying license renewal applications and license      revocation. There may be certain minor violations of the Gun      Control Act, e.g., failure to timely record information in      required records, that may not warrant license revocation or      license denial. This amendment provides new administrative      sanctions, less severe than current administrative remedies,      including license suspension, civil money penalties, and      authority to accept monetary offers in compromise of      violations of the law and regulations.     Section 2135.  Transfer of firearm to commit a crime of          violence       Present 18 U.S.C. 924(h) makes it unlawful to transfer a      firearm ``knowing'' that the firearm will be used to commit a      crime of violence or drug trafficking crime. However, 18      U.S.C. 924(b) makes it unlawful to transport or receive a      firearm in interstate commerce ``with knowledge or reasonable      cause to believe'' that any felony is to be committed     therewith. Both statutes carry the same maximum penalty.       There is no plausible reason why section 924(h) is limited      to instances in which the actor has knowledge that a crime of      violence or drug trafficking crime will be committed, as      opposed to having ``reasonable cause to believe'' that such      is the case. Indeed, the offenses covered by section 924(h)--     violent felonies and drug trafficking felonies--are      inherently more serious than the offenses covered by section      924(b), which extends to all felonies. Accordingly, this      section would conform the scienter element in section 924(h)      by adding ``reasonable cause to believe'' to that statute.     Section 2136.  Increased penalty for knowingly receiving          firearm with obliterated serial number.       The current maximum penalty for knowingly receiving a      firearm with an obliterated or altered serial number in      violation of 18 U.S.C. 922(k) is five years. This offense is      tantamount to that of receiving a firearm known to be stolen.      However, the latter carries a maximum penalty of ten years.      Accordingly, this amendment would increase the maximum      penalty for receiving a firearm with an obliterated or      altered serial number to ten years.     Section 2137.  Amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines for          transfers of firearms to prohibited persons.       The proposed amendment would require the United States      Sentencing Commission to provide an increase in the base      offense level for certain firearms violators under sentencing      guideline section 2K2.1. The increase should assure that the      base offense level for a person who transfers firearms or      ammunition with knowledge or reasonable cause to believe that      the transferee is a convicted felon or otherwise in a      prohibited category is the same as that for the transferee.      Under Federal law the offense of selling or disposing of a      firearm or ammunition to any person knowing or having      reasonable cause to believe that the person is in a      prohibited category is punishable by a maximum term of      imprisonment of 10 years--the same penalty that applies to      the transferee. See 18 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 922(d), 922(g) and      924(a)(2).       The sentencing guidelines provide that a prohibited person      who engages in a firearm offense is subject at least to      offense level 14. Thus, for example, a convicted felon who      unlawfully acquires a firearm in violation of section 922(g)      of title 18, United States Code, would face a sentencing      range of 18-24 months of imprisonment if his past conviction      resulted in a sentence of imprisonment of 60 days or more.      However, the transferor currently faces a guideline offense      level of just 12 (10-16 months of imprisonment for a first      offender, which can result in five months of imprisonment and      five months of supervised release with home confinement). The      transferor in this case should be subject to offense level      14, like the transferee.       Guideline section 2K2.1 also provides an offense level of      20 for a prohibited person whose offense involved a      machinegun or certain other dangerous firearms. The proposed      directive would require the Sentencing Commission to make      this offense level applicable to the transferor of such a      weapon if the transferor knows or has reasonable cause to      believe that the transferee is in a prohibited category.      However, the sentencing guidelines currently provide      additional base offense level increases in the case of      defendants who have prior felony convictions of either a      crime of violence or controlled substance offense,      Sec. 2K2.1(a)(1), (2), (3), and (4)(A). The directive to the      Sentencing Commission specifically exempts these additional      increases from its requirements.     Section 2138.  Forfeiture of firearms used in crimes of          violence and felonies.       The amendment adds the authority to forfeit firearms used      to commit crimes of violence and all felonies to 18 U.S.C.      Sec. Sec. 981 and 982. This authority would be in addition to      the authority already available to Treasury agencies under 18      U.S.C. Sec. 924(d).       The purpose of the amendment is (1) to provide for criminal      as well as civil forfeiture of firearms; and (2) to permit      forfeiture actions to be undertaken by Department of Justice      law enforcement agencies who have authority to enforce the      statutes governing crimes of violence but who do not have      authority to pursue forfeitures of firearms under the      existing statutes.       Section 924(d) of title 18 already provides for the civil      forfeiture of any firearm used or involved in the commission      of any ``criminal law of the United States.'' The statute,      however, is enforced only by the Treasury Department and its      agencies; it provides no authority for the FBI, for example,      to forfeit a gun used in the commission of an offense over      which it has sole jurisdiction. Moreover, Sec. 924(d)      provides for civil forfeiture only.       Subsection (d) adds a provision to 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(d)      intended to permit the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and      Firearms to forfeit property that otherwise would have to be      forfeited by another agency. Under Sec. 924(d), ATF is      presently authorized to forfeit a firearm used or carried in      a drug trafficking crime. Property involved in the drug      offense itself, such as drug proceeds, may also be      forfeitable under the Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C.      Sec. 881, but ATF does not presently have authority to      forfeit property under that statute and has to turn the      forfeitable property over to another agency. The amendment      does not expand the scope of what is forfeitable in any way,      but does allow the forfeiture to be pursued by ATF when the      agency is already involved in the forfeiture of a firearm in      the same case.       Finally, subsection (e) clarifies an ambiguity in the      present statute relating to the 120-day period in which a      forfeiture action must be filed. Presently, the statute says      that a forfeiture proceeding must be filed within 120 days of      the seizure of the property. This was intended to force the      government to initiate a forfeiture action promptly. In one      case, however, where the government did initiate an      administrative forfeiture action within the 120-day period,      the claimant filed a claim and cost bond which required the      government to begin the forfeiture action over again by      filing a formal civil judicial proceeding in federal court.      The claimant then moved to dismiss the judicial proceeding      because the complaint was filed outside the 120-day period.       The court granted the motion to dismiss because the literal      wording of Sec. 924(d) requires any forfeiture action against      the firearm to be filed within 120 days of the seizure.      United States v. Fourteen Various Firearms, __ F. Supp. __,      1995 WL 368761 (E.D. Va. June 19, 1995). This interpretation,      however, leads to unjust results in cases where the      government promptly commences an administrative forfeiture      action but the claimant waits the full time allotted to him      to file a claim. (Under Section 101 of this Act, the claimant      would have 30 days from the date of publication of notice of      the administrative forfeiture action to file a claim, which      is likely to be several months after the seizure even if the      government initiated the administrative forfeiture almost      immediately after the seizure.) In such cases, Congress could      not have intended the 120-day period for filing a judicial      complaint to count from the date of the seizure; indeed, it      is often the case that the claimant doesn't even file the      claim until more than 120 days have passed. Thus, the      amendment clarifies the statute to make clear that the      government must initiate its administrative forfeiture      proceeding within 120 days of the seizure and then will have      120 days from the filing of a claim, if one is filed, to file      the case in federal court. The amendment also tolls the 120-     day period during the time a related criminal indictment or      information is pending.     Section 2139.  Forfeiture for gun trafficking       This section provides for the forfeiture, under 18 U.S.C.      Sec. Sec. 981 and 982, of vehicles used to commit gun      trafficking, such as transporting stolen firearms, and for      the proceeds of such offenses. The provision is limited to      instances in which five or more firearms are involved, thus      making it clear that it is not intended to be used in      instances where an individual commits a violation involving a      small number of firearms in his or her personal possession.  Part 4--Targeting Serious Drug Crimes and Protecting Children From                                  Drugs     Section 2141.  Increased penalties for using minors to          distribute drugs       This provision would amend Section 420 of the Controlled      Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 861) to increase the current      mandatory minimum penalty for using or employing minors to      distribute drugs from one year to three years. Similarly, the      provision would increase the mandatory minimum penalty for a      second or subsequent violation of this statute from one year      to five years. The proposed increases are necessary to punish      persons who use or employ minors to distribute illegal drugs      and to deter others from engaging in such reprehensible      conduct.     Section 2142.1  Increased penalties for distributing drugs to          minors       This provision would amend Section 418 of the Controlled      Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 859) to increase the minimum      penalty for distributing drugs to minors from one year to      three years for a first offense, and from one year to five      years for a second or subsequent offense. The proposal would      also alter the age of the minor that triggers these      penalties. Under the proposed amendment, the penalties would      apply whenever a person at least eighteen years of age      distributes drugs to a person under eighteen. Presently, the      statute punishes a person at least eighteen who distributes      drugs to a person under twenty-one, thus reaching some      transactions in which the buyer is significantly older than      the seller. This makes little sense and is inconsistent with      the companion statute, 21 U.S.C. 861, which punishes persons      who employ minors to distribute drugs. The proposed amendment      would bring section 859 into conformity with section 861.     Section 2143.1  Increased penalties for drug trafficking in          or near a school or other protected location       This provision would amendment Section 419 of the      Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 860) to increase the      mandatory minimum penalty for distributing drugs in or near a      school or other protected location. The provision also would      increase the mandatory minimum penalty for second and      subsequent offenses from one to five years. The increased      penalties for drug trafficking in or near schools or other      protected locations are consistent with the other proposed      penalty increases in this legislation and are aimed at      protecting children from drug trafficking and abuse,      punishing drug dealers who target     children, and deterring others who might engage in such      conduct.     Section 2144.1  Serious juvenile drug trafficking offenses as          Armed Career Criminal Act predicates       This section would amend the Armed Career Criminal Act      (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(e)(2)(A), to permit the use of an      adjudication of juvenile delinquency based on a serious drug      trafficking offense as a predicate offense under that Act.      The ACCA targets for a lengthy period of at least 15 years'      imprisonment those felons found in unlawful possession of a      firearm who have proven records of involvement in serious      acts of misconduct involving drugs and violence.     Section 2145.  Attorney General authority to reschedule          certain drugs posing imminent danger to public safety.       Under existing law, the Attorney General is empowered to      add temporarily a substance to Schedule I of the Controlled      Substances Act when necessary to respond to an imminent      danger to public safety. See 21 U.S.C. 811(h). However, the      Attorney General is not authorized to reschedule a substance      that already has been placed on one of the schedules of the      Controlled Substances Act. Once a substance has been added to      one of the schedules, any rescheduling of that substance must      be done pursuant to the standard procedures for scheduling or      rescheduling a substance. Under the standard procedures, the      rescheduling of a substance can take several years.       The proposal would extend the Attorney General's existing      authority to schedule a substance on an emergency basis to      include the rescheduling of an already scheduled drug to      Schedule I. This authority will give the Attorney General to      respond to public health crises involving scheduled      substances, such as the rapidly escalating abuse of rohypnol,      a Schedule IV drug with no approved medical uses in the      United States.       The proposal contains the same limitations and procedures      as apply to the Attorney General's existing emergency      scheduling authority. The Attorney General could temporarily      reschedule a substance only for one year, with the      possibility of a one-time six month extension under certain      circumstances. In addition, the Secretary of Health and Human      Services would continue to have a formal role in advising the      Attorney General in any proposed rescheduling.     Section 2146.  Increased penalties for using federal property          to grow or manufacture controlled substances.       This provision would increase the penalty for cultivating      or manufacturing a controlled substance on federally owned or      leased land. A significant amount of the domestic marijuana      crop is grown on federal lands and a substantial number of      methamphetamine laboratories also have been discovered on      federal lands. Federal law enforcement agencies believe that      the use of federal lands for cultivating and manufacturing      controlled substances has increased because there is no      possibility that the land will be forfeited as is the case if      the cultivation or manufacture took place on private      property.     Section 2147.  Clarification of length of supervised release          terms in controlled substance cases.       This section resolves a conflict in the circuits as to the      permissible length of supervised release terms in controlled      substance cases. Under 18 U.S.C. 3583(b), ``[e]xcept as      otherwise provided,'' the maximum authorized terms of      supervised release are 5 years for Class A and B felonies, 3      years for Class C and D felonies, and 1 year for Class E      felonies and certain misdemeanors. The drug trafficking      offenses in 21 U.S.C. 841 prescribe special supervised      release terms, however, that are longer than those applicable      generally under section 3583(b). Those longer terms, which      may include lifetime supervised release, were enacted in 1986      in the same Act which inserted the introductory phrase      ``Except as otherwise provided'' in section 3583(b). Because      of this clear legislative history and intent, two courts of      appeals have held that section 3583(b) does not limit the      length of supervised release that may be imposed for a      violation of 21 U.S.C. 841 when a greater term is there      provided. United States v. LeMay, 952 F.2d 995, 998 (8th Cir.      1991); United States v. Eng, 14 F.3d 165, 172-3 (2d Cir.      1994. One court of appeals, however, has reached the opposite      result, holding that the length of a supervised release term      that can be imposed for controlled substance cases is limited      by 18 U.S.C. 3583(b). United States v. Gracia, 983 F.2d 625,      630, (5th Cir. 1993); United States v. Kelly, 974 F.2d 22,      24-5 (5th Cir. 1992).       Although the issue has not arisen with frequency, the      conflict is entrenched and should be dealt with definitively.      Accordingly, the amendment would add the words      ``Notwithstanding section 3583 of title 18'' to the title 21      controlled substance offenses in the parts of those statutes      dealing with supervised release to make clear that the longer      terms there prescribed control over the general provision in      section 3583.     Section 2148.  Technical correction to assure compliance of          sentencing guidelines with provisions of all federal          statutes.       This section would amend 28 U.S.C. 994(a) to assure that      sentencing guidelines promulgated by the United States      Sentencing Commission are consistent with the provisions of      all federal statutes. Currently, section 994(a) contains a      requirement of consistency only with statutes in titles 28      and 18 of the United States Code. No discussion of this      somewhat peculiar limitation appears in the legislative      history, see S. Rep. No. 98-225, 98th Cong., 1st Sess., p.      163 (1983). The limitation seems to have been based on the      mistaken assumption that all provisions pertinent to the      promulgation of sentencing guidelines were contained in those      two titles. However, other provisions, such as mandatory      minimum sentences in title 21, are relevant and clearly are      meant to act as constraints on the guidelines. This amendment      will insure that guidelines are not created that are      inconsistent with the provisions of any relevant enactment      of Congress.     Section 2149.  Drug testing, treatment, and supervision of          incarcerated offenders.       This section amends Section 20105(b) of the Violent      Offender Incarceration/Truth-In-Sentencing (VOI/TIS) grant      program of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act      of 1994 by adding the language at Section 20105(b)(1)(B) and      Section 20105(b)(2). The victims' rights language at Section      20105(b)(A) is current law as Section 20105(b).       The amendment adds several requirements to the conditions a      state must meet in order to receive funding under the VOI/TIS      program. First, the state must by September 1, 1998, have a      plan for drug testing/monitoring and treatment for violent      offender housed in their corrections facilities. This plan      needs to include sanctions for inmates who test positive.      Second, the language at (2) would permit the state to use      funds received under the VOI/TIS program to pay the costs of      the testing and treatment required under (B). Currently the      provisions at (B) are found in the Conference Report H.Rpt.      104-863 that accompanies the Department's fiscal year 1997      appropriations act. The language at (2) is not included. The      goal of the amendment is to make the language at (B)      permanent and add the language at (2) by amending the      underlying law.  subtitle b--grants to prosecutors' offices to target gang crime and                            violent juveniles       This subtitle amends Section 31702, Community-Based Justice      Grants for Prosecutors,'' of Title III of the Violent Crime      Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (42 U.S.C. 13862) to      respond to the increase of violent juvenile offenders and the      rate of gang-related juvenile crime. This subtitle provides      needed resources for state and local prosecutors to      facilitate the prosecution of violent and serious juvenile      offenders. There is no existing comparable legislative text      and programs previously authorized to assist prosecutors have      not been appropriated. As part of the President's fiscal year      1998 budget proposal, this program is authorized for      appropriations of $100,000,000 for fiscal year 1998 and      $100,000,000 for fiscal year 1999.       Specifically, the legislation expands authority to: hire      additional prosecutors to reduce prosecutorial backlogs;      enable prosecutors to more effectively prosecute youth drug,      gang, and violence problems; supply the technology,      equipment, and training to assist prosecutors in reducing the      rate of youthful violent crime while increasing the rate of      successful identification and rapid prosecution of young      violent offenders; and assist prosecutors in their efforts to      engage in community-based prosecutions, problem solving, and      conflict resolution techniques through collaborative efforts      with law enforcement officials, school officials, probation      officers, social service agencies, and community      organizations.       There is also a two percent set aside of all funds      appropriated under this Part to be set aside for ``training      and technical assistance'' consistent with the above-     mentioned purposes. Similarly, 10 percent is taken ``off the      top'' of all funds appropriated under this Part to be set      aside for research, statistics, and evaluation'' consistent      with these purposes. Numerous jurisdictions have requested      training and technical assistance as a priority need.      Additionally, through the introduction of various bills,      Congress has evidenced its support for enhanced research,      statistics, and evaluation.       subtitle c--grants to courts to address violent juveniles       Subtitle C establishes federal grant funding for states,      units of local government, and Indian tribal governments to      use in developing and implementing innovative initiatives to      increase levels of efficiency, expediency, and effectiveness      with which juvenile and youths are processed and adjudicated      within the criminal and juvenile justice system. This is a      new grant authority to assist state, local, and tribal      courts, including probation and parole offices, public      defenders, and victim/witness service providers, to respond      to violent and serious youthful offenders.       This subtitle amends Section 21062 of Subtitle F of Title      XXI of the ``Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of      1994'' (42 U.S.C. 14161), that currently provides assistance      to state and local courts. This subtitle reintroduces the      Administration's State and Local Courts Assistance Program      Act to authorize the establishment of the juvenile gun      courts, drug courts, other specialized courts, and innovative      programs to better deal with the adjudication and prosecution      of juveniles. As part of the President's fiscal year 1998      budget proposal), this program is authorized for      appropriations of $50,000,000 for fiscal year 1998.   Title III--Protecting Witnesses To Help Prosecute Gangs and Other                            Violent Criminals     Section 3001.  Interstate travel to engage in witness          intimidation or obstruction of justice.       This section would amend the Travel Act (18 U.S.C. 1952) to      add witness bribery, intimidation, obstruction of justice,      and related conduct in State criminal proceedings to the list      of predicates under the Travel Act (18 U.S.C. 1952). Recent      studies demonstrate that witness intimidation is one of the      most serious impediments to the prosecution of violent      street gangs and drug trafficking organizations in State      courts. This amendment responds to the growing witness      intimidation problem by authorizing federal prosecution of      persons who travel in interstate commerce with the intent      to bribe or intimidate a witness, obstruct a criminal      proceeding, or engage in related conduct.     Section 3002.  Expanding pretrial detention eligibility for          serious gang and other violent criminals.       This section would make three amendments to the pretrial      detention statutes designed to enhance the ability, in      appropriate circumstances, to use these statutes in      prosecutions against gang members and against other violent      criminals. Under the Bail Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. 3141 et seq.,      defendants charged with certain offenses can be detained      pretrial if the court concludes there is clear and convincing      evidence that no condition or combination of conditions of      release will adequately assure the safety of any other person      and the community. See 18 U.S.C. 3142 (e) and (f). The kinds      of charges that permit such detention on grounds of the      defendant's dangerousness include certain serious drug      trafficking offenses and a ``crime of violence''. They also      include any felony if the defendant has previously been      convicted of two or more crimes of violence or serious drug      trafficking offenses.       The first proposal would add a definition of the term      ``convicted'' to include adjudications of juvenile      delinquency. Thus, it would permit pretrial detention, upon      the requisite showing, of persons charged with any felony,      e.g., interstate transportation of a stolen automobile, who      had two or more prior violent or drug convictions, including      juvenile delinquency adjudications for such conduct. This      should facilitate the use of pretrial detention when      appropriate against young career offenders such as gang      members.       The second proposed amendment relates to the definition of      ``crime of violence'' in 18 U.S.C. 3156(a)(4). That      definition reaches offenses (A) that have as an element the      use or attempted or threatened use of physical force, (B) any      other felony offenses that, by their nature, involve a      substantial risk that physical force may be used in the      course of their commission, and (C), by virtue of an      amendment in the 1994 crime bill, any felony under chapter      109A or 110 (which proscribe sex offenses and child      pornography).       It is not clear whether the offenses of possession of      explosives or firearms by convicted felons qualify as      ``crimes of violence'' under the second or (B) branch of the      definition. What little case law exists suggests that they      do. See United States v. Sloan, 820 F. Supp. 1133, 1136-41      (S.D. Ind. 1993); United States v. Aiken, 775 F. Supp. 855      (D. Md. 1991). See also, United States v. Dodge, 846 F. Supp.      181 (D. Conn. 1994). The Sloan court noted that, although the      Supreme Court held in United States v. Stinson, 113 S. Ct.      1913 (1993), that a similar definition of ``crime of      violence'' in the sentencing guidelines did not encompass the      felon-in-possession statutes, because the Sentencing      Commission had promulgated a policy statement to that effect,      the bail statutes serve a very different purpose from      sentencing enhancements and should be more broadly construed      to protect the public from continued endangerment by      convicted felons charged with a new offense of weapon      possession. (Prior to the Commission's policy statement, the      courts were divided as to whether a violation of 18 U.S.C.      922(a) was a crime of violence for sentencing purposes). This      proposed amendment would codify the result reached in Sloan.      It would not mandate pretrial detention but would permit the      government to show, in the case of a convicted felon such as      a gang member charged with violating the certain explosives      or firearms statutes, that no one or more conditions of      release would be adequate to safeguard society.       The third proposed amendment would make membership or      participation in a criminal street gang, racketeering      enterprise, or other criminal organization a factor to be      considered by courts in making bail determinations.      Presently, many other personal history and characteristics of      the individual charged are required to be considered in      making bail decisions, such as prior convictions, drug abuse,      and whether the alleged offense was committed while on      parole, probation, or other form of release pending criminal      trial. Clearly, gang or organized crime group membership is a      relevant factor that bears both on dangerousness and risk of      flight and that courts should take into account in making      bail determinations. The amendment is not intended to impinge      on rights of freedom of association but rather to reach      membership or participation in those organizations that      exist, at least in part, for the purpose of committing crimes      or depriving third parties of their lawful rights. See Madsen      v. Women's Health Center, Inc. 114 S. Ct. 2516, 2530 (1994).     Section 3003.  Conspiracy penalty for obstruction of justice          offenses involving victims, witnesses, and informants.       Increasingly typical of many criminal gangs is violence      directed at silencing or retaliating against witnesses or      potential witnesses and informants. 18 U.S.C. 1512 and 1513      set forth offenses and penalties that, generally speaking,      adequately deter and punish such offenses. However, a      conspiracy to engage in witness intimidation or retaliation      in violation of these statutes is punishable only under the      catchall conspiracy statute, 18 U.S.C. 371, which carries a      maximum prison term of only five years. This is clearly      inadequate to vindicate an offense that involves, for      example, a conspiracy to kill a witness or potential witness      in a federal criminal proceeding. Such a conspiracy, if      perpetrated upon the special maritime and territorial      jurisdiction, would be punishable by up to life      imprisonment. 18 U.S.C. 1117. This is consistent with the      principle, recognized in some federal statutes and      prevalent in modern State criminal codes, that a      conspiracy warrants the same maximum penalty as the      offense which was its object. This principle is reflected      in several recently enacted federal statutes, including 21      U.S.C. 846 (drug conspiracies), 18 U.S.C. 1856(h)(money      laundering conspiracies), and 18 U.S.C. 844(n)(explosives      conspiracies). The proposed amendment in this section      would apply this principle to 18 U.S.C. 1512 and 1513 and      thus provide better protection from gang violence to      witnesses and informants.                  Title IV--Protecting Victim's Rights       Title IV contains two Sections that expand the rights and      protections afforded to the victims of crime, particularly      crimes committed by juvenile offenders and crimes committed      against children. It should be noted that a number of other      provisions of the Anti-Gang and Youth Violence Act of 1997      expand the rights and protections of crime victims. For      example, the proposed Section 5002, which amends 18 U.S.C.      5032, would establish a rebuttable presumption that juvenile      proceedings shall be open to victims and members of the      public, with special protections and access afforded to crime      victims. In addition, proposed Section 5037 would expand the      allocution rights of crime victims, including the right to      have input into the predisposition report prepared by the      probation officer and the right to appear before the judge      and be heard prior to an order of disposition.     Section 4001.  Records of crimes committed by juvenile          offenders.       The proposed Section 40001 would amend 18 U.S.C. 5038(a)(6)      to correct an oversight in current law. The amendment      affirmatively provides for a victim's or a victim's official      representative's allocation at the dispositional phase of the      juvenile proceeding. In addition, the new statutory language      clarifies that communication is allowable with the victim      about ``the status or disposition of the [juvenile]      proceeding in order to effectuate any other provision of      [state or federal] law''. This language clears up any      ambiguity in current law by explicitly extending to victims      of juvenile offenders the right to information about the      juvenile proceeding that they might need or be entitled to      under any other state or federal law, such as the victim's      rights set out in 42 U.S.C. 10606. Thus, under this new      language, victims of juvenile offenders would be treated like      victims of adult offenders. For example, victims would be      able: to know about the status of the proceedings and the      release status of the offenders; to consult intelligently      with the prosecutor; and to make a knowledgeable victim      impact statement at the time of the disposition. In addition,      if state law allows victim compensation or grants any other      rights, this provision allows communication about the federal      delinquency proceeding in order to effectuate those      provisions.       Fingerprints and photographs of adjudicated delinquents      found to have committed the equivalent of an adult felony      offense or a violation of 18 U.S.C. 922(x) and 924(a)(6)      (possession of a handgun by a juvenile) would be sent to the      Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and made available in      the manner applicable to adult defendants.       The limited availability of juvenile criminal records is a      serious concern in connection with violent and firearms      offenses. In order to address this problem, the Department of      Justice amended its regulations in 1992 to expand the ability      of the FBI to receive and retain records from State courts      for ``serious and/or significant adult and juvenile      offenses.'' 28 C.F.R. 2032. The proposed bill would further      alleviate this problem by making corresponding changes in the      statutory rules for reporting offenses by juveniles who are      prosecuted federally. This amendment was passed in substance      by the Senate in the 103rd Congress as Section 618 of H.R.      3355.       Further disclosure of records relating to a juvenile or a      delinquency proceeding would be authorized if it would be      permitted under the law of the State in which the delinquency      proceeding took place. The proposal will allow for the      development of State systems of graduated sanctions by making      it possible for the court to take into account a juvenile's      criminal history when imposing sentence. The records could      also be used for analysis by the Department of Justice if so      requested by the Attorney General.       Finally, the new Section 5038(c) would be amended to allow      the disclosure of ``necessary docketing data''. This is      necessary because the nationwide military justice system      cannot process traffic tickets without disclosing some      docketing information.     Section 4002.  Victims of Child Abuse Act extension of          authorizations.       This section extends the authorization of appropriations      for programs under Subchapter I of the Victims of Child Abuse      Act (42 U.S.C. 13001 et seq.). The programs authorized under      VOCA include regional children's advocacy centers, local      children's advocacy centers, and specialized training and      technical assistance for state and local practitioners      dealing with the prosecution of child abuse cases. These      programs currently are administered by the Office of Juvenile      Justice and Delinquency Prevention. Title V--Federal Prosecution of Serious and Violent Juvenile Offenders     Section 5001.  Short title.       The amendments made in this title are designed to provide      protection for the community and hold juveniles accountable      for their actions. They will help ensure that prosecution of      serious juvenile offenders is more swift and certain, and      that punishment of juvenile offenders will be commensurate      with the seriousness of the crimes committed.     Section 5002.  Delinquency proceeding or criminal          prosecutions in district courts.       Under current law, the decision to charge a juvenile as an      adult for specified crimes is made by the United States      district court as a result of a motion by the United States      to transfer the juvenile for criminal prosecution. The      offenses subject to this transfer authority are limited. Even      more restrictive are the list of violent offenses for which a      juvenile under 15 years of age can be transferred.       There is virtually universal agreement among federal      prosecutors that the present system is cumbersome and has      frequently inhibited them for seeking adult prosecution.      Prosecutors who have sought the transfer of juveniles to      adult status have experienced many difficulties in the      application of an outmoded statute or have encountered judges      personally opposed to the transfer of juveniles, even in      cases involving very serious crimes. Moreover, there is a      presumption under present law in favor of a juvenile      adjudication, and a district court's decision to decline      transfer to adult status may be reversed only upon a finding      of abuse of discretion. United States v. Juvenile Male #1, 47      F.3d 68 (2d Cir. 1995). The result is a juvenile justice      system which fails to provide an effective deterrent to      juvenile crime and fails adequately to protect the public.       The proposed statute would amend 18 U.S.C. Sec. 5032 to      greatly strengthen and simplify the process for prosecuting      the most dangerous juveniles as adults in federal court. The      legislation would bring federal law into conformity with that      of many states by giving prosecutors, rather than the courts,      the discretion to charge a juvenile alleged to have committed      certain serious felonies as an adult or as a juvenile.       The proposed statute would retain the minimum age in      existing law for prosecution of a juvenile as an adult but      would expand the list of offenses with serious violent, gun      or drug felonies. A number of states have similar statutes.       The legislation would, however, create a distinction      between juveniles 16 years of age and older and those who are      younger. Prosecution of juveniles 13 to 15 years of age at      the time of the offense would require approval of the      Attorney General or his or her designee at a level not lower      than Deputy Assistant Attorney General. This internal Justice      Department approval requirement (which would not be      litigable) has been used in other types of particularly      sensitive cases and would ensure that careful scrutiny and      uniform standards are used in determining whether to bring      criminal charges against very young juveniles. Prosecutors      would retain the discretion to proceed against anyone under      age 18 as a juvenile delinquent. In those cases, the current      requirement for prosecutorial certification would apply, thus      assuring that most such cases are handled at the state or      local level.\1\---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \1\ The federal prosecutor would be required to certify that      (A) the appropriate State does not have or declines to assume      jurisdiction over the juvenile, or (B) the offense is one      specified in the statute, and (C) there is a substantial      federal interest in the case of the offense to warrant the      exercise of federal jurisdiction. 18 U.S.C. Sec. 5032(a).---------------------------------------------------------------------------       The proposed bill would amend section 5032, to expand the      list of serious felonies for which a juvenile can be      prosecuted as an adult to include additional violent crimes,      firearms charges and drug offenses. Under the amended      statutes, a juvenile could be prosecuted as an adult for the      following offenses:       (1) a serious violent felony or a serious drug offense as      described in section 3559 (c)(2) or (c)(3) or a conspiracy or      attempt under section 406 of the Controlled Substances Act or      under section 1013 of the Controlled Substances Import and      Export Act (21 U.S.C. 846 or 963) to commit an offense      described in section 3559(c)(2); and       (2) the following offenses if they are not described in      paragraph (1): (A) a crime of violence (as defined in section      3156(a)(4)) that is a felony; (B) an offense described in      section 844(d), (k), or (l), or paragraph (a)(6) or      subsection (b), (g), (h), (j), (k), or (l), of section 924;      (C) a violation of section 922(o) that is an offense under      section 924(a)(2); (D) a violation of section 5861 of the      Internal Revenue Code of 1986 that is an offense under      section 5871 of such Code (26 U.S.C. 5871);       (E) a conspiracy to violate an offense described in any of      subparagraphs (A) through (D); or       (F) an offense described in section 401 or 408 of the      Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 841, 848) or a      conspiracy or attempt to commit that offense which is      punishable under section 406 of the Controlled Substances Act      (21 U.S.C. 846), or an offense punishable under section 409      or 419 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 849, 860),      or an offense described in section 1002, 1003, 1005, or 1009      of the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act (21 U.S.C.      952, 953, 955 or 959), or a conspiracy or attempt to commit      that offense which is punishable under section 1013 of the      Controlled Substances Import and Export Act (21 U.S.C. 963).       To ensure the prosecution in one trial of all offenses      charged, a juvenile tried as an adult for one of the      designated offenses could also be prosecuted as an adult for      any other offenses properly joined under the Federal Rules of      Criminal Procedure. With these amendments, juveniles      convicted as adults could receive substantially higher      sentences than under current law, commensurate with their      crimes and criminal histories.       The existing statute excludes younger juveniles in Indian      country charged with certain crimes from prosecution unless      the tribal government opts to have the provision apply. The      proposal would continue this provision.       The proposed bill allows, in certain limited circumstances,      the district court to order that a juvenile charged as an      adult be tried under the juvenile delinquency procedures.      This is sometimes referred to as a ``reverse waiver.'' Any      juvenile charged with one of the offenses listed in 3(A)-(F)      or a juvenile under the age of 16 would be able to request a      ``reverse waiver'' hearing. A motion making such a request      would have to be filed within 20 days of the juvenile first      being charged as an adult. At the hearing, the juvenile      charged as an adult would have the burden of establishing      that it would be in the interest of justice that the case be      tried under the juvenile delinquency provisions of 5032(a).      The criteria by which the court should make its determination      are listed in the proposed statute. The procedure for      appellate review of the court's ruling would be similar to      that presently used after a motion to suppress evidence. If      the trial court determined that the juvenile should be tried      as a juvenile delinquent, the government would have the right      to seek an expedited appeal. In the event the court      determined that the juvenile had not carried his or her      burden of establishing that it was in the interests of      justice that there be a reverse waiver, then the case would      proceed to trial as an adult prosecution and the juvenile      could appeal in the event of a guilty verdict.       Juveniles under the age of 16 charged as adults, but who      have not previously been adjudicated delinquent of a serious      violent felony, and who are charged with certain limited      offenses would be sentenced under the sentencing guidelines      but would not be subject to mandatory minimums.       Section 5032(a)(4) is amended to make clear that federal      juvenile proceedings are normally open to the public but may      be closed in the interests of justice or for good cause      shown. It also includes a provision allowing victims, their      relatives and guardians to be included when the public is      otherwise excluded, unless the same two tests applied for      exclusion of the public also independently require exclusion.     Section 5003.  Custody prior to appearance before judicial          officer.       Minor changes have been made to make clear that the      procedures applicable to the arrest of a juvenile prior to      the formal filing of charges apply whether or not it is      anticipated that the juvenile will be charged as a juvenile      or as an adult.     Section 5004.  Technical and conforming amendments to Section          5034.       This section is amended to clarify that it applies to      juvenile proceedings only.     Section 5005.  Speedy trial.       The proposed status would require that for a juvenile in      custody juvenile delinquency proceedings begin within 45      days, rather than the current 30 days. Exclusions in the      Speedy Trial Act (18 U.S.C. Sec. 3161(h)) would also be made      applicable for the first time in juvenile delinquency      proceedings. This additional time is necessary, particularly      in cases involving both adult and juvenile defendants such as      in the prosecution of gangs, to protect witnesses and      critical evidence by ensuring that the trial of a juvenile      does not proceed before the case against the adults. The time      within which a disposition hearing must be held after an      adjudication of delinquency would also be increased from 20      to 40 days. Within the 40 days, the probation office would      prepare a predisposition report which would include victim      impact information. Forty days is consistent with federal      court practice generally and will provide the time necessary      to prepare a comprehensive report.     Section 5006.  Disposition; availability of increased          detention, fines and supervised release for juvenile          offenders.       The legislation would amend section 5037 to make fines and      supervised release--not presently sentencing options--     available for adjudicated delinquents in addition to      probation and detention. The maximum period of official      confinement for an adjudicated delinquent would be increased      to ten years or through age 25 to give judges increased      sentencing flexibility for juveniles who are adjudicated      delinquent. The maximum period     for probation would be increased to the same period      applicable to an adult. To strengthen the accountability      of juveniles to victims, mandatory restitution would also      apply to adjudicated delinquents.     Section 5007.  Technical amendment of Sections 5031 and 5034.       This section makes technical and confirming amendments to      Sections 5031 and 5034.       Title VI--Incarceration of Juveniles in the Federal System     Section 6001.  Detention prior to disposition or sentencing.       Sections 6001 and 6002 relate to the detention of juvenile      offenders prior to disposition or sentencing. Specifically,      the bill would amend 18 U.S.C. 5035, to provide that juvenile      offenders less than 16 years of age being prosecuted as      adults but not yet convicted must be placed in an available,      suitable juvenile facility located within, or a reasonable      distance from, the district in which the juvenile is being      prosecuted. If such a suitable juvenile facility is not      available, the juvenile could be placed in any other suitable      facility located within, or a reasonable distance from, the      district in which the juvenile is being prosecuted. Only if      neither of these types of facilities is available could a      juvenile less than 16 years old be placed in some other      suitable facility. In order to protect the safety of these      younger offenders, the bill would require that, to the      maximum extent feasible, juveniles not be detained prior to      sentencing in any institution in which they have regular      contact with adult prisoners.       The requirement in current Section 5035, that a juvenile      charged with juvenile delinquency has regular contact with      adult prisoners would generally be retained in the proposed      legislation. However, the proposed bill would permit      juveniles adjudicated delinquent, once they reach the age of      18, to be placed with adults in a correctional facility. This      recommended change is consistent with recent regulatory      changes to state requirements under the Juvenile Justice and      Delinquency Prevention Act, 42 U.S.C. 5601 et seq.       Section 5039 of title 18, United States Code, would also be      amended to permit juveniles adjudicated delinquent to be      placed with adults in community-based facilities in order to      provide transition services for juveniles moving from      incarceration to the community and to allow juveniles to be      housed in their home communities. These changes would help      protect younger juveniles 13 or 14 years old, from 19 or 20      year-olds who, although adjudicated delinquent, may be as      dangerous as adults.       The legislation would also amend Sections 5035 and 5039 to      give the Attorney General discretion to confine with adults a      serious juvenile offender 16 years of age or older who is      charged as an adult, both before and after conviction. As      under present law, only those juveniles charged as adults      whom a judicial officer has found would, if released,      endanger the safety of another person or the community or      would pose a substantial risk of flight could be detained      prior to trial.       The current requirement in Section 5039 that every juvenile      under 18 years of age who is in custody be provided with      adequate food, heat, light, sanitary facilities, bedding,      clothing, recreation, education, and medical care, including      necessary psychiatric, psychological, or other care and      treatment would continue to apply to every juvenile charged      as an adult who is detained prior to trial and sentencing and      would be expanded to provide for reasonable safety and      security as well.       These changes are consistent with current practice in many      states and are proposed to ensure that the most violent      juvenile criminal offenders are not detained or incarcerated      with juvenile delinquents. By providing the discretion to      house older juveniles prosecuted as adults, adjudicated      delinquents once they reach the age of 18 and all juveniles      convicted as adults in adult facilities, this proposal would      also solve practical problems reported by the U.S. Marshals      Service and the U.S. Attorneys, who have experienced great      difficulty in finding suitable juvenile facilities for older      and violent juvenile offenders.     Section 6002.  Rules governing the commitment of juveniles.       The legislative analysis for the amendments made in this      discussion are discussed in the analysis accompanying Section      5005.       Title VII--Office of Juvenile Crime Control and Prevention       Title VII establishes within the Office of Justice Programs      the ``Office of Juvenile Crime Control and Prevention,'' the      ``Juvenile Crime Control and Prevention Formula Grant      Program,'' the ``Indian Tribal Grant Programs,'' and ``At-     Risk Children Grants Program,'' and ``Developing, Testing,      and Demonstrating Promising Programs Program,'' the      ``Incentive Grant Programs,'' the ``Research, Statistics, and      Evaluation'' grants, and the ``Training and Technical      Assistance'' grants.       Subtitle A of Title VII creates the ``Office of Juvenile      Crime Control and Prevention'' to replace the Office of      Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. The new Office      of Juvenile Crime Control and Prevention responds to the      changing nature of juvenile and youth crime and represents a      more focused, efficient, and effective office. Fundamental      protections safeguarding juveniles and youth within the      juvenile justice system have been maintained, while      operations within this new office have been streamlined to      better coordinate and integrate juvenile and youth crime      initiatives with other Department of Justice activities,      particularly activities within the Office of Justice      Programs, the National Institute of Justice and the Bureau      of Justice Statistics, as well as with states, units of      local government, Indian tribal governments, and local      communities.     Section 7001.  Short title.       This section provides that Title VII of the Anti-Gang and      Youth Violence Act may be cited as the ``Juvenile Crime      Control and Prevention State and Local Assistance Act of      1997.''   subtitle a--creation of the office of juvenile crime control and                                prevention     Section 7101.  Establishment of Office.       Section 2701 establishes the ``Office of Juvenile Crime      Control and Prevention'' under the general authority, and the      ``supervision and direction'' of the Assistant Attorney      General for the Office of Justice Programs, United States      Department of Justice. The words ``supervision and      direction'' are used to describe the line of authority and      reporting relationship between the Director of the Office of      Juvenile Crime Control and Prevention and the Assistant      Attorney General for the Office of Justice Programs in the      same way the words ``supervision and direction'' are used to      describe the line of authority and reporting relationship      between the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human      Services and the Assistant Secretary of Health as cited at 42      United States Code Section 202. This section continues the      Department of Justice's efforts in maintaining coordination      and cooperation among those federal agencies whose      jurisdictions involve the health, welfare, education or      general well-being of youths and/or juveniles. There are      numerous transitional elements to provide for the continuity      between the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency      Prevention and the new Office of Juvenile Crime Control and      Prevention, including a specific transfer for the current      Administrator of the Office of Juvenile Justice and      Delinquency Prevention to become the Director of the Office      of Juvenile Crime Control and Prevention.     Section 7102.  Conforming amendments.       Section 7102 makes minor and technical conforming      amendments.     Section 7103.  Authorization of appropriations.       Section 7103 provides for the authorization of      appropriations to carry out the functions of the Office of      Juvenile Crime Control and Prevention.                 subtitle b--juvenile crime assistance       Subtitle B of Title VII of the Act maintains and      establishes numerous federal grant programs and initiatives--     the ``Juvenile Crime Control and Prevention Formula Grant      Program,'' the ``Indian Tribal Grant Program,'' the      ``Incentive Grant Program,'' the ``Developing, Testing, and      Demonstrating Promising Programs'' program, the ``At-Risk      Children Grants Program,'' and two initiatives that provide      additional funding for research, statistics, evaluation, and      training and technical assistance.     Section 7201.  Formula grant assistance.       Section 7201 amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe      Streets Act of 1968 by maintaining but revising the formula      grant program.       This federal grant program has fewer state planning      requirements, specifically allocates ten percent of all      grants funds appropriated to be set aside and used for      research activities (including program evaluations, data      collection efforts, and studies to identify initiatives that      reduce juvenile and youth crime and violence), and      specifically allocates two percent of all grant funds      appropriated to be set aside and used for providing training      and technical assistance to states and local communities for      the implementation of initiatives and programs that have      demonstrated a high likelihood of success.       Under a new formulation, all states receive 50 percent of      their allocation. To receive the remaining funds a state must      continue to follow established practices and procedures for      protecting juveniles within the juvenile justice system.      These provisions are reflected in the Department of Justice's      newly issued regulations, 28 CFR Part 31, governing this      section. Should a state fail to meet the requirements of this      section, the unallocated funds may be redistributed within      the state.     Section 7202.  Indian tribal grants.       Section 7202 establishes for the first time a direct      federal grant program whereby funding goes directly from the      Office of Juvenile Crime Control and Prevention to Indian      tribal governments without utilizing state pass-through      procedures. Grant funds under this section shall be used for      initiatives designed to reduce, control, and prevent juvenile      and youth crime on Indian lands. This method of direct      funding is expected to better address and respond to the      needs and concerns of Indian tribes as well as increase      funding for these tribes. Also included is language      amending the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act      of 1994 to substantially increase funding targeted for      correctional facilities on Indian tribal lands.     Section 7203.  At-risk children grant programs.       The ``At-Risk Children Grants Program'' is a new federal      grant program administered by the Office of Juvenile Crime      Control and Prevention that provides federal assistance to      states, for distribution by states to local     units of government and locally-based organizations to combat      truancy, school violence, and juvenile crime by providing      funding for local crime prevention and intervention      strategies. Programs and initiatives funded with these grants      are designed to address youth within the juvenile justice      system who, with some focused supervision, direction, and      discipline, can go forward to lead-crime-free, productive      lives. This program is an expansion of what is currently      known as Title V of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency      Prevention Act.       Grants awarded pursuant of this Part may be used for:      supporting locally based efforts for assisting high-risk      juveniles and juveniles within the juvenile justice system;      preventing and reducing truancy and school drop outs;      enforcing juvenile curfews; supporting school safety      programs, juvenile mentoring, violence reduction programs,      intensive supervision services, jobs and life skills      training, family strengthening interventions, early childhood      services, after-school programs for juveniles, tutoring      programs, recreation and parks programs, parent training      initiatives, health services, alcohol and substance abuse      services, restitution and community services activities,      leadership development, accountability and responsibility      education, and other such efforts designed to prevent or      reduce truancy, school violence, and juvenile crime.       Local units of government that participate under this Part      must utilize a local planning board to develop a three-year      plan.     Section 7204.  Developing, testing, and demonstrating          promising programs.       Section 7204 establishes new federal discretionary grant      programs for states, units of local government, and Indian      tribal governments administered by the Office of Juvenile      Crime Control and Prevention to develop, test, and      demonstrate initiatives and programs that have a high      probability of preventing, controlling, and/or reducing      juvenile crime. These grants were developed to motivate      states, units of local government, and Indian tribal      governments to independently generate innovative initiatives      to combat juvenile crime and youth violence.       This section replaces the current multiple discretionary-     categorical grant programs currently established by the      Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974, by      consolidating several categorical grant programs into a      single, flexible, broad program.     Section 7205.  Incentive grant program.       This section establishes new federal formula grant programs      for states, units of local government, and Indian tribal      governments to develop and advance initiatives to prevent,      control, reduce, evaluate, adjudicate, or sanction juvenile      or youthful crime.       The state agency that receives a formula grant is eligible      to apply for a grant under this Part. Every applicant must      submit assurances to the Director of the Office of Juvenile      Crime Control and Prevention that they have or will have      within one year of submittal of an application:       (1) implemented a system of accountability-based graduated      sanctions; and/or       (2) implemented a system of information collaboration and      dissemination regarding acts of juvenile delinquency and      adjudication of the same.       Grants authorized under this section may be used to:       Achieve paragraphs (1) and/or (2) above; advance      initiatives that prevent or intervene in the unlawful      possession, distribution, or sale of a firearm by or to a      juvenile; implement initiatives that facilitate the      collection, dissemination, and use of information regarding      juvenile crime; implement new initiatives that assist state      and local jurisdictions in tracking, intervening with, and      controlling serious, violent, and chronic juvenile offenders;      implement comprehensive program services in juvenile      detention and correction facilities; implement procedures      designed to prevent and reduce juvenile disproportionate      minority confinement; or for any other purpose related to      juvenile crime reduction, control, and prevention as      determined by the Director of the Office.     Section 7206.  Research, statistics and evaluation.       Better research, evaluation, and statistical analysis is      critical to understanding and addressing the causes of      juvenile and youth crime. Under this section, increased      funding is combined with a collaboration between the Director      of the Office of Juvenile Crime Control and Prevention and      the Directors of the National Institute of Justice and the      Bureau of Justice Statistics to better direct and expand      these functions.     Section 7207.  Training and technical assistance.       This section provides for specific federal grant funding      for much-needed technical and training assistance for      individuals in the fields of juvenile justice and juvenile      and youth crime. Funding under this section will enable more      communities to implement effective programs and initiatives      that reduce, control, and prevent juvenile and youth crime.      While this is a new federal grant program, training and      technical assistance have been established functions of the      Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention.       In further recognition of the importance of high quality      and focused research, statistical analysis, evaluation,      training, and technical assistance, Title VII includes      specific provisions within each funded program setting aside      a percentage of grant funds appropriated for the above-     mentioned functions. These monies are in addition to funding      appropriated for these functions in Sections 409 and 410 of      Title VII. Specifically, Sections 403, 404, 405, 406, 407,      and 408 of Title VII of this Act provide that 2 percent of      all funds appropriated for each funded program shall be set      aside for training and technical assistance consistent with      Title VII. Similarly, Sections 403, 404, 405, 406, 407, and      408 provide that 10 percent of all funds appropriated for      each funded program shall be set aside for research,      statistics and evaluation activities consistent with Title      VII.               subtitle c--missing and exploited children       This subtitle amends the ``Missing Children's Assistance      Act'' (42 U.S.C. 5771 et seq.) by extending its authorization      to the year 2001 and by setting aside funds appropriated      under this subtitle to be used for research, statistics,      evaluation, and training. Additionally, conforming language      is added to the Act to reflect the replacement of the Office      of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention with the new      Office of Juvenile Crime Control and Prevention.
