 President, after great effort by many people, the Senate has voted to agree to H.R. 4, the Pension Protection Act of 2006.  Credit must go to the dedicated members of my staff, who spent many hours over many months working on the issues that ultimately led to this bill. Kolan Davis, Mark Prater, JohnO'Neill, Dean Zerbe, Elizabeth Paris, Chris Javens, Cathy Barre, Anne Freeman, Elizabeth Goff, and Nick Wyatt showed great dedication to the tasks before them.  As is usually the case, the cooperation of Senator Baucus and his staff was extremely valuable. I particularly want to thank Russ Sullivan, Patrick Heck, Bill Dauster, Judy Miller, Stuart Sirkin, Jon Selib, Melissa Mueller, Rebecca Baxter and Ryan Abraham.  I want to show my appreciation towards HELP Committee Chairman Enzi's staff, including Katherine McGuire, Greg Dean, Diann Howland and David Thompson. I want to thank Portia Wu and Holly Fechner along with the rest of HELP Committee Ranking Member Kennedy's staff. I also want to thank the staff of Finance Committee member conferees on the pension bill. They include Evan Liddiard, Brendan Dunn, Manny Rossman, Wes Coulam, Jennifer Perkins, Jen Vesey, Amy Barber, Steve Bailey, and James Dennis.  I also want to mention Thomas Barthold, the acting chief of staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation and his staff. The efforts of Carolyn Smith, Patricia McDermott, and Nicole Flax were invaluable. Roger Colinvaux, Gordon Clay, and Ron Schultz provided great assistance with the charitable provisions that are in the bill. I also want to thank Theresa Pattara, who worked on my staff as a legislative fellow, for her work on the charitable provisions.  Finally, I want to show my appreciation to the staff of Senate Legislative Counsel, including Jim Fransen, Mark Mathiesen, Stacey Kern, and Mark McGunagle.
