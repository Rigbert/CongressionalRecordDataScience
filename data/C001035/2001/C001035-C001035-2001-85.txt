President, Maine has led the way on insurance reform. Maine is one of only 12 States that cover clinical trials. The Maine legislators gave careful consideration to what the scope of that coverage should be, and a Democratic legislature and an independent Governor decided, for reasons of cost, to limit the clinical trials provisions to those who were approved by the National Institutes of Health. That is appropriate.  What I object to is that the Kennedy approach, the Kennedy-McCain bill, would say that if a State didn't cover clinical trials exactly as the Senator from Massachusetts wants them covered, then Maine's law is wiped out. I don't think that is right. I notice that Maine has been far more active than Massachusetts in the area of patients' protection, so perhaps that explains the difference in the approach that the Senator from Massachusetts, my friend, and I take.  I yield the floor.                             Exhibit No. 1                                           National Association of                                      Insurance Commissioners,                                   Kansas City, MO, June 19, 2001.     Hon. Susan Collins,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: As the Senate prepares to debate      legislation designed to protect the rights of health      insurance consumers I would like to reiterate the concerns of      the nation's health insurance regulators.       The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC),      which represents all fifty-five insurance commissioners in      the states and territories, is primarily concerned about      federal preemption of state laws and regulations. All states      have passed and implemented legislation to protect the rights      of beneficiaries. Over 40 states have acted to ensure access      to emergency and OB/GYN care, require fair utilization review      and internal and external appeals processes, and prohibit      discrimination and gag clauses. Over half of the states have      laws ensuring access to specialists and non-formulary      prescription drugs, a point of service option, and continuity      of care.       As members of Congress know from experience, passing      patient protection legislation this can be a difficult task      with a variety of issues to consider. States have faced the      challenges and produced laws that balance the two-part      objectives of protecting consumer rights and preserving the      availability and affordability of coverage. For the federal      government to unilaterally impose its one-size-fits-all      standards on the states could be devastating to state      insurance markets.       Members of the NAIC are also concerned about enforcement.      As you know as a former state regulator, if there is no      enforcement then there is no protection. States have      developed the infrastructure necessary to receive and process      consumer complaints in a timely fashion and ensure that      insurers comply with the laws. The federal government does      not have this capability, and the proposals do not provide      any resources to federal agencies to develop such capability.      It has taken the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA)      years to develop the infrastructure required to enforce the      Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)      which included only six basic provisions that most states had      already enacted. The proposed patient protection bills are      far more complicated than HIPAA and will require considerable      oversight.       To resolve these issues, the NAIC urges Congress to include      in any patient protection legislation provisions that would      preserve state laws and enforcement procedures, such as      internal and external review processes. Failure to maintain      state authority in this area could lead to the implementation      of regulations that are inconsistent with the needs of      consumers in a state and that are not enforced effectively.       Protecting patient rights is clearly a goal of both the      states and the federal government. Attaining this goal will      require cooperation and we look forward to working in      partnership with the federal government to implement      protections that are in the best interest of consumers in      each state.           Sincerely,                                            Kathleen Sebelius,                                                  President, NAIC,                          Insurance Commissioner, State of Kansas.
