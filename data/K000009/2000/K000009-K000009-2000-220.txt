Chairman, I just wanted to commend my colleague, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Traficant) for continuing his crusade on behalf of America's jobs, our workers, our communities.  We certainly would be pleased to accept the agreement, in agreement with the majority here today. I want to thank the gentleman again for keeping our eyes focused on what we should, and that is, America's strength and productivity.
