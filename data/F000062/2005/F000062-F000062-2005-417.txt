 President, I rise to introduce the Credit Card Minimum Payment Notification Act.  Today, 144 million Americans utilize credit cards and charge more debt on those cards than ever before. In 1990, Americans charged $338 billion on credit cards. By 2003, that number had risen to $1.5 trillion.  Many Americans now own multiple credit cards. In 2003, 841 million bank-issued credit cards were in circulation in the U.S. That number becomes nearly 1.4 billion credit cards, when cards issued by stores and oil companies are factored in. That's an average of 5 credit cards per person.  The proliferation of credit cards can be traced, in part, to a dramatic increase in credit card solicitation. In 1993, credit card companies sent 1.52 billion solicitations to American homes; in 2001, they sent over 5 billion.  As one would expect, the increase in credit cards has also yielded an increase in credit card debt. Individuals get 6, 7, or 8 different credit cards, pay only the minimum payment required, and many end up drowning in debt. That happens in case after case.  Since 1990, the debt that Americans carry on credit cards has more than tripled, going from about $238 billion in 1990 to $755 billion in 2004.  As a result, the average American household now has about $7,300 of credit card debt.  As has been discussed much in this Congress, the number of personal bankruptcies has doubled since 1990. Many of these personal bankruptcies are people who utilize credit cards. These cards are enormously attractive. However, these individual credit card holders receive no information on the impact of compounding interest. They pay just the minimum payment. They pay it for 1 year, 2 years--they make additional purchases, they get another card, and another, and another.  Unfortunately, these individuals making the minimum payment are witnessing the ugly side of the ``Miracle of Compound Interest.'' After 2 or 3 years, many find that the interest on the debt is such that they can never repay these cards, and do not know what to do about it.  Statistics vary about the number of individuals who make only the minimum payments. One study determined that 35 million pay only the minimum on their credit cards. In a recent poll, 40 percent of respondents said that they pay the minimum or slightly more. What is certain is that many Americans pay only the minimum, and that paying only the minimum has harsh financial consequences.  I suspect that most people would be surprised to know how I much interest can pile up when paying the minimum. Take the average household, with $7,300 of credit card debt, and the average credit card interest rate, which in April, before the most recent Federal Reserve Board increase of the prime rate, was 16.75 percent. If only the 2 percent minimum payment is made, it will take them 44 years and $23,373.90 to pay off the card. And that is if the family doesn't spend another cent on their credit cards--an unlikely assumption. In other words, the family will need to pay over $16,000 in interest to repay just $7,300 of principal.  For individuals or families with more than average debt, the pitfalls are even greater. $20,000 of credit card debt at the average 16.75 percent interest rate will take 58 years and $65,415.28 to pay off if only the minimum payments are made.  And 16.25 is percent only the average interest rate. The prime rate, despite recent increases, remains relatively low--at 6 percent. However, interest rates around 20 percent are not uncommon. In fact, among the 10 banks that are the largest issuers of credit cards, the top interest rates on credit cards are between 23 and 31 percent--and that does not factor in various penalties and fees. When penalty interest rates are factored in, the highest rates are 41 percent. In 1990, the highest interest rate--even with penalties, was 22 percent, a little more than half of what they are today.  Even if we assume only a 20 percent interest rate, a family that has the average debt of $7,300 at a 20 percent interest rate and makes the minimum payments will need an incredible 76 years and $41,884 to pay off that initial $7,300 of debt. That's $34,584 in interest payments--more than 4 times the original debt. And these examples are far from extreme.  Moreover, these are not merely statistics, but are reflective of very real situations for many people. On March 6, the Washington Post ran a headline story on its front page, entitled ``Credit Card Penalties, Fees Bury Debtors.'' I would recommend this article to my colleagues, because it illustrates part of the problem--that credit card companies, aggressively marketing their products, end up charging outrageous interest and fees to their customers. I ask unanimous consent that the article be included in the Record. The article highlighted the following stories:  Ohio resident, Ruth Owens tried for 6 years to pay off a $1,900 balance on herDiscover card, sending the credit company a total of $3,492 in monthly payments from 1997 to 2003. Yet her balance grew to $5,564.28.  Virginia resident Josephine McCarthy's Providian Visa bill increased to $5,357 in 2 years, even though McCarthy has used the card for only $218.16 in purchases and has made monthly payments totaling $3,058.  Special-education teacher Fatemeh Hosseini, from my state of California, worked a second job to keep up with the $2,000 in monthly payments she collectively sent to five banks to try to pay $25,000 in credit card debt. Even though she had not used the cards to buy anything more, her debt had nearly doubled to $49,574 by the time she filed for bankruptcy last June.  Unfortunately, these stories are not unique.  Part of the problem goes back to changes made in the credit card industry. For a long time, most banks required their customers to pay 5 percent of their credit card balance every month. That was before Andrew Kahr, a credit card industry consultant, got involved. Mr. Kahr realized that if customers were able to pay less, they would borrow more, and he convinced his clients that they should reduce the minimum payment to just 2 percent.  The PBS program ``Frontline'', ran a program in November of last year titled ``The Secret History of the Credit Card'' that examined the rapid growth of the credit card industry and included an interview with Mr. Kahr.  Mr. Kahr's innovation has been a windfall for the credit card industry. If consumers are paying a lower percentage of their balance as the minimum payment, the credit card companies will make more money over time. In fact, many in the industry refer to individuals who pay their credit card bills in full as ``deadbeats'', because they are less profitable than individuals who carry large balances, who are known as ``revolvers.''  And Mr. Kahr's own research showed that just making the minimum payment eased consumers' anxiety about carrying large amounts of credit card debt--they believe they are still being financially prudent.  The bill I am proposing speaks directly to those types of consumers. There will always be people who cannot afford to pay more than their minimum payments. But, there are also a large number of consumers who can afford to pay more but feel comfortable paying the minimum payment because they don't realize the consequences of doing so.  Now I am certainly not trying to demonize credit cards or the credit card industry. Credit cards are an important part of everyday life. However, I do think that people should understand the dangers of paying only their monthly minimums. In this way individuals will be able to act responsibly.  It's not necessarily that people don't understand the basics of interest. Most of us just don't realize how fast it compounds or how important it is to do the math to find out what it means to pay a minimum requirement.  The bottom line is that for many consumers, the 2 percent minimum payment is a financial trap.  The Credit Card Minimum Payment Notification Act is designed to ensure that people are not caught in this trap through lack of information. The bill tracks the language of the amendment originally proposed to the Bankruptcy bill that was co-sponsored by Senator Kyl, Senator Brownback, and myself.  Let me tell you exactly what this bill would do. It would require credit card companies to add two items to each consumer's monthly credit card statement: 1. A notice warning credit card holders that making only the minimum payment each month will increase the interest they pay and the amount of time it takes to repay their debt; and 2. Examples of the amount of time and money required to repay a credit card debt if only minimum payments are made; OR if the consumer makes only minimum payments for six-consecutive months, the amount of time and money required to repay the individual's specific credit card debt, under the terms of their credit card agreement.  The bill would also require that a toll free number be included on statements that consumers can call to get an estimate of the time and money required to repay their balance, if only minimum payments are made.  And, if the consumer makes only minimum payments for six consecutive months, they will receive a toll free number to an accredited credit counseling service.  The disclosure requirements in this bill would only apply if the I consumer has a minimum payment that is less than 10 percent of the debt on the credit card, or if their balance is greater than $500. Otherwise, none of these disclosures would be required on their statement.  The language of this bill comes from a California law, the ``California Credit Card Payment Warning Act,'' passed in 2001. Unfortunately, in 2002, this California law was struck down in U.S. District Court as being preempted by the 1968 Truth in Lending Act. The Truth in Lending Act was enacted in part because Congress found that, ``The informed use of credit results from an awareness of the cost of thereof by consumers.'' Consequently, this bill would amend the Truth in Lending Act, and would also further its core purpose.  These disclosures allow consumers to know exactly what it means for them to carry a balance and only make minimum payments, so they can make informed decisions on credit card use and repayment.  The disclosure required by this bill is straightforward how much it will cost to pay off the debt if only minimum payments are made, and how long it will take to do it. As for expense, my staff tells me that on the website Cardweb.com, there is a free interest calculator that does these calculations in under a second. Moreover, I am told that banks make these calculations internally to determine credit risk. The expense would be minimal.  Percentage rates and balances are constantly changing and each month, the credit card companies are able to assess the minimum payment, late fees, over-the-limit fees and finance charges for millions of accounts.  If the credit card companies can put in their bills what the minimum monthly payment is, they can certainly figure out how to disclose to their customers how much it might cost them if they stick to that minimum payment.  The credit card industry is the most profitable sector of banking, and last year it made $30 billion in profits. MBNA's profits alone last year were one-and-a-half times that of McDonald's. Citibank was more profitable than Microsoft and Walmart. I don't think they should have any trouble implementing the requirements of this bill.  I believe that this is extraordinarily important and that it will minimize bankruptcies. With companies charging very substantial interest rates, they have an obligation to let the credit card holder know what those minimum payments really mean. I have people close to me I have watched, with 6 or 7 credit cards, and it is impossible for them, over the next 10 or 15 years, to pay off the debt if they continue making just minimum payments.  We now have a bankruptcy bill that has passed into law. I continue to believe that a bill requiring a limited but meaningful disclosure by credit cards companies is a necessary accompaniment. I think you will have people who are more cautious, which I believe is good for the bankruptcy courts in terms of reducing their caseloads, and also good for American consumers.  The credit card debt problem facing our Nation is significant. I believe that this bill is an important step in providing individuals with the information needed to act responsibly, and it does so with a minimal burden on the industry.  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Washington Post, Mar. 6, 2005]   Credit Card Penalties, Fees Bury Debtors; Senate Nears Action on                             Bankruptcy Curbs                (By Kathleen Day and Caroline E. Mayer)       For more than two years, special-education teacher Fatemeh      Hosseini worked a second job to keep up with the $2,000 in      monthly payments she collectively sent to five banks to try      to pay $25,000 in credit card debt.       Even though she had not used the cards to buy anything      more, her debt had nearly doubled to $49,574 by the time the      Sunnyvale,     Calif., resident filed for bankruptcy last June. That is      because Hosseini's payments sometimes were tardy, triggering      late fees ranging from $25 to $50 and doubling interest rates      to nearly 30 percent. When the additional costs pushed her      balance over her credit limit, the credit card companies      added more penalties.       ``I was really trying hard to make minimum payments,'' said      Hosseini, whose financial problems began in the late 1990s      when her husband left her and their three children. ``All of      my salary was going to the credit card companies, but there      was no change in the balances because of that interest and      those penalties.''       Punitive charges--penalty fees and sharply higher interest      rates after a payment is late--compound the problems of many      financially strapped consumers, sometimes making it      impossible for them to dig their way out of debt and pushing      them into bankruptcy.       The Senate is to vote as soon as this week on a bill that      would make it harder for individuals to wipe out debt through      bankruptcy. The Senate last week voted down several      amendments intended to curb excessive fees and other      practices that critics of the industry say are abusive. House      leaders say they will act soon after that, and President Bush      has said he supports the bill.       Bankruptcy experts say that too often, by the time an      individual has filed for bankruptcy or is hauled into court      by creditors, he or she has repaid an amount equal to their      original credit card debt plus double-digit interest, but      still owes hundreds or thousands of dollars because of      penalties.       ``How is it that the person who wants to do right ends up      so worse off?'' Cleveland Municipal Judge Robert J. Triozzi      said last fall when he ruled against Discover in the      company's breach-of-contract suit against another struggling      credit cardholder, Ruth M. Owens.       Owens tried for six years to payoff a $1,900 balance on her      Discover card, sending the credit company a total of $3,492      in monthly payments from 1997 to 2003. Yet her balance grew      to $5,564.28, even though, like Hosseini, she never used the      card to buy anything more. Of that total, over-limit penalty      fees alone were $1,158.       Triozzi denied Discover's claim, calling its attempt to      collect more money from Owens ``unconscionable.''       The bankruptcy measure now being debated in Congress has      been sought for nearly eight years by the credit card      industry. Twice in that time, versions of it have passed both      the House and Senate. Once, President Bill Clinton refused to      sign it, saying it was unfair, and once the House reversed      its vote after Democrats attached an amendment that would      prevent individuals such as antiabortion protesters from      using bankruptcy as a shield against court-imposed fines.       Credit card companies and most congressional Republicans      say current law needs to be changed to prevent abuse and make      more people repay at least part of their debt. Consumer-     advocacy groups and many Democrats say people who seek      bankruptcy protection do so mostly because they have fallen      on hard times through illness, divorce or job loss. They also      argue that current law has strong provisions that judges can      use to weed out those who abuse the system.       Opponents also argue that the legislation is unfair because      it ignores loopholes that would allow rich debtors to shield      millions of dollars during bankruptcy through expensive homes      and complex trusts, while ignoring the need for more      disclosure to cardholders about rates and fees and curbs on      what they say is irresponsible behavior by the credit card      industry. The Republican majority, along with a few      Democrats, has voted down dozens of proposed amendments to      the bill, including one that would make it easier for the      elderly to protect their homes in bankruptcy and another that      would require credit card companies to tell customers how      much extra interest they would pay over time by making only      minimum payments.       No one knows how many consumers get caught in the spiral of      ``negative amoritization,'' which is what regulators call it      when a consumer makes payments but balances continue to      grow because of penalty costs. The problem is widespread      enough to worry federal bank regulators, who say nearly      all major credit card issuers engage in the practice.       Two years ago regulators adopted a policy that will require      credit card companies to set monthly minimum payments high      enough to cover penalties and interest and lower some of the      customer's original debt, known as principal, so that if a      consumer makes no new charges and makes monthly minimum      payments, his or her balance will begin to decline.       Banks agreed to the new rules after, in the words of one      top federal regulator, ``some arm-twisting.'' But bank      executives persuaded regulators to allow the higher minimum      payments to be phased in over several years, through 2006,      arguing that many customers are so much in debt that even      slight increases too soon could push many into financial      disaster.       Credit card companies declined to comment on specific cases      or customers for this article, but banking industry      officials, speaking generally, said there is a good reason      for the fees they charge.       ``It's to encourage people to pay their bills the way they      said they would in their contract, to encourage good      financial management,'' said Nessa Feddis, senior federal      counsel for the American Bankers Association. ``There has to      be some onus on the cardholder, some responsibility to manage      their finances.''       High fees ``may be extreme cases, but they are not the      trend, not the norm,'' Feddis said.       ``Banks are pretty flexible,'' she said. ``If you are a      good customer and have an occasional mishap, they'll waive      the fees, because there's so much competition and it's too      easy to go someplace else.'' Banks are also willing to work      out settlements with people in financial difficulty, she      said, because ``there are still a lot of options even for      people who've been in trouble.''       Many bankruptcy lawyers disagree. James S.K. ``Ike''      Shulman, Hosseini's lawyer, said credit card companies      hounded her and did not live up to several promises to work      with her to cut mounting fees.       Regulators say it is appropriate for lenders to charge      higher-risk debtors a higher interest rate, but that negative      amortization and other practices go too far, posing risks to      the banking system by threatening borrowers' ability to repay      their debts and by being unfair to individuals.       U.S. Bankruptcy Judge David H. Adams of Norfolk, who is      also the president of the National Conference of Bankruptcy      Judges, said many debtors who get in over their heads ``are      spending money, buying things they shouldn't be buying.''      Even so, he said, ``once you add all these fees on, the      amount of principal being paid is negligible. The fees and      interest and other charges are so high, they may never be      able to pay it off.''       Judges say there is little they can do by the time cases      get to bankruptcy court. Under the law, ``the credit card      company is legally entitled to collect every dollar without a      distinction'' whether the balance is from fees, interest or      principal, said retired U.S. bankruptcy judge Ronald      Barliant, who presided in Chicago. The only question for the      courts is whether the debt is accurate, judges and lawyers      say.       John Rao, staff attorney of the National Consumer Law      Center, one of many consumer groups fighting the bankruptcy      bill, says the plight consumers face was illustrated last      year in a bankruptcy case filed in Northern Virginia.       Manassas resident Josephine McCarthy's Providian Visa bill      increased to $5,357 from $4,888 in two years, even though      McCarthy has used the card for only $218.16 in purchases and      has made monthly payments totaling $3,058. Those payments,      noted U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Stephen S. Mitchell in      Alexandria, all went to ``pay finance charges (at a whopping      29.99%), late charges, over-limit fees, bad check fees and      phone payment fees.'' Mitchell allowed the claim ``because      the debtor admitted owing it.'' McCarthy, through her lawyer,      declined to be interviewed.       Alan Elias, a Providian Financial Corp. spokesman, said:      'When consumers sign up for a credit card, they should      understand that it's a loan, no different than their mortgage      payment or their car payment, and it needs to be repaid. And      just like a mortgage payment and a car payment, if you are      late you are assessed a fee.'' The 29.99 percent interest      rate, he said, is the default rate charged to consumers ``who      don't meet their obligation to pay their bills on time'' and      is clearly disclosed on account applications.       Feddis, of the banker's association, said the nature of      debt means that interest will often end up being more than      the original principal. ``Anytime you have a loan that's      going to extend for any period of time, the interest is going      to accumulate. Look at a 30-year-mortgage. The interest is      much, much more than the principal.''       Samuel J. Gerdano, executive director of the American      Bankruptcy Institute, a nonpartisan research group, said that      focusing on late fees is ``refusing to look at the elephant      in the room, and that's the massive levels of consumer debt      which is not being paid. People are living right up to the      edge,'' failing to save so when they lose a second job or      overtime, face medical expense or their family breaks up,      they have no money to cope.       ``Late fees aren't the cause of debt,'' he said.       Credit card use continues to grow, with an average of 6.3      bank credit cards and 6.3 store credit cards for every      household, according to Cardweb.com Inc., which monitors the      industry. Fifteen years ago, the averages were 3.4 bank      credit cards and 4.1 retail credit cards per household.       Despite, or perhaps because of, the large increase in      cards, there is a ``fee feeding frenzy,'' among credit card      issuers, said Robert McKinley, Cardweb's president and chief      executive. ``The whole mentality has really changed over the      last several years,'' with the industry imposing fees and      increasing interest rates if a single payment is late.       Penalty interest rates usually are about 30 percent, with      some as high as 40 percent, while late fees now often are $39      a month, and over-limit fees, about $35, McKinley said. ``If      you drag that out for a year, it could be very damaging,'' he      said. ``Late and over-limit fees alone can easily rack up      $900 in fees, and a 30 percent interest rate on a $3,000      balance can add another $1 ,000, so you could go from $2,000      to $5,000 in just one year if you fail to make payments.''       According to R.K. Hammer Investment Bankers, a California      credit card consulting firm, banks collected $14.8 billion in      penalty fees last year, or 10.9 percent of revenue, up     from $10.7 billion, or 9 percent of revenue, in 2002, the      first year the firm began to track penalty fees.       The way the fees are now imposed, ``people would be better      off if they stopped paying'' once they get in over their      heads, said T. Bentley Leonard, a North Carolina bankruptcy      attorney. Once you stop paying, creditors write off the debt      and sell it to a debt collector. ``They may harass you, but      your balance doesn't keep rising. That's the irony.''                                 ______                                       By
