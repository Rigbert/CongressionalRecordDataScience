 President, I stand before you today to recognize and salute the city of Jenkins in Letcher County, KY, as they celebrate 100 years of rich State history.  Jenkins's roots reach back before its official incorporation. Four smaller communities combined to form the city of Jenkins when Consolidation Coal Company purchased 100,000 acres of coal lands in eastern Kentucky. Consolidation Coal's director, George C. Jenkins, became the city's namesake in 1912 when it was officially founded. The communities that joined together, Dunham, Burdine, Jenkins, and McRoberts, helped build the new city, which grew quickly. On January 9, 1912, the Commonwealth of Kentucky recognized Jenkins as a city of the sixth class, and by April 20 of the same year, its government was established.  The people of Jenkins had an important role to play in the State--mining the ``Cavalier'' coal that earned the reputation as the best coal in Kentucky. The success and importance of their work further facilitated the expansion of the city, and within a few years a bank, grocery store, sawmill, brick plant, hospital, bakery, drug store, post office, jail, hotel, recreation center, and a few churches and schools all opened to serve the population of the area.  Today, citizens of Jenkins enjoy the incredible Appalachian heritage as much as the beautiful mountains and scenery that surround them. The picturesque surroundings of the southeastern Kentucky mountains, and the Pine Mountain area, are on display in Breaks Interstate Park, known as ``The Grand Canyon of the South,'' and in places like the Raven Rock Golf Course. Set in this environment is ``Jenkins Homecoming Days'' and theZegeer Museum, which celebrates the history and culture of the town. These highlights speak to the hard work and dedication of the citizens of Jenkins in the past century, especially their pioneering work in the coal mining and railroad industries, which the Zegeer Museum details wonderfully.  At this time, I would like to ask my colleagues in the U.S. Senate to join me in honoring the city of Jenkins as we look back in appreciation on their storied past, and recognize the diligent work of the residents to keep up the traditions and build a bright future.  I also ask unanimous consent that an article from the Mountain Eagle noting Jenkins's rich history be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Mountain Eagle, June 13, 2012]        100 Years of Mining History Displayed at Jenkins Museum                            (By Marcie Crim)       With the City of Jenkins celebrating its centennial this      year, there is much to learn about the town's history, and      the David A. Zegeer Coal-Railroad Museum is a good place to      begin.       In the fall of 1911, Consolidation Coal Company purchased      100,000 acres of coal lands in Pike, Letcher, and Floyd      counties from the Northern Coal and Coke Company. A site was      selected for a town to be named in honor of George C.      Jenkins, one of the leading citizens of Baltimore and a      director of Consolidation Coal. By the time Jenkins was      incorporated in 1912--containing the communities of Dunham,      Burdine, Jenkins, and McRoberts--construction of the town was      booming.       Consolidation Coal built Elkhorn Lake to supply water to      run the turbines in a power plant. The company constructed      several businesses to serve the new residents of Jenkins--a      bank, grocery store, sawmill, brick plant and a hospital that      was built in 1915. Also built were a bakery, drug store, post      office, jail, hotel, recreation center, churches and schools.       Jenkins was a town built to serve one purpose--to mine the      ``Cavalier'' coal that was to become known as the best coal      in Kentucky--and its history is on display at the Zegeer      Museum located on Main Street in the old train depot.       The museum is named in honor of a former employee of      Consolidation Coal and its successor in Jenkins, Beth-Elkhorn      Coal Corp. Zegeer joined Consol in Jenkins in the late 1940s.      When the company sold its Letcher County operations to      Bethlehem Steel in 1956, Zegeer became division      superintendent. He retired as manager of Beth-Elkhorn in      1977.       In 1983, Zegeer was confirmed as Assistant Secretary of      Labor for the U.S. Department of Mine Safety and Health      Administration (MSHA) in 1983, until retiring in 1987.      According to Lois Greer, the current curator of the museum,      Zegeer was ``a company man, but he really cared about the      people in this community.''       Zegeer also became interested in the history of Jenkins,      and in conjunction with another resident of Jenkins--Marshall      Prunty, president of Roberts and Schaeffer Co.--compiled a      videotape of the history of Jenkins based on 145 photographs      taken during the years of 1911 through the early 1930s and      various publications and interviews with some of the oldest      living residents. The documentary, entitled ``Birth of a      Mining Town, Jenkins, Ky.,'' is available for purchase at the      museum.       Many pieces of Jenkins history can be found at the museum,      from photos of the town's construction to various examples of      mining equipment--everything from hard hats to breathing      devices, dinner buckets, head lamps and more. Also on display      is the sword of ``Bad'' John Wright, also known as ``Devil      John,'' an infamous former resident of Letcher County. Many      of the exhibits in the museum are on loan from current and      former residents of Jenkins.       Lois Greer is a friendly woman who has called Jenkins home      for many years. She loves to talk about the history of the      town and tell stories of the people and buildings that once      called Jenkins home. She's more than happy to walk visitors      through the various rooms at the museum, pointing out      photographs that show coal camp houses, community centers      that no longer exist, and grand buildings that were later      taken by fire. She said attendance has been down at the      museum lately, but she expects it will pick back up come      August when the celebration begins in earnest.       As Jenkins prepares to celebrate its 100th birthday, the      museum is the perfect place to dive in and begin exploring      the history of coal mining in Letcher County. You can leave      with DVDs to watch at home, folk art made from lumps of shiny      black coal, and postcards showing photos of the town's      construction and subsequent boom years. You'll also walk out      with enough knowledge to make you want to start Googling the      history of Jenkins to find out more.       Jenkins is a proud town with a singular story to tell--a      story of building a town from scratch, digging it out of the      earth to be settled solely for the purpose of mining coal.
