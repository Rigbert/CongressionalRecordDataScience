Today, 26 million American adults have chronic kidney disease, and 500,000 have irreversible kidney failure, or end-stage renal disease ESRD. These patients require dialysis or a kidney transplant to survive.  Fortunately, medical advancements have transformed organ transplantation from an experimental procedure into the accepted and often best treatment for organ failure. Transplantation has prolonged and improved the lives of thousands of Americans. Over 16,000 Americans received a kidney transplant in 2007, and 150,000 today are living with functioning kidney transplants.  Many of these kidney transplants were paid for by the Medicare system, which provides health care to aged and disabled Americans, as well as those living with ESRD. For these ESRD patients, Medicare also covers dialysis for patients who have not received a donor kidney and immunosuppressive drugs for kidney transplant recipients. Organ transplant recipients must take immunosuppressive drugs every day for the life of their transplant to reduce the risk of organ rejection.  In 2000, Congress wisely eliminated the 36-month time limitation for aged and disabled beneficiaries who had Medicare status at the time of transplant. So today, for an older or disabled person on Medicare, immunosuppressive drugs are covered by Medicare for the life of the transplant.  However, we still have an unfair and unrealistic gap in coverage for people with ESRD who are neither disabled nor elderly. For those transplant recipients, coverage for immunosuppressive drugs ends 36 months after transplantation. This is economically inefficient and morally wrong. Without regular access to immunosuppressive drugs to prevent rejection, many patients find themselves back in a risky and frightening place--in need of a new kidney.  Since Medicare covers the cost of the transplant for end stage renal disease, it makes sense for Medicare to preservethis investment by covering antirejection drugs. It would be far less expensive for Medicare to cover immunosuppressive drugs at a cost of $10,000 to $20,000 a year than to pay for dialysis--$71,000 a year--or another transplant, $106,000, if a patient's kidney fails and he is once again eligible for Medicare coverage.  I am pleased to introduce today, along with my colleague from Mississippi, Senator Thad Cochran, the Comprehensive Immunosuppressive Drug Coverage for Transplant Patients Act. This legislation would allow kidney transplant recipients to continue Medicare coverage for the purpose of immunosuppressive drugs only. All other Medicare coverage would end 36 months after the transplant.  It is time to take this step to provide continuous coverage for immunosuppressive drugs through Medicare. This is a logical and moral move that will reduce the need for dialysis and kidney retransplants and provide reliable, sustained access to critically important, lifesaving medications for thousands of Americans. In the long run, we will save both money and lives.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 565       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
