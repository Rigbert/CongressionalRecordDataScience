 President, I am joining my distinguished colleague, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch of Utah, to introduce once again the Digital Performance Rights in Sound Recordings Act. Just as the version on which we collaborated last year did, this bill will--for the first time--provide recording companies and musical artists with the same protection under copyright law already enjoyed by songwriters and composers with respect to the performance of digital sound recordings.  Senator Hatch and I introduced similar language in the last Congress for the express purpose of beginning in earnest the debate over how to redress the current imbalance in copyright law. I'm very pleased that, although time did not permit final congressional action on the bill last year, virtually all of the affected industries accepted our invitation--and that extended by former Congressman Hughes--to fully explore the complicated legal and commercial issues presented by technology's inevitable advance.  Mr. Hughes, then chair of the House's Subcommittee on Intellectual Property and Judicial Administration, organized two highly effective roundtables that brought cable, broadcast, satellite, restaurant, and music industry leaders together with other copyright holder and labor organizations. I also met at great length with many of those principals last February, as did Chairman Hatch and his staff on many, many occasions. These efforts, I am pleased to say, produced a sweeping agreement on most major aspects of this issue last May.  That agreement provided the framework for the bill we have introduced today. This legislation creates a digital public performance right in sound recordings that is applicable to transmissions for which subscribers are charged a fee. Most of these transmissions are subject to statutory licensing, at rates to be negotiated, or if necessary, arbitrated. However, interactive services remain subject to an exclusive right, in keeping with the bill as originally introduced last Congress. The bill contains protections for licensing of copyrighted works in vertically integrated companies and contains language to make clear that the new performance right does not impair any of the other copyright rights under existing law.  Ditigal technology, and the industries built around its use to distribute sound recordings, have evolved and advanced dramatically in the 17 months since this legislation was first introduced, Mr. President. The need to keep America's copyright law current, therefore, has only become more acute.  Accordingly, I believe that this Congress has not merely an opportunity, but a responsibility, to build on the tremendous bipartisan strides made last year by expeditiously considering, amending if need be, and passing the bill that Senator Hatch and I have introduced today.  For those who have not reviewed this issue since the last Congress or are new to it, let me briefly review the principal reasons to adopt this legislation:  First, it is the fair thing to do. Owners of almost every type of copyrighted work--movies, books, plays, magazines, advertising, and artwork, for example--have the exclusive right to authorize the public performance of their copyrighted work. Sound recordings, and the artists and companies that make them, however, have no such performance right.  Accordingly, when a song is played over the radio, or, as is increasingly the case, over a new digital audio cable service, the artist who sings the song, the musicians and backup singers, and the record company whose investment made the recording possible have no legal right to control or to receive compensation for this public performance of their work.  The artists who made the music, and the companies that underwrote its production and promotion, don't see a dime of the revenue realized by the ditigal transmitter. And, without a right of public performance for sound recordings by means of digital transmissions, they will not. That is just not fair, and this inequity will not be corrected unless and until this legislation is passed.  Second, the advent of digital technology and the emergence of a whole new industry to distribute them directly to the home make prompt protection of artists and record companies critical.  Let me explain why. Ordinary, or analog, radio signals are waves and, as such, they vary in strength and break down over distance. That breakdown greatly diminishes sound quality.  In the past, therefore, the sale of comparatively high-quality recordings on cassette tapes and record albums was not jeopardized by the casual home recording of music played over the radio. The quality of home recording over-the-air simply did not compare with what a record or tape sounded like over a home stereo system.  Today, however, the same technology that has given us compact discs now allows perfect reproductions of music to be digitized--turned into computer ones and zeros--that can be sent by [[Page S950]] satellite or over cable TV wires around the globe, and reassembled into concert hall quality music in our homes. Predictably, and quite legally, this quantum leap in sound technology has had a revolutionary impact on the way that music is marketed.  New subscription digital audio services have sprung up in cities, towns, and rural communities across the country. For a modest monthly fee, they deliver multiple channels of CD-quality music to customers in their homes--primarily through subscribers' cable TV wiring.  Other companies are experimenting with similar services to be provided through home computers, or more sophisticated systems that will permit the customer at home to custom-order whatever music he or she would like to hear and record. Although it is extremely time-consuming to download a CD today, soon compression technology and high-speed transmission will permit virtual instantaneous access. All one will need is a modem.  As the market is now configured, however, these companies need merely go to a local record store, buy a single copy of a compact disc which they can then transmit for a fee to tens of thousands, potentially millions, of subscribers. Because our copyright law is behind the technological times, record companies and recording artists do not see a penny of compensation from even one of those thousands of performances.  It is thus no exaggeration to say, that, without the change in copyright law proposed today, these wonderful new services have the potential to put the current recording industry out of business. Why travel to a store to buy a record, tape, or compact disc when you can get the same, or custom-tailored musical packages, in your living room at the touch of a button?  Frankly, that would be a tolerable evolution of the marketplace if artists and record companies were compensated for the use of their sound recordings by the new digital transmission services and on-line and interactive services. Right now, however, because of skewed copyright law, that is not the way the market works.  Neither Senator Hatch nor I suggest that digital audio services should not be able to operate just as they do now to bring top-quality digital signals to American homes. Our bill does insist, however, that such services not be able to take advantage of a redressable gap in our copyright laws to avoid compensating record companies and artists fairly.  Third, copyright experts have consistently urged Congress to create a right of public performance in sound recordings.  The U.S. Copyright Office has recommended since 1978 that a performance right in sound recordings be granted in all public performances, not just digital transmissions, and recently reiterated the urgency of the need for such reform created by the advent of digital audio technology. Indeed, the Copyright Office testified before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Intellectual Property and Judicial Administration in the last Congress, urgently calling for enactment of such legislation.  In addition, the administration's working group on intellectual property rights of the information infrastructure task force, in its preliminary draft report, recently wrote:       * * * the lack of a public performance right in sound      recordings under U.S. law is an historical anomaly that does      not have a strong policy justification--and certainly not a      legal one.  The report also reiterated the administration's support for the bill that Senator Hatch and I introduced in the 103d Congress and for H.R. 2575, its House counterpart introduced by Representatives William Hughes and Howard Berman.  It is time to heed these expert calls.  Fourth, taking the experts' advice also will help U.S. trade negotiators obtain greater protection for American copyright holders overseas than they are now able to demand.  More than 60 countries around the world extend similar rights to producers and their artists, and have for many years. American negotiators' efforts to obtain protection for our own companies and artists have been hampered, as they have said repeatedly,by our inability to reciprocate. It is long past time to provide our trade representatives with this valuable bargaining chip.  Finally, Mr. President, I want to reiterate that the legislation we are introducing today is no different in intent than S. 1421, although the content is somewhat different. We have attempted to continue the work of the last Congress. Furthermore, we are introducing this legislation in the same spirit with which last year's bill was submitted. Chairman Hatch and I want to continue to work closely with all the affected industries to make this as strong and properly tailored a piece of legislation as possible.  We are standing at the cusp of an exciting digital age. Technological advances, however, must not come at the expense of American creators of intellectual property. This country's artists, musicians, and businesses that bring them to us are truly among our greatest cultural assets. This bill recognizes the important contribution that they make and provides protection for their creative works, both at home and abroad.  I am once again very pleased to be working with Senator Hatch to correct an increasingly dangerous and inappropriate imbalance in our Nation's copyright laws.                                 ______      By
