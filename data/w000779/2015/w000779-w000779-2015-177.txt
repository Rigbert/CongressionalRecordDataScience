I would just like to respond very specifically to some of the concerns raised by the Senator, my friend from Alabama.  My friend from Alabama said there would be no scrutiny--those were his words--of this particular agreement, and that it would be passed through as quickly as possible without any discussions.  Now, that certainly is an area where I have been very concerned. Chairman Hatch has been concerned that there hasn't been enough discussion in the past. So Chairman Hatch and I have changed this, and I want to be very clear what is going to happen now.  First, for a full 60 days before the President of the United States signs an agreement--starting with TPP, the Trans-Pacific Partnership--it would have to be made public for those full 60 days before the President signs it. Then after that, there would be close to 2 additional months when the American people would have the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement, or any other, in their hands before anyone casts a vote on an actual agreement on the floor of the Senate or in the other body, in the House of Representatives.  So as to this idea that my friend from Alabama has said, that there wouldn't be any scrutiny of anything, we are starting to get a little flack that it would be out there for too long before people started voting. But what this----
