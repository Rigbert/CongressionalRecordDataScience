Speaker, I rise to honor the life of a respected humanitarian, a man whose contributions to his community continue long after his passing. Monday, October 15th marks the dedication of the W. Ruel Johnson Ecological Reserve, a 1,350 acre reserve that ensures coming generations will continue to enjoy the natural beauty and environmental diversity that Southern California offers.  The Reserve's origins date back to 1966, when Ruel Johnson purchased the property that became Johnson Ranch. The Johnson family farmed the land for 18 years before opening it up to recreational uses like hunting and hiking. Recently, Riverside County purchased the land from the Johnson family with an agreement that the land would remain open space.  State and county officials will dedicate the land and memorialize the namesake. The Reserve will serve as a central component of the Riverside County Integrated Plan, a long-range effort to address the region's transportation, conservation, and land-use requirements for the coming decades. During the dedication, the state's Wildlife Conservation Board will present Riverside County with a check for $10.9 million, acknowledging their shared responsibility to ensure this planning effort continues to meet success.  None of this would have been possible were it not for the generosity of the Johnson family. As Founder of the Riverside Community Health Foundation and in numerous other contributions to youth and education organizations, Ruel Johnson served as an example for his family and for all of our community's philanthropists. I am honored to stand to recognize his achievements. The W. Ruel Johnson Ecological Reserve is aptly named and its namesake well-deserving of this distinguished honor.                          ____________________
