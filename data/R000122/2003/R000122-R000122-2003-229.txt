President, I rise to pay tribute to an outstanding Rhode Islander, Jimmy McDonnell, who is celebrating his retirement from the Biltmore Hotel after 45 years of dedicated service.  Since his earnest beginnings in 1948 as a busboy in the Town Room Restaurant, Jimmy McDonnell has exemplified great professionalism, boundless enthusiasm, and is today an institution in Rhode Island's hospitality industry. Jimmy McDonnell is synonymous with the Biltmore Hotel, located in the heart of the capital city of Providence.  As a waiter, manager, and director of catering service at the Biltmore Hotel for over five decades, he has become a hallmark of one of Rhode Island's finest institutions. Over his long and industrious career Jimmy McDonnell has attended to the needs of people from all walks of life--from Presidents and foreign heads of state, to CEOs and politicians, to television and movie celebrities and even to rock stars. Jimmy has been in the center of the Rhode Island restaurant and hotel industry and is well known to our community's most distinguished residents and visitors. Synonymous with the finest in service, Jimmy has, through his professionalism, skills and graciousness, always put Rhode Island's best foot forward and illuminated the kindness and generosity of our great State.  In addition to celebrities, he has touched the lives of virtually hundreds of Rhode Islanders and their families. He oversaw countless social events and charitable endeavors and he was ``the person'' to whom you entrusted the details of your son's bar mitzvah or who made sure your daughter's wedding went according to plan. He helped make cherished memories for so many, and his good heart and hard work footnoted many special events in our State and in our lives. His exemplary legacy of service leaves many Rhode Islanders with fond memories and stories of the man they knew as ``Mr. Biltmore.'' His presence at the Biltmore will indeed be sorely missed.  I ask my colleagues to join me in commending Jimmy McDonnell for his many years of service at the Biltmore Hotel, and to the hospitality industry which makes Rhode Island such a special place to live, work, and visit.                          ____________________
