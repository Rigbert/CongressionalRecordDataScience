President, let me say I am happy to support this amendment. I am happy to be a cosponsor with my friend from Utah, Senator Hatch. I had prepared an amendment on this subject and I am happy to join him in making this a bipartisan effort.  I will not take any time because I know a number of Members have to return to their families this evening, but I concur with him, with the increased number of Americans over the age of 50 filing for bankruptcy, this is a problem which we should address and address directly. It is not only to the benefit of senior citizens who are saving for their own retirement, it is certainly to the benefit of their families who are concerned that they be allowed to live in independence and security in their retirement years. We have traditionally given special consideration to 401(k) plans. This amendment will extend that consideration to IRAs and other vehicles that allow people to put savings away for their future retirement.  I am happy to support this and I am happy to say that the amendment which I offered, and I am sure this one as well, had the support of the American Association of Retired Persons and virtually every major senior citizens group in the country.  I yield the floor.
