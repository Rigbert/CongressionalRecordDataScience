President, if I could respond to something the Senator from California said, I commend Senator Feinstein for her efforts. She has worked very hard on this privacy matter. I realize there are some who want to block it. If you are a person who has had your identity stolen, if you have had your computer hacked, and somebody has gone into your bank account or somebody has ruined the chances of your children getting into a college, all from identity theft, you would be rushing down here to vote for this bill. I hope my friends on the other side of the aisle, Republican Senators, will stop objecting. I hope we can pass this legislation.                          ____________________
