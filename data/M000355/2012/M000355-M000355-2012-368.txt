 President, I rise to send my best wishes and gratitude to a good friend of mine and a loyal public servant to the people ofKentucky for many years, Ms. Phyllis Causey. After nearly 2 decades working for the Representative from Kentucky's 2nd Congressional District--first Congressman Ron Lewis, then Congressman Brett Guthrie--she has chosen to embark on a well-earned retirement.  As a field representative for Congressmen Guthrie and Lewis, she has made a huge impact on the lives of countless Kentuckians. Her dedication and hard work has set a standard for all who enter public service. She made many friends across the Commonwealth in her 18 years as a House staffer, and I am proud to be one of them.  Phyllis graduated from Hopkinsville Community College in 1970 and earned her bachelor's degree at Western Kentucky University in 1972. She also worked for Western Kentucky University for 23 years.  Before going to work for Kentucky's Second District, Phyllis was the vice chairwoman of the Warren County Republican Party. It was in that capacity she met Ron Lewis, who was exploring a run for Congress. A lot of people did not give Ron much of a chance at the time--after all, the previous holder of that district's Congressional seat, a Democrat, had held it for almost 40 years.  Well, Ron Lewis surprised a lot of people when he won that race. After winning, one of his first decisions--one of his best decisions--was to hire Phyllis Causey. And one of Brett's best decisions was to retain her.  In her retirement, Phyllis has said she hopes to be able to spend more time with her husband, Larry, and also care for her mother. As so many people have stepped forward to wish her well upon the news of her retirement, Phyllis has humbly said, ``All I can hope is that I have made a difference.''  I certainly think it is safe to say she has. I value her friendship and wish her the best in her future endeavors. I know my colleagues in the U.S. Senate join me in honoring Ms. Phyllis Causey upon her retirement and thanking her for her many years spent in public service.  The Bowling Green, Kentucky-area publication The Daily News recently published an article highlighting Phyllis Causey's life and career. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                  [From The Daily News, Jan. 14, 2012]Causey Is Hailed as Public Servant; Guthrie Aide Retiring at the End of                                 January                          (By Andrew Robinson)       When U.S. Rep. Brett Guthrie, R-Bowling Green, was      campaigning for Congress in 2008, he was frequently posed a      question. But it wasn't about his views on taxes, federal      spending or social issues.       ``Are you going to keep Phyllis Causey?'' people often      asked Guthrie.       Guthrie did in fact keep Causey, who served as his field      representative for the past three years. But Causey said      goodbye Friday, retiring after 18 years of work with      congressmen in Kentucky's 2nd Congressional District.       Causey, who worked for former U.S. Rep. Ron Lewis before      joining Guthrie's office, officially retires at the end of      January.       In a reception at the Warren County Justice Center, Causey      thanked co-workers, friends and families for their support      over the years.       ``I have mixed emotions,'' Causey said. ``I've been crying      a lot, as a matter of fact. It's very nice that people are      stopping by.''       She said she'll remember the friends she has made.       ``And, of course, working for a great guy like (Guthrie)      and the previous congressman is a blessing,'' Causey said.       In December, Guthrie spoke for a few minutes about Causey's      service on the floor of the U.S. House, a moment that was      entered into the Congressional Record.       ``She has been such an inspiration to me,'' Guthrie said on      the floor. ``She has always been devoted to the causes she      believes in--church, family and friends. Phyllis is an      incredible wife, daughter, sister and mother. I know her      family, especially her husband Larry, will be happy to have      her around more often.''       The moment caught Causey by surprise.       ``I did not know that was happening until the day before,''      Causey said. ``I'm overwhelmed and honored that he would want      to do that.''       Of course, Guthrie and Lewis had nothing but good things to      say about Causey.       ``I used to tell her, and she thought I was kidding, but I      used to say, ''Phyllis, don't run against me, you'll beat me      hands down,''' Lewis said. ``In the counties that Phyllis      serves, the people love her. She's never met a stranger.      Everywhere you go, they know Phyllis Causey.''       Lewis met Causey in 1993. She was working as the vice      chairwoman of the Warren County Republican Party and Lewis      was trying to gauge his support in Warren County when he ran      for Congress.       Lewis was invited by Causey to several events in Warren      County.       ``She became one of my first supporters in Warren County,''      Lewis said. ``She told me all the key people to talk to.''       Such stories are endless, Lewis said.       ``A lot of people who are very political have trouble      turning that into public service,'' Guthrie said. ``And      what's amazing about her, as hard-core of a Republican she      is, she served everybody.''       Causey plans to spend more time with her husband, as well      as be a full-time caregiver for her mother. Mark Lord, who is      serving as Guthrie's district director, will step up to serve      Warren and Barren counties as field representative.       ``She just has a great personality, loves people, loves her      job--and talk about a true public servant,'' Lewis said.      ``Phyllis is a public servant. I'm sad she's retiring because      people love her.''                          ____________________
