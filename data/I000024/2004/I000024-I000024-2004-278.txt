President, I say to my friend from Nevada, the argument I recall against the amendment was that the driver himself or herself would be in a position where they could lose control of a vehicle by not having a seatbelt on and, obviously, the children would be safer than if nobody had on a seatbelt.  The Senator makes a very good point. It is one at which I would certainly like to look.  I can assure the Senator from Nevada, I learned the hard way what our law was in Oklahoma when we started cranking out grandbabies. We have 11 of them now. I did not realize the seriousness of this bill and I did not haveone of the young ones in a seatbelt, and I had to pay the penalties. I learned the hard way they really meant business.  Our law has teeth. I would certainly like to look and see what kind of results the State of Nevada has had.
