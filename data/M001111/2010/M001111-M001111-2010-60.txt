 President, as many of my colleagues know, I began my career as a preschool teacher back in my home State of Washington. My experience as a preschool teacher allowed me to see just how important early education is in shaping a person's life. As we all know, research illustrates that children who begin learning at an early age are more likely to besuccessful in their secondary education career--and to graduate from high school.  During my time in the classroom, I could easily distinguish those 4-year-olds who were read to at home. Their skills were more advanced because they had been introduced to sounds and words prior to beginning school. This is why I believe it is important for all of us to understand that reading to children at home fosters a sense of curiosity and a passion for learning that drives students throughout their academic careers.  This is why I rise today to commend Jumpstart, a successful, national non-profit organization that focuses on developing the critical language and literacy skills of our young children in low-income communities.  Beginning in 1993, Jumpstart has recruited and trained thousands of students and community volunteers to deliver a research-based and results-driven curriculum to over 70,000 preschool children across our country. During the 2009-2010 school year, Jumpstart partnered with over 250 preschools across 15 States and the District of Columbia to provide early education to 13,000 preschool children. Additionally, Jumpstart promotes reading at home through Read for the Record, an event that engages adults and children in the world's largest shared reading experience.  In my home State of Washington, Jumpstart has played an important role in providing quality literacy skill development in the city of Seattle. During the 2009-2010 school year, over 150 volunteers served nearly 500 children in 9 preschools. I appreciate Jumpstart's commitment to Washington State and its continued dedication to providing essential skill development to prekindergarten children while stimulating our next generation by involving many student volunteers.                          ____________________
