President, I, again, join in the introduction of our NOPEC bill. I am sincerely sorry that this bill has not yet become law, and I hope that the situation we face as a nation will lead the Senate to recognize the toll that the OPEC producers are exacting from the American people. As gasoline prices continue to skyrocket, exceeding $2 a gallon in many communities, we must have a real correction. As heating oil prices have soared, the President needs to take notice. Without correction and containment, consumers across the nation will continue to suffer.  The relentless increases in gasoline prices are not the result of natural supply issues. Rather, they are largely due to market manipulation by OPEC, a cartel of those controlling production and supply of oil from the Middle East. When the Antitrust Subcommittee of the Committee on the Judiciary held its hearing on gas prices last year, experts from several fields, both in and out of government, confirmed for us what we already suspected: The higher prices are due to the OPEC cartel that sets production quotas for it members and prevents the free market from setting crude oil prices. The testimony at that hearing revealed that most of the gasoline price increase can be explained by OPEC's unfair production quotas.  The artificial pricing scheme enforced by OPEC affects all of us, not the least of whom are hardworking Vermont farmers. As USDA's Cooperative Extension Office in New Hampshire recently found, the increasing energy costs may add $5,000 or more to the total costs of operating a 100-head dairy operation in the Northeast. In addition, soaring prices have affected a variety of industries across the United States, and will likely force many Americans to make tough choices about family travel.  Over the last year, I have expressed concern that gasoline prices would simply continue to rise. I have hardly been alone in that belief, and I am sorry to say that my prediction has borne fruit. Sadly, that fruit is bitter for those forced to pay ever higher prices to go about their daily lives. This week, the average price for regular gasoline reached $2.00 per gallon. Our economy, our farmers, and our families need relief now. They also need good policy. In the absence of White House leadership, Congress should provide law enforcement the tools needed to fight anticompetitive practices.  If OPEC were simply a foreign business engaged in this type of behavior, it would already be subject to American antitrust law. It is wrong to let OPEC producers off the hook just because their anticompetitive practices come with the seal of approval of the member nations. I urge the Senate to support this bill and to say ``No'' to OPEC.                          ____________________
