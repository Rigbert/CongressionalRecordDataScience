Speaker, I was pleased to hear Dr. Larry Hayward give our opening prayer this morning. For some 25 years, he has been preaching and teaching. His journey has taken him from Texas to Iowa to the D.C. area. Now he is the pastor of Westminster Presbyterian Church, a church that my wife and I attend when we are here in Washington.  He is a graduate of Union Seminary in New York. In his personal life, he certainly has a love and respect for history, government and sports, but it is also clear that the Lord comes first.                          ____________________[Page H977]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                  WELCOMING REVEREND LARRY R.
