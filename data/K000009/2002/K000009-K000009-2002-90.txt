Speaker, Notre Dame Academy and Ottawa Hills High School were recently awarded the Blue Ribbon School Award for the 2001-2002 school year. I was pleased to congratulate each school at receptions in their honor held in Washington, DC, October 3-4, 2002.  For the past 19 years, the U.S. Department of Education has honored schools that have demonstrated excellence through leadership, teaching, curriculum, student achievement, and parental involvement. Upon receiving the Blue Ribbon School of Excellence Award, Notre Dame Academy and Ottawa Hills High School have joined a select group of outstanding schools throughout America.  The human mind is our most valuable resource, and education equips young people to function in a free society, keep America competitive in the world economy, and enjoy all the resources and opportunities our country has to offer. Upon receiving this recognition, Notre Dame Academy and Ottawa Hills High School will continue to be viewed with high esteem by educators, teachers and parents in the state of Ohio and across the country. These schools truly have elevated the citizens of our great community, and join the ranks of previous local awardees, each superb local school, offering our students the finest quality education.  I commend the Notre Dame community--administrators, teachers, support personnel, parents and students and alumni--for their hard work and unwavering commitment to educational quality. Likewise, Ottawa Hills High School will continue to be viewed with high esteem by educators, teachers and parents in the state of Ohio and across the country. Onward!                          ____________________
