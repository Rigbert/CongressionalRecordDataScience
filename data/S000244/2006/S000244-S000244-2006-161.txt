Speaker, I agree it is important to recognize that paragraph 1(a) requires that the Secretary of Homeland Security develop and implement a plan for appropriate passports or other documents as expeditiously as possible. It then instructs the Secretary to complete implementation of WHTI by no later than the earlier of June 1, 2009, or 3 months from the date the conditions of paragraph 1(b) are met.  Thus, the Secretary may and, indeed must, begin the implementation process earlier than the June 1, 2009, deadline to ensure that he meets this mandate.
