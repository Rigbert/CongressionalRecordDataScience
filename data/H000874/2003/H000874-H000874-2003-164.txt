 Mr. Leader, we have had a lot of concern and discussions about the child tax credit. It has been 85 days since the President urged us to pass it. Does the gentleman have any expectations that that might be on the agenda, either next week or in the near term?  I yield to the gentleman from Texas.  Mr. DeLAY. I appreciate the gentleman yielding and his concern on this issue, and I assure the gentleman that we would very much like to address his concern. But the truth is, we disagree so strongly on this issue, on how to address this issue. We on our side just do not believe that the tax credit should expire right after next year's election and certainly do not want to see it decrease in value over the next several years, so we have continued to insist to the other body in our negotiations that the child tax credit cover more families for a longer period of time with more relief. I just hope very soon that we can convince the conferees that this is the right approach to take.
