Speaker, the latest economic news is out, and it is not good. The trade deficit for March was announced today. It hit the second highest level in history, $43.5 billion more imports coming into our country than exports going out. What we are exporting are more U.S. jobs.  Why do we have such a high trade deficit? Rising oil prices and continued deterioration in our trade accounts because of NAFTA, especially Mexico as well as Canada. The March trade deficit with Mexico alone was a record $3.9 billion. The deficit with Canada was the highest since 2 years ago, January 2001.  NAFTA is not working for the United States. NAFTA is the great sucking sound. We are exporting our jobs, not our goods, and we are importing more goods from Mexico than ever in our history.  Unemployment in America has hit a 6 percent high with almost 9 million people out of work now. Just today the Bureau of Labor Statistics put out detailed information on joblessness in America. Where is Ground Zero in the Bush recession? It is the Visalia-Tulare-Porterville area in California with 18.1 percent unemployment. Of metropolitan areas with populations over a million people, the highest unemployment was found in Portland, Oregon, and San Jose, California, 8.4 percent each. I just returned from the San Jose area.  Indeed, of the 272 metropolitan areas for which year-to-year comparisons can be made, the largest declines in employment were found in San Diego, followed by Tulsa, Oklahoma; Flint, Michigan; and my home community of Toledo, Ohio. Ohio is first in our Nation in lost jobs as a percentage of our workforce since George Bush came into office in 2001. No State has suffered more than Ohio from the Bush administration's failed economic policies.  The dollar is hitting new lows in part due to impolitic comments made by our Treasury Secretary John Snow on Sunday talk shows. Is the Bush administration committed to a strong dollar? They say they are, but many experts are questioning the commitment in light of Secretary Snow's comment on Sunday that a falling dollar should help exporters. In fact, it is hard to make any sense of the Bush administration's economic policy. The administration seems bound and determined to start and hold a losing hand. All they can talk about are tax breaks for the wealthy.  But it is the consumer that is keeping our economy out of a depression. It is the middle-class consumer that made America great. It is the great middle class that fights our wars, makes our goods, delivers our services, and keeps our country strong. But the Bush administration wants to cut taxes for the super-rich, even though we know that that policy will lead to recession and more job losses.  In fact, look at what happened in our country after the first Bush set of tax breaks to the wealthy back in 2001: More and more job losses, over 2 million of them. They talked to us about jobless recovery. What is a jobless recovery? That is all we seem to have are jobless recoveries. Every time this group gets in office, they give us more unemployment. And, indeed, if the Members look back to 1981 when, under the Reagan administration, our Vice President, Dick Cheney, was the head of the Republican Policy Committee here in the House, they did the same thing. They called it the Economic Tax Recovery Act of July 29, 1981, and do the Members know what happened back then? The minute the same kind of tax program was enacted, guess what happened? More and more and more job losses.  I came here in January 1983 to try to help dig America out of a hole, a job-loss hole as well as a deficit hole. It took us almost 15 years, and now we are back to the same mess we had back then. I say if it is strike one, strike two, and now strike three, they ought to be out.  The Republicans in this kind of trickle-down tax program are really going to gouge the middle class again. So I would say, Mr. Speaker, just take a look at the record. It is the same old story. And what do we get? More job losses, an administration that does not want to extend unemployment benefits to those who have been out of work. They say go find a job somewhere, except for one thing: More and more jobs are being lost every day. And the Buckeye State rings in number one in terms of job losses.  Mr. Speaker, America should do better, and America will do better a year from now when we elect a new President.                          ____________________
