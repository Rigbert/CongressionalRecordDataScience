 President, I rise today to recognize the career and civic contributions of Mr. Ken Wheeler, an industry leader and community builder in Paducah, Kentucky. Ken's recent retirement is the culmination of a forty-two year career in the maritime industry spanning shipbuilding to inland shipping.  Ken earned a degree in mechanical engineering at Southern Methodist University and worked for twenty-four years for Ingalls Shipbuilding in the company's nuclear-submarine division. By the time he left Ingalls Shipbuilding, he was the company's vice-president of submarine programs. Contributions from individuals such as Ken Wheeler helped make our nation's nuclear-submarine fleet the safest, quietest, and most effective in the world. In the early 1980's, Ken and his wife, Jean, relocated to Paducah following Ken's career move to Midland Enterprises, which operates tow boats on the nations inland riverways.  Since joining Midland Enterprises, Ken has held various positions including vice-president of repair and maintenance, Port Allen Marine; president, Walker Boat Yard; vice-president, Harley Marine Corp.; president, R & W Marine, Inc.; and vice-president, maintenance and repair for all the Midland Enterprise companies.  Ken has been a key player in establishing Paducah as a national hub for river trade. The city currently boasts about twenty towing companies, and more than 130 supporting businesses. The towing industry in Paducah accounts for approximately 1,300 jobs and a $35,000,000 annual payroll. Ken has used his position within the industry as a ``bully pulpit'' to advocate needed infrastructure improvements on the riverways, our nation's internal trade lifeline. From the new Olmsted Dam on the Ohio River, not far from its confluence with the mighty Mississippi, to the expanded lock facilities at Kentucky Dam on the Tennessee River, Ken has worked to make sure that the general public as well as those in government understand the importance of a strong and vital river-transportation network. A network which has a great, but often unrecognized impact on our American way of life. Ken's goal as we cross the threshold into a new millennia has simply been to make certain that America's riverways continue to supply the economical transportation which we have so long enjoyed. As other countries around the world improve their inland transportation networks, we must work to ensure that increased costs of transportation do not put our exports at a competitive disadvantage.  In other areas of civic concern, Ken has also worked to better Western Kentucky by serving on the boards of Paducah Community College, and West Kentucky Technical College. He is a past president of the Propeller Club of the United States. Additionally, he chairs the River Heritage Center, an exciting new development which will showcase the history of the inland rivers and their importance.  Mr. President, I commend Ken Wheeler for his outstanding service to Kentucky and the nation. Whether it be building systems that helped win the Cold War, or championing an industry vital to our national commerce, Ken Wheeler's contributions will have long-lasting effect. I ask that my fellow colleagues join me in recognizing the career of this outstanding Kentuckian.                          ____________________
