President, today, as we celebrate National Women's History Month, I rise to pay tribute to the extraordinary women, past and present, who have broken down barriers and continue to shape our nation's future.  First, I would like to thank my distinguished colleague, Senator Barbara Mikulski, who herself has succeeded in redefining the role of women in politics by becoming the most senior woman in the Senate today. Twenty years ago, when Senator Mikulski was in the House, she and another one of my notable colleagues, Senator Orrin Hatch, co-sponsored the first Joint Congressional Resolution declaring National Women's History Week, now a month long celebration acknowledging the accomplishments of women. I applaud my colleagues for their leadership in bringing forth this important celebration of women.  This year's national theme is ``An Extraordinary Century for Women--Now, Imagine the Future!'' Given the extraordinary accomplishments of women this last century and the bright future of women in this new millennium, a more appropriate theme for this month's celebration of women could not have been chosen.  This month, we pay tribute to the founders of the first Women's Rights Convention 150 years ago. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucretia Mott, and Susan B. Anthony were visionaries who championed women's rights. We also celebrate the historic achievements of Amelia Earhart, Ida B. Wells, Eleanor Roosevelt, Jacqueline Kennedy, Sally Ride, and other legendaries who redefined the role of women and are role models, not only for today's young women, but for all.  My home state of Illinois is filled with such legendary women. Jane Addams was a socially conscious community leader who founded Hull House, a neighborhood center for immigrants in Chicago and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1931. Minnie Saltzman-Stevens was an internationally known Wagnerian soprano who received her first voice training from the O.R. Skinner Music School in Illinois. Content Johnson was an artist who gained considerable reputation as a portrait and still life painter in oils. Elizabeth Irons Folsom was an author and winner of the 1923 O'Henry Prize for short stories. Margaret Illington, born Maud Light, was a renowned actress who so loved Bloomington, Illinois, that she changed her name to Illington, forever bearing the proof of her love. These women paved the way for today's talented female Illinoisans.  Today's prominent Illinoisans include my friend and former colleague Carol Moseley-Braun, the first African American elected to the Senate and now the US Ambassador to New Zealand; Karen Nussbaum, Director of the Women's Bureau in the US Department of Labor; Marlee Matlin, the only hearing impaired person ever to win an Academy Award for Best Actress; Hillary Rodham Clinton, American first lady, attorney, and leader on education and children's issues; and Caribel Washington, an 86 year old civil rights activist who continues to use her strength and fortitude to inspire all people.  The struggles and triumphs of these women will guide those who follow. One such follower is Winifred Alves, who I had the pleasure of meeting the other day. Winifred is this year's recipient of the Girl Scout Gold Award.  Winifred's future is as bright as her Gold Award.  Despite opposition, many of us in this Congress are fighting to ensure fair pay for women and close the wage gap. We are working to open the doors of college to all Americans by providing quality education at the elementary and secondary level and college tuition assistance to make higher education more affordable. We are working to improve our nation's health by bringing the issues of affordable prescription drugs and a Patient's Bill of Rights to the forefront.  Although Winifred's future is bright, the lives of many of our children remain in jeopardy until we pass tougher gun laws. Last week, six year old Kayla Rolland was tragically shot to death by her fellow kindergarten classmate with a stolen gun. Kayla never had an opportunity to become a Girl Scout. She died senselessly because another six year old child was able to gain access to an illegal firearm. How many more of our children must die before we, as a Congress, band together on a bipartisan basis to pass comprehensive gun legislation?  In this month of March, let us not only pay tribute to those women who have pioneered and inspired all of us, let us remember the young lives we have failed to protect by failing to pass commonsense gun control legislation. Let us also remember, their mothers, teachers, neighbors and friends, who helped shape these young lives but will never know the full potential of their joyous labor. And let us also remember our own mothers, sisters, and aunts who, although unknown to most, continue to shape our lives and our nation's future.                          ____________________
