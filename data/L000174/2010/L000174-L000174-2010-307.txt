President, this week, the Nation commemorates Sunshine Week--a time to educate the public about the importance of open government. In recognition of Sunshine Week 2010, I am pleased to join with Senator Cornyn to introduce the Faster FOIA Act of 2010, a bill to improve the implementation of the Freedom of Information Act, FOIA.  Senator Cornyn and I first introduced this bill in 2005 to address the growing problem of excessive FOIA delays within our Federal agencies.Our decision to reintroduce the Faster FOIA Act this year is the most recent example of our bipartisan efforts to help reinvigorate FOIA.  Today, thanks to the reforms contained in the Leahy-Cornyn OPEN Government Act of 2007, millions of Americans who seek information under FOIA will experience a process that is much more transparent and less burdened by delays. In 2009, President Obama signed the OPEN FOIA Act into law. That bill is the result of another successful collaboration with Senator Cornyn and me that is making the process for creating new legislative exemptions to FOIA more transparent.  While both of these legislative accomplishments are strengthening FOIA, more reforms are needed.  According to the Department of Justice's Freedom of Information Act Annual Report for fiscal year 2009, the Department had a backlog of almost 5,000 FOIA requests at the end of 2009.
