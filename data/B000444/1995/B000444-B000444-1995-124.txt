 President, and I shall not object, I just want to tell my colleagues, there are two of my colleagues on this side who are going to seek to modify the Senator's amendment. I am not sure that is going to actually happen, so he is not caught blindsided by that. I am not at liberty to agree to a time agreement that is not subject to an amendment in the second degree. I do not know that will happen, so I do not object.
