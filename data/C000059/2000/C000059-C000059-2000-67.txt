 Madam Speaker, S. Con. Res. 145 expresses the sense of Congress on the propriety and need for expeditious construction of the National World War II Memorial at the Rainbow Pool on the National Mall on the Nation's capitol. In short, this gives the congressional approval to construct this memorial to the brave men and women who served and gave their lives during World War II at the Rainbow Pool location in the Mall and will, I hope, put this issue to rest.  Madam Speaker, there are two indisputable facts dealing with this memorial. One is the fact that no one can possibly think that memorial does not deserve to be in a place of the utmost prominence in the Mall. World War II was the most important event in this century and over 1 million Americans were either killed or wounded.  The other fact is that all approvals from various commissions have been granted to proceed with the construction of this memorial at this site. However, it is apparent that construction is still mired down, now with misguided lawsuits by a few people who apparently do not believe that this event and the 16 million brave men and women who proudly wore the American uniform deserve recognition.  Enough is enough, Madam Speaker. The process of constructing this memorial has gone on far and long enough, and it is high time we got down to the business and build this deserved memorial which means so much to so many people. Madam Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support S. Con. Res. 145.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
