 President, I rise to express my deepest condolences to the families of the innocent victims of the brutal terrorist attacks that occurred in Amman, Jordan, last Wednesday. Homicide bombers, wearing deadly explosives under their clothes, entered three popular and crowded hotels and detonated themselves. Jordanian authorities have determined the attack was the work of al-Qaida.  So far, 57 are thought dead, among them a number of children; many more are injured. A wedding reception was underway in one of the hotels, and on the day after what should have been the happiest day of their lives, a young Jordanian bride and her groom each had to bury their slain fathers.  I know my colleagues join me in completely condemning the terrorists behind this attack. America will never give in to terrorists and their murder of innocents. Unthinkable evil like that only strengthens our resolve to fight terror and bring those who practice it to justice.  According to our great ally King Abdullah II of Jordan, the targets of these Muslim terrorists were not Americans, but fellow Muslims. The hotels were well known to be frequented by Jordanians and Iraqis.  The terrorists' hope is that by attacking America's allies, like Jordan, they can frighten those countries into abandoning the War on Terror, and divide the grand coalition of free nations who oppose them. That appears to have been the purpose of the Amman attacks.  Well, the terrorists will not get what they want. I wish to bring to my colleagues' attention the inspired words of His Majesty King Abdullah, given shortly after the terrorists struck. Before this bombing, King Abdullah was America's steadfast partner in the War on Terror. Today, if possible, he stands even more aligned with our effort to fight terror.  King Abdullah and the Jordanian people will not be swayed by the terrorists.  In fact, we saw the demonstrators in the streets of Jordan--not against the King but against the terrorists.  The day after the bombings, the King declared: ``We will not be intimidated into altering our position, nor will we abandon our convictions or forfeit our role in the fight against terrorism in all its forms.'' He continued, ``To the contrary, every act of terrorism strengthens our resolve to adhere to our convictions, and to confront, with all the means at our disposal, those who seek to undermine the security and stability of this country.''  We all applaud King Abdullah for his strength and commitment to this fight. He refuses to bend to fear. His vision of a Jordan that rejects terror strengthens the will of every Jordanian, even those who emerged bloody and scarred from these atrocious attacks, to see this struggle through.  King Abdullah also deserves praise for his message that Islam is a religion of peace, and that the terrorists are not protectors of the Muslim faith but defilers of it. He is one of the world's foremost voices for moderation and tolerance in Islam. He understands that the War on Terror is not a war between America and Islam, as some of the most radical terrorists try to paint it, but actually a war between a small, fringe faction of violent extremists on one hand and a coalition of all freedom-loving peoples, Muslim, Christian,Jewish and Hindu among them, on the other.  I ask for unanimous consent that the entirety of King Abdullah's statement on the Amman bombings of last week be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: His Majesty King Abdullah's Address to the Nation Following the Amman                Bombings, November 10, 2005, Amman, Jordan       I would like to begin by extending my profound condolences      to the families of all the innocent victims who were killed,      and we are praying for a swift recovery for all of those who      were injured.       This is not the first time that Jordan has been a target of      terrorism. It is also not the only country that has been a      victim of terrorism; there have been many countries in the      region and throughout the world which have been similarly      terrorized by attacks of greater scope and intensity.       We know, however, that Jordan has been targeted more than      any other country for several reasons, among them, its role      and its message defending the essence of Islam--the religion      of moderation and tolerance that abhors the terrorists who      kill innocents in Islam's name, even as Islam is innocent of      such crimes.       Let it be clear to everyone that we will pursue these      terrorists and those who aide them; we will reach them      wherever they are, pull them from their lairs and submit them      to justice.       Jordan does not bow to coercion. We will not be intimidated      into altering our position, nor will we abandon our      convictions or forfeit our role in the fight against      terrorism in all its forms. To the contrary, every act of      terrorism strengthens our resolve to adhere to our      convictions, and to confront, with all means at our disposal,      those who seek to undermine the security and stability of      this country.       Our confidence in the security services and their ability      to protect the security of this country and its stability      remains unwavering. We have succeeded in preventing many      planned attacks on this country. For every infrequent success      terrorists have had in carrying out one of their crimes, we      have had many more successes in foiling their plots.       I appeal to every citizen--man and woman--of this country      to consider himself or herself a soldier and a security      officer. Each one of you has a responsibility to protect your      country. Circumstances require each and every citizen to be      cautious and vigilant, and to cooperate with the security      services to prevent any attack on the security and stability      of this country. We must be united in confronting these      terrorists, who have neither a religion nor a conscience.       I am confident that the patriots of Jordan--men and women--     will maintain, as they always have, a watchful eye over the      country and its security, and will be the first line of      defense in protecting Jordan and its achievements. Jordan      will continue, with the help of God and the determination of      its people, to overcome evil.       Finally, all my thanks and appreciation go to our security,      military and civil institutions, as well as to the citizens      of Jordan who have acted as one in confronting the attacks on      our precious capital, Amman.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I yield the floor.
