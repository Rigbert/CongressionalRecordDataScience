The national instant criminal background check system exists. We simply are applying it to unlicensed dealers at gun shows.  Second, I have heard much this afternoon about the law working. It has worked occasionally to punish terrorists and criminals who have used violence and weapons, but it has not worked as effectively to prevent harm to people who have been killed, the most obvious and most notable, 13 young people at Columbine High School. The Reed-McCain, McCain-Reed amendment can help prevent, we hope, this violence that so often strikes our communities.  I yield back my time.
