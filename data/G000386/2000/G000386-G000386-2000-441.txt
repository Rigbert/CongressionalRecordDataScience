 President, I would like to take a moment with my colleagues to discuss a recent article that was in the National Journal. It was about the Pentagon's Acting Inspector General, Mr. Donald Mancuso. The article was written by Mr. George Wilson. Mr. Wilson was a senior defense reporter at the Washington Post for many years. He left the Washington Post in 1991 to write books. He is now a columnist with the National Journal.  Mr. Wilson is a top-notch reporter. He is respected for being very thorough and very fair. But, above all, he is respected for an uncanny ability to find the nub of a complex issue and expose it to public scrutiny in an interestingand also informative way. He had a recent article in the National Journal that is no exception. It has exposed a very raw nerve. The article is entitled: ``Tailhook May Soil Choice for Pentagon's Mr. Clean.'' It appeared in the January 22, 2000, issue of the National Journal on pages 260 and 261.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have that article printed in the Record at the end of my remarks.
