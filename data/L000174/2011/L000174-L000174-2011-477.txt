President, the managers' amendment to the America Invents Act, adopted 97-2 on March 1, contained a rule of construction that nothing in section 14 of the act should be construed to imply that other business methods are patentable or that other business-method patents are valid. This provision was included merely as a clarification. No inference should be drawn in any way from any part of section 14 of the act about the patentability of methods of doing business.  Mr. President, I have discussed this with the Republican leadership, and we are prepared to yield back all time on both the Democratic and Republican sides.
