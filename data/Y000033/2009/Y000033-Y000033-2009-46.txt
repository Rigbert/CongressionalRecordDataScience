Mr. Chairman, I rise to enter into a colloquy with the distinguished chairman of Homeland Security, Mr. Thompson.  Mr. Thompson, as we prepare to authorize appropriations for the Transportation Security Administration, I'd like to thank you for your leadership in the committee and your efforts to bring this legislation to the floor.  I would also like to bring to your attention an issue that needs to be corrected. In 2003, when I was chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, language was included in the Vision 100 Act, Public Law 108-176, which required deployment of TSA screeners in the Alaskan communities of Kenai, Homer, and Valdez. Since that time, the Ted Stevens International Airport has improved bag screening capabilities and can adequately screen bags for the three previously mentioned airports.  Kenai, Homer, and Valdez are serviced by air carriers under a partial program. There are no regulatory requirements to screen bags for partial program carriers, so section 613 of the Vision 100 Act imposes a requirement not in effect for other similarly situated airports. The screeners are no longer needed, and TSA has asked that I repeal the language from Vision 100.  This will not cost any money. Rather, this will save TSA money. TSA has informed me that by including this legislation in the TSA Authorization, it would save $1 million a year.  I'd like to ask the gentleman to comment on this.
