 President, I heard the remarks of the distinguished Senator from New York, and, obviously, I agree and I guess I would like to add my 2 cents to the arguments presented.  I am a 19-year member of the Judiciary Committee, so I have had a front-row seat for judicial nominations for a long time. Over 800 judges have been confirmed since I came to the Senate.  Now, it was not so long ago that liberals and conservatives could easily win confirmation as long as they were well qualified, fair-minded, and had judicial temperament.
