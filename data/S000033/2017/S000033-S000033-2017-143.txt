 President, the adoption of this budget resolution will allow Republicans to come back to the floor of the Senate with a budget reconciliation package which will repeal the ACA with a simple majority. If they do that, up to 30 million Americans will lose their health care, with many thousands dying as a result. Because if you have no health insurance and you can't go to a doctor or a hospital, you die.  Medicare will be converted into a voucher program. Medicaid will be decimated. Rural hospitals will be closed, and they have no alternative proposition. They want to kill ACA, but they have no idea about how they are going to bring forth a substitute proposal. This is not what the American people want. This is irresponsible. This is dangerous. This should be defeated.  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask for the yeas and nays.
