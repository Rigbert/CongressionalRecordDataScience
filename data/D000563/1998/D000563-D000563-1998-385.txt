President, I rise to pay special tribute to a legendary radio personality, Steve Dahl, who today is celebrating his twentieth anniversary of broadcasting in Chicago, Illinois.  At age sixteen, Steve launched his career into radio broadcasting. At the time, he was considered somewhat of a rebel on the airwaves, but over the years, Chicagoans have come to love his unique style and personality.  With his afternoon talk-show, ``The Steve Dahl Show,'' on WCKG FM Chicago, Steve continues to entertain and inform more than a half million listeners everyday. As his loyal audience tunes in daily to hear his commentary on life in the Windy City, Steve's popularity continues to grow.  Steve Dahl has made a lasting contribution to the Chicago radio industry. Today, I join his colleagues, listeners, friends and family to commend Steve for his impressive tenure on the Chicago airwaves.                          ____________________
