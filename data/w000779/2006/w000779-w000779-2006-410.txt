President, reserving the right to object, and I have no intention of objecting, I want to clarify what the distinguished chairman and ranking member said--and they have been very helpful. My understanding is that we go to the Conrad amendment after that, the avian flu amendment. It is my understanding per the agreement between the chairman and ranking minority member that after the Conrad amendment has been discussed, we would next go to the Snowe-Wyden amendment.  Is that the understanding of the chairman and the ranking minority member?
