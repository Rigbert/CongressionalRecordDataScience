 On that night, President Bush told all of us and the Nation that the document reflecting his priorities, his fiscal year 2006 budget, `` . . . substantially reduces or eliminates more the than 150 government programs that are not getting results, or duplicate current efforts, or do not fulfill essential priorities.''  Less than a week after delivering that address, the President unveiled his budget that defines exactly what he sees as those nonessential priorities. What are they? Students; our ports and our borders; accessible health care; nuclear waste cleanup.  In addition, his budget has not one dollar--that is right, not one single dollar--for the two top priorities the President talked about that night. His two top priorities: Social Security transition, and making the tax cuts permanent. Both of those items are completely ignored in his budget. This is a camouflage budget that we have been presented, and it is meant to hide the truth from American families.  What the President should know is that families in my home State of Washington and across the country are concerned about the security of theirjobs, the security of their communities, access to affordable health care, and quality education.  Unfortunately, rather than inspiring confidence, I believe the President's budget leaves too many Americans questioning the future. On issue after issue, this budget falls short of what our communities need today to move forward and to feel secure.  What I would like to focus on is this budget's impact on one group that we absolutely must take care of, and that is our Nation's veterans. We have no greater obligation as elected officials than to take care of those who have taken care of us. Unfortunately, I fear this administration is failing in this most important responsibility. After asking thousands of soldiers to serve us overseas, this administration is not making their health care and their well-being a priority when they cease being soldiers and become veterans.  Access to first-class care should be a reality for all veterans, especially while our Nation is at war. The President's budget may have a few small steps in the right direction, but, sadly, he does not go far enough to meet the needs of all veterans. If this budget and its misguided proposals were enacted, it would devastate veterans' health care. Payroll and inflation increases for doctors, for nurses, for medications cost more than $1 billion. But the President has proposed to give the VA only half what it needs. To make up for the shortfall, the budget forces more than 2 million so-called middle-income veterans to pay more than double for their needed medications and to pay a $250 enrollment fee. That is not what we promised veterans when we asked them to serve us overseas.  In addition, the President's budget actually continues to ban some veterans from coming to the VA for care. So far under this flawed policy, 192,260 veterans have been turned away across the country, including more than 3,000 in my home State. This sends the wrong message to our troops overseas. They need to know we are there for them when they return home.  Sadly, this budget also destroys the relationship between the VA and our States. After the Civil War, the VA has supported the cost of veterans who reside in our State VA nursing homes. But this budget now calls on States to cover the entire cost of care for many veterans in these cost-effective nursing homes.  To make this budget add up, the President calls for $590 million in unspecified efficiencies. Thousands of nurses and other providers will be cut, thousands of nursing home beds will be shuttered, and more than 1 million veterans will no longer be able to afford to come to the VA for care.  You don't have to take my word for this. Listen to the head of the VFW who addressed this issue in Commerce Daily a few days ago. John Furgess, who heads the Veterans of Foreign Wars, said the administration's proposed $880 million increase in veterans health care only amounts to an increase of about $100 million because the budget proposes that veterans shoulder a $250 enrollment fee and an increased copay on prescription drugs in addition to nursing home cuts. Furgess said:       Part of the federal government's deficit will be balanced      on the backs of military veterans, because it's clear that      the proper funding of veterans' health care and other      programs is not an administration priority.  There is more. Before the budget was even sent to Congress, I read this in the New York Times:       Richard B. Fuller, legislative director of the Paralyzed      Veterans of America, said: ``The proposed increase in health      spending is not sufficient at a time when the number of      patients is increasing and there has been a huge increase in      health care costs. It will not cover the need. The enrollment      fee is a health care tax, designed to raise revenue and to      discourage people from enrolling.''  Mr. Fuller added that the budget would force veterans, hospitals, and clinics to limit services. He said:       We are already seeing an increase in waiting lists, even      for some Iraq veterans.  The story went on to say that there are already some hospitals with waiting lists for Iraqi veterans:       In Michigan, for example, thousands of veterans are on      waiting lists for medical services, and some reservists      returning from Iraq say they have been unable to obtain the      care they were promised. A veterans clinic in Pontiac, Mich.,      put a limit on new enrollment. Cutbacks at a veterans      hospital in Altoona, Pa., are forcing some veterans to seek      treatment elsewhere.  And yesterday, in an editorial titled ``Penalizing Veterans,'' the Boston Globe said:       It is a sign of how desperate the Bush administration is to      protect tax cuts for the wealthy while also trying to reduce      runaway deficits that it would call for veterans to pay more      for their health benefits. Congress should reject this      proposal out of hand and put enough money into veterans'      health care to end the inexcusable waiting lists at many      veterans' facilities.  I ask unanimous consent to print the editorial in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [From the Boston Globe, Feb. 9, 2005]                          Penalizing Veterans       It is a sign of how desperate the Bush administration is to      protect tax cuts for the wealthy while also trying to reduce      runaway deficits that it would call for veterans to pay more      for their health benefits. Congress should reject this      proposal out of hand and put enough money into veterans'      health care to end the inexcusable waiting lists at many      veterans' facilities.       Under the Bush proposal, veterans would have to pay an      enrollment fee of $250 for VA care. Their copay for      prescription drugs would rise from $7 to $15 for a monthly      prescription. The administration lamely defends these charges      by noting that they are for ``higher-income'' veterans      without service-connected disabilities. According to Joe      March of the American Legion, the administration defines      ``higher income'' as $25,000 or more, which hardly qualifies      as the Boca Raton set. A VA spokesman said the income level      is based on local conditions. He could not provide a national      average.       The goal of the administration, which has made similar      proposals in the past, is to save close to a half-billion      dollars by coaxing more than 200,000 veterans to seek care in      other venues. But increasing numbers of older Americans have      been turning to VA clinics and hospitals because they have      lost their employment-based insurance and discovered that      Medicare will not start covering prescription drug costs      until 2006. Many of these veterans do not have affordable      alternatives. According to Representative Stephen Lynch of      South Boston, veterans in his district often have to wait      eight months to see a doctor.       Treatment of veterans without service-related disabilities      is considered ``discretionary'' spending by the Department of      Veterans Affairs. Veterans'' advocates think this care should      not be discretionary but mandatory, like Medicare. In spite      of the growing number of veterans from recent wars, the      increasingly severe health needs of older veterans, and      overall increases in health costs, the administration is      asking for just a 2.7 percent increase for ``discretionary''      health care. Veterans groups favor an increase of 25 percent.       That is not realistic, but it is a reflection of the      frustration the advocates feel knowing that inadequate      spending for veterans' health is undermining the unwritten      promise of lifetime care that many veterans believe was made      to them when they took the oath.       ``Veterans' health care is an ongoing expense of war,'' the      American Legion's national commander, Thomas Cadmus, said      yesterday. It is particularly wrong-headed for the      administration to squeeze veterans when some of the armed      services have had trouble filling their ranks. Congress      should tell the Bush administration that veterans, who      enlisted to help their nation, should not be enlisted anew,      involuntarily, and burdened with the job of balancing the      budget.
