 But I said I would be happy, if you would like me to, that we vote on the Durbin amendment shortly with a 60-vote threshold, which is pretty common around here on all matters of controversy. I was pointing out that this Durbin amendment is the most controversial part of the bill. Both sides knew that. I don't know why we don't have a vote at 60 like we do on virtually everything of controversy in the Senate. Then dispose of the Durbin amendment and move on.
