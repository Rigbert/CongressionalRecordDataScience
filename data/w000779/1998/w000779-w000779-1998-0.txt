President, today Congress passed a version of the Dungeness Crab Conservation and Management Act, a bipartisan bill which I cosponsored along with Senators Murray, Gorton, and Smith. I would like to particularly commend Senator Murray for her strong leadership on this issue. She introduced the bill earlier this year and worked hard to secure its passage in this Congress.  Dungeness crab is integral to the economies of Oregon's coastal communities. The fishery is successfully managed, from both an environmental and an economic standpoint, by the States of Oregon, Washington, and California. Under existing law, the Federal government would have taken control of the management of Dungeness crab next year, costing taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars. Our legislation prevents this from happening. This is a common sense approach: it extends the existing authority for the States to manage Dungeness crab in Federal waters and eliminates the need to develop a costly Federal fishery managment plan.  The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, enacted in 1976, established regional Fishery Management Councils to develop Federal management plans for fisheries in need of conservation and management in Federal waters. However, in order to meet regional needs, the interpretation of this provision has traditionally been flexible, allowing states to manage some fisheries in Federal waters. An example of this flexibility is state management of the West Coast Dungeness crab fishery.  Since the 1960's, the States of Oregon, Washington and California have managed the Dungeness crab fishery in Federal waters. The three states and the concerned Indian tribes have worked together to make sure fishermen from each state are treated fairly and the fishery remains biologically sound. West Coast fishermen, scientists, fishery managers, and conservation groups all agree that state management has been a success story.  From a conservation standpoint, state management of Dungeness crab is effective. The crabs are harvested in a way that ensures healthy populations for the future. In addition, the problem of bycatch, or incidental catch of other fish species, is almost non-existent in the crab fishery.  Under the Magnuson Act, the authority for state management of Dungeness crab expires next year. The expiration of state authority would have required the Pacific Fishery Management Council to develop a Federal fishery management plan in 1999. Developing this plan would have consumed scant Council resources and staff time.  As many folks in Oregon know, management of West Coast groundfish and salmon species presents huge challenges to fishery managers. The Council shouldn't be forced to divert critical resources from groundfish and salmon in order to manage a species like crab, which is doing fine under the existing states' plan. With the passage of this legislation today, the Council can continue to focus its resources on the fisheries that need special attention.  This bill makes common sense by taking advantage of the unique situation presented by the Dungeness crab fishery. Essentially, Congress is agreeing with what many folks have said of this fishery: ``if it's not broken, don't fix it.'' I am glad Congress could work together in a bipartisan fashion to pass this common-sense legislation.                          ____________________
