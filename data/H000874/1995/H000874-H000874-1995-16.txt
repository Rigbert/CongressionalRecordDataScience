Ehlers], I think, are ones that reflect what I would refer to as a commonsense way of proceeding. Because, and that was the reason for my question, I believe that the Members of your conference have confidence in you, Mr. Leader, and I believe the Members of our caucus have confidence in the gentleman from Missouri [Mr. Gephardt]. I think if the two of you agree that this can be moved forward, with the Speaker's concurrence as well, the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. Ehlers] is echoing what I said, that we ought to be able to do that, it seems to me, by unanimous consent and put the Government back to work at least through January 2, which after all is a very short time.  But what it does is, it solves the problem that the gentleman from Virginia [Mr. Moran] has referenced with reference to getting paychecks to people for the second half of this month. We are running into a time now where we are not going to be able to pay people, not going to be able to send out checks except for the exceptions we have made.  I thank the gentleman for his comments and would concur with him. I do not believe, very honestly, Mr. Leader, that that takes any pressure off because of the short-term nature of that action.
