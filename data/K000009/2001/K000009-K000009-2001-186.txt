Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Stump), Chairman of the Committee on Armed Services, who is my good friend, and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Evans), the ranking member of the full committee, a member from my own class for whom I have the highest regard, for yielding the time to me.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in very strong support of the Senate resolution that has come back to us in support of constructing the World War II Memorial on our avenue of democracy where it belongs.  I think it is especially historic in that this is the first year of the new century and the new millennium which allows us some perspective in lookingback and recognizing that the victory of liberty over tyranny was the fulcrum of the 20th century.  As we look at that Mall and we think about the history of this Nation, we have the Washington Monument; yes, a monument to a person, but, more importantly, a monument to the founding of our republic.  Then not so far from it on the Mall, the Lincoln Memorial; yes, a memorial to a person, a great person, but also a memorial to the preservation of our union.  Now, for the 20th century, we add to this expression of the history of the United States a memorial to the victory of liberty over tyranny.  The 18th, 19th, and 20th century come together at one moment, in fact, in the revised design of this new memorial. There will be a light fixture in the central sculpture within the Rainbow Falls that will cast itself on the Reflecting Pool from the Lincoln Memorial at the exact place where the Washington Monument's shadow is cast in the reflecting pool in a way that the 18th, 19th, and 20th century all come together in celebration of freedom.  This is exactly the place where this memorial belongs. In fact, if you walk the Mall today, the disrepair of the Rainbow Fountains is a disgrace. And so, the improvements that will be made with the refined design will elevate us all as a people and the expression of our own history.  I believe, along with all the others who have spoken, that the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton) and those who have expressed some concerns about the design have been involved in the refinement and improvement of this expression of a free people. Thank goodness we have had over 22 public hearings, various approvals of the Fine Arts Commission and the National Capital Planning Commission, because with every step, it has become better, as it should.  On this Memorial Day that we will celebrate next week, we honor all veterans, all freedom lovers, certainly the 16 million World War II veterans who made our freedom and our ability to stand on this floor today as a free people possible.                              {time}  1045  We also remember the 5 million who still are living today and whom we hope will see our seriousness in celebrating and commemorating what they have done for the world. Whoever would have thought that we would live at a time or we would have witnessed the fall of the Berlin Wall, and brand new nations emerge with a chance, just a chance, for independence as Eastern and Central Europe come online. Imagine we are able to even e-mail people that we could not even talk to 20 years ago or 40 years ago. What an incredible new moment this is in the history of humankind.  I want to thank all of the Presidents, and there have now been three: President George Bush back in the 1980s, who signed the original authorizing legislation for the memorial; President Bill Clinton, who signed the memorial coins that were minted to pay the costs for the beginning of the memorial's planning; and now, our new President George W. Bush, who has endorsed the construction of this memorial.  President Clinton stood with us as we dedicated the ground. I am sure President George W. Bush will be there when the memorial is finally constructed.  I want to thank the Secretary of Veterans' Affairs, Anthony Principi, for the good words that he spoke this morning in support of this memorial.  So as we think about the importance of this place in American history, let us remember the significance of what these greatest Americans, this greatest generation of Americans, did for the freedom of humankind. Let us build this memorial in a timely way as the 21st century's way of saying thank you to the 20th century and its champions.
