 President, I wish to echo the remarks of my good friend from Arizona, Senator Kyl, about our friend Manny Rossman, who has never worked directly for me, but I say to the Senator from Arizona, he has such a great sense of teamwork that even though Manny was working first for Senator Lott and then for Senator Kyl, you had the feeling that the two offices were sort of a seamless web. The credit for that, in addition to the principal, I think goes to Manny, who had a great sense of the importance of cooperating, working together, making the leader's office and the whip's office really one. His personality, his brilliance, his ability to interact with people is really unsurpassed.  So I join my friend from Arizona and congratulate Manny for his great service to America in the Senate. I know he will have a hugely successful post-Senate career. We are going to miss him, but we wish him well.                          ____________________
