 Speaker, I also want to congratulate the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi) and wish her the very best, but the issue that I want to focus on is a very important piece of legislation which is going to surface tomorrow, and that is the issue of how Congress responds to the huge tax breaks that the President and the Republican leadership have given to the wealthiest 1 percent of the population.  Mr. Speaker, this country has a $6 trillion national debt, and, for the first time now in several years, we are running a deficit.  Mr. Speaker, despite all of the great speeches here about lockboxes and our great love for Social Security, everybody understands that Congress is now dipping into and raiding the Social Security fund.  Further, Mr. Speaker, most people in this country understand that we have many enormous social needs. In my State of Vermont, every week when I go out and speak to senior citizens, they demand of me that Congress do something about the outrageously high cost of prescription drugs and the fact that we do not have a strong prescription drug benefit under Medicare.  Mr. Speaker, what the issue tomorrow is going to be about is do we give huge tax breaks to the wealthiest people in this country? Forty percent of the President's tax breaks go to the wealthiest 1 percent, people who have a minimum income of $370,000 a year and average over $1 million a year in income. So the choice that Congress faces is, do you give huge tax breaks in the future to those people, or do you provide a strong prescription drug benefit under Medicare?  Mr. Speaker, not only is the President and the Republican leadership not going to provide a strong prescription drug benefit under Medicare, in fact in many ways they are going to cut back on Medicare. At a time when we need to strengthen Social Security, at a time that we need to raise the COLA, the President and the Republican leadership are dipping into the Social Security Trust Fund.  Mr. Speaker, let us get our priorities right. I speak to veterans virtually every week in the State of Vermont. We have many town meetings. What they tell me is when they apply for a benefit it takes 6, 7, 8, 10 months for them to get that benefit processed, and the reason is that in many instances the Veterans Administration is understaffed and is unable to process those claims.  Is it more important to give tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires, or is it more important to make sure that our veterans get the benefits to which they are entitled?  Mr. Speaker, just this last week, a couple of days ago, there was a front page story in the New York Times which talked about how middle class parents are finding it harder and harder to pay for the college costs of their kids. The average American young person graduating from a 4-year college ends up $20,000 in debt excluding the debt incurred, and the growing debt incurred, by their parents.  Is it more important to protect the middle class and make sure that the young people of this country can go to the college that they want and do that by significantly expanding Pell grants and other financial aid programs, or is it more important to give tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires, to people who provide huge campaign contributions to Members of this Congress and the White House?  Mr. Speaker, all over this country we are facing a disaster in terms of child care. Working families are unable to find affordable quality child care. We have people who are paying too much and getting too little, and the children are suffering. Yet the Federal commitment to child care is minimal.  Is it more important that we take care of the youngest children in this society and protect working families who want quality child care for their kids, or is it more important that we give huge tax breaks to the wealthy and the powerful?  Mr. Speaker, in my State and all over this country there is a terrible housing crisis.  The bottom line is let us repeal the tax breaks for the richest 1 percent, let us lower the deficit, and let us take care of the middle class of this country.                          ____________________
