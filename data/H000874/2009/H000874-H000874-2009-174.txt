We believe on this side that the committees are some 85 percent in agreement, as you know, the Energy and Commerce Committee, the Education and Labor Committee, and the Ways and Means Committee. As you also know, there are differences between those bills, and we are working on that at this point in time to see how we can make those compatible. The President's comments last night will obviously also be taken into consideration.  So we will bring to the floor a bill that we believe reflects the President's view, our view, and hopefully we would hope the views in part at least of some of the Members on your side of the aisle.  Mr. McCARTHY of California. I thank the gentleman.  Reclaiming my time, I notice you refer to the bill and sometimes another bill, and you have this bill H.R. 3200 done by one side of the aisle, passed three committees. I know last time when President Clinton was in and they took up health care and they produced a bill in Ways and Means, it took 7 weeks of debate. I know this was 48 hours and others were a short time period.  When you refer to that bill, are you referring to H.R. 3200 coming before this body, this House?  I yield to the gentleman.
