In Maryland, we call it a terrapin. Fear the turtle. But today we need to revere the turtle. Sixteen magnificent young women got on a court in Boston, and we had one of the most exciting, well-played basketball games, male or female, in the history of our country.  Madam Speaker, this morning I want to congratulate Coach Brenda Frese and the University of Maryland women's basketball team on winning the championship last night with a stunning 78-75 overtime victory over a valiant Duke University team. This game, Madam Speaker, was a demonstration of college athletics at its best.  The gentlewoman from North Carolina just spoke; our athletic director comes from North Carolina, Debbie Yow, and she recruited Brenda Frese. We thank you for that.  The Terrapins erased a 13-point second half deficit, the second largest in history, and Maryland freshman guard Kristi Toliver hit a three-point shot with 6.1 seconds remaining to send the game into overtime. ``We've played like this all year,'' said Terp Marissa Coleman. ``Nothing gets to us. We never thought we were going to lose this game.'' The Terps' win caps a tremendous 34-4 season and makes Maryland only the fourth college in America whose men's and women's basketball teams have captured national championships.  Madam Speaker, I know that all of us join together to congratulate those 16 young women who showed America what women can do and what an extraordinary athletic event they can provide. Both teams were magnificent. We in Maryland are proud of our victory. But those in North Carolina who come from Duke ought to be proud of their team as well.                          ____________________
