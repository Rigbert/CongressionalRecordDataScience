 President, as Senators return to Washington this week, we do so amidst a crush of troubling news about the economy. In the past week alone, we have learned that home values across the country are still falling at a time when about one out of five homeowners already owes more on their home than that home is worth. Auto sales are down. Manufacturers are showing the weakest growth in nearly 2 years. And there is deep pessimism about the prospects of a recovery anytime soon. So while some in Washington have sought to kind of paper over the economic problems or offer weak assurances that a recovery is right around the corner, millions of Americans continue to suffer with no end in sight, and very few people are confident things will turn around anytime soon. It is no secret why.  For 2\1/2\ years, Democrats in Washington have paid lipservice to the idea of job creation while pursuing an agenda that is radically opposed to it, and the results speak for themselves.
