 President, Senator Craig Thomas was a very good friend. He served in the Senate with great honor and respect for the institution.  I got to know Senator Thomas best through the work of the Finance Committee. Senator Thomas was an active and dedicated participant in the business of the committee from tax policy, to health care, Social Security and international trade. When I was chairman of the committee, I could always count on his diligent, steadfast andvaluable involvement in the issues before us. I appreciated greatly his commitment to conservative principles and the responsibilities of governing.  In particular, as chairman of the Trade Subcommittee, Senator Thomas was a strong voice for opening new markets and opportunities for U.S. exports. He went above and beyond and engaged himself fully in efforts to achieve ambitious outcomes from trade negotiations. He demonstrated his commitment time and again with his own personal time and his personal resolve.  Senator Thomas was a true representative for his Wyoming constituents. He worked hard and sincerely for their good and for the good of our Nation every day. He will be missed so very much. Barbara and I extend our sincere and deep sympathies to his family and his staff.
