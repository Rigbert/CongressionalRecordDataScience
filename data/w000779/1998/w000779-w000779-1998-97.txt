President, I join together with Senator Frist and ten other colleagues today to introduce bipartisan education reform legislation, based on a simple proposition: the federal government should liberate schools from the federal government's mandated bureaucratic water torture in return for schools committing to improve student performance. This bill is an invitation to innovation, an opportunity to develop home grown, locallydriven solutions to Americans biggest education challenges.  This legislation would empower states to get out from under burdensome federal education regulations, by expanding the enormously popular ``Ed-Flex'' demonstration program--in which 12 states already participate--into a nationwide effort. Ed-Flex is the program that allows states to waive out of certain federal regulations if they come up with a plan to show how they can do a better job. A State has to waive their own set of education regulations, develop high academic standards for their students and hold schools accountable for results.  Here is a brief example of how Ed-Flex works: In the past, federal funds have allowed schools to purchase computers for students with disabilities, but the rules prevented others from using the equipment when the students weren't using it. So in an Oregon school district, in return for committing to using the idle computers to improve adult education, the State got a waiver to use the computer for this extra use as well as for the disabled students.  Ohio uses a teacher training program that, without a waiver, can only be used to train teachers in math and science. Ohio wanted to use it where the greatest academic need is. They now have an Ed-Flex waiver and can tailor their teacher training program to the needs of the students, not to the needs of the federal government. In exchange, Ohio will have better prepared teachers in the classroom to help students improve in those areas.  My state also uses Ed-Flex to allow school districts to team up with community colleges to better prepare kids to go into the workforce. Using the Carl Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Act program, Oregon students can earn college credit or learn a practical skill without worrying about whether a credit will transfer or if they have to file several different pieces of paperwork.  And even more kids will be able to benefit if we can expand Ed-Flex to allow school districts to streamline bureaucracies even further and eliminate waste. The bill Senator Frist and I are introducing today will expand Ed-Flex from a pilot program in just a few states to every place from Maine to Honolulu. The bill will also provide a unique opportunity for current Ed-Flex states to experience more flexibility in their adult literacy and educational technology programs.  Let me give you an example of how the new flexibility will benefit my state. According to the National Adult Literacy Survey, Oregon has one of the highest literacy levels in the country. In fact, 75 percent of Oregonians have basic reading skills; that is, they can proficiently read, write and speak in English, whereas 55 percent of all adults in the nation achieved that level. Yet, for Oregonians, less than 100 percent is not good enough. We want all of our adults to have basic literacy skills. Under the Adult Education Act, a State can only use 20 percent of the funds to prepare people to make high school equivalency tests. That may work for a state that has a very low literacy level, but it does not work for Oregon.  Oregon would like to develop a waiver to use the funds to help all illiterate or semi-literate adults earn a GED (general education development) or other high school equivalency measure. The more people with a GED, the more valuable our workforce becomes. Under our Ed-Flex bill, Oregon would be eligible to apply for that waiver.  Mr. President, this bill grows out of the work of the Senate Budget Committee's Education Task Force, which Senator Frist chaired, and on which I served. Together, in hearing after hearing, we listened to States tell us that they can do a better job. They said they could balance flexibility and accountability and they we ready to be judged by results, not process. We know as well that Ed-Flex has strong support from the Administration, and our bill has strong bipartisan support in the Senate and from the National Governors Association.  Oregon was the first state to participate in Ed-Flex, and people in Oregon are convinced that regulatory flexibility and school accountability work. It is time to expand that approach nationwide.                          ____________________
