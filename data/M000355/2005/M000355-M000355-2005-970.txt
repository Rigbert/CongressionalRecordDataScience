 President, for the information of all our colleagues, we will return for business on Monday, July 11, following the Fourth of July recess. Upon our return, we willbegin to work on the Homeland Security appropriations measure. The majority leader has announced that we will be voting that day and, therefore, Senators can expect the next rollcall vote at approximately 5:30 on Monday, July 11. We expect Senators to be available on that day to call up their amendments to the Homeland Security bill, and the 5:30 vote will likely be in relation to one of those amendments.  I wish everyone a safe Fourth of July recess. And we look forward to seeing everyone back here on July 11.                          ____________________[Pages S7943-S7944]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                                PROGRAM  Mr. McCONNELL.
