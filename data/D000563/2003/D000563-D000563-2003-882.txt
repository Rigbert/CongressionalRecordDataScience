President, I want to make this as brief as I can. I commend the Senator from Utah coming to the floor. I would like to ask this question of the Senator from New York.  I think you have taken a reasonable position. Having practiced law for a number of years, as the Senator from Utah did, and I believe the Senator from New York, you know, in the discovery process, when the other side refuses to turn over a document, goes into this long fight, you begin to suspect, on your side of the case, there is something very important in that document.  These documents of Miguel Estrada have become the crux, the center point, of the debate about what this man has said and done and thought as assistant to the Solicitor General in the Department of Justice. So I think the Senator from New York is right in insisting that be part of any compromise ending this deadlock.  I also hope we will insist, on the Democratic side, that if we are going to end this deadlock, we return to the regular order of the Judiciary Committee, that we do not put three controversial nominees on the calendar in the same day, that we do not ignore the blue slips required of each Senator from the State, that we do not violate the rules of the Senate that have been in place for 24 years in relation to debate in the committee.  I think all of those would be a good-faith effort to go back to the regular order and establish some comity and understanding between us, which I hope will guarantee that we will not face this kind of situation in the future.
