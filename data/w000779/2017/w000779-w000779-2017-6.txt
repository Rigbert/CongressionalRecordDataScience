I think we need to tell America about this because we have won this round, but the Senator and I are going to be back at this fight with our colleagues again. In effect, this would have been Citizens United 2.0. This would have been another version of the push to have unaccountable, dark money--billions of dollars poured into elections through churches and sham charities.  Turning to the question now of this evening, it looks to me as though we have now found several other Byrd rule violations that would seem to me to be further indications of rash and reckless legislating that does not serve the American people well.  So I would wrap up by asking my colleague from Vermont--and I want to tell him it has been a pleasure to work in partnership with him on this--aren't these Byrd rule violations that we have been going after and that you are going to discuss again tonight, aren't these just a textbook case of what happens when you legislate with reckless haste?
