 ``Bob'' Williams. Bob hails from Independence, KY, and is a member of our Nation's Greatest Generation. Like so many in that generation, he answered the call of duty and fought valiantly in the Second World War. I rise today to honor his service to this country.  Early on the morning of June 6, 1941, Bob was among the first Allied paratroopers dropped into Normandy as a part of Operation Overlord, on the historic day of D-day. Several hours later, the largest amphibious assault in the history of war would commence. For the time being, however, Bob and his fellow paratroopers fought behind enemy lines, securing the roads and bridges that were vital to the operation's success. You could say that these men constituted the tip of the sharpest sword this Nation has ever thrust into battle.  The airborne soldiers' mission that day was extremely dangerous--simply making it to the battlefield through the barrage of German anti-aircraft fire was a feat in itself--yet Bob displayed remarkable courage under fire. Upon landing, an enemy machine-gunner placed 12 bullet holes in his baggy pants pockets. Undeterred, Bob continued to fight that day, and for 10 more days until he was seriously wounded on June 16.  Since the war's conclusion, Bob has done his part to keep alive the memory of those who served. On the 50th anniversary of the D-day invasion, he joined 18 fellow veterans in re-creating their parachute jump into Normandy. He has also written a book containing his, and other veterans' stories from the war. Most recently, Bob was honored to be inducted into the Kentucky Veterans Hall of Fame in March of this year.  As the Second World War drifts further and further into the past, it becomes increasingly important that we remember the sacrifices made to secure victory. So today, I ask that my U.S. Senate colleagues join me in honoring Robert L. Williams and his service to his country during the great battle to make the world safe for democracy that was World War II.  Mr. President, the Lexington Herald-Leader recently published an article detailing Bob Williams' and other Kentucky World War II veterans' storiesfrom the war. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:            [From the Lexington Herald-Leader, June 5, 2014] Veterans from Lexington, Louisville Areas Mark D-day Anniversary This                                 Weekend                            (By Jim Warren)       On D-day morning, 70 years ago Friday, Winchester's Jonah      Thomas was an Army combat engineer in one of the first      landing craft to hit Omaha Beach.       German shells obliterated the boat almost the instant it      touched the sand.       ``I didn't see anybody else there when we hit the beach, so      maybe they didn't have anybody else to shoot at,'' Thomas      recalled. ``They blew that boat to smithereens.''       A soldier in front of Thomas was struck in the face. Thomas      was covered with his blood.       ``I would have been hit if he hadn't been there,'' Thomas      said. ``There were 44 men crammed in that boat, and hardly      anybody survived.''       Thomas, now 89, was one of the few who did.       He'll be among about 80 veterans from the Lexington and      Louisville areas who are flying to Washington early Friday,      the 70th anniversary of D-day. They'll visit the Korean War      Veterans Memorial, the Iwo Jima Monument, and the National      World War II Memorial before returning Friday evening. A      public welcome is planned at Blue Grass Airport when they      return.       D-day, June 6, 1944, was when roughly 160,000 American,      British and other Allied troops stormed into Nazi-held France      along a 50-mile stretch of beaches in Normandy.       It was one of history's biggest military operations. More      than 5,000 ships and 11,000 planes supported the landings,      which launched the final campaigns that ended World War II in      Europe in May 1945.       Within five days after D-day, more than 300,000 soldiers,      54,000 vehicles and 104,000 tons of supplies had come ashore.       But for the first few hours, the D-day invaders struggled      just to survive a wave of bullets and shells from German      guns. About 12,000 Allied soldiers were killed, wounded or      captured, including roughly 6,000 Americans.       London's Owen Edwards, then 18, was a Navy coxswain,      steering one of the landing boats headed for Omaha. His job--     delivering a 20-man medical team to the beach--looked      impossible.       ``Eighty-eight millimeter shells were hitting so close they      were throwing water into the boat,'' Edwards remembers. ``It      was so intense, that I finally turned the boat toward another      part of the beach where the shelling wasn't as heavy. I      probably wouldn't have made it if I hadn't done that.''       Edwards, now 88, is another veteran who'll be making the      trip to Washington Friday. He eventually landed the medical      team safely on Omaha, one of two runs he made to the beach      that day.       ``It was complete chaos,'' Thomas said. ``There were bodies      everywhere, wrecked equipment, tanks that never made it,      soldiers that drowned going in. It's a miracle that we took      that beach.''       Thomas visited Omaha Beach in 1993, and stood on the spot      where he landed his boat.       ``The beach was so quiet and peaceful then, but I could      visualize what it was like on June 6, 1944,'' he said. ``It      was pretty emotional.''       The French invited Robert L. Williams to visit Normandy for      the 70th D-day anniversary. But Williams, 91, decided to stay      home in Kenton County.       ``I'm getting too old for nine hours on an airplane,'' he      said. ``Besides, I've been there and done that.''       Williams, a 101st Airborne Division paratrooper, had one of      D-day's most dangerous jobs. He was among about 13,000 Allied      paratroopers who parachuted into Normandy to seize and hold      strategic roads and bridges before the invasion.       Williams survived days of heavy fighting in Normandy, but      was seriously wounded on June 16, 1944.       Fifty years later, he helped organize a re-creation of the      original parachute jump for the 50th D-day anniversary on      June 6, 1994. Williams and 18 other original D-day      paratroopers parachuted into Normandy from a World War II era      C-47.       ``The government said, `There's no way we're going to let      you do that, you're all too old,' '' Williams recalls. ``We      did it anyway.''       He says the 1994 jump was one of the most satisfying things      he's ever done.       ``People were beginning to forget about World War II back      then,'' Williams said. ``I think that jump kind of brought it      all back. To me, it was more exciting than D-day.''       The boat carrying Lexington infantryman John A. Palumbo was      blown out of the water 100 yards off Omaha Beach on D-day. It      was his first taste of combat.       Palumbo splashed shore. But a bullet destroyed his BAR      light machine gun and left shrapnel in his right arm.       Eventually, he hooked up with some more experienced      soldiers, helped them get through a minefield, and found      cover on a bluff behind the beach. He never fired a shot on      D-day, but saw much heavy fighting later.       Palumbo, now 93, landed on a sector of Omaha Beach code-     named ``Easy Red.''       ``There was nothing easy about what we went through      there,'' he recalls. ``No one on that beach was rear-echelon.      Everybody was a front-line soldier on D-day. Period.''       Palumbo often says that every day of his life since D-day      has been a bonus, because he didn't expect to survive.       ``I'm glad I went through it,'' he said, ``rather than      having any of my heirs go through it.''       Ray Swafford, now 88, of Manchester, was a sailor on the      minesweeper YMS-247, destroying underwater mines to clear a      safe path for ships taking troops to Normandy.       It was dangerous work. The night before D-day, another      minesweeper hit a mine and exploded.       ``We had to leave the survivors in the water, and that hurt      real bad,'' Swafford remembers.       After clearing mines, Swafford's ship spent D-day guiding      landing craft toward shore, picking up survivors, even trying      to draw German gunfire away from soldiers on the beach. They      also went to assist the destroyer USS Corry, which was      sinking.       But Swafford was most unnerved by German ``E-boats,'' small      fast craft that fired torpedoes.       ``We couldn't shoot back at them because we might hit our      own ships,'' he said. ``Those torpedoes still bother me      today. I really don't like to think about it.''       Swafford isn't going on Friday's Washington trip, but he      said he might mark the 70th anniversary by cooking out with      some friends.       ``The captain of my ship stopped here to visit me once      about 20 years ago,'' Swafford said. ``He asked what I      thought about D-day, and I said, `It seems like a bad dream.'      ''       ``He said, `That's the way it seems to me too.'''                          ____________________
