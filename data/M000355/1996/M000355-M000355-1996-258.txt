 President, twice a year, the Jefferson County Medical Society conducts a mini-internship program to inform and educate those outside the medical professional about the practice of medicine. For 2 days, about 12 to 18 business professionals and government officials are matched up with several Louisville physicians to watch them perform their jobs. Recently, Melissa Patack, a member of my staff, had this unique and worthwhile opportunity. I ask that a summary of her experience be printed in the Record.  The material follows:  Jefferson County Medical Society Mini-Internship--April 16-17, 1996       On April 16 and 17, 1996, I participated in the Jefferson      County Medical Society's Mini-internship program. During the      course of the two days, participants accompanied physicians      in their usual activities and had the opportunity to observe      first-hand the practice of medicine.       On Tuesday morning, I met Dr. Kathryn Cashner, an ob-gyn      with a speciality in high risk pregnancies, at her office to      watch her morning appointments with more than a dozen women.      Dr. Cashner is a sole practitioner, with patients from all      socio-economic backgrounds. About one-quarter to one-third of      her patients receive Medicare benefits. This was a morning of      unusual normalcy, Dr. Cashner remarked. Virtually all of the      women were experiencing normal pregnancies, although several      of the patients were 4 to 6 months into their pregnancies and      seeing Dr. Cashner for the first prenatal visit. Dr. Cashner      counseled one woman who had a negative test result, but who      was immediately sent for a follow-up sonogram which turned      out to be normal. When I left Dr. Cashner at Audubon      Hospital, she was about to perform surgery on one of her      high-risk patients which would enable the patient to carry      her baby to full term. Dr. Cashner's practice brings her into      close contact with the lives of her patients; on one wall of      her office she displays pictures of all the babies she has      brought into the world.       The afternoon brought me to Jewish Hospital to observe Dr.      Thomas O'Daniel, a plastic surgeon, performing a face lift.      Watching directly over his shoulder, I saw Dr. O'Daniel      perform the delicate task of reconstructing a 57 year-old      woman's face. The operation was a grueling, pain-staking      procedure of more than 6 hours. Dr. O'Daniel concentrates on      facial injuries and gets a great deal of satisfaction from      the work he does on children. The next morning, he was      operating to correct a child's clef palate. Last fall, he      traveled to Guatemala, where he and his staff operated on 75      children who suffered from clef palates and other facial      deformities.       In the evening, I went to University Hospital where I      watched Dr. Robert Couch run the night shift of the emergency      room. The evening brought everything from walk-ins seeking      routine medical care to the airlift of two victims from a      head-on automobile crash, probably caused by a driver who had      too much to drink. The residents under Dr. Couch's      supervision were poised for action when the helicopter landed      and two women with broken bones, head injuries and internal      bleeding were wheeled in to Room 9. Within moments, life-     saving actions were taken to get one patient breathing. X-     rays were immediately taken and the young doctors made snap      decisions on the treatment for these endangered patients.      These emergency room doctors don't have on-going      relationships with their patients. They treat and move on to      the next crisis with enormous dedication.       After an exhausting and exhilarating day, I returned the      next morning at 7:15 a.m. to Jewish Hospital to observe Dr.      Laman Gray perform a quadruple coronary bypass on a 67 year-     old man. One stands in sheer amazement at the sight of the      human heart beating in an open chest cavity. When it came      time for Dr. Gray to stitch the new bypass vessels to the      aorta, the heart was stopped and then brought back to its      rhythmic beating when Dr. Gray completed his delicate work.      Dr. Gray had another operation scheduled for the afternoon      and in-between, he was dealing with 2 other emergencies,      including arranging for the airlifting of a heart attack      victim from another state to Jewish Hospital for care and      treatment.       Wednesday afternoon, I accompanied Dr. Cindy Zinner on her      appointments at the Portland Family Clinic, a federally-     sponsored community health center. Dr. Zinner specializes in      internal medicine and pediatrics, and that afternoon, was      working as a pediatrician. The Portland facility fills a      unique role by being accessible not only to those covered by      health insurance (including Medicaid) but also to the working      poor who lack employer-sponsored health insurance, and who do      not qualify for Medicaid. In observing Dr. Zinner treat      several seemingly routine ear infections and perform a number      of well-child examinations, the highly important role for      preventive medicine becomes readily apparent. Dr. Zinner      becomes a positive force in the lives of these struggling      families.       These doctors, the residents, nurses and other assistants      with whom they work are dedicated to the care and treatment      of individuals from every part of our society. Each of the      doctors has chosen a very different career in medicine, but      all are devoted to the good health and life of the people      they treat. My experience was a significant educational      opportunity and I was privileged to watch these men and women      perform their work.                          ____________________
