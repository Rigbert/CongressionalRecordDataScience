President, I might also reflect on that victory 50 years ago and think about another civil rights milestone that we have an opportunity to act on this week--this week--in Washington.  Two weeks ago, the Judiciary Committee favorably reported the nomination of Loretta Lynch to the full Senate. If confirmed by the Senate, Ms. Lynch will become the first African-American woman to serve as Attorney General of the United States.  In January, she gave moving testimony to the committee about sitting on her father's shoulders as a young girl so she could witness civil rights activists planning sit-ins and marches in the early 1960s.  Ms. Lynch is incredible. She is so well qualified that in the course of 2 days of hearings, there was virtually no negative question asked of her. She handled it so well.  She has now waited 121 days for confirmation by the Senate. Loretta Lynch has waited longer than any nominee for Attorney General in the last 30 years. She languishes on the calendar. It is embarrassing to think that after all of the speeches and all of the reflection of this last weekend on the progress we have made in civil rights in America, this woman, whose nomination in and of itself is a civil rights victory, is being held up in the Senate for no obvious reason.  As Congressman Lewis said in a recent letter to the Judiciary Committee, Ms. Lynch ``recognizes the value of all people and has fought vigorously to ensure their equal protection under the law.'' John Lewis said: ``She will carry the torch of justice to help make the United States a more perfect union.''  Mr. President, we are not a perfect union. We will strive throughout our history to reach that almost impossible goal.
