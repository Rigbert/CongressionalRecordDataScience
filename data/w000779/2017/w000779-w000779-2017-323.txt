 I wish to turn to the issue of misleading testimony. What remains unresolved are major inconsistencies between Congressman Price's testimony to the Finance Committee, statements by Congressman Collins, and statements by Innate's CEO Simon Wilkinson published last week in the Wall Street Journal.  Simply put, Innate's chief executive and Congressman Collins, the company's top shareholder, provided one version of events to one of the world's most respected newspapers. Congressman Price provided a different version of events to the Finance Committee and the Health committee. These inconsistencies are among the reasons that Democrats boycotted last week's Finance Committee markup. The Senate has an obligation to know the truth about these transactions in order to protect the integrity of this body and its constitutional duty to consider executive branch nominees.  Now, with respect to exclusivity of the sale, Congressman Price told the Finance Committee that the August sale was available to all Innate shareholders, which contradicts what Innate's management told the Wall Street Journal. Congressman Price was definitive in his response to my question during the hearing.  Reading back the transcript, I said: ``Well, you purchased stock in an Australian company through private offerings at discounts not available to the public.''  Here is Congressman Price's response: ``Well, if I may, those--they were available to every single individual that was an investor at the time.''  That is not what Innate executives told the Wall Street Journal. Here is an extended passage from the Wall Street Journal:       Rep. Tom Price got a privileged offer to buy a biomedical      stock at a discount, the company's officials said, contrary      to his congressional testimony this month. . . .       The cabinet nominee is one of fewer than 20 U.S. investors      who were invited last year to buy discounted shares of the      company--an opportunity that, for Mr. Price, arose from an      invitation from a company director and fellow Congressman. .      . .       At Mr. Collins' invitation, Mr. Price in June ordered      shares discounted in the private placement at 18 cents      apiece, and then more in July at 26 cents a share, Mr.      Collins said in an interview. Those orders went through in      August, after board approval. Mr. Price invested between      $50,000 and $100,000 according to his disclosure form. . . .       Mr. Wilkinson said investors who had bought in a previous      private placement were called to ``make friends and family      aware of the opportunity. . . . We are always looking to      increase our shareholder base. But those new parties have to      meet the definition of sophisticated financial investor.''      Only six U.S. investors, including Mr. Price, fell into the      friends-and-family category, Mr. Collins said. About 10 more      U.S. investors were offered discounted shares by the company      because they previously had been invited to partake in      private placement offerings.  In other words, Congressman Price not only got a deal that wasn't publicly available, he was in a special group of six investors in a special category called ``friends-and-family,'' whereas other American investors got in on the private deal because they previously participated in the company's private placements. Congressman Price bypassed that requirement. He got in as what could only be called a special guest--a ``friends-and-family'' guest of his House colleague, Congressman Collins.  As I mentioned earlier, when I asked the company how Congressman Price was able to get this special status, the company refused to provide an explanation. The Wall Street Journal also reported a key distinction between U.S. investors and the company's shareholders in Australia and New Zealand. The paper reported:       The discounted stock offered in Innate Immuno, as the      company is known, was made to all shareholders in Australia      and New Zealand--but not in the United States, according to      Mr. Collins and confirmed in a separate interview with Innate      Immuno CEO Simon Wilkinson.  The Wall Street Journal's account is supported by company documents, specifically a ``Rights Issue Booklet'' that Innate published on June 10, 2016. The booklet noted that the shareholders would buy one new share for every nine shares they already own. The booklet noted that the shareholders would have ``the option to pay for their new shares in either Australian dollars or New Zealand dollars.'' The booklet goes on to describe the private stock sale in which Congressman Price participated. I will read briefly from the book:       In conjunction with this rights issue, Innate announced      that it also completed a private placement at an issue price      of U.S. 18 cents, raising U.S. $1.8 million.  The booklet states clearly that the private placement was announced on the June 10, 2016, the same day Innate announced the rights issue for investors in Australia and in New Zealand.  Our staff has reviewed all of the company's publicly available documents and found no similar advertisements for the private placement to American investors. So this paper trail pokes more holes in Congressman Price's argument that the private stock sale was open to all the company investors.  First off, the company didn't announce the existence of the private sale until after it already had been completed. So unless an investor was on the company's short list of go-to people, they were just excluded.  Second, the company's documents clearly show that Congressman Price and other participants in the private stock sale were able to buy far more discounted shares than the company's typical investors. Innate documents showed that the company restricted the number of shares the typical investor could buy in the rights issue to just one new share for every nine they already owned. No such limit appears to have been imposed on Congressman Price and the other American participants in the private stock sale. In fact, Congressman Price owned just over 60,000 shares at the time of the sale. His participation in the private stock sales allowed Congressman Price to buy 400,000 more shares. If Congressman Price had been held to the same rules as everyday investors, he would have been restricted to buying less than 7,000 shares.  The bottom line to me is what Congressman Price said was untrue. The deal Congressman Price got was not open to every other shareholder. And again, when I sent a letter last week to the Innate CEO, asking him to explain all of this, he declined. He told my staff that as an Australian firm, the company had no obligation to cooperate.  So to recap, Congressman Price told the Finance Committee and the Health Committee that the stock sales he participated in were open to all shareholders. That is not true. The private sale does not appear to have been widely marketed to American investors and was certainly not advertised in the company's public documents. The private sale reportedly included less than 20 American investors. Congressman Price was part of an even smaller subgroup known as friends and family, invited by other investors--in this case, by his House colleague, Congressman Collins. How many people were eligible to be in the friends and family group? Just six.  That brings me to the next issue, which is, How did Congressman Price learn about the special sale in the first place? Congressman Price told the Finance Committee his conversations with Congressman Collins had no influence on his investment decisions.  I am going to again quote from his written response to questions for the record asking Congressman Price to describe the communications with Congressman Collins regarding Innate. Congressman Price said:       I had a conversation with Representative Collins in the      fall of 2014 that brought Innate as a company to my      attention. The nature of the conversation did not, however,      influence my decision to invest in the company in either 2015      or 2016. I believe I had subsequent general communications      with Representative Collins regarding Innate. I do not have a      specific recollection of when those conversations occurred or      their substance. Any such communications did not impact my      investment decisions, however, because my     purchases of Innate were based solely on my own research.  I am going to quote again from the Wall Street Journal:       Mr. Price got in on the discounted sale after Mr. Collins      filled him in on the company's drug trial, according to Mr.      Collins. Mr. Collins said he told Mr. Price of the additional      private placement. He said Mr. Price asked if he could      participate in it. ``Could you have someone send me the      documents,'' Mr. Collins recalled Mr. Price asking him.      Congressman Price wants us to believe that Congressman      Collins had no influence on the decision to buy Innate stock.      But Congressman Price would not have known about the company      in the first place if he hadn't talked to Congressman      Collins, and he wouldn't have known about the private      placements without hearing about them from Congressman      Collins.  Congressman Price characterizes his conversation with Congressman Collins in 2015 and 2016 as being general in nature. But again, according to the Wall Street Journal, Congressman Collins, one, told Congressman Price about the upcoming drug trial; two, alerted him to the private stock sale; and three, arranged to ensure that he could participate. To me, this seems like more than ``subsequent general communications with Congressman Collins regarding Innate'' as Congressman Price put it in his written response to the committee.  With respect to reporting to the committee and the Office of Government Ethics, I would just say that I think I described issues--ethical issues--that are serious enough on their own. However, it took no small amount of effort to unravel Congressman Price's holdings in the company because he failed to fully disclose them to Federal ethics officials, the American people, and the Finance Committee. I don't believe this issue would have ever come to light if it were not for the work of the committee's minority investigations team.  On February 7, 2 days ago, Congressman Price sent a letter to the independent Federal ethics officials at the Office of Government Ethics that amended his original public ethics disclosure. This letter confirmed the suspicions of Finance Committee Democrats that Congressman Price's original ethics disclosure to the public understated the value of his Innate stock holding by roughly a quarter of a million dollars. Put another way, his stake in Innate was more than five times the figure initially reported to the American people.  Congressman Price's original disclosure reported that he owned less than $50,000 in Innate stock. At the time the disclosure was filed, by my calculation, his shares had a value of more than $250,000. Today his stake is valued at more than $300,000. Quite simply, it appears the shares he bought in the private stock sale in 2016 were excluded entirely from the Congressman's financial disclosure to the Office of Government Ethics. And because it is the Office of Government Ethics disclosure that is posted on a public Web site so the public can see the investment ties and investments the President's nominees hold, the American people, too, were kept in the dark about how much stock Congressman Price held in this company.  In addition, the Congressman was also less than forthcoming in his disclosure of the value of Innate holdings to the Finance Committee. In his response to the committee questionnaire, Congressman Price valued Innate stock he bought in the private sale between $50,000 to $100,000. However, that amount was based on the $84,000 discounted price the Congressman paid to buy his stocks in the August private stock sale. It was not based on the actual value of the stock on the Australian stock exchange--the true value of his holdings.  By December, when he made his disclosure to the Finance Committee, the stock price had nearly tripled and the shares he bought in those private sales were worth nearly $230,000. In other words, he told the committee that his private purchases were less than half the value they really were.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following items be printed in the Record: a memo from Finance Committee Staff to the Finance Committee, dated January 23 of this year, and a letter from Congressman Price to the Office of Government Ethics dated February 7, 2017, amending his public ethics disclosure.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                Memorandum for Finance Committee Members     From: Senate Finance Committee Staff     Date: January 23, 2017     Re: Nomination of Dr. Thomas E. Price       This memo describes the Senate Finance Committee staff      review of the 2013, 2014, and 2015 tax returns, and other      documentation of Dr. Thomas E. Price in connection with his      nomination to be the Secretary of the Department of Health      and Human Services (HHS).                               Background       Finance Committee staff conducted a review of Dr. Price's      Senate Finance Committee (Committee) Questionnaire, tax      returns for 2013, 2014, and 2015, and financial disclosure      statements. As part of this review, a due diligence meeting      was held with the nominee and his legal representation on      January 16, 2017. His accountant participated via telephone.      In addition to the due diligence meeting, staff submitted      multiple rounds of written questions to the nominee.       At the conclusion of this process, three issues have been      identified that have been deemed appropriate to bring to the      attention of Committee Members. Senate Finance Committee Questionnaire--Ethics Investigation and Late                      Property Tax Payments Omitted       All nominees referred to the Committee are required to      submit the Senate Finance Committee Statement of Information      Requested of Nominee (``Questionnaire'').       Part D. Legal and Other Matters, Question 1, asks nominees:      ``Have you ever been the subject of a complaint or been      investigated, disciplined, or otherwise cited for a breach of      ethics for unprofessional conduct before any court,      administrative agency, professional association, disciplinary      committee, or other professional group?''       In his response, submitted December 21, 2017, Dr. Price      responded, ``No.'' However, in 2010, the Office of      Congressional Ethics (OCE), an independent office of the      House of Representatives, conducted an investigation into Dr.      Price's 2009 fundraising activities. OCE voted 4-0-1 to refer      the case to the House Ethics Committee, which, after      conducting a second investigation, ultimately found no      wrongdoing in 2011.       In written questions submitted to Dr. Price on January 6,      2017, Committee staff requested an explanation for the      omission of the ethics investigation. Dr. Price stated it was      an inadvertent omission and that the majority of activities      investigated related to his authorized campaign committee,      rather than him personally. The information pertaining to      this investigation has been and continues to be available on      the webpage of the House Ethics Committee.       Part F. Financial Data, Question 10, asks nominees: ``Have      you paid all Federal, State, local, and other taxes when due      for each of the past 10 years?'' Dr. Price responded,      ``Yes.'' However, upon examining Washington, D.C. and      Nashville, Tennessee real estate tax records, Committee staff      determined late tax payments had been made in relation to      rental properties owned by Dr. Price, totaling $1,583.45 for      late payments made over the past seven years.       In written questions submitted to Dr. Price on January 6,      2017, Committee staff requested an explanation for the      omission of the late tax payments. Dr. Price stated that,      regarding the DC property, he believed that ``late fees and      penalties derived from not receiving timely property tax      notices.'' Regarding the Tennessee property, the nominee      noted that ``notices regarding property taxes for this rental      property . . . were either not being received or being      wrongly mailed to the tenant at the property and not reaching      the nominee and his spouse.''   Depreciation of Land Value and Miscellaneous Employment Deductions       Committee staff received 2013, 2014, and 2015 tax returns      from Dr. Price on December 21, 2016. In addition to the      written questions submitted on December 28, 2016 and January      6, 2017, Committee staff spoke with Dr. Price's accountant on      January 9, 2017. Following the due diligence meeting with Dr.      Price, Committee staff then submitted an additional round of      written questions to the nominee on January 16, 2017.     Improper Inclusion of Land Value in Depreciation Calculations       Taxpayers who own rental property are generally allowed to      deduct depreciation expenses associated with the wear and      tear of those buildings. Taxpayers are not, however, allowed      to include the value of land in the depreciable amount.       Dr. Price owns rental condominiums in Washington, D.C. and      Nashville, Tennessee, and claimed depreciation expenses      associated with those properties for years 2013, 2014, and      2015. It appears these values included depreciation for the      value of the land. According to property tax records, the      land value of Washington, D.C. condominium was listed as      $95,640, and the land value of his Nashville condominium was      listed as $30,000.       Under current tax rules, these values are not allowable for      depreciation expenses. Committee staff asked for      clarification on this issue in the due diligence meeting with      Dr. Price and sent written follow-up questions on January 16,      2017.       In his response to the Committee, received on January 23,      2017, Dr. Price's accountant     stated he had taken the position that the land had a fair      market value of zero. However, given the lack of another      valuation besides the property tax assessments, Dr. Price has      committed to address the discrepancy by filing a Form 3115 to      adjust the depreciation and account for the improper      deductions on his 2016 tax returns, though adjustments may be      spread out over four years.     Absence of Documentation of Employment Deductions       In 2013, 2014, and 2015, Dr. Price claimed miscellaneous      employment deductions, totaling $19,034. Dr. Price, and his      wife, also a medical doctor, both list their occupations as      ``PHYSICIAN'' on the second page of their Form 1040s. Neither      Dr. Price nor his wife actively works as a physician, though      Dr. Price has noted he has maintained his medical license.      Committee staff requested substantiation and further      explanation of the deductions in written questions submitted      December 28, 2016.       Committee staff spoke with Dr. Price's accountant on this      matter on January 9, 2017, and again during the due diligence      meeting on January 16, 2017. In those discussions, Dr.      Price's accountant noted that Dr. Price and his wife,      Elizabeth, would compile a variety of expenses, including      vehicle expenses, and discuss with the accountant what      portion of those expenses would be appropriate to deduct as      employment expenses, frequently settling on an amount equal      to roughly 60 percent. Though the Prices no longer actively      work as physicians, their accountant believed that the      deductions were appropriate, and were reflective of expenses      incurred by Mrs. Price. After the January 16, 2017, due      diligence meeting, staff suggested that in the absence of      full documentation of the deductions, that the returns be      amended.       In a response, received January 23, 2017, Dr. Price's      accountant noted that proper documentation could not be      located. Dr. Price's 2013, 2014, and 2015 tax returns will be      amended to remove the $19,034 of deductions. Since Dr. Price      was subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) in each of      those years, the changes will not result in any change to tax      liability.                              Asset Values       In separate financial disclosure filings to the House of      Representatives, to the Committee, and to the public through      the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) Form 278, the nominee      reported ownership of stock in an Australian pharmaceutical      company--Innate Immunotherapeutics Ltd. The nominee purchased      these shares in two tranches: one in 2015 valued at $10,000      at the time of purchase, but was valued at between $15,000      and $50,000 on December 20, 2016, the date of filing. A      second tranche was purchased in August 2016 of 400,613      shares, through a private placement offering, and was listed      on the Committee questionnaire as being valued between      $50,000 to $100,000, which was based upon the purchase price.      An analysis done by multiplying the number of shares by the      market price on December 20, 2016 demonstrates a value higher      than that reported by the nominee. The nominee noted that the      amounts reported to the Committee were a good faith      valuation. The nominee agreed to recalculate the value of the      shares based on the market value at the time the Committee      Questionnaire was completed. The revised value of the second      tranche was between $100,000 and $250,000 when filed.       The nominee and Committee staff also agreed that the      tranche of shares acquired in August 2016 was not accounted      for on the OGE Form 278, and the nominee told staff that      income attributable to his holding in the company reported on      OGE Form 278 was incorrect. The nominee noted that it is      unclear how information related to his holding in this stock      was misstated on the published form. The nominee agreed to      contact OGE to correct the form.                                  ____                                                   February 7, 2017.     Ms. Elizabeth J.

If I have a managed account or otherwise use the services      of an investment professional during my appointment, I will      ensure that the account manager or investment professional      obtains my prior approval on a case-by-case basis for the      purchase of any assets other than cash, cash equivalents,      investment funds that qualify for the exemption at 5 C.F.R.      Sec. 2640.201(a), obligations of the United States, or      municipal bonds.       I understand that as an appointee I will be required to      sign the Ethics Pledge (Exec. Order no. 13770) and that I      will be bound by the requirements and restrictions therein in      addition to the commitments I made in the ethics agreement I      signed on January 11, 2017.       I have been advised that this supplement to my ethics      agreement will be posted publicly, consistent with 5 U.S.C.      Sec. 552, on the website of the U.S. Office of Government      Ethics with ethics agreements of other Presidential nominees      who file public financial disclosure reports. I understand      that this letter will also be released as an attachment to my      public financial disclosure report.           Sincerely,                                             Thomas E. Price, M.D.
