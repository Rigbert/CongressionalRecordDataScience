This is a high-stakes gamble with America's future. This trifecta is going to have many more American losers than winners. This is the worst special interest bill I have seen in my time in Congress.  This will not bring prosperity to America's families. This will bring deeper debt to our Nation at a time when we don't need it. This is the first President in the history of the United States to call for cutting taxes in the midst of a war, asking sacrifice from soldiers and their families and turning around to the wealthiest in America and saying: We are going to give you a tax cut. That is an outrage.  I hope my colleagues will join me in opposing this trifecta. Don't buy a ticket on this race, because it is a loser.
