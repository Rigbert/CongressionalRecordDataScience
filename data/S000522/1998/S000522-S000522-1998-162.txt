Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 15 seconds to very briefly respond.  A large number of national and international religious groups support this legislation, including the B'nai B'rith, National Association of Evangelicals, the U.S. Catholic Bishops' Conference, the Anti-Defamation League, the Southern Baptist Convention on Ethics and Religious Liberty, the National Jewish Coalition, the International Campaign for Tibet, the Religious Action Center for Reformed Judaism, the Union of Orthodox Congregations of America, Campus Crusade for Christ, the Seventh Day Adventist Church, the Salvation Army, National Religious Broadcasters, and I can go on and on. But large numbers of religious bodies wholeheartedly embrace this legislation.
