Speaker, if the gentleman will continue to yield, the bill was introduced yesterday. It was jointly referred to the Committee on the Judiciary and the Committee on Financial Services.  The leadership and I made a decision, together with the gentleman from Ohio (Chairman Oxley) and the gentleman from Louisiana (Chairman Tauzin), that it is really important that the bill be passed quickly, given the volatility in the stock market. Hopefully, we can provide some assurance that corporate wrongdoers will go to jail for a very long time, and this bill does that.
