Speaker, the gentleman has raised several issues. This bill opens the door even wider to privatization. The original House and Senate bills prohibited privatization. This bill does not. The President has determined that air traffic control is not an inherently governmental function. They want to contract it out. They want to make it into private for profit.  And on the so-called operational areas, guess what. They are voluntarily reported. And of the 219 contract towers, only eight of them voluntarily reported an error. To say they had a very low error rate, the GAO determined, the IG determined that this was not a valid study, because we do not have mandatory reporting. We do not know whether there were errors or not. We cannot say they are 4\1/2\ times safer.  And to say that we did this because of contributions is outrageous, and I should have had the gentleman's words taken down.
