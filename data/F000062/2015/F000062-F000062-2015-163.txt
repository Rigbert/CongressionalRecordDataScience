 President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for such time as I may consume.  As Senator Klobuchar stated, I come to the floor to speak on the sex trafficking bill. I know it is now held up by certain language, which I will go into in the details of my remarks, but briefly, I would like to begin by describing the bill's highlights. The bill clarifies that a person who buys a sex act from a minor or other trafficking victim can be prosecuted under the Federal commercial sex trafficking statute. The bill authorizes block grants for State and local governments to develop programs to rescue trafficking victims and investigate and prosecute traffickers. The bill also includes nearly all of the provisions from the Combat Human Trafficking Act which Senator Portman and I introduced in January.  I am very grateful to the authors--Senator Klobuchar, Senator Cornyn--for adding these. Those provisions establish a minimum period of 5 years of supervised release for a person who conspires to violate the commercial sex trafficking statute.  It would require the Justice Department to train on investigating and prosecuting buyers, on seeking restitution, and on connecting victims with health services. It would require reporting on sex trafficking prosecutions. It would expand wiretap authority to cover all human trafficking offenses. It would expand the rights of crime victims--something I have been interested in since Senator Kyl and I did the Crime Victims' Bill of Rights.  The bill, which is not controversial, should pass, except for the surreptitious inclusion--I use this word considered--of a provision that is known as the Hyde amendment. The provision was not included by language but by cross-reference to provisions in another previously enacted appropriations bill.  Here is what it says:       Limitations. Amounts in the Fund, or otherwise transferred      from the Fund, shall be subject to the limitations on the use      or expending of amounts described in sections 506 and 507 of      division H of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014      (Public Law 113-76; 128 Stat. 409) to the same extent as if      amounts in the Fund were funds appropriated under division H      of such Act.  This provision was not included in the bill Senator Cornyn introduced last Congress, which I cosponsored. His staff approached my staff and staffs of other Senators early in 2015. They asked if I would cosponsor again. My staff asked whether the bill was identical to last year's bill and for an explanation of any changes that weremade. Senator Cornyn's staff then sent back an email with a list of changes--seven changes in all. That list did not include the Hyde amendment language that had been added. That language was not mentioned to my staff at any point.  In other words, an important and sensitive change was made to the bill and was not disclosed upon request. That does not excuse us for not catching this, but if you see the complicated and sort of obfuscated nature of this--I am not saying it is intended obfuscation, but all of the numbers that are in there--I think it makes it understandable.  If the Hyde amendment--which is what this is--if that language comes out, this bill will pass easily.  Let me address for a moment the enormous problem we are trying to address with this bill. Today, high demand and easy access fuels a huge amount of sex trafficking. Human trafficking today is the second largest criminal industry in the world. It is only behind illegal drugs.  In 2005, human trafficking was a $32 billion criminal enterprise. Today, some 9 years later, it is a $150 billion estimate of illegal gains. Two-thirds of the proceeds from human trafficking come from sex trafficking.  Children as young as 12, 13, and 14 can be found on the street or over the Internet. It is not an exaggeration to say that this is modern-day slavery. Those victims are moved against their will to cities throughout the country and even to other countries, wherever demand is high.  Trafficking rings are also run by gangs. In San Diego, for example, profits are so great and the risk of being caught so minimal that rival gangs do not fight each other over sex trafficking, as they do when drugs are involved.  Some traffickers make as much as $33,000 per week. These are numbers gathered by the Urban Institute: Atlanta, gross take per trafficker per week, $32,833; Denver, $31,200; Seattle, $18,000; Miami, $17,741; Dallas, $12,025; Washington, DC, $11,588; and San Diego, $11,129. This is weekly gross cash intake per individual trafficker.  Traffickers lure victims through promises of love and money or sometimes use an older trafficked girl as a recruiter. Those criminals prey on the most vulnerable children in our society, including those who are homeless or in the foster care system. They target children who have been victims of sexual abuse. Once they have a victim under their control, they may traffic him or her from city to city based on demand.  For example, this is a slide of California. It is from the Orange County Human Trafficking Task Force, and it shows the route traffickers take to move victims around the State of California to meet demand. You can see these circles from Oakland to Sacramento and then down into the Inland Empire and then from Los Angeles all the way around into the Inland Empire. So you can actually track various routes. Orange County did this. The orange center here is meant to be Orange County.  This particular task force is comprised of a number of Federal and local law enforcement agencies in Orange County, including Anaheim and Huntington Beach police departments, the U.S. Attorney's Office, the FBI, and the District Attorney's Office.  Now, here it comes: Regardless of how children are first trafficked, one thing is almost universal--victims will be advertised on the Internet. By one estimate, 76 percent of child sex trafficking victims--76 percent of them are sold over the Internet.  My staff and I have spoken with a number of law enforcement officials in California about the Internet's role in connecting sellers of underage children with buyers. Nearly every single official we spoke with said the Internet is the primary means to connect sellers with buyers. So this is where we next must take decisive steps to stop sex trafficking. Purveyors of these online ads must be held accountable. Senator Kirk and I have an amendment that will do that.  There are at least 19 distinct Web sites that accept ads relating to trafficking underage boys and girls. Here they are: Backpage.com; EscortAds.xxx; ErosAds.com; EscortsInCollege.com; AsianEscortSF.com; EscortsInThe.us; LiveEscortReviews.com; MyProviderGuide.com; EroticMugShots.com; NaughtyReviews.com; EscortPhoneList.com; RubAds.com; Eros.com; TheEroticReview.com; RubMaps.com; APerfectSin.com; EscortDater.com; MyRedBook.com; and NightShift.com. Nineteen Web sites act as purveyors of child sex trafficking in this country. They ought to be ashamed of themselves.  This site I am going to show you, Backpage.com, allows a purveyor to post an advertisement for an escort or a body rub. In fact, nearly all of these ads are for commercial sex acts; many of them depict minors. When you view an ad for an escort or a body rub, you will see pictures of young girls, often with few or no clothes on.  Now I am going to show you two girls. The first is a missing 17-year-old girl. She is here as a runaway. This is a listing of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, a very legitimate organization which I am fully in support of. It is entitled ``Endangered Runaway,'' and it is information about her, her date of birth, her age, her sex, her race, and all of it, and where you can get in touch if you have any information.  I wish to show how this is also used. This is the same girl on Backpage, and this essentially says:       Hello Texas,       Are you looking for an unforgettable experience? Look no      further!       I am 100% Great service provider!       I am very down to earth, warm, sensitive, passionate,       and genuinely interested in giving you a great experience.  And it goes on and on.  This is the same picture of this same girl.  We blocked out the image, and it is shocking. It is simply shocking that this is going on to the extent it is in our country, right in a ribald way on the Internet.  Law enforcement officials and anti-trafficking organizations say there are a number of key indicators that allow them to identify ads that are likely for trafficking victims.  In this advertisement we see three of those key indicators. First, the title states the victim is ``New to your City.'' Anti-trafficking organizations say this is code for being underage. You may also see girls in ads described as ``new,'' ``fresh,'' or ``new in town'' to indicate they are underage. Second, we see a victim is listed from outside the area. Here she is listed as from Miami for a posting that is in the Houston area.  Third, the victim also has an out-of-area phone number.  Those are three indicators of what this ad is for--to sell sex with children. Law enforcement and experts confirm this point.  The Cook County Sheriff's Office in Illinois found that 100 percent of women claiming to be massage therapists or platonic escorts on one Web site, Backpage, were being sold for sex. This isn't mine, this is the Cook County Sheriff's Office.  The sheriff's office set up so-called dates with 618 girls via Backpage. All 618 agreed to provide sex for money.  The sheriff's office concluded: ``This presents irrefutable evidence that Backpage is indeed a haven for pimps and sex solicitors who are victimizing women and girls for their own gain. Any notion that Backpage employs a legitimate business model simply does not stand up to the facts.''  This is a direct letter from Sheriff Tom Dart, Cook County, IL.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a memorandum to Sheriff Tom Dart.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                Cook County Sheriff's Office Memorandum     Date: 6/9/2014.     To: Sheriff Thomas J. Dart.     From: Deputy Chief Michael Anton, Cook County Sheriff's          Police.     Subject: Backpage.com Arrests.       Per Sheriff Dart's direction, the Cook County Sheriff's      Police Vice Unit has utilized Backpage.com as its primary      forum for recovering victims of human trafficking in Cook      County. Please find our year-to-year Backpage arrest      statistics       Cook County Sheriff's Police Arrests Off of Backpage:       2009: 142       2010: 108       2011: 63       2012: 121       2013: 135       2014 (through the end of May): 49       Total: 618       Additionally, the Cook County Sheriff's Police Vice Unit      has made 42 arrests for Involuntary Servitude, Human      Trafficking or Prostitution since 2007, with many of those      investigations originating from responses to Backpage ads.       It is important to note that 100% of the women claiming to      be massage therapists or platonic escorts on Backpage have      accepted the offer of money for sex from our undercover male      officers. Our team has set up ``dates'' with 618 via this      website--all 618 have turned out to be prostitutes. This      presents irrefutable evidence that Backpage is indeed a haven      for pimps and sex solicitors who are victimizing women and      girls for their own gain. Any notion that Backpage employs a      legitimate business model simply does not stand up to the      facts.
