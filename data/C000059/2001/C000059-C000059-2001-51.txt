Speaker, my congressional district in Riverside, California is extremely fortunate to have a dynamic and dedicated group of community volunteers who willingly and unselfishly give of their time and talents to ensure the well-being of our city and county. These individuals work tirelessly to enrich and brighten the lives of so many at Riverside Community Hospital. It is my distinct pleasure to honor and commend the Auxiliary of Riverside Community Hospital today as they celebrate their 75th Anniversary on April 28th.  Volunteers of the Auxiliary of Riverside Community Hospital have donated millions of hours of service to the hospital and the community over the last 75 years. Fund-raising before 1997 helped to significantly improve services at the hospital. And since then, the Auxiliary has raised $50,000 for defibrillators for the Riverside City Fire Department, $75,000 for a mobile health vehicle to deliver free health services throughout the riverside area, and most recently $50,000 for dental equipment and $25,000 for health educational materials for the Eastside Health Center. The Auxiliary volunteers also raise funds for educational scholarships and seminars.  Volunteers of the Auxiliary give over 60,000 volunteer service hours a year to the riverside Community Hospital in addition to all of their community work. Services that Auxiliary volunteers perform to augment the quality of health care at the hospital include: Discharging patients, clerical work, visiting patients, information desk, messenger service, maternity tea, lobby host and much more.  As we approach National Volunteer Week, from April 21 to April 28, it is fitting that we thank the Auxiliary volunteers for their dedication and service to better the lives committed to Riverside Community Hospital's care and the enriched atmosphere that their presence creates. 2001's designation as International Year of Volunteers also reminds us that the men, women and youth across our nation who volunteer deserve recognition and thanks for giving back to their local community, state and nation.  Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the Auxiliary of Riverside Community Hospital on its 75th anniversary and commend its local community and city service.                          ____________________
