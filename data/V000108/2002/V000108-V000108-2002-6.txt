Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding me this time, and if I could ask my colleague from Illinois (Mr. Weller), my good friend, a question before I begin my remarks, I would appreciate that opportunity.  At the end of most of my colleagues' comments, the gentleman from Illinois has pointed out his assertion as to how many couples, working families, et al would be benefited. I am from the first district in Indiana. I thought perhaps we could begin my discussion with those figures now instead of ending with those.
