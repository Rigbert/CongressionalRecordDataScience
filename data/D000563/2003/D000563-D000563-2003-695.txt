Is it not a fact that we are only a few years away from the baby boom generation showing up for Social Security? Isn't it the height of irresponsibility for us to be dragging this Nation deeper in deficit at the expense of the Social Security trust fund when we know that parents and grandparents are going to be asking for the Social Security benefits which they paid for a lifetime? Isn't the same true when it comes to Medicare, that these same senior citizens will need Medicare to make sure they are healthy, independent, and lead strong lives as long as possible, and what we are doing is jeopardizing Social Security and Medicare to provide tax breaks for the elite investors in America?  How in the world can you rationalize that once we have a promise to a generation that has paid for over 40 years into Social Security? I wonder if the Senator from Nevada can remember when President George W. Bush came to us with his first tax cut, he said: This should be easy. We are going to have a surplus over the next 10 years of $5.6 trillion. For goodness' sake, you do not need the money in Washington to waste on programs. Send it back home to the families so they do not have to pay taxes.  A lot of people were enthralled by this message. I was not. Neither was the Senator from Nevada. Today, is it not a fact, I ask the Senator from Nevada, that same projection over 10 years has gone from the President's $5.6 trillion surplus to a $1.8 trillion deficit and that this bill will make the deficit even worse over the next 10 years?
