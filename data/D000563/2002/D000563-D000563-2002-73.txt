KENNEDY. I will yield, but first I will be glad to continue with my friend if he is interested in trying to get the legislation passed. We have not heard what the Senator is for. We know what he is against. He is against this bill. If the Senator is saying he is for an extension on it, we are more than glad to try and work and see if something can be achieved, if that is what the position is. If the Senator's position is in opposition and continues to be in opposition, then we are going to continue to press him. If his position is, yes, I will support--would the Senator support the extension of the Thomas bill?
