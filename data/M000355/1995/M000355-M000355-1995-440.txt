 President, I want to make it clear it is not the view of this Senator that this vote on the second-degree amendment I have offered is in any way condoning of the use of frequent flier miles for private use--private use of frequent flier miles acquired as a result of Government travel. That is certainly not my view. It is not the view of the Senate. And the vote on the amendment I offered will be solely on the issue of whether or not the Senate ought to be making rules for the House. That is my view. I guess reasonable people can differ about that.  But in no way could a vote for the second-degree amendment I have offered be construed as condoning the policy that the Senate does not have. We have not had this for quite some time. So I personally certainly do not support the use of frequent flier miles accrued as a result of Government travel for private use. I know my friend from Kentucky was not implying that. But it is also my view that a vote for this second-degree amendment is not a vote to condone the use of frequent flier miles acquired as a result of Government travel for private use.  I will yield the floor.
