 President, there currently is no cap at all on the amount taxpayers will reimburse contractor employees for compensation except for just a handful of executives, and that limit is already too high at $693,951. That is far above what the chief executive of the U.S. Government gets paid at $400,000 a year.  So that is why we would cap it at no more than what the President can get. I presume the Senator from Michigan is aware of that and willing to help us on that process by adopting this amendment.  Mr. McCAIN. Where would the congressional and staff salaries fit on that?
