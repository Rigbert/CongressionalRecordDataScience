President, I would like to briefly recognize the service of retiring Senator David Vitter. Senator Vitter has served the people of Louisiana in Congress since 1999, through the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, across three different administrations, and through countless debates. As he retires from the Congress after nearly two decades of service to Louisiana, I wish him, his wife, Wendy, their four children and his entire family all the best in the next chapter.                          ____________________
