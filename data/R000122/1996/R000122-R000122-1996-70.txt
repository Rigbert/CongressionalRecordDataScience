Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 3604, the Safe Drinking Water Act amendments. This bill includes an important provision: H.R. 3280, the Water Quality Right-To-Know Act of 1996, of which I am a cosponsor. I am pleased that the House will pass this bipartisan piece of legislation, which will continue to protect our Nation's drinking water. While I remain concerned about the last-minute inclusion of projects which threaten to diminish the State revolving fund [SRF], overall I believe this is a good bill. It is my hope that this issue will be resolved in the House-Senate conference.  This bill takes many important steps to improve the Safe Drinking Water Act. It authorizes the SRF, which is essential to our communities in providing safe drinking water; it gives the EPA more flexibility in issuing regulations; it requires that standards be set for arsenic and radon; and it requires the EPA to conduct studies on sulfates.  One of the most important provisions would require water systems to public information annually on the status of drinking water and notify consumers of any contaminants. While the United States has one of the safest drinking water supplies in the world, there have, unfortunately, been incidents of contamination. I have heard from many constituents who expressed support for this provision because Americans have a right to know what is in their drinking water. I agree with them, and that is why I am a cosponsor of this provision.  I commend my colleagues who kept negotiations on this bill open and involved all interested parties to produce a sound piece of legislation that will establish good public policy. It is a relief to support a commonsense, bipartisan bill that will ensure that Americans have clean, safe drinking water. This bill will allow our communities to meet the goals of the act cost effectively and responsibly without sacrificing the quality of our drinking water.  Mr. Speaker, again, I urge my colleagues to work in the House-Senate conference to ensure that funding for the SRF is not cut, and I look forward to passage of this important piece of legislation.                          ____________________
