Speaker, I would like to call your attention to a group of young people from East Chicago, Indiana, who have become environmental activists in recent months organizing and demonstrating to keep Northwest Indiana safe and clean. Pablo Villarreall, Daniel Bustos, Monica Bustos, Jennifer Ruiz, San Juan Guajarvo, Samuel Guajarvo, Franky Gonzalez, Alfredo Alsedo Flores, Michael Jimenez, Diana Dela Rosa, Ester Ramirez, Victoria Ramirez, Sandra Wojak, Evelyn Gamez, Josephine Gamez, Jennie Montantes, Jackie Montantes, Olivia Perez, Alex Perez, Nicole Garcia, Moises Cordon, Erik Cordon, Veronica Bustos, Jose Gonzalez, Vito McCormick, Yara Sota, Tlatsin J'shua, Sindy Santos, Santos Santiago, Olivia Bustos, and Roxanne Bustos have taken it upon themselves to become citizens in the best sense of the word. Unlike the negative stereotype of teenagers that pervades our culture, these real teenagers have been active in helping their community, and helping themselves.  They came together through the Catholic Worker House, where they hold regular meetings each week and engage in different projects--photography, poetry, drama--while establishing relationships with one another and the Bustoses, who supervise their activities. They choose to come to the Catholic Worker House instead of participating in gangs, and, in an area with a high drop-out rate, these young people choose to stay in school. But these young adults aren't just the recipients of community volunteerism. They are volunteers themselves. After hearing from a local environmentalist at the Catholic Worker House, these teens decided to get involved. They have garnered attention from local news agencies and helped to make all of the adults in their community become more aware of their environmental concerns.  The late Mother Teresa aptly described the volunteer spirit, when she said: ``There is a tremendous strength that is growing in the world through . . . sharing together, praying together, suffering together, and working together.'' These young people worked together in the spirit of community, to bring attention to their cause and take on the role of active citizens. As young as they are, these students not only care what happens in their community, they accept the responsibility that goes along with that concern. These students are helping themselves, educating themselves, and using the power they get from these activities to help those around them. Mr. Speaker, these fine young men and women have demonstrated that they are clearly on the path to becoming mature, responsible adults, and I commend them to you.                          ____________________
