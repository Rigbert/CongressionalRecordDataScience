Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I think that this amendment is a good one for a number of reasons, but I just would like to make it very clear what the amendment does.  First, it requires that during the last 2 years of incarceration the inmate would be paid not less than $2.50 an hour; and, secondly, it would have a cap on how much inmates could be paid regardless of whether they were within 2 years of release or not within 2 years of release to 50 percent of the minimum wage by September of 2004 and the minimum wage by September 2009.  Additionally, the amendment would save the funds for a prisoner in trust which would be paid to them upon their release, which would mean that when the prisoners are released, they would have some gate money in their pocket to be able to begin their lives anew and hopefully lead a crime-free rest of their lives.  Now, with these two provisions this amendment is a very good one because it addresses two things. First of all, it helps level the playing field in terms of wages paid to FPI employees who are inmates with those of private sector employees who are making goods that are competing with the Federal Prison Industries. Secondly, it does give the prisoners an amount of money that has been held in trust for them so that they do not walk out of the prison with very little money in their pocket and perhaps are given a greater temptation to commit a crime in order to be able to put more money in their pocket to live.  So I think that this is really a win-win situation. I would hope that the committee would approve this amendment because I do believe it deals with some of the concerns in this bill that are legitimate and which have been expressed by people who have some doubts over how this bill has been put together.
