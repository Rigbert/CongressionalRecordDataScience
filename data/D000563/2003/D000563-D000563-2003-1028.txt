And I say to my colleague from Utah, Senator Bennett, with whom I share some responsibility on the Appropriations subcommittee, and whom I have found to be an extremely fair person, I think perhaps he has come up with the solution to the gordian knot we face.  We are not against Miguel Estrada. Without information, we cannot make a judgment on Miguel Estrada. We believe it is our constitutional responsibility to ask of every judicial nominee, from both Democratic and Republican Presidents, obvious important questions. In the case of Mr. Estrada, since he never served as a judge, he has legal writings, legal memoranda, legal opinions. We are asking him to share those with us so we can have insight into who he is, what he believes, and what he will do with a lifetime appointment to one of the most important Federal benches in America.  That is what this is about. It is not about being Hispanic. If you look at the record on the Democratic side, President Clinton appointed far more Hispanics to the bench than any other President in history. We supported him, and we continue to support that. I believe this affirmative action by theWhite House to bring Hispanics into the judiciary is a good thing for America. Our judiciary should reflect the diversity of the country. Whether they are Hispanic, Irish, or Lithuanian, we are going to ask the hard questions.
