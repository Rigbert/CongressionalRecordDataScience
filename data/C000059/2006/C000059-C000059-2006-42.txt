Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor Mike Reaume for his dedication and commitment to improving the community of Corona, California. On January 14, 2006, the Corona Chamber of Commerce recognized Mike for serving as the chairman of the board for the chamber during 2005.  After joining the Corona Chamber in 1999, Mike quickly became an active member of various chamber committees. His involvement included work with the Website, Ambassadors, and Corona Night with the Angels Committees. While serving on the chamber's board of directors, Mike was elected as vice president, chairman-elect, and, most recently, chairman of the board. In addition to his dedication to the chamber, Mike owns an insurance brokerage firm, Reaume Insurance Services, which specializes in employee benefits for employers and individuals.  During Mike's term as chairman, the chamber continued to grow in membership and develop new strategies to strengthen the relationships within the business community. The chamber exceeded the goals it set for the year by increasing membership up to nearly 1,150 members representing over 35,000 jobs in the region. Furthermore, the new members made an immediate impact by noticeably increasing the participation levels and attendance at chamber events.  Community-based organizations, like chambers of commerce, rely extensively on committed and dynamic individuals who take the initiative to address important issues facing their community. Mike's dedicated service epitomizes the selfless, hard-working spirit that is the backbone of communities throughout our great nation. The Corona Chamber and the community of Corona are significantly better off thanks to Mike's tireless efforts.  I want to express my appreciation for Mike's tremendous contributions on behalf of our entire community and congratulate him on the tremendous leadership he displayed as chairman of the board.                          ____________________
