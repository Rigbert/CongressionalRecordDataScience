 WELLSTONE. Yes.  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my friend from Ohio. I listened carefully to his remarks. He accurately pointed out that labor unions are the only organizations in America that can raise political funds and spend them on whatever they choose to without the consent of the donor, which is an aberration. Everybody else in the political system has to raise money from voluntary donations. They have to ask for it. I thank my friend for pointing out that there really can't be any campaign finance reform that is meaningful without addressing this extraordinary abuse. I appreciate very much his comments on this debate.
