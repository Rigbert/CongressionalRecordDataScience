The President put it on the agenda, the Social Security privatization, private accounts act. Can you tell me whether or not we anticipate a Social Security bill coming to create private accounts or privatize in some way Social Security coming to the floor this year.  Mr. DeLAY. The Committee on Ways and Means remains focused on developing a comprehensive retirement security package. And I still hope that the House will be able to consider legislation in this area before we end this session. That is about as much as I am informed as to where the bill is, what is in it, and when it will come.
