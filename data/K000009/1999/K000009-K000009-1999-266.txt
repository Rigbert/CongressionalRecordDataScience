Speaker, I rise today to recognize Sister Estella Ibarra of Toledo, Ohio, who is being honored this evening in a special tribute for her work in our community. Since her 1988 arrival in Toledo, Sr. Estella has tended to the housing, employment, and educational needs of South Toledo residents, while ministering to their spiritual needs as well.  After coming to Toledo to establish Marianist Social Ministries, Sr. Estella witnessed the critical housing situation facing many of her clients and it spurred her on to action. While working as Hispanic Outreach Coordinator for Catholic Charities in the Diocese of Toledo, she proposed and initiated CHIP: the Charities' Homeowners Initiatives Program. Since 1992, CHIP has provided close to thirty low-moderate income families with financial counseling, legal assistance, training in budgeting, home management, and retirement planning in preparation for buying a home. Starting in the city of Toledo, Sr. Estella is replicating the program in seventeen other communities in the Toledo Catholic Diocese.  To aid families in housing crises, Sr. Estella founded La Posada, a temporary shelter for homeless families. The shelter, named to honor the Mexican Christmas tradition in which families walked through the village by candlelight reenacting the Holy Family's search for shelter on the night of Jesus' birth, allows families in need to stay up to ninety days while re-establishing a foothold. Sr. Estella founded La Posada in 1991 through the combined efforts of herself and five churches in Toledo's Old South End: SS Peter & Paul, Immaculate Conception, St. John's Lutheran, First English Lutheran, and Peace Lutheran. Serving largely Hispanic families in need, La Posada provides help to about 120 people each year, most of whom are migrant workers, recent immigrants, and refugees, as they strive toward self-sufficiency.  St. Estella also works closely with Toledo Central City Neighborhoods Development Corp (TCCN), which is sponsored by ten Catholic churches and rehabilitates and builds affordable homes in Toledo's central city neighborhood. She began service on TCCN's Board in 1994, and even served briefly as the organization's interim director in 1996.  Sometimes referred to as the ``Mother Teresa of Toledo,'' Sister Estella has helped hundreds of Toledo's ``poorest of the poor.'' In a time when many in our government and across our nation have abdicated our responsibilities toward one other, Sr. Estella has chosen instead to follow Christ's teaching; ``Whatever you do to the least of my brethren, that you do unto me.'' She is a quiet and humble example of how we might live as true followers of Christ, and how we might seek to truly impact the life direction of people. Sr. Estella Ibarra is ensuring that our future will not only be different but better because she has been here. I join our community in honoring her achievements and thanking her in the most heartfelt way for the positive changes she has brought to people in need.                          ____________________
