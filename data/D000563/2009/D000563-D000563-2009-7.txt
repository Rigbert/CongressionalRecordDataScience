If the Senator happens to have a hurricane in his State and needs disaster aid and we put money in the bill, then would we have to question the Senator's motive for voting for the bill? I think it goes entirely too far, and I support this effort to table.  Mr. DeMINT. This a DeMint-Durbin amendment. It is mirrored after Speaker Pelosi's bill. They have this rule in the House. They can make it workable. Certainly, the integrity of this body is worth considering.  I would encourage my colleagues, at this point, when the public is looking at us, asking for some trust and integrity, we can make this bill work. I ask my colleagues to support my amendment and oppose the tabling motion.
