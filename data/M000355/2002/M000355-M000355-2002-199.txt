 We have reached agreement in principle on 6 of the 13 suggestions I made.  Today, he and I both had an opportunity to brief our colleagues in the Republican conference on the 13 suggestions I proposed. They have now been distributed. I would like for the majority leader and the Democrats to look at them as well. I am hoping we can continue to discuss the changes in the next few days.  I remind our colleagues that this bill, which certainly will become law sometime soon, doesn't take effect until November 6. So I think to take a little more time to look at it very carefully and consider technical changes that will benefit both sides is a good idea. I encourage all Senators to take a look at the suggestions I have made. I believe virtually all of them are reasonable. I know Senator McCain believes that at least some of them are reasonable. Therefore, I object.
