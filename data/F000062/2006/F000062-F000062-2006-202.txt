 President, I rise today with Senator Snowe to introduce legislation to strengthen our international HIV prevention efforts for youth and empower the people on the ground who are fighting this disease to design the most effective and appropriate HIV prevention program.  Our legislation does three things. First, it expresses the sense of the Senate that sexually active youth who live in a country where HIV infection is spreading through the general population should be considered at high risk of contracting HIV and provided with information on the complete range of tools to prevent the spread of HIV.  To date, the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator has focused prevention programs for youth on abstinence only and ignored other prevention techniques such as the use of condoms.  Second, it defines ``abstinence-until-marriage'' programs as those programs that place the highest, rather than exclusive, priority on encouraging individuals who have not yet married to abstain from sexual activity.  And finally, it reserves at least one-third of funds for prevention of the sexual transmission of HIV--rather than one-third of all prevention programs--for abstinence-until marriage programs. This recognizes that HIV prevention includes many types of activities and those that target the sexual transmission of HIV/AIDS, such as abstinence-until-marriage programs, are only a subset.  In 2003, I was proud to join my colleagues in passing the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Act of 2003, a historic piece of legislation that expressed our resolve to see the United States take a leadership role in the fight against the global HIV/AIDS pandemic.  The bill recognized that prevention--along with care and treatment--is an essential component of that fight and demands a multipronged approach. It endorsed the ``ABC'' model for prevention of the sexual transmission of HIV: Abstain, Be Faithful, use Condoms.  That bill also contained a provision that mandated that at least one-third of global HIV/AIDS prevention funds be set aside for ``abstinence-until-marriage programs.''  Three years later, we still face an uphill battle against the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Worldwide, 40 million people are infected with HIV. Each day, approximately 13,400 people are newly infected with HIV. In 2005, there were 5 million new HIV infections around the world, 3.2 million in Sub-Saharan Africa alone. Sub-Saharan Africa is home to almost two-thirds of the estimated 40 million people currently living with HIV.  Across sub-Saharan Africa, the prevalence rate for the general population is 8 percent; 2.4 million adults and children died of AIDS in 2005.  Despite these devastating numbers, according to UNAIDS, less than one in five people at risk for infection of HIV have access to basic prevention services. Studies have shown that two-thirds of new HIV infections could be averted with effective prevention programs.  Clearly, we still have a long ways to go to rein in this disease.  During the debate on the global HIV/AIDS bill, I expressed concern that we were placing politics over science by requiring that at least one-third of prevention funds go to ``abstinence only'' programs.  I argued that such an artificial earmark--which, by the way, was not based on any scientific study or conclusive evidence--would tie the hands of HIV/AIDS workers and doctors on the ground and severely inhibit the ability of the administration to fund the most effective HIV prevention programs.  It would mean less money for funds to prevent mother-to-child transmission; less money to promote a comprehensive prevention message to high risk groups such as sexually active youth; and fewer funds to protect the blood supply.  Unfortunately, the evidence clearly shows that the one-third earmark hashad a negative impact on our prevention efforts and inhibited the ability of local communities to design a multipronged HIV prevention program that works best for them.  Last month, the Government Accountability Office, GAO, issued a report that found ``significant challenges'' associated with meeting the abstinence-until-marriage programs. The report concluded that:  The 33 percent abstinence spending requirement is squeezing out available funding for other key HIV prevention programs such as mother-to-child transmission and maintaining a healthy blood supply. Country teams that are not exempted from the one-third earmark have to spend more than 33 percent of prevention funds on abstinence-until-marriage activities, sometimes at the expense of other programs. The spending requirement limited or reduced funding for programs directed to high-risk groups, such as sexually active youth and; the majority of country teams on the ground reported that meeting the spending requirement ``challenges their ability to develop interventions that are responsive to local epidemiology and social norms.''  Clearly, we are placing constraints on our ability to protect high-risk populations around the world from HIV transmission and fund the wide range of prevention programs, such as mother-to-child transmission.  Our bill seeks to address the problems highlighted in the GAO report and provide local communities the necessary flexibility to achieve the goal we all share: stopping the spread of HIV, especially among young people.  Let me be clear: our bill does not strike the 33 percent earmark for ``abstinence-until-marriage'' programs.  In fact, our legislation is pro-abstinence. It maintains abstinence as a critical part our prevention efforts and places no limits on programs that lead to this result. It even allows the administration to spend more than one third of funds for the prevention of HIV on ``abstinence-until-marriage'' programs if the administration decides that is the best use of those funds.  Simply put, our bill balances congressional priorities with public health needs. Under our legislation, country teams can take into account country needs including cultural differences, epidemiology, population age groups and the stage of the epidemic in designing the most effective prevention program.  One size does not fit all. A prevention program in one country may look a lot different than a prevention program in another country.  A May 2003 report from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Henry J. Kaiser Foundation highlights that proven prevention programs include: behavior change programs, including delay in the initiation of sexual activity, faithfulness and correct and consistent condom use; testing and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases; promoting voluntary counseling and testing; harm reduction programs for IV drug users; preventing the transmission of HIV from mother to child; increasing blood safety; empowering women and girls; controlling infection in health care settings, and; devising programs geared towards people living with HIV.  For example, studies have shown that combining drugs with counseling and instruction on use of such drugs reduces mother-to-child transmission by 50 percent.  Such cost effective programs are not related to abstinence and should not be constrained by the 33 percent earmark on funds for prevention.  I understand the importance of teaching abstinence. It is and will remain a key part of our strategy in preventing the spread of HIV.  But let us listen to the words of someone with first hand experience about the challenges sub-Saharan African countries face in combating HIV/AIDS and the constraints the ``abstinence-until-marriage'' earmark places on those efforts.  In an August 19, 2005 op-ed in the New York Times, Babatunde Osotimehin, chairman of the National Action Committee on AIDS in Nigeria, wrote:       Abstinence is one critical prevention strategy, but it      cannot be the only one. Focusing on abstinence assumes young      people can choose whether to have sex. For adolescent girls      in Nigeria and in many other countries, this is an inaccurate      assumption. Many girls fall prey to sexual violence and      coercion ..When dealing with AIDS, we must address the      realities and use a multipronged approach to improving      education and health systems, one that can reach all of our      people.  He concludes:       National governments must have the freedom to employ the      very best strategies at our disposal to help our people.  I could not agree more.  If we want to help the girls of Nigeria and the youth of sub-Saharan Africa, we cannot limit the information they receive about keeping them safe from acquiring HIV.  Mr. President, I have been heartened to witness Republicans and Democrats coming together to support a robust U.S. assistance package to fight the HIV/AIDS pandemic. We all share the same goal of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief to prevent 7 million new HIV infections by 2010.  This bill is about helping us achieve that goal. When we put our faith in the people on the front lines of this fight and allow them to use all the tools and strategies at their disposal, we are one step closer to making that goal a reality.  We do not have time to lose. I urge my colleagues to support our legislation and support a pro-abstinence, multi-pronged approach to preventing the spread of HIV.  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3656       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``HIV Prevention for Youth      Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (in this      Act referred to as ``PEPFAR'') is an unprecedented effort to      combat the global AIDS epidemic, with $9,000,000,000 targeted      for initiatives in 15 focus countries.       (2) The PEPFAR prevention goal is to avert 7,000,000 HIV      infections in the 15 focus countries--most in sub-Saharan      Africa where heterosexual intercourse is by far the      predominant mode of HIV transmission.       (3) The PEPFAR strategy for prevention of sexual      transmission of HIV is shaped by 3 elements: the ABC model,      defined as ``Abstain, Be faithful, use Condoms'', the      promotion of ``abstinence-until-marriage'', and deference to      local prevention needs.       (4) The United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS,      Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003 requires that at least      one-third of all prevention funds be reserved for abstinence-     until-marriage programs. In implementing this requirement,      the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator has required that 50 percent      of prevention funding be dedicated to sexual transmission      prevention activities. This requirement severely limits      countries from employing strategies for the prevention of      sexual transmission other than abstinence, because the other      sexual transmission prevention programs under PEPFAR (such as      the purchase of condoms and management of sexually      transmitted infections) cannot exceed one-sixth of the total      prevention funds.       (5) The Government Accountability Office (GAO) issued a      report in April, 2006, ``Spending Requirement Presents      Challenges For Allocating Funding under the President's      Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief'', that found ``significant      challenges'' associated with meeting the earmark for      abstinence-until-marriage programs.       (6) GAO found that a majority of country teams report that      fulfilling the requirement presents challenges to their      ability to respond to local epidemiology and cultural and      social norms.       (7) GAO found that, although some country teams may be      exempted from the abstinence-until-marriage spending      requirement, country teams that are not exempted have to      spend more than the 33 percent of prevention funds on      abstinence-until-marriage activities--sometimes at the      expense of other programs.       (8) Indeed, according to GAO, the proportion of HIV      prevention funds dedicated to ``other prevention'' activities      (i.e. the purchase and promotion of condoms, management of      sexually transmitted infections other than HIV, and messages      or programs to reduce injection drug use) declined from 23      percent in fiscal year 2005 to 18 percent in fiscal year 2006      for country teams that did not receive exemptions.       (9) GAO found that, as a result of the abstinence-until-     marriage spending requirement, some countries have had to      reduce planned funding for Prevention of Mother-to-Child      Transmission programs, thereby limiting services for pregnant      women and their children.       (10) GAO found that the abstinence-until-marriage spending      requirement limited or reduced funding for programs directed      to high-risk groups, such as services for married discordant      couples, sexually active youth, and commercial sex workers.       (11) GAO found that the abstinence-until-marriage spending      requirement made it difficult for countries to fund medical      and blood safety activities.       (12) GAO found that, because of the abstinence-until-     marriage spending requirement, some countries would likely      have to reduce funding for condom procurement and condom      social marketing.       (13) In addition, GAO found that two-thirds of focus      country teams reported that the policy for implementing the      ABC model is unclear and open to varying interpretations,      causing confusion about which groups may be targeted and      whether youth may receive the ABC message.       (14) GAO found that the ABC guidance does not clearly      delineate permissible C activities under the ABC model.      Program staff reported that they feel ``constrained'' by      restrictions on promoting or marketing condoms to youth.      Other country teams reported confusion about whether PEPFAR      funds may be used for broad condom social marketing, even to      adults in a generalized epidemic.       (15) Each day, an estimated 13,400 people worldwide are      newly infected with HIV.       (16) Sub-Saharan Africa is home to almost two-thirds of the      estimated 40,000,000 people currently living with HIV.       (17) In many African countries, the epidemic has spread      among the general population. The HIV prevalence rate for the      general population is 8 percent across sub-Saharan Africa.      Among the United States focus countries in sub-Saharan      Africa, the HIV prevalence rate ranges from 4 percent in      Uganda to 37 percent in Botswana.       (18) According to the Joint United Nations Programme on      HIV/AIDS, young people between the ages of 15 and 24 are      ``the most threatened by AIDS'' and ``are at the centre of      HIV vulnerability''. Globally, this age group accounts for      half of all new HIV cases each year. More than 7,000 young      people contract the virus every day.       (19) Most young people in sub-Saharan Africa have sex      before marriage during their adolescent years. In many      countries, at least half of all women have sex before age 20      and before marriage. Among young men, more than 70 percent      have premarital sex before age 20.       (20) Many adolescents, who are sexually active and not yet      married, have inadequate information on how to protect      themselves against HIV. Fewer than half of young people in      sub-Saharan Africa mention abstinence, monogamy, or condom      use as a way of avoiding HIV.       (21) Young people who have sex are at greater risk of      acquiring HIV than adults, partly because of their lack of      knowledge. They are apt to change partners frequently, have      more than 1 partner in the same time period, or engage in      unprotected sex.       (22) Coercion and sexual violence undercut the ability of      young people--women in particular--to prevent HIV and      contribute to the vulnerability to infection. In addition,      gender inequality makes it much more difficult for young      women to negotiate abstinence from sex or to insist that      their partners remain faithful or use condoms.       (23) Marriage does not protect young women from HIV, even      when they are faithful to their husbands. In some settings,      it appears marriage actually increases a woman's HIV risk. In      some African countries, married women aged 15-19 have higher      HIV infection levels than nonmarried sexually active women of      the same age.       (24) A recent USAID-funded review found that sex and HIV      education programs that encourage abstinence but also discuss      the use of condoms do not increase sexual activity as critics      of sex education have long alleged. Sex education can help      delay the initiation of intercourse, reduce the frequency of      sex and the number of sexual partners, and also increase      condom use.       (25) Young people are our greatest hope for changing the      course of the AIDS epidemic. According to the World Health      Organization, ``Focusing on young people is likely to be the      most effective approach to confronting the epidemic,      particularly in high prevalence countries.''.     SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.       It is the sense of Congress that sexually active young      people, both unmarried and married, who live in a country      where HIV infection is spreading through the general      population, rather than being confined to specific      populations, such as sex workers and their clients, injecting      drug users, and men who have sex with men, and the rate of      HIV infection among people between the ages of 15 and 49      exceeds 1 percent should be--       (1) considered at high risk of contracting HIV infection;      and       (2) provided with the knowledge, skill-building programs,      and tools to protect themselves from HIV infection,      including--       (A) medically accurate information on public health      benefits and failure rates of multiple strategies for      eliminating or reducing the risks of contracting HIV and      other sexually transmitted infections; and       (B) information about correct and consistent use of condoms      as well as abstinence and the importance of reducing casual      sexual partnering.     SEC. 4. ALLOCATION OF FUNDS.       Section 403 of the United States Leadership Against HIV/     AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003 (22 U.S.C. 7673)      is amended--       (1) in subsection (a), in the second sentence, by striking      ``HIV/AIDS prevention'' and inserting ``prevention of the      sexual transmission of HIV''; and       (2) by adding at the end the following new subsection:       ``(c) Abstinence-Until-Marriage Programs.--The term      `abstinence-until-marriage programs' means programs that      place the highest priority on encouraging individuals who      have not yet married to abstain from sexual activity, which      if practiced 100 percent correctly and consistently is the      only certain way to protect against exposure to HIV and other      sexually transmitted infections. The programs include      information on the health benefits of delayed sexual debut in      reducing the transmission of HIV and may be used to support      the wide range of approaches that promote skill-building      strategies for practicing abstinence.''.     SEC. 5. ASSISTANCE TO YOUNG PEOPLE.       Section 104A(d)(3) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961      (22 U.S.C. 2151b-2(d)(3)) is amended--       (1) in subparagraph (A), by inserting ``sexually active      young people, both unmarried and married, who live in a      country experiencing a generalized HIV epidemic,'' after      ``infected with HIV/AIDS,''; and       (2) by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:       ``(C) In subparagraph (A), the term `generalized epidemic'      means, with respect to a country, that--       ``(i) HIV infection is spreading through the general      population of such country, rather than being confined to      specific populations, such as sex workers and their clients,      injecting drug users, and men who have sex with men; and       ``(ii) the rate of HIV infection among people between the      ages of 15 and 49 exceeds 1 percent.''.
