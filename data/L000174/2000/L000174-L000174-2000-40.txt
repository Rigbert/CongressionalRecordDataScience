President, I am pleased that the Senate is passing S. 3137, the James Madison Commemoration Commission Act. I was an original cosponsor of this legislation, which will establish a bipartisan commission to recognize the life and accomplishments of James Madison on the 250th anniversary of his birth, March 16, 2001.  Among his many accomplishments, James Madison was the primary author of the U.S. Constitution, a document so brilliantly constructed that it has been amended only 27 times in our Nation's history. The first 10 amendments were ratified as our Bill of Rights in 1791, over two centuries ago. There have been just 17 additional amendments.  Our tribute to the Father of the Constitution comes in the same year that the Senate defeated no less than three ill-conceived proposals to amend his handiwork. I am proud that we were good stewards of the Constitution, and that the anniversary of Madison's birth will truly be a cause for celebration.
