Yes, it is the intent of the conferees that both the new king crab processor quota shares and the new c.opilio processor quota shares shall receive a designation based on the location in which crab was historically processed.  Mr. LoBIONDO. I thank the gentleman.                          ____________________[Page H4665]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                COLLOQUY RE CRAB PROCESSOR QUOTA SHARES  (Mr. LoBIONDO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr. LoBIONDO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to enter into a colloquy with the chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Chairman Young.  Is it the intent of the conference on H.R. 889, the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2006, that when the National Marine Fisheries Service issues new processor quota shares under section 417, the regional designation for the shares for both the king and c. opilio crab fisheries shall reflect the processing history of the Blue Dutch during the years leading up to the North Pacific Council's adoption of the crab plan?
