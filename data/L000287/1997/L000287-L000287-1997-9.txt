Mr. Speaker, I rise today to say to you, to the chairman of the Committee on House Oversight and to the Republican Members of the House, let Loretta Sanchez go. Stop holding this woman hostage in your game of political terrorism.  The voters of California's 46th Congressional District cast their ballots last November. They voted Bob Dornan out and Loretta Sanchez in by nearly 1,000 votes. The election was certified by the California Secretary of State. A lengthy recount requested by Mr. Dornan showed no change in the outcome.  Then came Mr. Dornan's charges of voter fraud. Yet almost a year after the election and after expending hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxpayer funds, Republicans have yet to show any evidence of voter fraud.  Mr. Speaker, the time has come to give up the charade. Stop this mockery of an investigation, stop the harassment, stop the intimidation. Let Loretta Sanchez go. She won her seat in the House fair and square. Put up your evidence or drop this ill-conceived investigation. Stop it and end it now.                          ____________________
