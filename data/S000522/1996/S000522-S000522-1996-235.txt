Mr. Speaker, I noticed in the news that President Yeltsin has vowed to go ahead with a trip to Chechnya some time before the Presidential elections in June. As our colleagues are aware, Moscow has tried to reestablish control over the breakaway North Caucasus region by unleashing a brutal war against not only combatants, but also against thousands of noncombatants, Chechen and Russian, alike.  Mr. Yeltsin says that he intends to go to Chechnya despite assassination threats. I truly hope there won't be any such attempts, but it must be admitted that the people of Chechnya have reason to be bitter about the fate of their homeland. While Chechen irregulars have committed their share of atrocities, there is emerging from Chechnya a frightening picture of the Russian Army degenerating from an organized military force into a band of barely controlled brigands.  The Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, of which I am proud to serve as chairman, held congressional hearings on the situation in Chechnya earlier this year. At these hearings, Russian Duma member and prominent human rights advocate Sergei Kovalev described the continuing depredations by the Russian military against civilians. In his words, ``45,000 innocent persons'' killed in the war is ``too high a price to pay for punishing [the late Chechen leader Dzhokar] Dudaev.''  Mr. Speaker, in this connection, I would note that the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe recently received a disturbing report from the well known international humanitarian organization Doctors Without Borders, drawing attention to the deteriorating human rights situation in Chechnya. This report, ``Civilians Targeted,'' documented the systematic bombing and killing of civilians by the Russian military in Chechnya, which, according to the report, has actually increased following President Yeltsin's announced peace initiative in March.  I would list a few of the activities engaged in by the Russian military, as witnessed by Doctors Without Borders teams.  Whole villages, including hospitals, schools and mosques, continue to be targeted, in blatant violation of the Geneva Conventions and other international agreements, to which Russia is a signatory.  The Russian military extorts money from Russian civilians in exchange for safe passage out of villages under attack.  Newly secured towns and villages are systematically looted and cattle are either killed or stolen.  Civilians are systematically denied the right to humanitarian assistance and humanitarian relief organizations are denied access to the areas in greatest need, often long after a military offensive is over.  The Russian military has consistently failed to respect the neutrality of hospitals and clinics, both in areas of intense military activity in the center of the country and in the capital Grozny, where the Doctors Without Borders hospital is under regular sniper fire.  These are a few of the blatant violations of accepted rules of warfare and humanitarian conduct cited in the report.  I think we can safely assume that Mr. Yeltsin's advisors have not provided him with a Russian language copy of the Doctors Without Borders report on his army's actions in Chechnya. There certainly have been indications that the President's advisors and military commanders have not been supplying him with entirely accurate information regarding the state of affairs in that war-torn region.  However, I have yet to hear anyone doubt Mr. Yeltsin's personal courage. Perhaps he will leave the secure confines of the Severny airport on the outskirts of Grozny and see what sort of peace his military is promoting in Chechnya.  I wish him a safe and instructive trip.                          ____________________
