 President, yesterday I introduced legislation to improve our Nation's ability to use the criminal law to guard against and respond to terrorist attacks at our seaports--the Reducing Crime at America's Seaports Act of 2005.  I am pleased to join my colleagues Senators Biden, Specter, Kyl, and Allen, who have co-sponsored this bill, in moving forward with this initiative.  The Nation's seaports are a tremendous asset to our economy. They also represent a significant vulnerability to a possible terrorist attack.  Much of our national commerce travels through these ports. Ninety percent of all cargo tonnage moves through the 50 biggest ports. Just 25 of those ports account for 98 percent of the Nation's container traffic--two of the largest such ports, Oakland and Los Angeles/Long Beach, are in my home State of California.  A modern port, which handles huge ships laden with thousands of containers, and vast amounts of critical bulk cargo, is complex and sprawling. It is also extremely vulnerable to a terrorist attack.  The very complexity and size of our ports make them an obvious and attractive target for a terrorist. With hundreds of miles of wharves and piers, a vast volume of boat, truck and car traffic, lengthy perimeters, ports can be the perfect target.  Not only are they vulnerable to attack, the consequences of even a small attack could be overwhelming. Commerce would be devastated, not only atand around the port, but all around the Nation, because the goods moving through ports are the lifeblood of industry and commerce throughout the Nation. The human cost would also be terrible, because ports not only employ thousands of workers; they are without exception located near large metropolitan population centers.  My concern is not just theoretical. The available intelligence analysis supports the conclusion that seaports are a critical vulnerability. Our terrorist enemies are well aware of the vulnerability of these ports, and are well equipped to do terrible damage.  This problem is heightened by two critical factors: the first is the growing importance of containers in maritime commerce. Since their introduction in the late 1960s, container traffic has grown. It now accounts for 66 percent of dollar value of all U.S. maritime traffic. In some ports, such as Los Angeles/Long Beach, it constitutes most of the trade. The problem with containers is that they are, by definition, a potential delivery device for a terrorist weapon. Whether conventional explosives, biological agents, or a nuclear device, such as a so-called ``dirty bomb,'' containers complicate the problem of securing our ports. The second factor is the increasing possibility that terrorists have, or will soon acquire, the ability to mount unconventional attacks, such as nuclear, radiological or biological attacks. In such a case our ports provide both a method for bringing such things into the country for an attack inland, and can be the target itself.  There is a lot to do to secure our ports. Some of it requires long term investment in capital improvements. But we can accomplish much simply by fine-tuning the tools we already have. Among those tools is the criminal law. These laws are vital to those on the front line--the Coast Guard, the FBI, Customs Agents, and the State, local and private authorities who protect our ports every day.  This bill will improve the criminal law applicable to ports in the following ways: it would clarify that the law prohibiting fraudulent access to transport facilities includes seaports and waterfronts within its scope, as well as increase the maximum term of imprisonment for a violation from 5 years to 10 years. According to the Report of the Interagency Commission on Crime and Security at U.S. Seaports: ``[c]ontrol of access to the seaport or sensitive areas within the seaports is often lacking.'' Such unauthorized access is especially problematic, since inappropriate controls may result in the theft of cargo and, more dangerously, undetected admission of terrorists.  It would amend the U.S. Code to make it a crime: One, for a vessel operator knowingly to fail to slow or stop a ship once ordered to do so by a Federal law enforcement officer, including the Coast Guard; two, for any person on board a vessel to impede boarding or other law enforcement action authorized by federal law; or three, for any person on board a vessel to provide false information to a federal law enforcement officer. Any violation of this section would be punishable by a fine and/or imprisonment for a maximum term of 5 years. A core function of the Coast Guard is law enforcement at sea, especially in the aftermath of the tragic events of September 11. While the Coast Guard has authority to use whatever force is reasonably necessary to force a vessel to stop or be boarded, ``refusal to stop,'' by itself, is not currently a crime.  It creates a new criminal provision to make it a crime to willfully use a dangerous weapon, including chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear materials, or explosive, with intent to cause death or serious bodily injury to any person on board a passenger vessel. Any violation of this section, including attempts and conspiracies, would be punishable by a fine and/or imprisonment for a maximum term of 20 years and, if death results, for a term of imprisonment up to life. This section would close a potential gap in existing law by making it clear that ``passenger vessels'' like cruise ships are included within the scope of transportation vehicles covered by the provision.  The bill would amend existing law which covers violence against maritime navigation to make it a crime to intentionally damage or tamper with any maritime navigational aid maintained by the Coast Guard or under its authority, if such act endangers the safe navigation of a ship. The Coast Guard maintains over 50,000 navigational aids on more than 25,000 miles of waterways. These aids, which are relied upon by all commercial, military and recreational mariners, are essential for safe navigation and are, therefore, inviting targets for terrorists.  The bill would make it a crime to: One, knowingly place in waters any device or substance which is likely to damage a vessel or its cargo, interfere with a vessel's safe navigation, or interfere with maritime commerce; or two, knowingly discharge a hazardous substance into U.S. waters, with the intent to endanger human life or welfare. Any violation of these provisions would be punishable by a fine and/or a term of imprisonment up to life; if death results, the offense could be punishable by a sentence of death. This addresses the vulnerability of our shorelines and ports to such a terrorist attack the results could be economically and environmentally devastating.  The law would make it a crime to knowingly and willfully transport aboard any vessel an explosive, biological agent, chemical weapon, or radiological or nuclear materials, knowing that the item is intended to be used to commit a terrorist act. Any violation of this provision would be punishable by a fine and/or a term of imprisonment up to life; if death results, the offense could be punished by a sentence of death. It would also make it a crime to knowingly and willfully transport aboard any vessel any person who intends to commit, or is avoiding apprehension after having committed, a terrorist act.  The law creates a set of crimes involving attacks on sea vessels. Modeled upon the existing criminal sanctions for destruction or interference with aircraft or aircraft facilities, updating them in the maritime area to harmonize them with coverage in the aviation context. Specifically, this section would make it a crime to: One, damage or destroy a vessel or its parts, a maritime facility, or any apparatus used to store, load or unload cargo and passengers; two, perform an act of violence against or incapacitate any individual on a vessel or at or near a facility; or three, knowingly communicate false information that endangers the safety of a vessel.  The law would also subject any individual who knowingly conveys false information about the offenses described above, or other named offenses, to a civil penalty up to $5,000. In addition, an individual who willfully and maliciously or recklessly conveys false information would be punishable by a fine and/or imprisonment for a maximum term of 5 years.  The law would amend the U.S. Code to prohibit the carrying of a dangerous weapon, including a firearm or explosive, at a seaport or on board a vessel. Any violation of this section, and conspiracies, would be punishable by a fine and/or imprisonment for a maximum term of 10 years; an individual who willfully or recklessly violates this section would be punishable by a fine and/or imprisonment for a maximum term of 15 years; if death results, the offense would be punishable by a term of imprisonment up to life. According to the Interagency Commission Report, ``[a]t many seaports, the carrying of firearms is not restricted, and thus internal conspirators and other criminals are allowed armed access to cargo vessels and cruise line terminals.''  The bill expands the scope of section 659 of title 18, theft of interstate or foreign shipments, to include theft of goods from additional transportation facilities or instruments, including trailers, cargo containers, and warehouses. In addition, it would increase the maximum term of imprisonment for low-level thefts from 1 year to 3 years and clarify that the determination of whether goods are ``moving as an interstate or foreign shipment'' is made by considering the entire cargo route, regardless of any temporary stop between the point of origin and final destination.  In addition to making changes to the criminal law, the bill creates mechanisms to permit the government to efficiently acquire data necessary to target scarce enforcement resources. Recognizing that cargo theft is not only a significant economic problem in its own right, but an indicator of poroussecurity, and thus of terrorist vulnerability, the law creates meaningful reporting requirements.  This bill would require the Attorney General to one, mandate the reporting of cargo theft offenses; and two, create a database containing the reported information, which would be appropriately integrated with other agencies' information-collection efforts and made available to governmental officials. Despite the fact that cargo theft is a well-known problem, there exists no national data collection and reporting systems that capture the magnitude of serious crime at seaports.  The bill increases the penalties for noncompliance with certain manifest reporting and record-keeping requirements, including information regarding the content of cargo containers and the country from which the shipments originated. The effectiveness of Federal, State and local efforts to secure ports is compromised by criminals' ability to evade detection by underreporting and misreporting the content of cargo--with little more than a slap on the wrist, if that. The existing statutes simply do not provide adequate sanctions to deter criminal or civil violations. As a consequence, vessel manifest information is often wrong or incomplete--and our ability to assess risks, make decisions about which containers to inspect more closely, or simply control the movement of cargo is made virtually impossible.  Our Nation's ports represent a critical vulnerability point in our Nation's defenses. It is critical that we take steps to reduce this vulnerability, develop defenses, and, unfortunately, plan for mitigation should there be an attack. There is much to do, including providing additional funding. This bill addresses one aspect of the problem by improving and adding to the criminal justice tools which can protect our ports. It is a relatively narrow bill, with a precise focus on the problem at hand.  I urge my colleagues to join in supporting this much-needed improvement to our law.                          ____________________[Pages S1500-S1502]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]            REDUCING CRIME AT AMERICA'S SEAPORTS ACT OF 2005
