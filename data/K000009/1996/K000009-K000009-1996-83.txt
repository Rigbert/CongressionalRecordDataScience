Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the St. Vincent School of Nursing, and to offer my congratulations as the school celebrates its centennial anniversary. Since 1896, the School of Nursing has remained a healthcare education landmark in Toledo, OH.  Opened by the Sisters of Charity of Montreal, more commonly known as the ``Grey Nuns,'' the School of Nursing became the first school of its kind in Ohio. Sr. Elodie Mailoux served as the first director, from 1896 to 1898. Currently, Ms. Elizabeth Cain holds the post. She has been director since 1989 and is the 18th director of the school.  Throughout its history, the School of Nursing has kept pace with the evolution of healthcare and nursing to graduate nearly 4,000 highly skilled, dedicated nursing professionals. In addition, the school has prided itself on its ability to successfully blend common spiritual beliefs with the latest healthcare technology and nursing education.  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to recognize the 100th anniversary of the St. Vincent School of Nursing. As it enters its second century, the school's dedication to care, education, and service continues to provide the northwest Ohio area with outstanding nursing education.                          ____________________
