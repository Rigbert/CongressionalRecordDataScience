Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Shays) and the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Meehan) may each control 4 minutes of time allocated to me and that they may yield time.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Maryland?  There was no objection.
