 President, I will not object to that request--in fact, I agree to it--but I also want to make the point that one of the most important amendments we anticipate is an amendment by Senator McCain. I know earlier he had contacted us indicating he wanted to come over and offer it. Since we will be in recess under the consent agreement Senator Reid is going to offer from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m., it is my hope Senator McCain will be able to come over and offer that at 2 p.m. and we can get that in the queue.
