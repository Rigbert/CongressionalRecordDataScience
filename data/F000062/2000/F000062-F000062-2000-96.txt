 President, I rise today to address the Levin amendment to the military construction appropriations bill, which strikes the provisions of the Byrd-Warner amendment on Kosovo which was attached to the bill in committee.  Unfortunately, for an issue of such importance, this amendment came up very quickly in committee without, I think, due consideration and study.  Since the committee markup last week I have had a chance to further consider and study this issue and I have had the opportunity to discuss this issue, at length, with senior members of the Administration, with Secretary Cohen, with Jack Lew, Director of the OMB, and with General Wesley Clark, the former supreme NATO commander. As a result of these discussions, I have some serious concerns about the potential impact of the Byrd-Warner amendment  During the committee markup, proponents of this amendment asserted that the certifications called for by the amendment could be made ``tomorrow'' without delay. According to Mr. Lew, however, the certifications can not be met by July 15 of this year.
