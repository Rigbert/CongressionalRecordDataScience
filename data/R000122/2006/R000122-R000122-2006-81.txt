President, while I certainly appreciate the efforts last evening of Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye to add roughly $13 billion to this appropriations bill for the readiness of the U.S. Army and the Marine Corps, it is emergency spending, but it should come as no surprise that it is necessary.  What I find surprising is that apparently the requests by the Department of the Army, the Department of Defense, and also the OMB were turned down until it became obvious--and publicly obvious--that the readiness condition of the Army and the Marine Corps is the worst it has been in several decades.
