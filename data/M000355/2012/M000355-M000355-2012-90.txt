 President, I rise today to mourn the loss of a good man, an honored Kentuckian, and a dear friend. Mr. George Washington Griffin passed away on December 19, 2011, from complications of pneumonia at the age of 85. He is deeply missed by all those who knew and loved him.  George--known to his friends as G.W.--was a fixture of the Laurel County community and a leader in the region and the Commonwealth. A co-owner and former chairman emeritus of the Laurel Grocery Company, G.W. served on the National American Wholesale Grocers Board of Governors for two terms beginning in 1967. He was elected president of the Kentucky Wholesale Grocers Association in 1979, and the Kentucky Grocers Association/Kentucky Association of Convenience Stores honored Mr. Griffin as Kentucky Grocer of the Year in 1986.  When George retired from the grocery industry in 1997, he left the Laurel Grocery Company well positioned for success in the 21st century. Fellow members of the grocers industry across Kentucky honored G.W. as one of the original three inductees into the Kentucky Grocers Hall of Fame in 2005.  G.W. was born in East Bernstadt, KY, in 1926. He attended the Kentucky Military Institute, Wake Forest University, and the University of Kentucky. He served in the U.S. Navy during World War II and was decorated with the Victory Medal, the American Area Campaign Medal, the Asiatic-Pacific Area Campaign Medal, and the Philippine Liberations Ribbon.  G.W. was also very involved with the Cumberland Valley National Bank, Institutional Distributors, and played arole in the formation of Appalachian Computer Services in London. He also had a hand in Laurel Insurance Company and worked in the printing industry. In his spare time, G.W. loved UK athletics, rarely missing a home game.  G.W. was a close personal friend to me and a strong support of mine going back to 1984. I will always be thankful for his belief in me and his help over the decades. It was a pleasure to see him every time I made my way to London. I will miss our friendship.  Elaine and my prayers go to G.W.'s family, including his wife Elizabeth; his daughter and son-in-law, Elizabeth and Hal McCoy; his son and daughter-in-law, George William and Becky; his son and daughter-in-law, Winston and Shannon; his sister, Margaret Fouts; his five grandchildren; and many other friends and family members. G.W. was preceded in death by his parents, George W. Sr. and Willie Lee, and his brother William.  Mr. President, I ask my U.S. Senate colleagues to join me in mourning the loss of Mr. George Washington ``G.W.'' Griffin and extending sympathies to the Griffin family. Kentucky is poorer for his loss.  An obituary detailing Mr. Griffin's incredible life appeared in the Laurel County-area publication the Sentinel Echo. I ask unanimous consent that said article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [The Sentinel Echo, December 23, 2011]   George Washington `G.W.' Griffin--Owner of Laurel Grocery Company       Laurel County, KY.--George Washington ``G.W.'' Griffin, 85,      died December 19, 2011, from complications of pneumonia.       Born on February 28, 1926, in East Bernstadt, Griffin      attended the Kentucky Military Institute, Wake Forest      University and graduated from the University of Kentucky,      where he was a member of the Kappa Alpha Fraternity. Having      served in World War II, he was a proud veteran of the United      States Navy.       He was a member of the First Baptist Church. He was a      founding member and past president of the London Country Club      and long-time member of Biltmore Forest Country Club. He      served on the board of trustees of the University of Kentucky      for 16 years, which is how he met his partner in crime and      close friend, the late, great Dr. Otis Singletary. Griffin      was past chairman of Laurel Grocery Company, Cumberland      Valley National Bank, Institutional Distributors, London      Rotary Forms, and the Food Marketing Education Council (the      Red Coats). He was a board member of Cumberland College,      National-American Wholesale Grocers Association, Kentucky      Chamber of Commerce, Appalachian Computer Systems, and the      Kentucky Grocers Association. He was an initial inductee into      the Kentucky Grocers Hall of Fame. An avid golfer and      thoroughbred horse owner/racing enthusiast, he traveled all      over the world to pursue his passions, but his favorite place      was always the great state of Kentucky. A diehard UK fan,      Griffin never missed a home football game until he became too      ill to attend.       He was preceded in death by his brother, William ``Bill''      Griffin.       He is survived by his wife of 53 years, Elizabeth Park      ``Sis'' Griffin, and sister Margaret Fouts of Lacey, Wash.       The couple have three children, Elizabeth (Hal) McCoy of      Hopkinsville, Ky.; George William (Becky) Griffin of      Lexington; and Winston (Shannon) Griffin of London; and five      grandchildren, Winston Park Griffin, Charlotte Grace Griffin,      Griffin Bell McCoy, Catherine Rose Griffin, and Bella James      Griffin.       The Griffin family extends heartfelt gratitude to Don      Dossett for his loving care and assistance with G.W. Griffin      these last two years.       Funeral services will be held at 11 a.m. Wednesday at First      Baptist Church, 804 W. 5th Street, London, with Dr. Terry      Lester officiating.       Burial will be in A.R.
