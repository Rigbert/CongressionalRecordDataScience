 It is true that permitting States and localities to advance refund governmental bonds one additional time would provide important financial flexibility at a critical time. State and local governments across the country are facing unprecedented fiscal crisis. Being able to refinance debt at a lower rate will clearly translate into important savings for our Nation's cities, counties and states.  I assure the Senator this proposal will receive serious and thorough consideration by the Finance Committee, which I chair, as we address tax legislation in the future.                          ____________________
