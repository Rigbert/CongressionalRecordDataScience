 President, I rise today to honor an organization that has contributed greatly to the Commonwealth of Kentucky and its citizens. The Mount Saint Joseph Conference and Retreat Center celebrates its 25th year of service this year. The center has been a long time contributor to the State and the community in western Kentucky surrounding Maple Mount.  In 1983, after many years as a boarding school, the Ursuline Sisters of Mount Saint Joseph made a difficult, yet promising decision to close its educational facilities. That led to the opportunity to develop the center into a modern facility. After much thought and prayer, the sisters that so dedicatedly ran the boarding school worked to transform it and its surroundings into a retreat center offering programs and meeting spaces for businesses and organizations.  Since the renovation 25 years ago, the Mount Saint Joseph Conference and Retreat Center has focused on spirituality, the arts, and environmental education. Each year, 500 students visit the center to tour the surrounding farm and learn good stewardship of the Earth. Groups from churches and businesses frequent the center, which contains living quarters and a cafeteria.  Not only does the center add to the mental and spiritual well-being of the people of western Kentucky, it works to preserve the environment as well. Through the dedicated leadership of Sister Amelia Stenger, director of the center, the Ursuline nuns have made it their mission to educate the community about the environment. In so doing, they have built one eco-friendly home out of straw and now plan to rebuild a home using several energy-saving measures.  They plan to build a ``near-zero'' home that uses no outside sources of energy in western Kentucky. Sister Stenger pioneers these efforts after a visit to Austria, where she toured various conservation efforts there. This house will be called the Casa del Sole Environmental Education Center. The name is Italian for ``house of the sun,'' and for the Ursulines it also refers to Jesus Christ.  The service and selflessness of Sister Stenger, three previous directors, and the center's staff has contributing much to those who visit the center every year and to the Commonwealth of Kentucky. I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the Mount Saint Joseph Conference and Retreat Center for 25 years of service in the community.                          ____________________
