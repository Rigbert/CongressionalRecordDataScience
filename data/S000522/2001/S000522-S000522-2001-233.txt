Mr. Speaker, we have no further requests for time, but I would just note to the membership that, again, pursuant to the majority leader's statement that every Member who wants to speak on this vital issue will have that opportunity, my understanding is that the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos) has six additional speakers, so I would like to again ask unanimous consent that during consideration of H.J. Res. 61, pursuant to the order of the House of earlier today, debate on the joint resolution be extended for an additional 30 minutes, equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on International Relations.  Mr. Speaker, let me be clear that we have no additional requests for time, and we intend on yielding back to expedite these proceedings.
