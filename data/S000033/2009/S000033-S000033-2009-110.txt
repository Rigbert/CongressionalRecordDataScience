 President, pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable sections of this act for purposes of the pending amendment.  This amendment is supported by a number of Senators, not just from the east coast or Midwest or Southwest or the West but from all over the country--among others, Senators Snowe, Udall of New Mexico, Schumer, Bennett, Collins, Franken, Casey, Udall of Colorado, Specter, McCaskill, Gillibrand, Klobuchar, and Shaheen.  We are united from every section of the country to make the point that when we talk about the deep recession we are facing, this is a recession that is impacting rural America very severely, and we cannot forget about rural America.  Right now, at this moment, dairy farmers across the country are suffering from the lowest milk prices in four decades. In the last year, the price farmers received for milk has plummeted 41 percent. I ask for support on the amendment.
