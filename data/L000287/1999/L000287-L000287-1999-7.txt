Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning to congratulate the Atlanta Braves, America's team. I wish Bobby Cox and all the members of the Braves family the very best in their great nonviolent struggle against the New York Yankees.  I say this morning: Braves, go Braves. Go and win. You must win. When you win, America wins. Go Braves. Go Braves.                          ____________________
