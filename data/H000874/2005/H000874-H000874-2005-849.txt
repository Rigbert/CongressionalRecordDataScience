Speaker, in the constantly changing world of Capitol Hill, all of us who are privileged to serve here recognize that people come and go--Members, staff, journalists, lobbyists and others.  And, if you work hard and have some luck, you can make your mark and make a difference in this great city and the life of our Nation.  Today, we mourn the loss of a truly wonderful woman who clearly did just that by establishing, along with her husband, one of Washington's enduring institutions--the Monocle restaurant. For 25 years, Helen Anton Valanos and her husband, Conrad (``Connie''), operated the Monocle, which the Washingtonian magazine recently said ``remains a Hollywood East of political stars,'' and ``a sort of political refuge flying a white flag . . . a place where Republicans and Democrats mix over food and drink and the bad blood between political parties seems to get bottled and checked at the door.''  Mrs. Valanos passed away on January 4th in Boca Raton, Florida, where she had lived since 1985. But the memories of her--like the political lore that has been generated at the Monocle for more than four decades--will always be with us.  She was born in Anderson, Indiana, and graduated from the University of Miami before settling in Washington with Connie in 1950. She worked with her husband in their accounting firm, and then, in 1960, they opened the Monocle. As the Washingtonian recounted: ``The Monocle opened with no advertising, no sign outside and all 86 seats filled for lunch.'' And thus was born, in September 1960, a place to see and be seen.  Today, says John Valanos, who since 1989 has run the restaurant that his parents started, three-quarters of his customers are ``people coming to the Hill to do business or to show friends or family what Washington is all about. They stop to see the photos on the wall, to experience some of the history that makes us unique. They say this is where JFK dined, where Mark Russell taped his CNN shows.''  During much of that time, as The Washington Post recently noted: ``Mrs. Valanos, a stylish presence at the restaurant for 25 years, would leave her bookkeeping duties upstairs, enter the restaurant and sweep through the room, greeting customers and making sure the regulars had a momentary chat with the owner.''  The secret to the Monocle's success is not only its proximity to Capitol Hill, its great food and its unique ambience, but also the fact that Connie and Helen--and now their son John--have nurtured a politically nonpartisan establishment and worked to protect the privacy of the public figures who dined there. Personally, I remember going to the Monocle when I was still a Congressional aide in the 1960s, and still go there for dinner and political fund-raisers.  I know that I speak for literally thousands of Members and others in offering my deepest condolences to Connie, John, the Valanos' other son, George, and the entire Valanos family for their loss.                          ____________________
