 President, since 1963, the month of May has helped the nation focus on the contributions and achievements of America's older citizens. Fewer people over the age of 65 require nursing home care and more are living on their own, with little or no outside help. Older Americans increasingly redefine modern maturity, re-shape cultural boundaries and dispel age-related stereotypes associated with getting older. They are leaders in our families, in our workplaces and in our communities.  One of these leaders is a 71-year-old man from Davenport, Iowa. Larry Sinclair understands the value of helping others. Through his initiative, compassion, and commitment, he has touched the lives of many in the Davenport community.  Originally from Maine, Mr. Sinclair and his wife, Sylvia, moved to Davenport in 1959. A 33-year veteran of the Rock Island Arsenal, Mr. Sinclair became involved with helping seniors after his retirement. At the time, his mother in Maine was suffering from Alzheimer's Disease and the distance prevented Mr. Sinclair from helping his sister care for her on a regular basis.  After hearing a presentation at church about respite assistance for caregivers, Mr. Sinclair decided it was time to get involved. Although he couldn't go to Maine to give his sister the respite she needed, he could provide help to caregivers in Davenport. For eight years, Mr. Sinclair volunteered up to 10 hours a week to provide relief to caregivers in the community. Although he is no longer actively involved in the program, he still keeps in touch with several of families that he worked with over the years.  Mr. Sinclair's commitment to seniors in the community has been instrumental in the success of one of the few all-volunteer congregate meal sites in Iowa. Eleven years ago, Mr. Sinclair helped establish the meal site at his church. Every Tuesday, he and his wife spend the their day serving a meal to 25-30 seniors. Mr. and Mrs. Sinclair do everything from meal pick-up in the morning to clean-up in the afternoon. Although Mr. Sinclair has the formal title of meal site manager, he gives much of the credit to his wife. He says the two of them make a ``pretty good team.''  Mr. Sinclair also is highly active in the Great River Bend Area Agency on Aging. He has been a member of the agency's policy board for the past six years, serving as its president last year and vice president this year. As an Operation Restore Trust volunteer he makes presentations to various senior groups, nursing homes and assisted living facilities about Medicare fraud and abuse. He has served as a delegate to aging association meetings in Washington, DC, and he is a member of the agency's nutrition committee and services committee.  In 1959, Mr. Sinclair became a charter member of the West Park Presbyterian Church and he is still actively involved in serving the congregation. Friends know that if they need help, Mr. Sinclair is the first one to call. He serves as an elder in the church and chairman of the committee that is responsible for programming church activities and fundraisers. Mr. Sinclair says he feels it is important for people like him, who have the time to help, to do what they can to keep the church growing for younger members.  A devoted family man, Mr. Sinclair has been married to his wife Sylvia for 50 years. The couple has three daughters, four grandchildren and one great-grandchild. Mr. Sinclair stays physically active by walking with his wife three miles a day. In addition, he enjoys golfing and biking.  With all of these activities, Mr. Sinclair's friends sometimes wonder if he is one of those people who just can't say no. But, Mr. Sinclair refutes that characterization, saying he chooses not to say no because he enjoys what he does.  I want to thank Mr. Sinclair for his contributions to the Davenport community. His initiative and compassionate concern for others is an example to us all that we should always be willing to help others, no matter what our age.                          ____________________
