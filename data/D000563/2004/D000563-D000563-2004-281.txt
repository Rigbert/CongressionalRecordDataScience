President, the Senator from South Dakota, Mr. Daschle, has advised me that his flight to Washington was delayed due to weather conditions. His flight was scheduled to arrive earlier this afternoon, but the delay resulted in his unavoidable absence during the previous vote on the Hutchison amendment. Senator Daschle has advised me that had he been here he would have voted ``yea.''                          ____________________
