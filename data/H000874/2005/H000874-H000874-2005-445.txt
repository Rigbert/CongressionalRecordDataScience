Chairman, from 1789 to 2002, the Federal Government got a free ride from the States in the administration of elections. We did not pay a nickel to elect any Member of Congress, any United States Senator, any President, or on running elections.  If we care about the quality and credibility of our election system, we must strive in the months ahead to provide the remaining $800 million.  Mr. Chairman, I hope you work with me. I intend to work with the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hastert) and the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ney) and the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Olver) and the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey) in accomplishing this objective. It is an important objective to meet our promises and not have unfunded mandates, and to make sure that America's elections are run in a fashion that will continue to be an example for the rest of the world and the pride of our own country.
