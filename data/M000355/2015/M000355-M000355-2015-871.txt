 President, many thought we would never get here, but we have. Later today, the Senate will pass a multiyear highway bill that does not raise taxes by a penny, and we will do it on a broad bipartisan basis. This is more than just another accomplishment for the Senate. It is a win for our country because the bill would cut redtape and streamline regulations, it would modernize infrastructure and advance research and innovation, it would enact new transparency measures to empower Americans to see how much of their tax money is actually being spent, and because it is a multiyear bill it would give States, cities, and towns the certainty they need to better plan road and bridge projects well into the future.  The multiyear nature of this legislation is one of its most critical components. It is also something the House and Senate are not united on. We all want the House to have the space it needs to develop its own bill because we all want to work out the best possible legislation for the American people in conference later this year. So we will take up a measure this afternoon to give them that space, while also delivering important relief to veterans.  The bill will extend a helping hand to heroes who need it by covering unfunded requirements the administration failed to budget for. I hope we will rally in support of veterans when that measure is considered, just as we continue to rally in support of a multiyear bipartisan and fiscally responsible highway bill we will pass today.  Some never thought this day would come, but thanks to the enduring dedication of Senators on both sides of the aisle--in particular, Senator Inhofe, Senator Boxer, as well as Senator Thune, Senator Nelson, and Senator Hatch--it is here.                          ____________________
