The Toledo Blade ran two headlines. One reads, ``Jeep reductions: Firm warns up to 2,035 Toledo jobs to be cut.'' The second headline read, ``Expanded PT Cruiser Output Bypasses City of Toledo for Mexico.''  Welcome to post-NAFTA America. Here we have a company shifting production from the United States at the expense of our workers. Make no mistake, these are excellent jobs we are talking about. These are not minimum-wage jobs with no benefits. These are not low-tech jobs. They are the type of jobs that any community in America would fight for. These are middle-class jobs. That is what Toledo and the State of Ohio did, in fact. They went out and fought for the Jeep jobs. The taxpayers invested hundreds of millions of dollars to keep those jobs in Ohio and in the United States, and now Chrysler is cutting 2,000 jobs in Toledo at the same time as it is adding production lines in Mexico to make the popular PT Cruiser.  Now President Bush wants to expand NAFTA, he tells us. Is this the promise of NAFTA, 2,000 more families out of work and good jobs in our country? Is this what the future looks like under a hemispheric NAFTA known as Free Trade of the Americas, FTAA? Is this what you get with Fast Track?  President Bush went to Quebec City last week to push for NAFTA's expansion to the free trade of the Americas. He made some interesting claims about what his version of free trade envisions. There was some talk about labor rights and environmental standards and democracy. That sounds well and good, but we need to see concrete action to back up the rhetoric.  In Quebec City, President Bush said it is clear to me that ours is a hemisphere united by freedom. How about the freedom of workers to earn a living wage and to know that they are protected against workplace injury and guaranteed the right to organize the worth of their labor? How about the freedom for families to know what is in their food? How about the freedom of a mother on the border in Mexico knowing that the water is safe to drink and the air fit to breathe? How about the freedom for Members of Congress to have access to all the working documents and drafts of these agreements, not only the multinational giants that helped to negotiate the agreement that we are likely to consider?  In Quebec City, President Bush said, ``Our commitment to open trade must be matched by a strong commitment to protecting our environment and improving labor standards.'' But then he did a pirouette and he said, ``We should not allow labor and environmental codicils to destroy the spirit of free trade.''  He had it right the first time.  Those of us on the other side of the argument have been saying for years that these trade agreements should give individuals the same rights as multinational corporations. The President was wrong when he said labor andenvironmental provisions would destroy free trade. If free trade cannot accommodate labor and environmental concerns, it does not deserve to be known as free.  If the extension of the right for labor to organize, the right to free speech and the right to a safe and livable environment are things that would destroy a trade regime, maybe we should reconsider our trade priorities. Adding labor and environmental rights as a side agreement or included with fig-leaf compromises is completely unacceptable. We learned our lesson with NAFTA, the hard way.  President Bush said, and I quote, ``I am confident I will have trade promotion authority by the end of the year because I think most people in the United States Congress understand that trade is beneficial to our hemisphere.  ``It is in our Nation's best interest to have the President have trade promotion authority,'' he said.  Congress does understand that trade can be beneficial to our hemisphere. We also know it can be unbeneficial. We do not need Fast Track to create a trading system that is fair to all nations and workers. We need a trading system that will lift up workers everywhere and help us maintain our standard of living in America. We need a trade agreement that will lift workers up, not leave behind 2,000 more families in Toledo while factories in Mexico gear up to meet a demand for a very popular vehicle on the backs of an exploited workforce that works for slave wages.  Madam Speaker, our rallying cry as we approach the Free Trade Agreement of the Americas debate must be free trade among free people and no less.                          ____________________
