Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to Mr. Duffy's amendment. I have listened to his arguments very closely. My interest in this is the American Indian and Alaska Native and Hawaiian Native. My interest is because this program, the CDFI, is the one program where they have access to moneys, and they cannot get it from the standard lending institutions for their businesses that they are trying to create. And it has worked successfully in Alaska and in the lower 48, too.  I would suggest, respectfully, that a lot of people don't understand, we don't have a road system. Most of our--in fact, all of our villages don't have banks, and this program can work and does work very well to try to improve their lot. And I say they have been successful at creating new jobs that create money.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to suggest one thing. I listened to these arguments about the money we are appropriating, and I wish everybody would understand in this body we cannot create jobs by creating government jobs. That is not real money. That is money that is being consumed. And this body has been neglectful in creating jobs from resources and manufacturing from, have not supported, nor have they made the suggestion that this should be done.  So we talk about these programs, we need to have money available to create jobs that create real money, and a lot of this is done in the rural communities in my State of Alaska and the Indian country in the lower 48.  So I suggest the gentleman has a point, but not a strong enough point to have me vote for his amendment.
