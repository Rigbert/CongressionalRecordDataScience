 Mr. Speaker, Congress isn't doing its job to investigate the fraud that has infected our entire financial system, fraud perpetrated by Wall Street, and it has hurt the global financial system as well. I think the reason is that too many people have forgotten that gambling with other people's money often entices very addictive personalities who are incapable of self-policing. They need rules, they need limits, and they need oversight. Otherwise they just keep getting into the same trouble again and again, harming innocent people in the process by looting their assets.  The American people know that corruption on Wall Street is pervasive, and millions upon millions of our fellow citizens have been harmed by it. The Republican leadership in this House have failed in their responsibility to aggressively investigate crime in the financial services sector.  Earlier this month, I spoke about Bloomberg's report on how President Bush's Secretary of the Treasury, Hank Paulson, in 2000, inappropriately and behind closed doors in a private meeting tipped off his former colleagues at Goldman Sachs and a handful of Wall Street insiders about how Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac might collapse and what steps the government intended to take. All of this occurred on the very same day that Secretary Paulson led The New York Times to believe that those two companies would give a signal of confidence to the markets.  You can imagine what those financial insiders did with their investments before the rest of America was even aware.  I also reminded my colleagues that the Securities and Exchange Commission was finally rebutted recently in a New York court for settling fraud cases with major Wall Street banks like Citigroup in a way that allowed the biggest banks to walk away by simply paying a few fines without so much as admitting any wrongdoing.  I ask, where is this Congress' oversight of these most crucial financial machinations that have so harmed our Nation and world since the market crashed in 2008?  Finally, after months and months of press coverage, Congress is taking a tad of action. Last week, the House's Agriculture Committee held one of the first hearings we have seen all year. That hearing, called by Chairman Frank Lucas of Oklahoma and Ranking Member Collin Peterson of Minnesota, began to shed some light on what is the eighth-largest bankruptcy in U.S. history at MF Global Holdings. Its misdeeds had been widely reported, but they deserve much closer scrutiny. We need to subpoena their full records and transactions that led to the collapse.  Even before last week's hearings, we knew that MF Global Holdings filed for Chapter 11 on October 30. Citizens in my district have been impacted and harmed as over $1 billion disappeared from customer accounts. The Washington Post and other press reported weeks ago that the firm's CEO, former Governor Jon Corzine, had essentially placed a $6.3 billion bet on the sovereign debt of several European Governments. After its most recent quarterly return showed almost $200 million in losses, MF Global stock lost 67 percent of its value.  But this is not just a case of an investment firm being lured by the higher returns of riskier bonds. As investigators continue to piece together what happened at MF Global, there is increasing evidence of criminal activity. This case has all the trappings of a massive case of fraud.  Now, CME Group Incorporated, which audited MF Global's accounts, reported weeks ago that Mr. Corzine's company violated key Federal requirements to keep its accounts separate from their customer accounts. At last week's Agriculture Committee hearing, the public was once again told that as much as $1.2 billion may still be missing from segregated customer accounts.  This isn't just a case of misplaced money. The financial press has been reporting a staggering amount of malfeasance in the days before MF Global filed for bankruptcy. In an apparent effort to buy themselves time, MF Global sent checks instead of wiring money. Many of those checks, we all know now, bounced. There are stories of requests to transfer funds being denied and even inaccurate account statements being issued. Even more egregious are accounts of people receiving bounced checks going back and finding their accounts were also altered inappropriately. May I ask, if this doesn't sound like fraud, what is it?                              {time}  2120  The American people must demand more congressional oversight. Congress needs to produce more information.  I attended last week's hearing in the House Agriculture Committee. While some important questions were asked of Mr. Corzine, Congress' responsibility has been far from met. Anyone who carefully followed the hearing watched as Mr. Corzine dodged questions and provided hollow responses.  The Wall Street Journal provided us with an interesting assessment of Mr. Corzine's testimony that is worth entering in the Record. According to the Journal, Governor Corzine ducked or deflected questions 15 times. On five occasions, he used a well known strategy for avoiding accountability by using some variant of the phrase, ``I did not intend to break any rules.'' He apologized or expressed regret six times for the damage his choices wrought on countless families and businesses. But the operative fact is $1.2 billion; that is the amount that is missing from MF Global's segregated client funds for which Mr. Corzine could provide no explanation. In fact, astoundingly, this seasoned trader pleaded ignorance of what was happening at his own company.  Let me mention that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Jill Sommers, a representative who testified at the hearing, was very invaluable to public understanding.
