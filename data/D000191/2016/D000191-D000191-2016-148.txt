Speaker, I rise today on the House floor to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the National Collegiate Honors Council. The NCHC, which is dedicated to achieving excellence in education in diverse subject and curriculum areas, represents over 800 colleges and universities around the country and over 800,000 honors students.  I would also like to honor Lane Community College, in my district, on their membership in the National Collegiate Honors Council. After joining the Council in 2011, the college was able to establish multiple honors classes in various disciplines in order to promote a liberal education approach. Striving to implement an honorary program displays the motivation to up the academic standards of Lane Community College and compete with other institutions. Members of this honor program conduct undergraduate research, which is later shared with the campus community and public in an academic symposium each spring. Several findings from these research studies have been used by both the college and community.  As graduates of this prestigious honor program, students from Lane Community College often receive scholarships and transfer to various institutions in order to complete their degree at a higher level of competency. These same students go on to become the future leaders of America.  Congratulations to the National Collegiate Honors Council on its 50th anniversary and to Lane Community College on their continued success in providing exceptional education opportunities for their students.                          ____________________
