We have some 17 Departments for which we have oversight and we deal with on a daily basis. When the Nuclear Regulatory Commission was originally formed, it was to have the expertise and the knowledge as to what is going to assure the most safety for the public in the cheapest way you can get things done. They have done a good job. We have a lot of organizations such as this throughout Government. We have CASAC, the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee. We look to them because they have expertise. We look to the NRC because they have expertise.  I do not want to imply that any of the Members here would have necessarily less expertise than the NRC, but I suspect that is the case. So we rely on that expertise. Here we have the Department of Energy with all of its experts saying: This is the safe way to do it. This is the cheapest way to do it. And we have the NRC, which is charged with the responsibility of public safety, saying: This is the best way to do it.  So I believe, when the time comes, we need to look at this rationally and not try to make disparaging remarks about some of the members of the Armed Services Committee in our consideration of this amendment. Keep in mind, this was years in the making. Six years ago we started hearings on how to properly dispose of this, and the conclusions they came to were unanimous.  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.
