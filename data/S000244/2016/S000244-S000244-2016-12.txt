Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman from Washington for offering this amendment, and I support it.  This amendment clarifies that grant monies authorized by H.R. 5046 can be used to fund community-based substance abuse diversion programs sponsored by law enforcement agencies.  There are a variety of programs across the country administered by State and local law enforcement and prosecuting agencies that offer diversion to drug treatment and other services as an alternative to incarceration.  In my home State of Wisconsin, Treatment Alternatives and Diversion, or TAD, programs ``offer offenders the opportunity to enter and do voluntary substance abuse treatment, case management, and other risk reduction services as a safe alternative to jail or prison confinement. Diverting nonviolent offenders into substance abuse treatment keeps them out of jail and correctional facilities, thereby saving bed space and taxpayer dollars, as well as treating the underlying addiction that may have influenced the commission of a crime or may contribute to future criminal behavior.''  These are precisely the types of treatment alternatives to incarceration programs that I believe should be eligible for funding through this new Department of Justice grant.  I thank the gentlewoman from Washington for working with us on drafting the amendment.  I urge my colleagues to join me in support of it.  I reserve the balance of my time.  Ms. DelBENE. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson).
