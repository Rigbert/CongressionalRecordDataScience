Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I congratulate the Slovak Club of Merrillville, Indiana, as the organization celebrates its 100th anniversary. In honor of this momentous occasion, the Slovak Club is hosting a celebratory event on Saturday, September 28, 2013, at the club hall in Merrillville, Indiana.   The Slovak Club of Merrillville was first established in 1913 when a group of Slovak men joined together with the goal of preserving Slovak heritage and tradition at Holy Trinity Catholic Church in Gary. The group initially called themselves the Slovak Political and Educational Club. After World War II, members of the club wanted a permanent home and purchased property at 11th Avenue and Harrison Boulevard in Gary. The Ladies Auxiliary was established in 1950, and once the new building was complete, the auxiliary began hosting dinners featuring shrimp, fish, and traditional Slovak fare, which were tremendously successful. The organization continued to grow over the next twenty years with membership exceeding more than 450 members. By 1979, the organization's Board of Directors sold the Slovak Club building in Gary, and members began meeting at the Slovak American Legion Post #367. The current home for the Slovak Club in Merrillville, at 69th Avenue and Broadway, was completed in 1986. For the past 100 years, Slovak Club members have dedicated their time and efforts to many charitable organizations throughout the community, and for this they are to be commended.   I would like to take this time to recognize the Slovak Club officers and Board of Directors. The officers are President Ronald Mayersky, Vice President Randall Mayersky, Treasurer John Dienes, Financial Secretary Kenneth Dienes, and Recording Secretary John Brezik. The Board of Directors include Robert Deliget, Peter Guip, George Murray, Donald Engel, Paul Rogers, Joseph Koveck, John Stofko, William Mindas, and Ed Mayersky.   I would also note with pride that my 97-year-old father, former Gary Mayor John Visclosky, continues his membership in this noteworthy fraternal organization, as do I.   Mr. Speaker, at this time, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in recognizing the 100th anniversary of the Slovak Club of Merrillville, Indiana. The Slovak community has played an important role in enriching the quality of life and culture of Northwest Indiana. For their commitment to civic endeavors and to preserving Slovak traditions, the Slovak Club's leaders and membership are worthy of our highest praise.                          ____________________
