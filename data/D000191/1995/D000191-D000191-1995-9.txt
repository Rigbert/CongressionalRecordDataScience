Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  Earlier I heard some confusing statements from the other side talking about the Clinton ICC. You know, two of the three current sitting commissioners are Reagan-Bush appointees. They talked about the reversal of this decision by the Clinton ICC. Would that it were. Would that there were five members, would that, you know, five members sitting, that a majority had been appointed by President Clinton and confirmed by the Senate. But that is not the case.  So this precedent which was talked about earlier is not the result of the current administration reversing the field here.  But what I rise to do is speak in support of the Whitfield amendment. There is a question of equity here now with the recent Burlington Northern-Santa Fe merger. We have the top seven executives at Burlington Northern getting golden parachutes worth $35 million.
