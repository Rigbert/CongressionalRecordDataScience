  There are others who wish to speak.  The amendment is as follows:       On p 360, between lines 21 and 22, insert the following:       (e) Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect      existing law or authorities, relating to the detention of      United States citizens, lawful resident aliens of the United      States or any other persons who are captured or arrested in      the United States.  I will yield the floor.
