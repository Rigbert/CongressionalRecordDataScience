Chair, I would like to thank the majority and minority for accepting my amendment to the farm bill on invasive species en bloc.  My amendment requires the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to submit an annual report to Congress on invasive species.  The report would include a list of invasive species in the country, their country of origin, how they got into the country, what year they entered the country, rate of entry, cost estimates, and a description of the ongoing research occurring to combat the species.  More importantly, the report must include a description of any legal recourse available to people affected by the species.  A 2005 study shows that invasive species cost the United States more than $120 billion in damages every year.  U.S. agriculture loses $13 billion annually in crops from invasive insects.  Every farmer, rancher, local government, non-profit or small business deserves to know what legal avenues are available to compensate them for dealing with an invasive species that was brought into their backyard through no fault of their own.  Invasive species are not just harmful to humans or our food supply. They affect our endangered animals.  More than 400 of the over 1,300 species currently protected under the Endangered Species Act, and more than 180 candidate species for listing are considered to be at risk at least partly due to displacement by, competition with, or predation by invasive species.  My amendment seeks to bring an understanding to the challenge we are facing in combating invasive species.  Currently, no single clearinghouse exists to find out how many invasive species there are in the country, where those species came from, and what research is ongoing to combat that particular species.  How are we ever going to come up with a national strategy to combat invasive species if we don't know how what we are up against.  This information needs to be available to the public so we can begin a national conversation and put our best and brightest to the task of coming up with solutions for combating invasive species.  Again, I would like to thank the Members of the Agriculture Committee and I look forward to the remaining 2013 Farm Bill debates.                          ____________________
