 President, I rise today to state that I object to proceeding to the consideration of an executive nominee to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The nominee is Joseph Timothy Kelliher, who is listed as a ``senior policy advisor'' to the Secretary of the Energy Department.  I have an outstanding document request at the Energy Department, and I must be certain that it will be answered in a timely and complete manner. I am also concerned that some Department of Energy officials are, among other things, misconstruing an amendment that I offered to H.R. 2754. My amendment is section 316 of the Energy and Water Appropriations Act, H.R. 2754, and it transfers claims processing responsibilities for ``Subtitle D'' of the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000, EEOICPA, from the Department of Energy to the Department of Labor. I am trying to get some answers and straighten that out as well.                          ____________________
