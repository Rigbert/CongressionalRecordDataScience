It depends on one's perspective. The amendment he just described that he added to the bill is a valuable part of this bill. It wasn't there originally. It is now. I am glad it is. I am happy to support it. That is what we are trying to do today, to move its passage so it becomes the law of the land. But because we fell short by only two Republican votes coming forward today, we can't move forward.  If the position of the Senator is we should not pass his amendment or this underlying bill until we reform Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, I am with him in terms of the reformation. I don't believe it is reasonable to require this bill to do everything that needs to be done. That is my only difference with the Senator from Georgia.
