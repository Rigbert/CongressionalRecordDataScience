 President, when I quote the Democratic leader, I use his exact words--his exact words--which I did throughout my comments. Yet he makes up words for me. I have never said the Senate is working fine. I think the Senate has been disastrously run for the last 2 years--disastrously run not because of the rules but because of the operation. And it is certainly not the fault of the Republicans.  Take the budget, for example, which can be done with a simple majority. We haven't had a budget in 3 years.
