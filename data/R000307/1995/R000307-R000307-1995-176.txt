 As the gentleman has indicated, Ed Madigan and the Madigan family come from Illinois, Lincoln, IL, as he has stated, to be exact. And to borrow from President Lincoln's famous address, it is altogether fitting and proper that we do this.  More especially, in regard to the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Ewing], who is now so ably representing the 15th district, Mr. Ewing, like Ed Madigan, serves on the House Agriculture Committee, and in many ways, I think, exemplifies Ed Madigan's legacy of positive attributes.  All of us who have admired and known and love Ed want to thank my colleague, more especially, for taking this special order.   [[Page H191]] In the House we have a parliamentary means that allows us to say, in essence, ``That was a mighty fine speech.'' Or, ``What you said certainly makes sense to me.'' And we put it this way: ``I thank the gentleman,'' or ``gentlewoman, and I associate myself with his remarks.''  Now today there are many, many of Ed's friends who share our sense of personal loss and love for this man and his family, who associate themselves with this special order.  In this regard I do want to make special mention of former Congressman Bob Smith of Oregon. It was Bob Smith and Pat Roberts, along with any farmer and rancher who knew Ed Madigan, who thought we should and fought to make Ed Secretary of Agriculture. We had been riding shotgun with him for a long time.  The same applies to the members of the ``team'' Madigan, if I may use that term, both on the Hill and at the Department of Agriculture, talking about Chuck Hilty, Bill O'Connor, Diane Liesman, Jackie Parke, Mary McGrane, Allie Devine, and Jim Waller.  I would also like to make special mention of former deputy secretary of agriculture Ann Veneman, who worked with Secretary Madigan in streamlining the USDA and certainly making it more cost-effective. I know this list could go on for many special orders in regards to Ed's many friends, but I also want to mention one person, Ed's special friend, Joe Quattrone, or ``Joe Q.,'' of the House barbershop. All of us miss him, and he is part of us.  Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentleman of the House, in reflecting on what I would like to say and should say during this special order, I came to one very obvious conclusion. Simply put, when our Republican leader Bob Michel spoke in giving the moving and very eloquent eulogy for Ed Madigan, he spoke for us all. And borrowing from Lincoln again, I believe we can neither add nor detract from what Bob Michel stated.  Mr. Michel's eulogy will follow my remarks. So in closing, let me say on behalf of Ed's family, his wife Evelyn--and what a source of strength and resolve and love she has been to us all and to Ed and the family: To Kim, Kellie, Mary Elizabeth, brother Bob, sister Sandra, and all of the grandchildren, that we share in your sense of personal loss and that you are in our prayers.  If Ed were with us today, in his true Irish wit, he would put his glasses down on his nose, sitting somewhere in the House, and as he has done many times in the House Committee on Agriculture, he would say, ``That is enough, Roberts.''  But I do want to repeat a quote from Helen Steiner Rice which I think pretty well sums up how we feel and how we should feel as we celebrate Ed's life. Helen Steiner Rice said the following:     When I must leave you for a little while,       Please go on bravely with a gallant smile     And for my sake and in my name,       Live on and do all things the same--     Spend not your life in empty days,       But fill each waking hour in useful ways--     Reach out your hand in comfort and in cheer,       And I in turn will comfort you and hold you near.  And that is the way that Ed would want us to conduct ourselves, to live our lives to the fullest, thankful that the Lord really gave us the opportunity to know him and to share this all too brief time in space.  I submit the eulogy of Mr. Michel for the Record.               Eulogy for the Honorable Edward R. Madigan     (Offered by Republican Leader Robert H. Michel, Dec. 12, 1994)       Evelyn, Kim, Kellie, Mary Elizabeth, brother Bob, Sister      Sandra and Grandchildren.       It's a most difficult task to be called upon to speak when      you are overcome with grief in the passing of a loved one.       All the more so when it's your close friend and colleague      who has been taken from you so suddenly.       We find it particularly hard to take when the last time we      saw Ed, scarcely two months ago, he was in his usual good      form speaking atop a couple of bales of straw at a Logan      County Pig Roast he was hosting for Ray LaHood just before      the election.       We simply can't fathom the speed with which the scourge of      cancer can take its toll on what we all perceived as a very      healthy, robust, tall and erect good-looking fellow like Ed      Madigan.       Who are we to know what our fate will bring--the whys and      wherefores--all we know and feel is that Ed was taken from us      all too soon.       His was a life deeply steeped in politics, and devoted      primarily to public service.       I knew him as a very able state legislator before he came      to the Congress where he served for another 20 years prior to      being selected by President Bush as his Secretary of      Agriculture.       During the extended period we worked closely together and      became fast friends.       He was not the flamboyant type, but rather one who prided      himself in doing his homework, quietly going about his      business, getting the facts, and being a stickler for detail.       In short, he was a legislator of the old school.       A legislative craftsman genuinely interested--and      marvelously skilled--in forming good legislation out of the      give-and-take of debate and discussion.       To legislate successfully in a democracy means not only      being able to understand the problems, or articulate the      problems, but also the rare ability to work with colleagues      on both sides of the aisle to solve the problems.       Some political activists call such an approach      ``compromise.'' Ed called it by its real name: democracy in      action.       I can tell you from experience that not everyone is capable      of enduring the long hours, the endless debates, the mixture      of raging ego and intense ambition and partisan enmities that      make up so much of the legislative process.       But Ed Madigan, with that sense of civility and reserve and      decency which seemed inherent in him, went about his work      patiently and proudly, always being the perfect gentleman.       He was proud to be a public servant at a time when public      service has been getting bad press.       Well, Ed Madigan's life is the answer we give to those who      doubt that a genuine sense of public service still live in      this country.       As a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee and of the      Agriculture Committee, Ed always brought to his duties that      enviable but indefinable quality called class.       Ernest Hemingway once defined courage as ``grace under      pressure.'' We might similarly define class as grace under      the glaring spotlight of public life.       There was a sense of easy, good-humored charm about Ed,      always tempered by that sense of reserve, that attractive      reticence, that innate self-possession that is as rare as it      is admirable in the rough and tumble world of politics.       And that is how we will remember him: his class, his sense      of calm amidst the storm, the easy, comfortable charm of the      born leader.  Again I thank the gentleman for yielding and reserving this special order.
