 On June 7, 2001, President Bush signed the legislation. On Friday, June 7 of this year, the President marked the first anniversary of that event in Des Moines, Iowa. I was pleased to join the President for that anniversary celebration.  One year ago this week, the Treasury Department started sending out rebate checks to every American taxpayer. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an announcement from the Treasury Department dated July 26, 2001.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                  [From the Office of Public Affairs]           Treasury To Mail Out 8.1 Million Checks On Friday                            (July 26, 2001)       Tomorrow the Treasury Department will send out 8.1 million      advance payment checks to taxpayers for more than $3.4      billion in tax relief. These checks will be sent to taxpayers      whose last two digits of their Social Security numbers are      10-19.     Week Two (July 27) Social Security Numbers 10-19       Number of Checks 8.1 million       Amount of Relief $3.4 billion     Week One (July 20) Social Security Numbers 00-09       Number of Checks 7.9 million       Amount of Relief $3.3 billion       The Treasury Department will announce every week the number      of checks that are being mailed out for that week, and the      amount of tax relief that is being sent to taxpayers. Checks      will be mailed over a ten-week period, according to the last      two digits of the taxpayers Social Security number. Notices      from the Internal Revenue Service that tells taxpayers the      amount of their check and when they should expect it have      been mailed. Single taxpayers will get a check up to $300,      head of household up to $500 and married couples filing      jointly will get up to $600.       Because the Social Security number determines when checks      are mailed, taxpayers may receive their checks at different      times than their neighbors or other family members. On a      joint return, the first number listed will set the mailout      time.------------------------------------------------------------------------   If the last two digits of your Social       You should receive your            Security number are                   check the week of------------------------------------------------------------------------00-09.....................................
