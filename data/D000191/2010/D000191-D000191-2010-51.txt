 Mr. LaTOURETTE. That's what I'm talking about.  Mr. DeFAZIO. I don't know what the gentleman's complaining about. You'll get an extra $38 million and I'll get about $30 million less.  Mr. LaTOURETTE. Well, here's the skinny: That depends upon Harry Reid's putting a letter in the mail, sending it over to the chairman and the Speaker, and having another bill. Now, no disrespect to your majority, but you haven't done such a great job in passing bills since you guys took over 4 years ago. So waiting for another bill to come--and, quite frankly, trying not to be partisan about this, but this mess was created by George Bush and it is perpetuated by President Obama because his Transportation Secretary says they don't want to deal with the 6-year bill until March of 2011. Thirty percent of the construction trade in this country is out of work. Why wouldn't you do this?  To my distinguished friend from Oregon, all I was asking was for his State to do better. Transfer the $13 billion from this worthless tax credit and put it into infrastructure. Put these guys to work. Actually build something. Again, going back to Mr. Oberstar's wonderful speech that he always gives: a million jobs with only 8 percent of that $800 billion. Wouldn't it be great if we could give Jim Oberstar $14 billion to create jobs for America rather than coming up with this goofy tax credit that says if you hire somebody for $30,000, we're going to waive the payroll tax for November and December. Guess what? You can save $1,500 if you just give somebody a $30,000 job. It's nuts. This bill is wrong. That's what I was talking about.
