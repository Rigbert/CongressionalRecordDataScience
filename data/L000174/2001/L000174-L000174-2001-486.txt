President, I thank my friend from Delaware, but I note my amendment does not allow a separated spouse to somehow shield assets because the bill already counts income of the debtors from all sources.  The definition of ``current monthly income'' on page 18, lines 4 to 21, of the bill includes income from all sources. So if a battered spouse or anybody else conceal income on a bankruptcy schedule, that is a Federal crime.  What I do not want is a battered wife who is getting no income from a separated spouse to suddenly, if she is out there trying to put her financial situation in order, to have to consider the income of a spouse from whom she is getting no income.  I ask unanimous consent a letter from the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers, on behalf of a number of organizations, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                               American Academy of                                          Matrimonial Lawyers,                                      Chicago, IL, March 15, 2001.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on the Judiciary, Russell          Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: I write in strong support of your      ``separated spouse'' amendment to the pending means test      provisions of the bankruptcy bill not being considered by the      Senate.       I assume the current language in the bill is the result of      an unintentional drafting error. If left uncorrected, the      existing language will be draconian in its application to all      single parents with children who do not have the benefit of      any spousal income. It will particularly jeopardize a      battered spouse who flees her home with her children. This      debtor could be denied bankruptcy relief regardless of her      circumstances because the bill would count her husband's      income as well, even if she did not receive any money from      him.       The current language would impute to a single parent      debtor, for purposes of a means test, the income of a      separated spouse irrespective of whether the absentee spouse      actually contributes any income to the household.       There can be no justification that single parents with      children should suffer unduly in the bankruptcy process      because false and inflated income of an absentee spouse is      credited to debtor spouse. I support your laudable effort to      correct this oversight, which if left unrepaired, would      create a severe injustice to many women, children and      families across the country.           Respectfully yours,                                             Charles C. Shainberg.
