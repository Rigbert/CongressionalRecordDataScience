 The expansion of the National Health Service Corps is essential if health centers are to continue to meet the health care needs of their growing disadvantaged populations, and if we are to address the impending crisis in the supply of primary care doctors and dentists. Increasing the program's funding over the next several years is an important goal. The program is strongly supported by the Association of American Medical Colleges, which has called for an increase of 1,500 Corps awards per year to help meet the need for physicians caring for underserved populations and to help address rising medical student indebtedness.  In fiscal year 2007, the National Health Service Corps was funded at $126 million and the current level approved by the Appropriations Committee for fiscal year 2008 would level-fund the program. I thank the committee members for rejecting the administration's proposal which would have actually reduced funding by $10 million for this vital resource in the face of a dwindling supply of primary care doctors and dentists. While I recognize the many competing needs of important programs within the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education appropriations bill, at the very least, I would like to see the National Health Service Corps program funding increased by the $5.8 million approved by the House of Representatives.
