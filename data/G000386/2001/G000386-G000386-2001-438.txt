 President, today I rise to introduce the Enrolled Agent Credentials Protection Act. This legislation would make it clear that Enrolled Agents have the right to use their federally granted credentials, by making it clear that states shall not restrict enrolled agents from using the words ``Enrolled Agent'' or the abbreviations ``EA'' and ``E.A.''  A number of states have enacted laws that restrict the right of Enrolled Agents to use their credentials or designations as Enrolled Agents. The Supreme Court has held in similar situations that because the Federal Government grants the license, restricting its use is an unmerited exercise of state powers. This legislation is consistent with the Uniform Accountancy Act, Third Edition, as drafted by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and National Association of State Accountancy Boards.  Enrolled Agents have been providing valuable services to taxpayers since 1884. Since that time, the profession has evolved and now includes preparing and advising on tax returns for individuals, partnerships, corporations, estates, trusts and any entity with tax-reporting requirements. They also provide affordable representation to individuals and small businesses with disputes before the Internal Revenue Service. At present, there are approximately 35,000 Enrolled Agents in the country providing practical and affordable tax service to taxpayers.  Enrolled Agents are highly qualified tax professionals. While certified public accountants and licensed attorneys also represent taxpayers before the Internal Revenue Service, only Enrolled Agents are required to demonstrate to the IRS their technical competence in the field of taxation. In order to maintain their status as Enrolled Agents, they must take 72 hours of continuing professional education, reported every three years to the IRS. Because Enrolled Agents focus on federal taxes and tax administration, they are able to keep on the forefront of current changes in the law and regulations.  The Enrolled Agent designation dates to the Enabling Act of 1884 and the profession is regulated by Treasury Circular 230, the same body of regulations that governs the practice of attorneys and certified public accountants before the Internal Revenue.  This bill would restate the statutory validation that Enrolled Agents hold and allow them the right to use their credentials as Enrolled Agents. In doing so, this bill does not add to the powers that Enrolled Agents currently maintain, nor would it affect the rules and regulations provided for in Treasury Circular 230.  Section 10.30 of Circular 230 authorizes Enrolled Agents to advertise and display their ability to practice before the IRS provided the designation is not misleading or deceptive to the public. Neither Congress nor the Treasury Department ever intended for states to interfere with the right of Enrolled Agents to inform taxpayers that they hold a license to practice before the Internal Revenue Service.                                 ______                                       By
