Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, my colleagues, I rise in reluctant opposition to the amendment offered by the gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. Roth].  I do want to associate myself with the remarks of the gentleman from New York [Mr. Gilman], the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Hall], the gentleman from Nebraska [Mr. Bereuter], the gentleman from Indiana [Mr. Hamilton], all strong defenders of export programs, the Public Law 480 program.  The issue here is not so much about substance. The Roth amendment does contain some very good provisions in trade policy. There is no question about it. And the gentleman from Nebraska [Mr. Bereuter] has worked very hard. The chairman of the full committee has worked very hard, the gentleman from New York [Mr. Gilman].  But the Roth amendment also preempts what I consider to be a careful and reasoned formulation of agriculture trade policy and strategy for the next 7 years. Seven years, that is a long time. We are passing a 7-year farm bill for the first time in the history of the Congress.  We want the consistency and the predictability because this is a very important matter.  Now, what the Roth amendment does, it sets forth a 7-year plan for U.S. food assistance and a 7-year plan for an agriculture trade strategy and our export programs. This is being accomplished without the benefit of any discussion or consultation or consultation, talk, two-way street, with members of the committee of shared jurisdiction, not sole jurisdiction, shared jurisdiction. We are talking about the Committee on Agriculture.  In terms of practical effect, the Roth amendment rejects the ideas of members of the Committee on Agriculture. We do not have a chance. We have 30 members of the House Committee on Agriculture who have pending amendments that would like to offer either improving amendments or to work out some kind of compromise in regards to the entire trade and export picture.  Now, members of the Committee on Agriculture have introduced a comprehensive bill, called farm bill II. Actually it is called the Agriculture Trade and Regulatory Relief Act. It is to provide farmers with regulatory relief that will certainly enable them to compete in a very competitive global environment.  It is the intention of the chairman to consider this bill, have the final product reflect the views of the members of the Ag Committee. The Roth amendment does actually preclude this step for agriculture trade and other programs.  So the amendment effectively ends the discussions and reforms of important agriculture exports programs. I am talking about the market promotion program, something of intense and personal interest by many Members, the export enhancement program. It cuts off debate on this very important subject. This is wrong, especially in a time that our competitors are re-arming and setting up programs to gain control of the global market share.  I am concerned that the Roth amendment, by setting a goal of increasing ag exports up to $60 billion by 2002, it effectively holds our current trade levels in place. That is not the intent. But I am concerned about it if you do not have any discussion about it now. According to the Department of Agriculture, agriculture exports will reach the $60 billion level this year. This year. The Roth amendment could maintain the status quo for agriculture trade. That would be a disaster.                              {time}  1045  The Roth amendment also terminates, listen to this one, it terminates all agriculture export programs if the unilateral goals of the amendments trade strategy are not met.  Hello? A trade strategy in which not one member of the Committee on Agriculture and only a few in the Committee on International Relations actually participated should not dictate the future of American agriculture.  Members of the Committee on Agriculture want to participate in the formulation of an agriculture and trade policy. We want to work with you. We will dance with you. We will dance with you until closing time. But closing time is already here. We did not even get to dance.  All Members will be precluded from participating in this debate under the Roth amendment. Amendments Members want to include in the farm bill title included, and these are amendments we already had pending that we were going to consider in farm bill II on both sides of the aisle, protection from trade embargoes that have a detrimental effect on agriculture producers.  We have five embargo protection bills pending in the Committee on Agriculture. What is going to happen if you go to the Senate and you want embargo protection, and the Senators sit there and stare you in the face and say ``Outside the scope. Can't do that.''  Everybody knows the shattered glass effect of embargoes. We need that protection. We have a tight stocks situation right now, rumors of embargoes. We needed this amendment in this bill.  We should require the secretary to monitor the compliance of the World Trade Organization. My goodness, we have heard about that and all the trade problems in the recent presidential debate.  The chairman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Mr. Lugar, and myself, sent a letter to the President, we have to maintain strong oversight in regards to our NAFTA and GATT trade treaties. We have not done that. We need to give the Secretary strong authority to monitor those and take the appropriate action. Not in this bill.  The reform of the credit worthiness standards for the Credit Guarantee Program, so that financing requirements can better match the credit guarantee, we need to update these credit programs. We have pending amendments on that in the Committee on Agriculture.  Finally, significant reform of the Market Promotion Program. We have many amendments that want to improve and reform the Market Promotion Program. A very critical program, very controversial. We need to fix it. It is not contained in this amendment.  The Export Enhancement Program, we are already hearing commentary that with the tight stocks situation, we do not need the Export Enhancement Program anymore.  That is not right. We need to better tailor that program. These are essential programs needed to counteract the trade practices of our competitors. We want to ensure they are responsible and flexible and respond to the current trade situation.  Now, I do not mean to get obstreperous or very parochial in regards to my dear friends who have worked so hard on the Committee on International Relations in behalf of a very fine trade amendment. Members of the Senate have done the same thing.  But, folks, you just ran an end run around the committee of jurisdiction, shared jurisdiction, and we have no opportunity to offer amendments on the very key items that we are having here today.  What a way to run a railroad. Now we have already heard complaints in this body, and I share the frustration of those who say they are being denied the process.  I really think had we been able to consider this in farm bill II, and we had a commitment by the leadership to bring that bill to the floor as soon as possible, we would have had hearings in the next several weeks and we would have done this, that would have been the appropriate way.  That is why I oppose this amendment. We have an opening on the Committee on Agriculture, on the other side, but maybe we could work that out. If the gentleman from Wisconsin wants to run the committee, we might consider that. I oppose the bill. I am considering the vote. I am unhappy. And the process has been very untoward.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
