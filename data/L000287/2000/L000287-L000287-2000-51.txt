Mr. Speaker, the Negro History Bulletin, the Journal of Negro History, the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History, Black History Month--these were the creations of Carter G. Woodson. Carter G. Woodson said we must know and celebrate our history. And, he made it his life's work to see to it that we do.  From his home, Dr. Woodson ran the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History. At his home, Dr. Woodson trained the scholars and staff that researched, collected, catalogued and preserved the history of a people.  I rise in support of the designation of Dr. Woodson's home as a national historic site. There is no fitting tribute to the man and his work * * * and to the understanding and appreciation of a people that more than any other has made our Nation what it is today.
