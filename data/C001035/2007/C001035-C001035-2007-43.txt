President, shortly the Senate will vote on an amendment Senator Lieberman and I have offered to provide $100 million in badly needed funding for a new emergency communications grant program. This program is about to be authorized in the Homeland Security bill we have recently completed the conference negotiations on, and which I anticipate will be cleared either tonight or tomorrow morning.  When we look at the needs of our first responders, interoperability of communications equipment is at the top of their list. We saw on 9/11 that firefighters, police officers, and emergency medical personnel lost their lives because of an inability to communicate due to incompatible equipment. We saw it again in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, where police could not communicate with firefighters, who could not communicate with emergency medical personnel.  Unfortunately, achieving interoperability is an expensive, lengthy, and difficult process, and it is one our State and local governments need assistance in meeting. The proposal Senator Lieberman and I have put forth is a pretty modest proposal. The Homeland Security conference report authorizes a $400 million program. The budget resolution did as well for this year. What we are asking for is a modest downpayment of $100 million. It is offset by a modest reduction in other accounts.  Let me say that this amendment does have the strong support of our first responder community. It has been endorsed by the International Association of Fire Chiefs, the Congressional Fire Services Institute, the International Association of Firefighters, the International Association of Chiefs of Police, and the Association of Public Safety Communications Officials International.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that endorsement letters from those organizations be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                         International Association                                 of Fire fighters',                                    Washington, DC, July 26, 2007.     Hon. Joseph Lieberman,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Susan Collins,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Lieberman and Senator Collins: On behalf of      the nation's more than 280,000 professional fire fighters and      emergency medical personnel, I am writing to express our      support for your amendment to the 2008 Homeland Security      Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2008 providing $100      million for grants to improve emergency communications.       The Department of Homeland Security's 2006 National      Interoperability Baseline Survey found that first responder      agencies have made some progress towards achieving      interoperability. However, the failure of emergency personnel      to communicate with each other along the Gulf Coast in the      wake of Hurricane Katrina provides a stark example of just      how much work remains to ensure that first responders have      adequate communications capabilities in emergencies.       The new grant program dedicated to improving first      responder communications, established in the 9/11 Commission      Act, will help states achieve this critical goal. By      permitting funds to be used to assist with a variety of      activities, including activities to achieve basic      operability, this new program will enable states and regions      to overcome their own unique communications challenges, and      ensure a solid foundation upon which to build an      interoperable communications network.       The ability of first responders to communicate with each      other, as well as with state and federal authorities, is      integral to any effective, coordinated emergency response.      The Lieberman-Collins amendment will provide a down payment      on our commitment to help America's first responders      communicate during an emergency.       Thank you for your leadership on this vital issue and your      continued strong support of our nation's fire fighters.           Sincerely,                                           Harold A. Schaitberger,     General President.                                  ____                     [From the APCO International]    APCO Supports Lieberman-Collins Communications Interoperability                                Amendment       The Association of Public-Safety Communications Officials      (APCO) International supports Senators Lieberman and      Collins's amendment to appropriate $100 million for a new      Interoperable Communications Grant Program.       Since 2002, our nation has had to overcome the devastation      caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita on the Gulf Coast,      which showed the operational vulnerability of emergency      communications systems. The issue was not only      interoperability but also operability. Due to the lack of      operable emergency communications systems, command and      control of the disasters was almost non-existent.       Five years after September 11, 2001 APCO International      finds that, while there have been significant accomplishments      to report on issues affecting public safety communications,      there is also a disturbing lack of progress. Multiple      nationwide surveys indicate there are significant shortfalls      in communications operability and interoperability in many      regions and locales with many contributing factors. The      lessons learned from 9/11 and Hurricanes Katrina and Rita for      emergency communications are simple. Be prepared.      Preparedness, planning and training are the key elements to      achieving operability and interoperability during day-to-day      activities and disasters.       Preparedness involves planning and implementing current and      effective technology solutions. Preparedness involves      coordination and mutual aid agreements with surrounding      jurisdictions, state and federal government agencies.      Preparedness involves making sure your personnel and      equipment are able to function during any emergency and meet      the unexpected challenges that may arise at any time.      Preparedness is making sure the daily operations of the      emergency communications center are adaptable to any      unexpected situation. Preparation also includes adequate      funding for planning and operations.       We strongly believe this amendment will provide the funding      needed to vastly enhance our Nation's operability and      interoperable emergency communications systems and we hope      that your Senator can support this amendment.                                  ____                                         International Association                                               of Fire Chiefs,                                        Fairfax, VA, Mar. 2, 2007.     Hon. Joseph Lieberman,     Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental          Affairs, U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building,          Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Lieberman: On behalf of the nearly 13,000      chief fire and emergency officers of the International      Association of Fire Chiefs (IAFC), I would like to express      our support for several major provisions included in S. 4,      the Improving America's Security Act of 2007. I appreciate      the hard work and dedication your committee has put into this      legislation, and I urge the Senate to move expeditiously      towards its passage.       The IAFC is proud to endorse the information sharing      programs outlined in Title I of the bill. These programs,      which include guidelines to help integrate the fire service      into fusion centers and a fellowship program designed to      improve the exchange of intelligence data between government      entities, constitute a significant step forward in our      nation's homeland security efforts. By ensuring that fire      departments and other emergency response providers      participate directly in fusion centers, Title I will open new      doors for nontraditional information gathering, enhanced      capabilities assessments, and better coordination between the      fire service and law enforcement in planning for and      responding to major disasters. Simply put, these changes will      make our information sharing programs more effective and our      country safer.       Additionally, the IAFC strongly supports the operable and      interoperable communications programs defined in Title III.      The IAFC is working with partners in public safety on      numerous fronts to strengthen the voice and data      communications capabilities of first responders throughout      the United States. Accomplishing this goal requires adequate      spectrum for responders to communicate, as well as funding      for purchase and installation of the equipment necessary to      utilize the available spectrum. At present, substantial      action remains to be taken by the federal government on both      fronts, and Title III of S. 4 will make a positive      contribution by authorizing over $3 billion for the Emergency      Communications Operable and Interoperable Grants program.       Furthermore, the IAFC supports the critical infrastructure      provisions set forth in Title X of the Improving America's      Security Act. The IAFC looks forward to working towards Title      X's critical infrastructure goals through the partnership      model currently reflected in the National Infrastructure      Protection Plan (NIPP). In particular, we believe that      ensuring adequate protection for human elements--as well as      physical and cyber elements--will be an essential part of the      critical infrastructure protection efforts carried out by the      fire service under this title.       Finally, the IAFC strongly believes that however grant      reform measures (such as those described in Title II) are      resolved in this legislation, the final product should      preserve the all-hazards nature of the FIRE and SAFER Act      grant programs. These programs were created with an emphasis      on equipping the fire service with the tools, equipment,      training, staff, and other resources needed to respond      effectively to all types of emergencies--whether natural or      man-made, great or small. In its present form, section      2002(c) of the Improving America's Security Act fully      protects the FIRE and SAFER Act grant programs, and any      changes to the grant reform section should preserve section      2002(c) as it is currently written.       As the primary fire service leadership organization in the      United States, the IAFC would like to thank you and your      dedicated staff for your work thus far on S. 4. The IAFC      stands ready to provide you with information and support as      the Improving America's Security Act of 2007 moves forward in      the legislative process.           Sincerely,                                            Chief James B. Harmes,     CFO, President.                                  ____                                                     June 7, 2007.     Hon. Joseph I. Lieberman,     Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental          Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Hon. Susan Collins,     Ranking Member, Committee on Homeland Security and          Governmental Affairs U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Lieberman and Ranking Member Collins: On      behalf of our organizations, we urge you to consider the      following issues as conference negotiations on H.R. 1, the      Implementing the 9/11 Commission Recommendations Act, and S.      4, the Improving America's Security Act get underway.      Individually and collectively, we appreciate the support you      have shown for the fire and emergency services through your      work on this critical homeland security legislation.       Over the past sereral years, the question of how homeland      security grant funding should be distributed has been an      extremely contentious issue. While we do not have a position      on how this matter should be resolved, we do ask that you      make sure that the FIRE and SAFER Act grant programs are not      affected by reforms included in the conference report. The      FIRE and SAFER Act grant programs were created with an      emphasis on equipping the fire service with the tools,      equipment, training, staffing, and other resources needed to      respond effectively to all types of emergencies--whether      natural or man-made,     great or small. Section 2002 of each bill fully protects      these programs, and any compromise grant reform section      should preserve these safeguards.       A second issue of critical importance to the fire service      is the ability to communicate effectively. As you know, first      life responders throughout the United States are currently      facing major challenges in the area of wireless      communications. Fortunately, both H.R. 1 and S. 4 create new      grant programs designed to help address this problem. In      crafting the final version of the communications grant      program, we ask you to retain the $3.3 billion authorization      total included in S. 4, ensure that funding is available for      both operable and interoperable communications projects, and      build in flexibility allowing funding to be used for systems      in a wide range of operating frequencies. Furthermore, we      urge you to ensure that these grants utilize the Department      of Homeland Security's SAFECOM grant guidance and fund all of      the areas defined in the SAFECOM ``Interoperability      Continuum,'' including governance.       In addition to seeking progress on the issues above, the      first responder community also wishes to see a well-prepared      private sector that will voluntarily take its share of      responsibility for emergency preparedness and business      continuity. The voluntary private sector preparedness program      outlined in S. 4, which relies on standards such as the NFPA      1600 Standard on Disaster/Emergency Management and Business      Continuity Programs, would enable our nation to better      protect lives and property. This initiative complements other      first responder disaster and emergency preparedness plans and      is critical for a robust homeland security policy.      Accordingly, we believe that the Senate-passed language      should be retained in the conference report.       Finally, we strongly urge you not to include provisions in      the conference report that would establish new federal      mandates for re-routing of hazardous materials around urban      areas. While we understand that local re-routing may be      necessary on a case-by-case basis, federal mandatory re-     routing regulations would create additional dangers by      shifting hazardous materials to rural areas that may not be      as well-staffed or equipped to deal with an incident. In      addition, re-routing hazardous materials would keep them in      transit for a longer amount of time, which would increase the      risk and the potential for an incident to occur. Larger,      urban fire departments are generally in a better position to      handle these incidents, because they have more specialized      equipment and other resources.       Again, thank you for your attention to these pressing      homeland security issues. Should you have questions or desire      additional information as you move through the conference      process, please do not hesitate to contact Kevin King.           Sincerely,     Chief James B. Harmes,       CFO, President, IAFC.     Thomas Fee,       President, IAAI.     James M. Shannon,       President, NFPA.     Chief Philip C. Stittleburg,       Chairman, National Volunteer Fire Council.                                  ____                                         International Association                                 of Fire Fighters',                                Washington, DC, February 13, 2007.     Hon. Joseph Lieberman,     Hon. Susan Collinsm,     Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, U.S.          Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Lieberman and Ranking Member Collins: On      behalf of the nation's more than 280,000 professional fire      fighters and emergency medical personnel, I applaud you for      your efforts to implement the recommendations of the 9/11      Commission. We are especially grateful that you included in      your proposal provisions to reform our nation's Homeland      Security Grant Program and enhance first responder      communications.       The establishment of the new grant program dedicated to      improving communications operability and interoperability is      vital to protecting the health and safety of our nation's      fire fighters. Permitting funds to be used to assist with a      variety of activities, including activities to achieve basic      operability, will enable states and regions to overcome their      own unique communications challenges.       Provisions ensuring that states provide local governments      and first responders homeland security funding in an      expedited manner, and permitting a portion of funds to be      used for the payment of overtime and backfill costs will      allow communities to take full advantage of this invaluable      federal assistance.       The Improving America's Security Act also demonstrates your      strong commitment to America's fire service. By guaranteeing      that members of the fire service are involved in local      planning to determine effective funding priorities, and by      maintaining FIRE and SAFER grants as separate and distinct      programs, you properly ensure that America's fire service      will continue to receive funding to fulfill its vital role in      local emergency preparedness.       Thank you for your leadership on these vital issues. We      appreciate your willingness to work closely with the IAFF in      developing the Improving America's Security Act, and look      forward to continuing our work together on behalf of our      nation's emergency response personnel.           Sincerely,                                                   Barry Kasinitz,                                   Director, Governmental Affairs.
