President, I know we are going on to the bankruptcy bill later today. We made progress on the bill last week. We cleared 25 amendments and improved the Bankruptcy Reform Act. We will continue to try to do that again today. The distinguished Senator from New Jersey, Senator Torricelli, and I, working with the distinguished deputy Democratic leader, the Senator from Nevada, are prepared to enter into a unanimous consent agreement to limit the remaining Democratic amendments to only 28 amendments. Most of these would limit us to very short time agreements. I will speak on this more this afternoon. I want Senators to know that.                          ____________________
