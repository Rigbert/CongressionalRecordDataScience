Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to a group of patriots whose dedication and contributions to the United States space community has been exceptional. For the past 2 years I have served as the Chairman of the Science Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics and have had the honor to work with a staff comprised of some of the best and brightest in the fields of space and earth science, aeronautics and space exploration.  In the 2 years that I've been Chairman, the staff has worked diligently to implement the President's Vision for Space Exploration, maintain robust science and aeronautics programs and open opportunities for the private sector and space entrepreneurs. In short, they have tried to give America's space-farers the ``Rules and Tools'' to succeed in the Second Space Age. Last year, the President signed into law the first NASA Authorization Act in 5 years. Anyone can tell you how difficult it is to draft legislation that must balance the many needs of the Agency's various stakeholders while keeping the original Vision intact. The majority subcommittee staff worked tirelessly to secure passage and I commend their hard work and dedication. It certainly has paid off--NASA is charging full speed ahead with the Vision for Space Exploration and a commitment to ten healthy centers.  The subcommittee completed several resolutions commending successful shuttle launches and their crews; conducted hearings on a wide range of topics including ``The Future of Aeronautics at NASA,'' ``Future Market for Commercial Space,'' and ``The NASA Workforce''; and conducted several legislative mark-up hearings on other relevant bills. The subcommittee even conducted the first hearing in Congressional history with a witness testifying from space when NASA astronaut John Phillips, a member of the crew aboard the International Space Station in June 2005, participated via satellite. The efforts of the subcommittee staff also enabled me to visit all of NASA's Centers, including the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Applied Physics Laboratory, during the 109th Congress. None of this would have been possible without the intelligence and perseverance of the staff.  At this time I would like to recognize the individuals responsible for the subcommittee's many accomplishments:  Bill Adkins, former Staff Director. Bill was a thoughtful advisor and an influential force in the passage of the NASA Authorization Act during the 18 months we worked together.  Johannes Loschnigg, current Staff Director. Johannes has done a terrific job and has offered solid leadership to the subcommittee.  Ed Feddeman, Professional Staff. Ed is the resident expert on aeronautics and space science. I have appreciated his depth ofknowledge on these issues and his expertise during several NASA Center visits.  Ken Monroe, Professional Staff. Ken is the subject matter expert on the space shuttle program and financial management at the Agency. His first-hand experience, and strong attention to detail has been a true asset during the last 2 years.  Tind ``Shep'' Ryen, Professional Staff. Shep is the go-to-guy on the space exploration agenda being implemented by NASA, including the Constellation Systems program, NASA Workforce and Commercial Space issues. As one of the more recent additions to the staff, Shep has not wavered from delving deeply into his work and has exercised excellent oversight over these exciting new programs.  Tom Hammond, Professional Staff. Tom handles a long list of issues including the International Space Station, Earth Science, Remote Sensing, and International and National security programs. I appreciate Tom's dedication and know he will continue to excel in all his future endeavors.  Devin Bryant, Staff Assistant. Devin is the support system to all of the staff and has done an incredible job. As a fellow Californian, I appreciate his enthusiasm for America's space program as it reminds me of the ripple effect of NASA's achievements--inspiring the next generation of explorers.  Roselee Roberts, Chairman's Designee/Professional Staff. Roselee has been a tremendous asset to my chairmanship and the subcommittee. It was an honor to designate her as my representative. It has been a pleasure to work with her these past 2 years. She has been a trusted confidant to me and my staff and I appreciate her dedication and loyalty. She will always be a part of the Calvert team.  I would be remiss if I did not also mention my deep gratitude to David Goldston, Chief of Staff of the Science Committee. David impressed me with his intelligence, tireless work ethic, and his love of science policy. During the past 2 years we have shared some great conversations and debates and I believe I have been a better Chairman for them. I appreciate the tremendous support and expertise he has provided me and my staff during my Chairmanship.  To all of the subcommittee staff, I would like to express my deepest gratitude for your hard work, diligence, passion, and service. I salute your dedication and wish you all the best of luck.                          ____________________
