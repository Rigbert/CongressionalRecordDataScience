Chair, I thank the gentleman. I certainly rise in support of this amendment. Having chaired that subcommittee for 6 years and knowing the good work of that subcommittee, I think the intent of thelanguage aligns with the two authorizing bills passed by the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology earlier this year. I certainly voted for them both times.  I think it is a good amendment, so I urge an ``aye'' vote.
