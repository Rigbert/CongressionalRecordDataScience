Speaker, I strongly oppose the securities litigation conference report.  The laws governing securities litigation can certainly stand to be improved, but the language of this conference report does much more harm than good. This legislation--written by and for the large securities firms--is antismall investor and antiworking family.  The conference report reduces consumers protection. An investors ability and right to sue unscrupulous securities firms should not be stifled or circumscribed by Congress. For example, the language includes a sweeping loser-pays provision that will make it extremely difficult for anyone without a multimillion-dollar trust fund to challenge a large corporation in court.  Supporters of this legislation claim that there is an explosion of frivolous suits. The fact is that the number of securities class action suits has shrunk over the past 20 years. During the last several years, suits have been filed against only 120 companies annually--out of over 14,000 public corporations reporting to the SEC.  I cannot support this legislation. This conference report goes against the interests of working people and small investors. I sincerely hope that the President will veto this legislation so that Congress can then enact true reform of our Nation's securities litigation laws.  Miss COLLINS of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1058, the so-called Securities Litigation Reform Act. This legislation actually weakens Federal securities fraud laws, and is just another example of the majority in this Congress trying to reduce the penalties for certain kinds of crimes committed by their wealthy supporters while continuing to maintain or increase discriminatory penalties for other kinds of crimes more commonly resorted to by poor people.  In addition, I have received hundreds of letters from State and local officials, mayors, municipal and county treasurers and finance officers representing an extraordinary bipartisan national consensus that the pending measure would imperil the ability of public officials to protect billions of dollars of taxpayer monies in short-term investments and pension funds that have been entrusted to them. Many of these officials are both issuers of municipal bonds and investors of taxpayer money. In other words, they can be both plaintiff's or defendants in securities fraud class action lawsuits. They have joined with me to oppose this legislation because it will make it nearly impossible to recover taxpayer losses due to fraud, particularly if something like the Orange County fiscal crisis occurs elsewhere in the country.  Mr. Speaker, I am opposed to this discriminatory measure.         American Federation of State, County and Municipal            Employees, AFL-CIO                                 Washington, DC, December 4, 1995.       Dear Representative: On behalf of the 1.3 million members      of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal      Employees (AFSCME), I am writing to express our strong      opposition to the conference agreement on H.R. 1058, the      Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.       This legislation would deny important rights which now      protect consumers, stockholders, and pension plans from      securities fraud. It would create new and unfair pleading and      burden of proof requirements for victims, and it calls for      the adoption of the so-called English Rule which unjustly      requires the loser of a law suit to pay the defendant's court      costs. We believe these changes discriminate against lower      and middle income citizens and would severely limit justified      litigation, thus acting to lessen deterrence to securities      fraud.       Moreover, we are concerned that this legislation would have      an adverse impact on public employee pension systems. One      needs      only to look to Orange County, California as an example of a case where      alleged securities fraud has resulted in the loss of employee      retirement funds. If this legislation is adopted, it could      limit the ability of those who have been wronged to recover      their full damages.       We ask that you oppose the conference agreement on H.R.      1058.           Sincerely,                                              Charles M. Loveless,                                          Director of Legislation.
