 President, I rise today to draw my colleagues attention to an on-going problem that impacts our national security--parts shortages for the C-5. I know it may surprise some that I say this is a national security problem. Well, it is. My colleagues on the Armed Services Committee and on the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee are not surprised. They know how vital strategic airlift is to national security. They also know that C-5s are the backbone of our strategic airlift capability. Working with the C-17, the C-5 provides the airlift needed for both wars and for humanitarian missions.  For those who have not spent as much time on the issue, let me explain. The C-5 can carry more cargo, farther than any other plane in the American military. It is what brings the big, heavy stuff to the fight. For example, C-5s brought precision munitions into our major European bases for Allied Force in Kosovo. Once the big loads are brought into a theater, where necessary the C-17 then moves the equipment and supplies around the theater. As the Commander in Chief of United States Transportation Command has said many times, seventy percent of the cargo most needed in the first 30 days by the warfighter can only be airlifted on a C-5 or a C-17. And, by the way, this is stuff we'll need even if we get lighter and more mobile because time will always matter and the more we can get to the fight quickly, the better our military position.  In addition to our warfighting needs, America uses the C-5 to promote goodwill and to help those made needy by natural disasters. C-5s are almost always involved in providing humanitarian assistance. For example, large desalinization plants to provide drinkable water must go on the C-5. So must the Fairfax Search and Rescue Team that we heard so much about after earthquakes in Turkey and Taiwan.  To get back to my earlier point, America is a global power that needs a healthy C-5 fleet. One major factor in low mission capable rates and lower airlift capacity has been a lack of parts for the C-5. In short, without parts, C-5s are not available to the Nation.  Because I was seeing the impact of this on a regular basis at Dover Air Force Base, in my State of Delaware, I thought it was important to take a closer look at this problem. What I was seeing was maintenance crews being overworked on a regular basis because there were no parts available to repair planes. In order to keep C-5s flying, two or more C-5s had to be turned into ``hangar queens'' or ``cann-birds''. Sad terms that describe million dollar airplanes that must be used to provide parts for other planes. Parts are taken from that plane and then put into another plane that needs that part. This process, called aircraft cannibalization, cost the Logistics Groups at Dover over $2.77 million for Fiscal Year 1999 according to an independent review of Logistics cost done for Air Mobility Command.  Cannibalization not only wastes money, it also requires significantly more work hours to open up an airplane, remove a part, open up the other airplane and install the part, and then eventually install a replacement part in the original airplane. This process also increases the risk that something else on the cann-bird will break or that the part itself will break. The end result was that morale was low because without an adequate supply of spare and repair parts, inefficient procedures had become standard practice. In addition, the overall health of the C-5 fleet suffered.  As I became more aware of the impact this lack of parts was having on morale and the readiness of the C-5 fleet two years ago, I brought then Secretary of Defense Bill Cohen to Dover to make him aware of the problem.  While I believe that visit was helpful, it was clear to me that continued attention to the issue was necessary. That led me to write a short report on the issue. I have sent copies of the report to my colleagues in the Senate.  The report seeks to explain the important role played by the C-5, the extent of the parts problem for the C-5, the impact those parts shortages have had on the fleet and those who work on the C-5, and to describe the failures in logistics system management thatmade the problem even worse. I hope that my colleagues will take the time to review the report and will reach the same conclusions that I did. In the end, it was clear to me that we must do three things.  First, we must continue to increase funding for parts and keep it predictable.  Second, we must completely modernize the C-5 fleet with new avionics and the Reliability Enhancement and Re-engining Program.  Third, we must continue to promote smart management reform throughout the defense logistics system.  Again, I know that none of this is news to my colleagues on the defense committees who have provided so much leadership and support for addressing these challenges, but I hope the report will be helpful to them and their staffs and to other colleagues.  I know that spare and repair parts is not glamorous, but it is vital to America's ability to protect and promote our national security. For that reason, we must build on the good work done by the defense committees over the past four years to begin to solve the parts shortage problem and ensure that we do not lose sight of what must be done now and in the future to eliminate the problem.                          ____________________
