President, I totally concur with what the distinguished senior Senator from Massachusetts has said. He was a leader who worked with us to design the Senate-passed bill.  All of us, whether we are parents or grandparents or teachers or policymakers, we are puzzling over the causes of children turning violent in this country. We know that the root causes are likely multifaceted. We know there is no one cause. There is no one magic solution.  I believe the Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice bill is a firm and significant step in the right direction. The passage of that bill showed that when Senators roll up their sleeves and get to work, we can make significant progress. And we did. Senators were on the floor, they were in conferences in the cloakroom and off the floor. We worked extremely hard to come together. We had some false steps at the beginning, but we finally came together when we passed a piece of legislation 73 to 25.  That took a lot of work. We had conservatives and liberals and moderates holding hands on a number of issues to make it work because we cared about the children of this country. That progress does not do any good if the House and Senate do not come together in a conference.  I yield for a question to my friend from California.
