I am just asking the gentlewoman a simple question.  Mr. Chairman, I can understand the concern of the gentlewoman because she does not know.  In order to implement her amendment, and this is the final question, and we will get to the end of this, would the Secretary obtain income tax returns from the IRS, or require producers to bring in a tax return, or require producers to certify their off-farm income in order to verify any off-farm income?
