  That farmer had it exactly right because whether Trent was making sure an old man in Pascagoula got his Social Security check or ducking into a kitchen in Tunica to thank the cooks after a political event, no service was too small, no task too insignificant when it came to serving the people of Mississippi.  One time, when Trent was a young Congressman, a constituent called his office to have his trash removed. When Trent asked why he hadn't called the town supervisor first, the man replied that he didn't want to start that high.  Nobody ever saw Trent Lott as a Congressman or a Senator. To them, he was just Trent. As he vowed last month, that commitment to the people of Mississippi does not end here. ``I will work hard for the State, the last day I am in the Senate,'' he said, ``and I will work hard for this State until the last day I am alive.''  In a plaque on his office wall, visitors will find Trent's rules.
