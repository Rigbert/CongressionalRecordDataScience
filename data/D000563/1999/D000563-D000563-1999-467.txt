I will make it brief because I have spoken on my concerns about the District of Columbia. My reason for withdrawing the last amendment is my belief that not only is it a high priority of the White House, it is fundamentally a sound program, as I said from the start.  My quarrel is what I consider to be the irresponsible action of the D.C. City Council with the so-called tax cut they have enacted. The sense of the Senate, which I make a part of this appropriations bill, says the D.C. City Council has a chance to prove their theory; they have a chance to prove the $59 million in tax cuts is more important than $59 million spent on police protection; $59 million, a part of which could be spent on the schools; $59 million, a part of which could be spent to try to help these poor babies who are dying because of low birthweight and other problems.  You have your chance. That is what home rule is all about. The sense of the Senate says it is a sense of the Senate that in considering the District of Columbia's fiscal year 2001 budget, the Senate will take into consideration progress or lack of progress in addressing the following issues: crime, including the homicide rate; implementation of community policing; the number of police officers on local beats; and the closing down of open-air drug markets.  Second, access to drug abuse treatment, including the number of treatment slots, the number of people served, the number of people on waiting lists, and the effectiveness of treatment drugs. Remember that HIV-AIDS is seven times more prevalent in the District of Columbia than in other city.  The third item on the sense of the Senate is management of parolees and pretrial violent offenders, including the number of halfway house escapees, and steps taken to improve monitoring and supervision of halfway house residents to reduce the number of escapees.  Pick up the paper with regularity and you will find that the so-called halfway houses have revolving doors. Those accused of felonious conduct and violent crime are back on the street, walking in the neighborhoods of the District of Columbia, shoulder to shoulder with the people who live here and those who come to visit the Nation's capital.  That has to change. It is one of the criteria which I will personally use, and I hope others will use, during the course of this consideration of criteria for future appropriations for the District of Columbia.  Fourth, education including access to special education services and student achievement.  Fifth, improvement in the city's basic services, including rat control and abatement.  Six, the application for and management of Federal grants. This D.C. city government has not even applied for the money it is eligible for from the Federal Government. They have to reach a level of competence and it may mean achieving some in phases. I hope the Mayor is listening, and I hope the members of the D.C. City Council will be responsible for that.  Finally, the indicators of child well-being, which I mentioned earlier. Let's see next year, when we gather to debate this appropriation, whether the District of Columbia is still in last place among all the States in the Nation in so many categories which reflect the well-being of the children who live here.                           Amendment No. 1227(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding the urgent need  to address basic quality of life concerns in the District of Columbia)
