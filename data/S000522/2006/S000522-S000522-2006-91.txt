Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 608) condemning the escalating levels of religious persecution in the People's Republic of China, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                              H. Res. 608       Whereas the Constitution and laws of the People's Republic      of China purport to provide for religious freedom, however,      these freedoms are substantively ignored;       Whereas all religious groups and spiritual movements must      register with the Chinese Government, which monitors      religious services and judges the legitimacy of religious      activities;       Whereas unregistered religious groups in China continue to      experience official interference and members of religious      groups have been subjected to intimidation, harassment, and      detention;       Whereas many religious leaders and adherents in China,      including those in official churches, have been detained,      arrested, or administratively sentenced to prison terms in      reeducation-through-labor camps;       Whereas religious believers are denied the ability to hold      public office not by law, but by a logical extension of the      fact that most government positions go to members of the      Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and CCP membership and      religious belief are considered incompatible;       Whereas numerous abuses of unofficial Catholic clergy have      occurred, including the detentions of Bishop Zhao Zhendong,      Bishop Jia Zhiguo, Bishop Yao Liang, Bishop Su Zhimin, Bishop      An Shuxin, Bishop Lin Xili, Bishop Han Dingxiang, and Bishop      Shi Enxiang, as well as other Catholic priests and lay      leaders who have been beaten or otherwise mistreated;       Whereas the Chinese Government-sanctioned Catholic      Patriotic Association of China conducted unauthorized      episcopal ordinations of the priests Joseph Ma Yinglin and      Joseph Liu Xinhong, elevating them to the office of bishop      without the approval and against the wishes of the Holy      Father Pope Benedict XVI;       Whereas numerous abuses of Protestant House Church Leaders      have occurred, including the detentions of Pastor Gong      Shengliang, Pastor Zhang Rongliang, Luo Bingyin, Li Cuiling,      Wang Chaoyi, Yang Tianlu, and Zhao Xinlan, as well as other      Protestant House Church Leaders who have been beaten or      otherwise mistreated;       Whereas the whereabouts of Gendun Choekyi Nyima, the boy      identified by the Dalai Lama as the 11th Panchen Lama and      detained by Chinese authorities ten years ago, when he was      six years old, are still unknown;       Whereas, according to the Department of State, Chinese      authorities continue to restrict Muslim religious activity,      teaching, and worship in Xinjiang, including reported      prohibitions on the participation and religious education of      minors;       Whereas the Chinese Government continues its brutal      campaign to eradicate the Falun Gong spiritual movement and      thousands of its members have been subject to     excessive force, abuse, detention, and torture, including Liu      Chengjun who died in 2003 after reportedly being abused in      custody in Jilin Province and Huang Wei who is currently      detained in Hebei Province, among others;       Whereas Cai Zhuohua, a Beijing underground church leader,      was sentenced on November 8, 2005, to three years in prison      for distributing Bibles and other Christian materials;       Whereas the Haidian Lower People's Court in Beijing also      sentenced Mr. Cai's wife, Xiao Yunfei, to two years in prison      and her brother, Xiao Gaowen, to 18 months in prison; and       Whereas on November 20, 2005, after attending services at      the Gangwashi Church in Beijing, President George W. Bush      stated: ``A healthy society is a society that welcomes all      faiths and gives people a chance to express themselves      through worship with the Almighty'': Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That--       (1) the House of Representatives condemns the imprisonment      of religious leaders and people of faith in the People's      Republic of China and urges their release; and       (2) it is the sense of the House of Representatives that it      should be the policy of the Government of the United States      to promote and defend religious freedom and freedom of      conscience in China.
