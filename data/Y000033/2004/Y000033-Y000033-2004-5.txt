Mr. Chairman, I rise to speak regarding H.R. 10, the 9/11 Recommendations Implementation Act.  I realize the importance of this legislation and understand the need for improving our intelligence gathering and coordination. The failure of our intelligence and law enforcement agencies to communicate has been demonstrated on numerous occasions. However, while there is no doubt that we must protect our country and our people from the threat of terrorism, we must also protect the viability of our economy. I want to stress that, the viability of our economy, and if we do not do so, especially in our Nation's transportation, the bad guys have won.  The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure has worked very hard on a bipartisan basis for the last 3 years to develop the best transportation security possible. It was our committee that proposed and passed the first legislation to create the Transportation Security Administration, TSA. We have improved that legislation and moved other bills that improved security as well. We have exercised our oversight jurisdiction both thoroughly and prudently and with due respect to the concerns of the Department of Homeland Security and other federal agencies.  H.R. 10 contains new recommendations from our committee regarding improvements in aviation security and additional improvements in the area of maritime security. The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure also reported recommendations regarding the funding of first responders.  Recently, I personally experienced how it felt to be on TSA's no-fly list when I was confused with another person with the same name. This was not a pleasant experience, but I was able to clear up the confusion fairly quickly and continued on my trip. H.R. 10 includes recommendations from the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure that will provide travelers who are misidentified by the TSA an opportunity to appeal.  I have serious concerns regarding section 5027, encouraging the Committee on Rules to act on the recommendation regarding committee jurisdiction prior to the next Congress. This House should have an opportunity for full and fair debate on any changes to the structure of the standing committees or any changes to their jurisdiction. There should be regular order and a fair process for consideration of changes that could have seriously impacts on all the stakeholders and industries who will be affected by the way we exercise our jurisdiction and carry out our oversight.  The decision regarding the rules of the House should be made at the beginning of the next Congress. This is not a fight about turf as some might claim. It is about doing the best job for legislating that we can for the American people and that requires both expertise and balance. The committee with a single focus only on security, not balanced by concern for the economic and other consequences, could result in posing unreasonable burdens on the taxpayers and our economic base.  The current recommendations of the Select Committee on Homeland Security eliminate the ability of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure to exercise legislation or oversight jurisdiction over transportation security. The Select Committee on Homeland Security's recommendation has extremely serious consequences and deserves full consideration over the coming months.  Should this bill go to conference, I strongly encourage the conferees and the Committee on Rules to refrain from taking action that would prevent a full and fair debate on the changes to the rules. As we legislate to protect the homeland security in all areas of our national life, we must look at the whole picture and find the right balance between security and economic stability.  And may I respectfully suggest to the leadership of the House on both sides of the aisle and those that might be in the conference, and I will be one of them, if we, in fact, change the rules without going through the due process, I will vote and work against this legislation. Because if we disrupt our economic base, if we cannot continue the mission of moving our goods and people, then the bad guys have won. So we have to be very careful what we do. As we rush to judgment to pass a piece of legislation recommended by the 9/11 Commission, I will assure the Members that I want to study it very closely to make sure that we provide the security that is necessary but keep in mind the economic well-being of our people in this Nation.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.                              {time}  1800
