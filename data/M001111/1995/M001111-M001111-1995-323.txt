 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a former colleague, a great legislator and a courageous and loyal friend, Washington State Senator Cal Anderson.  I worked with Cal Anderson when I served in the Washington State Senate. He is known throughout my home State as an outstanding legislator. His reputation is one of hard work, of holding true to his beliefs but compromising for the greater good, and of reaching conclusions that work for everyone. Cal is a true believer, as I am, in good government.  I was honored to work with him on open record policies in my home State. I was astounded by his ability to be inclusive, to bring everyone into the debate. Cal made sure that our bill was not just legislation that was good to look at but legislation that was good for people.  Cal is a Vietnam veteran. He earned two Bronze Stars and four Army Commendation medals for meritorious service in that conflict. He is courageous, Mr. President, and he is honest. He has touched so many lives across this country--his very presence in our State legislature shows young people that no matter who they are or where they come from, everybody has a great deal to offer their communities and our country. His very presence tells us that America will be great when we let everybody participate and be an equal voice in our national dialog.  Cal Anderson is one of the highest ranking openly gay elected officials in this country. He continues to break down stereotypes and ignorance. And, he is a champion and a role model for all people. Nobody in the State legislature thought of Cal as the ``gay legislator''; we thought of him as an extraordinary man who just happened to be gay.  And, this week, Mr. President, with his characteristic honesty and integrity, Cal Anderson told us he has AIDS. He has been diagnosed with non-Hodgkins lymphoma and is undergoing chemotherapy. I called him today, and was not surprised to find him in his senate office in Olympia. He has a lot of work to do, and is determined to get it done.  Mr. President, Cal Anderson's honestly should inspire all of us who shape public policy to take this epidemic seriously. In my own State, more than 5,500 men, women, and children have been diagnosed with AIDS. More than 1,100 cases have been reported over the previous year. Cases are growing in rural areas, and cases are growing among women.  A few weeks ago, we learned the sad news that AIDS is now the leading cause of death of Americans between [[Page S2756]] the ages of 25 and 44. I fear that everyone in America will soon know someone who is infected with HIV. My friends and neighbors in Washington do now: his name is Senator Cal Anderson.  Mr. President, let me conclude by thanking Cal for everything he does for my home State, and by wishing him and his partner, Eric, only the best with his therapy and in the future.                          ____________________
