I want to thank the gentleman from Michigan for yielding me this time.  Madam Speaker, it is unbelievable that with so many people out of work and millions of people uninsured that the first item of this new Congress is to take health care away from people who just got coverage. More people have insurance today because of the Affordable Care Act; more small businesses are offering health insurance to their workers. For the first time in the history of our Nation, we are headed in the right direction. We are making health care a right and not a privilege.  The repeal will force seniors to pay for more drugs. It would kick young people off of their parents' insurance. We will go back to a time when insurance companies were allowed to discriminate. And once again it will allow insurance companies to put profits above patients' health.  We must not turn back. We have come too far. We cannot go back. The American people are counting on us to do what is right, what is just, what is fair. We made a promise of health care to the American people. We must keep that promise. Vote ``no.'' Keep the promise of health care for all of our citizens.
