 billion bailout of the Government of Mexico and its Wall Street creditors by our taxpayers through the instrumentalities of the United States, including our U.S. Treasury, our Federal Reserve, the International Monetary Fund, into which the United States pumps money, and the Bank for International Settlements, on whose board sit the chairman of our Federal Reserve and the chairman of the New York Federal Reserve.  All of this was done without a vote of the Congress of the United States, the only federally elected officials representing the people of this country.  This newest proposal is a perpetuation of the worst kind of manipulative politics, both here in our country and in Mexico. And from a constitutional standpoint, it is absolutely precedent setting in the abuse of power by our own Federal Reserve, in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Treasury.  This new proposal is nothing short of a circumvention of the democratic process and a circumvention of the proper role of the elected leaders of the Congress of the United States.  The administration chose this path because they knew that they did not have the votes in this Congress, nor the support of the American public. In fact, over 80 percent of the American people oppose this bailout.  This new proposal is representative of what is wrong with politics in our country: not reflecting the will of the people.  Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan, officials in the administration, and the top Republican leadership of this Congress have all exhibited this type of behavior during the present Mexican peso crisis and further through past trade policies which created this mess, an arrogance and abuse of power which knows no bounds.  It is well known that people tend to change once they come into the beltway in Washington.  In October 1979, Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan told the Senate Banking Committee that a proposed $750 million loan, one-fortieth of what is being proposed here, for near-bankrupt Chrysler Corp. was a bad idea that flew in the face of the principles of free enterprise. This is the same man who by raising interest rates has increased your mortgage payments and increased your monthly credit card payments, eating into your wages over the last 20 years.  Chairman Greenspan and the Federal Reserve are trying desperately to cover their own tracks in this crisis. In fact, it was the Federal Reserve's own interest-rate policies of the past 3 years that helped set Mexico up for a fall.  Low United States rates in 1992 and 1993 led speculators to pump record levels of money into Mexico, some estimating over $70 billion, and other emerging markets, but then the Fed's interest rate increases of 1994, all six of them, led those same investors to pull their money back out and bring it home.  If Chairman Greenspan was so concerned about Mexico, he would certainly not have raised United States interest rates six times over the last year.  The latest increase in interest rates means that if you own a $60,000 home with a 30-year mortgage, your mortgage payments have gone up by an additional $100 a month. And as a result of the Fed's actions, your home will cost you about $1,200 more a year or about $36,000 over the life of your mortgage.  Chairman Greenspan is unelected, unaccountable, and evidently unaware of the people's lives in this country that his policies affect.  There is absolutely no reason that a proposal of this magnitude should not be considered by the Congress of the United States.  Under the Constitution, we have the absolute authority to coin money and to regulate the flow of money between nations. What was done here, very cleverly through the back door, was that an entity within the U.S. Treasury Department, the Currency Stabilization Fund, took deutschemarks and yen that they hold and they said to the Federal Reserve, we will borrow against those. And essentially a flow of funds came from the Federal Reserve to the U.S. Treasury against the terms of the Constitution of the United States, which require all appropriated dollars to be voted on by the Congress of the United States.                          ____________________
