Chairman, I thank the chairman very much for yielding and join him in opposing this, I think, well-intentioned amendment. The amendment would actually cut funding for the oversight of existing loans. I don't think, in view of some of the things that have happened in the past, that is the best course.  The program has had a significant beneficial impact on innovative energy projects coast to coast that are generating energy today. Therefore, I would agree with the chairman in opposing the amendment.  I urge my colleagues to support our efforts to vote ``no'' at this time.
