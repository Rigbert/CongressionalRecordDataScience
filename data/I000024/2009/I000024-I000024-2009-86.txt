We have 67 percent of the $789 billion that is not obligated. That means it is not there. The Senator is right; in their minds it may be obligated, but it is not obligated. We tried to have an amendment to triple the amount of money that would have gone to roads and highways and bridges back during the consideration, and we couldn't get that in. The Senator was a cosponsor of my amendment. Now we are trying to do the same thing we were unable to do then.  This is supposed to be a stimulus bill. The total amount of stimulus in this bill, in my opinion, is about 7\1/2\ percent. This is an opportunity to do something with real jobs and not have any problem in increasing our debt or deficit.  So I appreciate the fact that my colleague is coming down, and several Senators will be coming down, and drawing this to the attention of the American people as well as to our friends on the other side. There is our opportunity to save lives, to do infrastructure--one of the major reasons we are here in this Chamber today.
