 President, let me also remind my colleagues that NATO's decisions require unanimity. I know we all know that. We got that unanimity at a recent Washington summit after long and tough negotiations.  By appearing to withhold U.S. support for the revised Strategic Concept--and perhaps eventually even blocking its implementation--this amendment, if misread, would put the alliance in great jeopardy.  And that could lead to the collapse of NATO, which I am sure is not the goal of my colleague from Kansas.  One final comment. I know that my friend from Kansas is strongly opposed to the conduct of the current war in Yugoslavia, and, while disagreeing with him, I respect his views.  But, I would remind him and the rest of my colleagues that the 1999 revision of the Strategic Concept is neither the justification for, nor the driving force behind, NATO's bombing campaign or actions in Kosovo.  NATO's bombing campaign began a full month before the newest revision of the Strategic Concept was approved at the Washington Summit.  To sum up, there are no compelling political or legal arguments for the Roberts amendment. in terms of making this concept subject to treaty amendment.  I urge my colleagues to join me in voting against this amendment.  I yield the floor. I thank my colleagues.
