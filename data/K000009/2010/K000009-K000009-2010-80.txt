Chairman, thank you for bringing this resolution to the floor.  Madam Speaker, on Saturday, I was emailed by Stanley Kobylak, a leader of the Polish community in the Toledo, Ohio/Rossford area, informing me of this tragic situation. I rise in support of this important resolution, offering sympathy to the liberty-loving nation and people of the Republic of Poland, our great ally.  Poland is one of America's longest and most steadfast allies from the time of our own Republic's founding, made possible by the valiance of Polish Generals Casimir Pulaski and Tadeusz Kosciuszko.  Poland's highest leaders, including its President and First Lady, Lech and Maria Kaczynski, were among the victims of that terrible crash as they wended their way to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the Katyn massacre when over 22,000 Polish officers, intellectuals and leaders were murdered at the hands of Joseph Stalin and the Soviet Army in and around that forest during World War II. The truth of that slaughter was hidden for over 70 years, and now the entire world knows of that sacred ground.  Madam Speaker, please allow me to extend condolences on behalf of my constituents in Ohio to the friends andfamilies of those who perished, to the people of Poland, to the nation of Poland, and to the people of Polish heritage throughout the world. Let this moment be one of recommitment to Poland's highest aspirations and full expression of its own history.  So long as we are alive, there will be a Poland.
