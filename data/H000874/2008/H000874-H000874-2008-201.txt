Obviously, I agree with your premise that the bill as passed out of Congress was not the exact same bill because of the deletion of title III,apparently by error. Title III, as I understand, is not particularly controversial. I understand that from the discussion between Mr. Goodlatte and Mr. Peterson.  So a mistake was made. A deletion was made. The President and the White House did not catch it. We didn't catch it. The President vetoed a bill. The bill that he vetoed, he sent back here. We have now said notwithstanding the veto, we believe the provisions that we both passed should in fact become law.  Now the gentleman is correct, which is self-evident, and I can't disagree with your proposition that the bill was not in exactly the same form, and as I indicated at the beginning, because I only learned about this about an hour and a half ago, these are off-of-the-top-of-my-head opinions, and are probably worth that much.
