President, I will not ask how the distinguished Senator from Kentucky would define crocodile tears, but I ask this question of the distinguished majority leader: Was he aware that during the time when Democrats have been in charge, during President Bush's tenure, we have confirmed judges at a faster pace than when the Republicans were in charge? Was the distinguished majority leader aware of that?
