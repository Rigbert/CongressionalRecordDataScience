 That is [[Page H1451]] what the 1980's was about. During the 1980's, the richest one-half of 1 percent owned 55 percent of the total wealth that was created in that period. In the midst of all of this discussion, however, what frightens me the most is that ordinary people look out, and they are hurting very, very badly, as both of you have already talked about. The new jobs that are being created are low wage jobs, part-time jobs, temporary jobs without benefits. Yet, I do not hear a whole lot of discussion about those issues on the floor of the House. We spend weeks and weeks discussing this, and we discuss that, but suddenly, somehow, we do not talk, in my view, about the most important issue. In my humble opinion, the most important issue facing this country is the role of big money. Big money, and I must say, in all due respect to my friends, controls not only the Republican Party, has tremendous influence over the Democratic Party, has tremendous influence over the mass media.  Interestingly enough, when we hear about the Contract With America and how they want a citizen legislature, they forget to talk about campaign finance reform.  To the best of my knowledge, and maybe my friends here can correct me if I am wrong, my understanding is that today, or before the last election, some 20 percent of the Members of Congress were millionaires. Does that sound right to my friends?
