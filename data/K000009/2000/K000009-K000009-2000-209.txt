That is the deficit. That is how many more of our dollars go into their coffers. We are the largest funder of the Chinese increasing defense spending and purchases of weaponry and advancement in their Navy, their Army, their Air Force, all of the technology that they are buying, some of it for making some saber-rattling moves towards Taiwan.  The point is that the system that we are currently supporting, and some of the proponents of this want to lock in permanently, would give the very forces that have created this systemthe kind of go-ahead that frankly I as a liberty-loving person cannot support.  We hear the proponents say, well, but if you do this, you will bring freedom. How do we bring freedom when 110,000 Nike workers inside China who work for contract shops, 50 of them, that we could not even get into or drive by because they are hidden in country, those workers earn pennies an hour. If they earn over 35 cents an hour they are doing well. They work 7 days a week. They have mandatory overtime. If they do not do it, in other words, if they do not work from 7:30 in the morning until 11 at night, three shifts, they lose two day's wages. They are penalized if they do not do the mandatory overtime.  Who can survive in that kind of system? To me, it would make sense that if the United States is taking all these goods, we take over one-third of Chinese exports globally.
