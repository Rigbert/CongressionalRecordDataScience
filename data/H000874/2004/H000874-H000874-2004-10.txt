Speaker, this conference report provides critical funding for our Nation's first responders, for the defense of our borders and our ports, and enhances our transportation and infrastructure security.  While I believe we continue to have critical, unmet homeland security needs, and have supported repeated democratic efforts to increase the funding in this bill, Chairman Rogers and Mr. Sabo have done an admirable job with their allocation, and I support this agreement.  I am particularly pleased with the $65 million for the Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response Firefighters--or SAFER--Program, and I was proud to have worked with Curt Weldon to pass an amendment this summer to provide initial SAFER funding.  This conference agreement's $65 million in new hiring grants will help bring fire departments to adequate staffing levels and improve the safety of our firefighters and the communities they serve.  The agreement also contains $650 million for the Fire Grant Program, and while we do not maintain the $750 million provided the last 2 years, this is a $150 million increase over the presidents request--an increase that is vital to our firefighters, too many of whom risk their lives on a daily basis to protect our homes and our families without the modern equipment and advanced training they deserve.  Thanks to the equipment, vehicles and improved training provided by fire grants, more than 15,000 departments across America are now better trained and equipped to respond to fires, automobile accidents, natural disasters, or acts of terrorism.  We have an obligation to provide our firefighters with the necessary resources to improve their safety as they risk their lives in our defense every day, and funding for the SAFER and Fire Grant Programs helps us make good on that obligation.
