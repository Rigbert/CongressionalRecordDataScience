Speaker, I hope that the Speaker's intention is carried out, which will require, over the next 72 hours, hard work by Members and by staff and a willingness to understand that each side has some things it must have and each side has some things it cannot do. That is the nature of the legislative process.  If we exercise the responsibility that our constituents hoped that we would exercise when they sent us to this body, surely we can do that. I want to tell my friend, the chairman, for whom I have great respect--I hope that doesn't hurt him too much on his side of the aisle--that I want you to be able to say that Mr. Hoyer said he was going to urge his colleagues not to vote for another CR, and that, therefore, unless you have 218 votes on your side for whatever the product that you produce, that if we are going to fund government, as we surely should do, that we come to an agreement.  Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Committee on Appropriations for 23 years, I was very proud, it was the most bipartisan committee in the Congress, and we understood our responsibility that the appropriation bills are the one bill that must pass if we are to continue to serve our public and keep America strong and vibrant and economically growing jobs. This is a serious matter. Continuing to kick the can down the road ought to be an unacceptable alternative.
