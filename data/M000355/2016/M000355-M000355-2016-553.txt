 President, we all heard Democrats warn that we ``cannot delay any longer'' on Zika control funding. We have heard them warn that ``every day we wait is increasing the risk that we will have problems with Zika.'' We have even heard them warn that ``the mosquitoes are not going to be on recess.'' But now, as we are about to vote on a bicameral compromise that reflects the $1.1 billion funding level that Democrats already unanimously supported here in the Senate, they are threatening to block the Zika control money.  The Democratic leader yesterday went so far as to say that his Members ``have no choice'' but to oppose it. He and our friends across the aisle can try to come up with a line of excuses as to why they are blocking funding to address the Zika crisis and blocking support for our Nation's veterans, but here is what it all boils down to: This is partisan politics.  They might like to pretend this Zika control measure is ``woefully inadequate,'' but Senate Democrats are all on the record supporting this level of funding, and the CDC Director has testified that this $1.1 billion funding level is sufficient ``to do the things we need to do in the immediate term.'' That is the head of the CDC.  They might like to pretend that the Zika control measure walks back clean water protections, but that is false too. It actually contains a temporary, targeted compromise to promote mosquito control as long-term solutions like a vaccine are being developed.  They might want to dust off the ``war on women'' playbook, too, but this Zika control measure actually provides more resources for women's health services through community health centers, public health departments, and hospitals.  It is really puzzling to hear Democrats claim to be advocates for women's health measures when they are the ones trying to block this Zika legislation and its critical resources to protect women's health. The CDC has said: ``Zika virus infection during pregnancy can cause a serious defect called microcephaly, as well as other severe fetal brain defects.''  So today Democrats have a choice: Continue pushing thinly veiled partisan arguments and block the Zika control funding or join with us to advance a serious solution and send critical funding to the President's desk right now.  Remember, this legislation is the last chance we have to get Zika control funding to the President's desk for weeks. We should pass it to protect those especially at risk--pregnant women and babies. We should pass it to help prevent the spread of Zika and other mosquito-borne illnesses. We should pass it to help keep Americans safer from this public health concern in the midst of mosquito season.  We know that blocking this bill would mean preventing critical anti-Zika funds from moving one step closer to becoming law. But here is what else it would mean: blocking critical funding for our veterans, our servicemembers, and their families. These men and women voluntarily serve in our ArmedForces in order to protect our country and our freedom. They don't ask for much, but we ask so much of them.  That is why we must meet our commitment to them by passing this Veterans and Military Construction funding measure as soon as possible. This bill will increase critical resources to help ensure veterans receive health care and the health benefits they rely on. It will improve quality of life on military bases for soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and their families. It will support critical national security projects such as missile defense. It is a bipartisan measure that earned the support of both Democrats and Republicans when it passed the Senate. So let's work together today and pass it again.                          ____________________
