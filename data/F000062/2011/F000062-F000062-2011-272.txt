 President, I rise on behalf of myself and Senator Boxer to introduce legislation to further the restoration of the San Francisco Bay.  There are many areas in the country in which restoration is done, and I am pleased to introduce an authorization for restoration work in the San Francisco Bay with Senator Boxer, Chairwoman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. Companion legislation will also be introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives by Congresswoman Jackie Speier.  As Chair of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies, I secured $17 million in Federal funding for ecosystem restoration and water quality work in the San Francisco Bay in the last three years. I also secured $15 million since 2006 for the Fish and Wildlife Service to restore salt ponds to tidal wetlands in the Bay.  It is necessary to ensure that these funds continue to be appropriated and are spent on the most important projects for the ecosystem and public benefit.  To that end, this legislation will prioritize funding for projects that will protect and restore vital estuarine habitat for migratory waterfowl, shorebirds, and wildlife; improve and restore water quality and rearing habitat for fish; and ensure public benefits.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 97       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``San Francisco Bay      Restoration Act''.     SEC. 2. SAN FRANCISCO BAY RESTORATION GRANT PROGRAM.
