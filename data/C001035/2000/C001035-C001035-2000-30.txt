President, Senate Republicans are committed to enacting legislation to preserve, strengthen, and save Medicare for current and future generations. It is also critical that Congress take action this year to address some of the unintended consequences of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 which has been exacerbated by a host of ill-conceived regulatory requirements imposed by the Clinton administration. The combination of regulatory overkill and budget cuts is jeopardizing access to critical home health care services for millions of our Nation's seniors.  If one thinks about it, health care has really come full circle. Patients are spending less time in the hospital, more and more procedures are being done on an outpatient basis, and recovery and care for patients with chronic diseases and conditions increasingly takes place at home. Moreover, the number of older Americans who are chronically ill or disabled in some way continues to grow each year.  As a consequence, home health care has been an increasingly important part of our health care system, and I know the Senator from Kansas has been a very strong supporter of ensuring that these vital services are provided for our senior citizens. The kind of highly skilled and often technically complex services our Nation's home health care agencies provide have enabled millions of our most frail and vulnerable older citizens to avoid hospitals and nursing homes and receive care right where they want to be--in the comfort and security of their own homes.  In 1996, however, home health care was the fastest growing component of Medicare spending. This understandably prompted consideration of some changes as part of the Balanced Budget Act that were intended to slow the growth in spending to make the program more cost-effective and efficient.
