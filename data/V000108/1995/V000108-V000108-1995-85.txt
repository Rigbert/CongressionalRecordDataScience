Speaker, today, I am introducing legislation to authorize the development of a comprehensive watershed management plan for northwest Indiana's Deep River Basin, which includes Deep River, Lake George, Turkey Creek, and other related tributaries. The communities of Hobart, Lake Station, and Merriville, IN, would greatly benefit from the implementation of this plan.  The sediment cleanup of Lake George was first authorized in the Water Resources Development Act of 1986, Public Law 99-662, and the project has received Federal funding since 1990. The project includes flood control, environmental enhancement, and recreational development for an area that comprises the 282-acre Lake George, Turkey Creek, and Deep River in the vicinities of Hobart and Lake Station, IN.  However, the successful completion of the Lake George project is dependent upon a detailed, comprehensive investigation of the watershed, beyond the scope of the existing Lake George study authority. The legislation I am introducing today would facilitate the evaluation of how to sufficiently control the current and long-term sediment quality and quantity, address chronic flooding problems and the safety of Lake George Dam, and ensure the proper management of endangered wetlands.  In addition, a comprehensive watershed management plan is essential to determine the placement of sediment traps for the authorized Lake George project. Taxpayer dollars would be saved by instituting effective land use management techniques and trapping sediments before they reach Lake George. It is possible that sediment flow could be relieved in the unauthorized tributaries. In sum, future costs could be drastically reduced by developing and implementing a comprehensive management plan, which would result in less costly sediment traps and much [[Page E470]] needed flood relief for the communities of Hobart and Lake Station, IN. Additionally, the development of a comprehensive plan could alleviate the need for a costly redredging of Lake George in the future.  It is my hope that this bill will enhance our ongoing efforts to develop and implement sound, reasonable, and long-term solutions to the watershed management problems faced by the Lake George area, as well as the rest of northwest Indiana. I would hope to have your support, and the support of my other colleagues in the House of Representatives, in advancing this important legislation.                          ____________________
