Mr. Speaker, today marks the 50th anniversary of former Secretary of State George Marshall's commencement address to the graduating class at Harvard University. In that address, Secretary Marshall laid the foundation for the historic foreign aid program that would come to be known as the Marshall plan.  Mr. Speaker, most historians would agree that the Marshall plan was the most dramatically successful peacetime foreign policy implemented by the United States. However, when our Nation moved so swiftly and sincerely to assist the war-ravaged landscape, economy and political structure of Europe in the late 1940's, it also marked the beginning of the United States' role as worldwide peacekeeper and protector of democracy.  Beginning with the Yalta Conference in 1945--when some argued that President Franklin Delano Roosevelt had given away Eastern Europe to Joseph Stalin--the world entered a new arena of confrontation unlike any before. When Winston Churchill referred to the borders of the Eastern Bloc Communist countries as the ``Iron Curtain'', the stage had been set for the cold war.  The Revolutionary War brought us our independence; the Civil War gave us our national identity; the First World War made us players in the international arena; and the Second World War turned America into a superpower. For those veterans, there can be no doubt. Their participation in the combat theater ensures that their selflessness and contribution to our great Nation will never be overlooked or be taken for granted.  Yet, Mr. Speaker, for those veterans who gave just as selflessly to this country, but may have never looked directly into the eyes of the enemy, there is honor for them as well. From the policy of containment in the late 1940's to detente in the 1970's to confrontation in the early 1980's to the revolution in 1991, the veterans of the cold war stared unwaveringly into the depths of communism, and they did not blink for an instant. Rather, these veterans made it manifestly clear that democracy--that government by, of, and for the people--would be secure not only for America, but also for the entire world.  Therefore, Mr. Speaker, from Capt. Gary Powers to every sailor who stood ready off theshores of Cuba, I salute all cold war veterans, and thank them for their service to our great Nation.                          ____________________
