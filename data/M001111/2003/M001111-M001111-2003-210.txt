 President, I will later be offering a very important amendment on the budget resolution. It will fully fund the No Child Left Behind Act, and I will be offering that amendment with Senators Kennedy, Bingaman, Kerry, Mikulski, and Johnson.  Given the bipartisan support for the No Child Left Behind Act a year ago, I am disappointed that there are still no Republicans who have asked to cosponsor the funding that bill promised to all of our constituents.  A budget is a statement of our priorities. In an environment where we cannot fund everything, we have to make choices based on our values. Even when times are challenging, certainly as they are today, it is important that we continue to fund our children's education and to invest in their future.  This budget that is before the Senate has a meager investment in funding for the No Child Left Behind Act, and it fails our children and fails their future. It actually fails the very promise that Congress and this President made to students just a few years ago.  Leaving no child behind was a very important, noble goal, and it passed with bipartisan support. It was an education reform bill that was set out to say we will leave no child behind. But the Republican budget that is now before this Senate does not even come close to meeting the needs of our students or keeping the important promises of that legislation.  When we passed the No Child Left Behind Act, we passed it based on two commitments.
