 We had extensive discussion yesterday about what the Adarand case did and didn't do. What it did do was lay out a standard which this provision of the bill couldn't possibly meet and sent it back to the district court in Colorado, which found that this section of ISTEA was unconstitutional.  We could argue this round and round and round, and we have argued it round and round and round. But I don't think there are serious constitutional scholars who believe that the Adarand case didn't set up a standard that this section of the bill could not possibly meet.  I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Ohio.
