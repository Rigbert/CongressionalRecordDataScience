  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I paid $3.43 a gallon for gas in Springfield, Oregon. My colleague Greg Walden paid $3.99 on the east side of the Cascades. Something a little fishy here because, a year ago today, oil prices were $66.85 a barrel. Today, they are $63 a barrel. The price of crude oil is down, but the price of gasoline at the pump is up, way up.  And what is the cause? They say, oh, well, we forgot, we had to clean and maintain the refineries, and gee, we've had to shut 'em down. Does this remind anybody else of Enron? Enron/Exxon, they're interchangeable.  Enron would shut down plants to drive up the cost of electricity and make wild profits. Exxon and the other big oil companies are doing the same thing. They're using refinery repairs and maintenance as an excuse to price-gouge the American people.  Congress needs to stop the price gouging now.                          ____________________
