Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend the Government of Romania for its contribution to the U.N. peacekeeping force in Angola. It is heartening to see that Romania is willing to spend its own limited resources to help maintain peace and stability in an African country that has witnessed so much tragedy and fighting.  Romania currently has nearly 1,000 peacekeepers in Angola, which is the second largest national contingent in the U.N. force. Romania has also established a program to help train and educate Angolans so that they can better rebuild their country and has contributed 54 medical personnel to run a 40-bed hospital. Romania is involved in these efforts even though they have no economic or geopolitical interests in the region. As far as I can tell, Romania is participating in this humanitarian venture because of a commitment to the United Nations and a sense of responsibility to fellow human beings.  Democracy in Angola is important to the stability and the vitality of the region. In the post-Cold War era, we as a nation must work with other countries to help promote democracy and freedom throughout the world. I am pleased that Romania, despite facing its own challenges as it moves toward a market economy, understands the importance of supporting democracy elsewhere in the world. Romania's participation in the peacekeeping force in Angola is an important reminder that we are all part of the international community and have a responsibility to help each other.                          ____________________
