President, on August 25, 2012, the United States and the world lost one of its most creative thinkers and problem solvers. Roger D. Fisher, Williston Professor of Law at Harvard University and coauthor of ``Getting to Yes: Negotiating Without Giving In,'' the most widely read book ever written on the subject, was 90 years old.  Roger Fisher was a pioneer and a giant in the field of negotiation. He not only changed the way people think about dispute resolution, inspiring and mentoring countless students who have gone on to use his teachings in their own careers, he applied his theories to real-life conflicts from South America to the Middle East.  I had the good fortune to meet Roger and was struck by his affable manner and big smile, his inquisitive mind, and, perhaps above all, his enthusiasm for devising creative ways to help others solve seemingly intractable problems and in doing so make the world a better place. No conflict was too big or too small. He had imaginative, thoughtful approaches to everything, from ending the Vietnam war to resolving an argument among siblings at the family dinner table.  Roger was a gifted advocate. He had a brilliant mind and an extraordinary ability to persuade. But, as others have said, ``he taught that conflict was not simply a `zero-sum' game in which a fixed pie is simply divided through haggling or threats.'' Rather, it was about how one approaches the problem, recognizing the other side's needs, understanding their interests, and in doing so maximizing outcomes for both sides. That was the genius of the ``without giving in'' part of ``Getting to Yes.'' While some might assume he meant getting one's way at another's expense, Roger recognized that is rarely possible or desirable, and it is often not necessary for a good result. But he also saw how lacking in the basic analytical and practical tools of negotiation most people are.  I often think of Roger when I see the House and Senate so polarized and incapable of the positive, creative thinking and compromise that are necessary to deal effectively with issues of importance to our constituents, to the country, and to the world. ``Getting to Yes'' should be mandatory reading for every Member of Congress. It contains invaluable lessons for the job the American people sent us here to do.  I want to express my condolences to Roger's two sons, Elliot and Peter. Elliot Fisher lives in Vermont, is a respected physician at the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center and a leading voice for health policy reform. Peter Fisher has had a distinguished career in finance, including at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and as an Under Secretary of the Treasury. I have no doubt they both have put to good use the lessons of their father.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an obituary in the Economist about Roger Fisher.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                            [Sept. 15, 2012]                              Roger FisherRoger Fisher, lawyer, teacher and peacemaker, died on August 25th, aged                                    90       He might be an academic--40 years on the faculty of Harvard      Law School--but Roger Fisher was really a fixer. He would      relax by mending the plumbing, or laying brick terraces at      the summer house he loved in Martha's Vineyard. But that was      tiddler stuff. At breakfast he would scan the New York Times,      looking for bigger problems he could fix: arms control,      hostage-taking, the Middle East. Over dinner the conversation      would be sorting out Vietnam, or ending the war in El      Salvador. At his 80th birthday party, most other guests gone,      he was found deep in a discussion of peace between Arabs and      Israelis.       As long as there were disputes in the world and energy in      his body, he was going to help resolve them. If it needed a      letter to a head of state, he would send it. If it needed him      on the next flight to Moscow or Tokyo, he would catch it.      People didn't have to invite him in. He would go anyway,      tall, slim and smiling, and slip into action behind the      scenes. With that sunny confidence he always had, he knew he      could make the world better. And so did others: J.K.      Galbraith remarked that if he knew Mr. Fisher was on to a      problem, it always eased his conscience.       Mr. Fisher had a system. He outlined it with William Ury in      his book ``Getting to     Yes'' (1981), which sold 3 million copies; he also taught it      to students, especially, from 1979, through his Harvard      Negotiation Project. Like all good tools, it got better with      use. In any negotiation, he wrote--even with terrorists--it      was vital to separate the people from the problem; to focus      on the underlying interests of both sides, rather than stake      out unwavering positions; and to explore all possible options      before making a decision. The parties should try to build a      rapport, check each other out, even just by shaking hands or      eating together. Each should ``listen actively'', as he      always did, to what the other was saying. They should      recognise the emotions on either side, from a longing for      security to a craving for status. And they should try to get      inside each other's heads.       That was the theory, and Mr. Fisher delighted to put it      into practice. At the Geneva summit of 1985, for example,      Ronald Reagan on his advice did not confront Mikhail      Gorbachev, but sat by a roaring fire with him while they      exchanged ideas. More summits followed. A border war between      Peru and Ecuador was nipped in the bud when Mr. Fisher      advised the president of Ecuador (once a pupil of his) to sit      on a sofa with the Peruvian president, and look at a map with      him. Interviewing President Nasser of Egypt in 1970, Mr.      Fisher asked him how Golda Meir, then Israel's prime      minister, would be regarded at home if she agreed to all his      demands. ``Boy, would she have a problem!'' Nasser laughed.      He then grew thoughtful, having briefly seen their dispute      from her point of view.       The Middle East, which caused him personal grief, also      brought his most public success. His principles were used all      through the Camp David negotiations of 1978, from the      brainstorming over Jimmy Carter's draft of an agreement (23      rewrites) to the moment when Mr. Carter presented Menachem      Begin, the Israeli leader, with signed pictures dedicated, by      name, to each of Begin's grandchildren. Deeply affected,      Begin began to talk about his family. The accords were signed      that day.       He had his failures. As a Pentagon adviser in the 1960s he      suggested several ``yesable propositions'' to put to the      North Vietnamese; Robert McNamara listened, but not the      military brass. In 1967 he had fun trying to nurse the tiny,      dusty island of Anguilla to independent statehood, but the      experiment was overturned. South Africa possibly satisfied      him most: the Afrikaner cabinet and ANC officials, trained      separately by him in negotiation workshops, agreeing to end      apartheid without resorting to violence.                         Lessons from the souk       Mr. Fisher's motivation was as clear as his writing. He      hated war. His own service had been as a weather      reconnaissance officer; in the course of it he had lost his      roommate and many college friends. He had also flown often      over Japan, harmless morning flights which the Japanese, pre-     Hiroshima, had fatally learned to ignore. All those deaths      weighed on him.       More light-heartedly, he grew up as one of six children,      preferring to strike bargains rather than land a punch. Later      on, still bargain-minded, he would stroll the souks of      Damascus or Jerusalem, looking to expand his collection of      ancient weights. Every one of those pieces represented a      tough negotiation successfully concluded. For those who found      his principles too idealistic, he could point to age-old      haggling tricks he also recommended: pretending not to be      interested, refusing to react to pressure, being prepared to      walk away.       His most pleasing bargain, though, was the one he made to      get his lot on the Vineyard. There he built a glass and      shingle house right between the pounding ocean and Watcha      Pond, where ospreys nested. When he first found the place,      the owner refused to part with the few acres he needed. He      would sell him only the whole property, 60 acres or so, which      cost too much. But Mr. Fisher called in friends, they all      clubbed together, the deal was agreed; and he spent 50      glorious summers there, in just the sort of sweet, wise,      negotiated peace he always wished for the world.                          ____________________
