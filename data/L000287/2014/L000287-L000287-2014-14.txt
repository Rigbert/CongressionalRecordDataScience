Speaker, I rise today to honor a very special woman, Chief RosemaryCloud, of East Point, GA. She is the first African-American woman to lead a paid professional fire department in America.  I am proud to recognize my amazing constituent on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives.

For the past 12 years, she has served as the Fire Chief of the East Point Fire Department. Over her years of service, Chief Cloud has managed 35 fire stations and over 1,000 employees.  Chief Cloud's service extends beyond Metro Atlanta. She was the Appointed Subject Matter Expert on Homeland Security Presidential Directive-8 for the White House National Security Council. She helped develop policies to help the United States prevent and respond to terrorist threats, major disasters, and other emergencies. Chief Cloud was also recently inducted into the International Women in Homeland Security and Emergency Management Hall of Fame.  Additionally, Chief Cloud is actively involved in her community. She currently mentors young people through leadership programs. She has also established more than 10 community service public safety programs in East Point.  Mr. Speaker, Chief Cloud's dedication to public service is inspirational and patriotic. I applaud her service and leadership, and I congratulate her on this historic appointment.                          ____________________
