Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that information, and also for planning purposes that assurance for March 12.  We talked last week and we know that the highway reauthorization extension for 2 months was worked out. When can we expect the committees to mark up the reauthorization bill, and when do you expect to see it on the floor.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will continue to yield, I believe the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young) is in the process of working with the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar), the ranking member, and members of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure to develop a product that can move through this House before the Easter recess and be signed into law as quickly as possible. So if we back away from our Easter recess, I would hope that the committee would, within the next couple of weeks, be marking up a bill so we can get it to the floor before the Easter recess.                              {time}  1300
