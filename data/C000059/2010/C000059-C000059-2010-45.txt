Brigadier General James L. Melin, of the United States Air Force Reserve, is a true American hero and today I thank him for his 39 years of service. On Saturday, March 27, 2010, General Melin will be honored at his retirement and Change of Command Ceremony at March Air Force Base in California.  General Melin was commissioned through the ROTC program at St. Louis University, Missouri, and graduated in 1971.

In 1997, General Melin commanded the 434th Operations Group, Grissom ARB, Indiana and later assumed command of the 434th Air Refueling Wing. Starting in 2006, General Melin took command of the 452nd Air Mobility Wing at March Air Force Base in California.  Throughout his exemplary career, General Melin has flewn over 5,500 hours and participated in tanker operations in Desert Shield, Desert Storm, Joint Forge, Noble Eagle, Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom.
