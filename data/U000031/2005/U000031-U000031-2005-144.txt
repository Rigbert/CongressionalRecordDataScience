Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Paula Dawning who recently was awarded the honor of State Superintendent of the Year for 2006 in the State of Michigan. Dawning has been the Superintendent of Benton Harbor Areas Schools since July of 2002 after she retired from her career as an executive at AT&T.  The Benton Harbor school system has made progress by leaps and bounds under her direction of during the past few years. Her constant commitment to academic improvement and reform--including additions like the new freshmen academy, improved reading programs, and her fiscal responsibility--have helped bring about a new sense of hope and achievement in a school system that has faced difficult challenges.  The award came as a surprise to Paula, who was not even made aware of her nomination until she had already received the award. In her usual humble demeanor she accepted the prestigius award that recognized her as an outstanding school superintendent; evidence that she stands out as the best among many highly qualified school system administrators.  I want to personally thank Paula for her service which has improved not only the education, but also the lives of the students in Benton Harbor. Paula's hard work and dedication to the children of her community make her a living example to all of people of Southwestern Michigan. I congratulate her once again for her distinguished award.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Page E2372]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                      CONGRATULATING PAULA DAWNING                                 ______                                                             HON.
