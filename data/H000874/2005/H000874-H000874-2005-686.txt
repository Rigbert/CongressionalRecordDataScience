Leader, we obviously have a disagreement in the perceptions as to what the rule does and does not do. I think both you and I are very concerned about the reputation and integrity of this House. I think you share that view and I share that view. It is my suggestion that resolving this in a way that is bipartisan will be productive for the House.                              {time}  1615  Mr. Hefley, the former chairman, I do not agree with Mr. Hefley on a lot of things, but I do agree with his perception of how we protect the integrity of the House. There may be people on my side of the aisle who agree with your perception and not mine. I understand that. The fact is, though, that it would be in the best interest of this House and this country for us to resolve these matters in a bipartisan way either through, as our leader has proposed, a commission to be a joint commission equally divided, as was the Livingston-Cardin commission, or, in the alternative, to consider H.R. 131.  The leader is absolutely right, and I made that aside, as you recall. We did vote against the rules package, but we had agreed to the components, and there was no controversy about the ethics component in the rules package. There were other things with which we disagreed, obviously, but that was an agreement, and it was reached in a bipartisan fashion.  This was not reached in a bipartisan fashion. And, yes, as both parties usually did, I can remember, it is getting more difficult to remember, but I can remember when we were in charge and your side used to vote unanimously against our rules package and we pretty much do the same because we have some disagreements. But there was agreement on the rules package as it related to the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, and the reason for that is because both sides felt it to be very important.  Mr. DeLAY. If the gentleman would yield.  I have to remind the gentleman, and I know going back to 1997 is very difficult, but this was not part of the rules package. This was voted on September 18, 1997, and it was on the recommendations for reforming the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, and the gentleman that worked on the recommendation and the gentleman speaking voted against the recommendations, not on the House rules package.  My point, and I do not want to belabor that for the gentleman, I think it is very important that if the gentleman is protecting a package and a rules ethics reform that he voted against, I think that is one thing. But the other thing is we are working in a bipartisan way, I hope. The chairman and ranking member are dealing with this. A commission would just open up the whole recommendations that the gentleman from Maryland worked on and the gentleman from Louisiana worked on.  I do not think we need a complete overhaul of the ethics process, but there are certain problems that were found in practice that the Speaker felt needed to be done in order to protect the Members. And I have got to tell you, the Members on your side of the aisle as well as my side of the aisle better think about this very seriously because we do want to protect the integrity of the institution. But, as important as that is, we also want to protect the rights of the Members.
