A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide an exclusion from gross income for distributions from qualified State tuition programs which are used to pay education expenses; to the Committee on Finance.                    educational savings legislation Mr. McCONNELL.  Mr. President, I come to the floor today to introduce legislation that addresses an important issue facing American families today--the education of their children. It is my long-held belief that we need to make a college education more affordable, and the legislation I am introducing today, the College Savings Act, will do just that by providing tax incentives to families who save for college.  This legislation is a serious effort to reward long-term saving by making savings for education tax-free. It is important that we not forget that compounded interest cuts both ways. By saving, participants can keep pace, or even ahead of, tuition increases while putting a little away at a time. By borrowing, students bear added interest costs that add thousands to the total cost of tuition. Savings will have a positive impact, by reducing the need for students to borrow tens of thousands of dollars in student loans. This will help make need-based grants, which target low-income families, go much further.  Mr. President, anyone with a child in college knows first-hand the expense of higher education. Throughout the 1990's, education costs have continually outstripped the gains in income. Tuition rates have now become the greatest obstacle students face in attending college. In fact, the astronomical increase in college costs has been well documented. According to a study conducted by the College Board, tuition and fees for a four-year public university rose 107 percent from 1980-1997, while median household income rose only 12 percent.  Due to the high cost of education, more and more families have come to rely on financial aid to meet tuition costs. In fact, a majority of all college students utilize some amount of financial assistance. In 1997-98, $60 billion in financial aid was available to students and their families from federal, state, and institutional sources. This was $3 billion higher than the previous year. A majority of this increase in aid was in the form of loans, which now make up the largest portion of the total federal-aid package at 57 percent. Grants, which a decade ago made up 49 percent of assistance, have been reduced to 42 percent. This shift toward loans further burdens students and families with additional interest costs.  We must reverse the dependence on federal assistance and encourage families to save. My legislation would reward savings and allow students and families that are participating in these state-sponsored plans to be exempt from federal income tax when the funds are used for qualified educational purposes. This legislation also recognizes the leadership that states have provided in helping families save for college. In the mid-1980s, states identified the difficulty families had in keeping pace with the rising cost of education. States like Kentucky, Florida, Ohio, and Michigan were the first to start programs in order to help families save for college. Nationwide more than 30 states have established savings programs, and over a dozen states are preparing to implement plans in the near future. Today, there are nearly one million savers who have contributed over $3 billion in education savings. The provision which I authored, which allows tax-free education savings in state-sponsored savings plans for education purposes, provides nearly a $1.5 billion tax break for middle-class savers nationwide. In Kentucky, over 3,720 families have established accounts, which amount to about $7.5 million in savings.  Mr. President, I have worked closely with the state plan administrators over the years seeking both their advice and support. Again this year, I am pleased to have the National Association of State Treasurers and the College Savings Plans Network endorse this legislation. They have worked tirelessly in support of this legislation because they know it is in the best interest of plan participants--the families who care about their children's education.  Mr. President, many Kentuckians are drawn to this program because it offers a low-cost, disciplined approach to savings. In fact, the average monthly contribution in Kentucky is just $52. It is also important to note that 60 percent of the participants earn under $60,000 per year. By exempting all interest earnings from state taxes, my legislation rewards parents who are serious about their children's future and who are committed over the long-term to the education of their children by providing a significant tax break for middle-class savers nationwide. Clearly, this benefits middle-class families.  In 1994, I introduced the first bill to make education savings exempt from taxation. Since then I have won a couple of battles, but still haven't won the war. To win the war, Congress needs to make education savings tax free--from start to finish. The bill I am introducing today will achieve that goal.  In 1996, Congress took the first step in providing tax relief to families investing in these programs. In the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996, I was able to include a provision that clarified the tax treatment of state-sponsored savings plans and the participants' investment. This measure put an end to the tax uncertainty that has hampered the effectiveness of these state-sponsored programs and helped families who are trying to save for their children's education. Also in 1996, Virginia started its plan and was overwhelmed by the positive response. In its first year, the plan sold 16,111 contracts raising $260 million. This success exceeded all goals for this program.  In 1997, the Taxpayer Relief Act made revisions to provide maximized flexibility to families saving for their children's college education. The most significant reform was to expand the definition of ``qualified education costs'' to include room and board, thus doubling the amount families could save tax-free. In Kentucky, room and board at a public institution make up half of all college costs. This important legislation also expanded the definition of eligible institutions to include all schools, including certain proprietary schools, and defined the term ``member of family'' to allow rollover eligibility for cousins and step-siblings in the event that the original beneficiary does not attend college.  Last year, the Senate passed legislation, sponsored by Senator Coverdell and Senator Torricelli, which would have allowed parents to place as much as $2,000 per year, per child, in an education savings account for kindergarten through high school education. Included in this legislation was my proposal to make savings in state-sponsored tuition plans tax-free. Unfortunately, the bill was vetoed by President Clinton.  As a result of our actions over the last several years, more and more state plans have implemented tuition savings and prepaid plans for their residents. It is projected that there will be 43 states with tuition savings plans by the year 2000. I believe that we have a real opportunity to go even further toward making college affordable to American families. It is in our best interest as a nation to maintain a quality and affordable education system for everyone. By passing this legislation, we can help families help themselves by rewarding savings. This will reduce the cost of education and will not unnecessarily burden future generations with thousands of dollars in loans.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill and letters endorsing my legislation from the Kentucky Higher Education Assistance Authority and the National Association of State Treasurers be printed in theRecord, along with an article from Time magazine that discusses the popularity of state tuition saving programs.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 387       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

Hon. Mitch McConnell,     U.S. Senate, Russell Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: Your tremendous support of the      Kentucky Educational Savings Plan Trust (Trust) has led to      more favorable federal tax treatment of this program and      other qualified state tuition programs (QSTPs) around the      country. The success achieved through your work provides      Kentucky families a greater opportunity to save for the      higher education costs of their children.       I am writing to ask for your continued leadership on this      issue by pushing forward to obtain tax-free treatment for      amounts distributed from QSTPs to cover qualified higher      education expenses. Significant progress has been made in      this area during the past three years, and we believe your      continued efforts will achieve the final goal of tax-free      treatment.       Currently, over 2,800 Kentucky families have saved over      $7.5 million dollars through the Trust for their children's      higher education. We greatly appreciate your efforts to help      Kentucky families save for higher education and look forward      to continuing to work with you and your staff on this      important initiative.           Sincerely,                                                   Paul P. Borden,     Executive Director.                                  ____                                College Savings Plans Network,                                                 February 4, 1999.     Re college savings legislation.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: On behalf of the College Savings      Plans Network (``CSPN''), which represents the 44 states      currently offering and managing colleges savings programs, I      am writing to express our strong support for your legislation      to provide tax-free treatment for contributions to the      qualified state tuition programs. CSPN applauds your      leadership on legislation to encourage savings for college.      Currently, there are over 849,288 signed college tuition      contracts. The estimated fair market value of these contracts      if $4.2 billion. The families participating in the programs      appreciate your efforts on their behalf.       The College Savings Plans Network embraces and fully      supports the intent of the College Savings Act of 1999. The      public policy intent of this proposal is to enable and      motivate families to save for college by providing clear and      easily understood tax treatment of the qualified state      tuition plans.       CSPN greatly appreciates and fully supports the legislation      and your leadership on this proposal.           Sincerely,                                                 Marshall Bennett,         Chairman, College Savings Plans Network, and Mississippi      State Treasurer.                                  ____                       [From Time, Dec. 7, 1998]                      New Way to Save for College         (Online advice from Time finance columnist Dan Kadlec)       The best college-savings program you never heard about      keeps getting better. As you think about year-end tax moves,      consider dropping some cash into a state-sponsored plan where      money for college grows tax-deferred and may garner a fat      state income tax exemption as well. This plan is relatively      new and often gets confused with more common prepaid-tuition      plans, in which you pay today and attend later--removing      worries about higher tuition in the future. Savings plans are      vastly different and in most cases superior because they are      more flexible.       Prepaid plans offer tax advantages, and some are portable,      but many still apply only to public colleges within the      taxpayer's state. What if Junior gets accepted to Harvard?      You can get your contributions back. But some states refund      only principal, beating you out of years' worth of investment      gains. And state prepaid plans make it tougher to get student      aid because the money is held in the student's name. With      savings plans the money is in a parent's name, where it      counts less heavily in student-aid formulas--and you can set      aside as much as $100,000 for expenses at any U.S. college.       Both the prepaid and the college-savings plans vary from      state to state. Check out the website ``collegesaving.org''      for details. It's a fast-moving area. In the next few months,      eight states will join the 15 that already have state      college-savings programs. Those are mostly in addition to the      19 that have prepaid-tuition plans. Only Massachusetts will      probably offer both.       Most of the newer savings plans make contributions      deductible against state taxes. New York, for example,      launched its plan two months ago. It permits couples to set      aside up to $10,000 a year per student and lets New York      residents deduct the full amount from their income on their      state return. Missouri will approve a tax-deductible savings      plan in December. Minnesota is expected to adopt a plan in      which the state matches 5% of your contributions. These      college-savings plans are open to everyone, regardless of      income--in contract to the Roth IRA and other federal savings      plans, in which eligibility begins to phase out for couples      earning more than $100,000.       If your state doesn't offer a college-savings plan, you can      still participate through an out-of-state plan. You won't get      the state tax deduction, but you will get tax-deferred      investment growth; and when the money is tapped, it will be      taxed at the student's rate (usually 15%). Fidelity      Investments (800-544-1722), which runs the New Hampshire      savings plan, and TIAA-CREF (877-697-2337; www.nysaves.org),      which runs the New York plan, make it easy. If your state      later offers a savings plan with a tax deduction, you can      transfer your account penalty free.       Both plans invest mostly in stocks in the early years and      slowly shift into bonds and money markets as your student      nears college age. You get no say in this allocation. The      impact of tax deferral is big. TIAA-CREF estimates that      someone in the 28% tax bracket saving $5,000 a year and      mimicking its investments in a taxable account could expect      to accumulate $167,000 in 18 years.       Deferring taxes and then paying them at 15% brings the      total to $190,000. The state deduction, for those who      qualify, pushes the nest egg to $202,000.       Plan benefits:       Taxes are deferred and then paid at the child's lower rate;       Families are eligible regardless of income or state of      residence; and       Tax deductions are increasingly available on state      returns.
