 There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, July 12, 1998]                           Takings Exception       For all their professed commitment to federalism,      congressional Republicans frequently seem eager to pass laws      dumping quintessentially local matters into federal courts.      The latest such effort is the Property Rights Implementation      Act of 1998, which the Senate is now poised to consider. A      version of this bill was already passed by the House of      Representatives; it was a bad idea then, and it's no better      now.       The principal component of the proposal would give property      owners quicker access to federal courts in their disputes      with local governments over contrasts on the use of private      land. The takings clause of the Fifth Amendment forbids      governments to take private property without providing just      compensation, and battles over such local matters as zoning      sometimes erupt into takings clause litigation.      Traditionally, federal courts have not deemed takings claims      ripe for review until avenues for negotiation with local      officials are exhausted and plaintiffs have first sought      compensation from state courts. The federal judiciary also      has sought to avoid interpreting questions of state law in      takings cases. The Senate bill would change the rules of      takings litigation, allowing property holders into federal      court earlier in the process of negotiations with local      officials. It also would curtail the abstention authority of      the federal courts. It would, in other words, make federal      cases out of a whole class of property fights now treated as      local matters.       The other prong of the legislation would give those      claimants who are suing the federal government a wider choice      of venues in which to do battle than they now enjoy.      Currently, those who feel their property rights are being      infringed can sue in federal district court seeking to have      the federal agency stopped, or they can sue in the Court of      Federal Claims for compensation for an alleged taking. The      current proposal would give both courts jurisdiction over      both types of claim. This is an invitation for abusive venue-     shopping by plaintiffs, and the Justice Department has warned      that it also poses constitutional problems.       The department has said it will recommend that President      Clinton veto this bill, and he should certainly do so if it      passes. Current takings law is murky, but its murkiness      strikes a useful balance, allowing government to implement      zoning, environmental and other rules that can restrict the      use of private property while still permitting compensation      where that property is physically invaded or grievously      devalued. That balance should not be altered.
