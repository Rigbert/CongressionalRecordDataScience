  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, well, the Republicans can try and dredge up the ghosts of administrations past, but this commission report released this morning says that both the Clinton and Bush administrations are equally culpable in 9/11. What they say is there is an ongoing failure. The greatest failure is of our intelligence agencies and law enforcement agencies to share information.  They say no matter how much money you dump into the intelligence agencies, they are going to continue to fail because of the culture of keeping their own information. They say we need to establish a new way of sharing information among those agencies.  The gigantic bureaucracy of the Department of Homeland Security, written on the back of a napkin by Karl Rove at the White House, did not get there because it excluded the intelligence agencies who failed the United States of America. Nothing has been done about this ongoing failing to integrate the information. They put out something called the TTIC, the Terrorist Threat Information Center. Guess what? They send low-level people there on short details and they do not share. They are like 3-year-olds about billion dollar budgets.  They have the information to make this country safe. It is time for this Congress and this administration to take the steps we need that are outlined in this report. Forget about Sandy Berger and a bunch of other B.S.                          ____________________
