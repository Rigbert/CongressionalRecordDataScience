Countrywide is one of the worst abusers, the worst abuser, in this scandal.  So, during the 1990s, the mortgage process became hooked to Wall Street. Then for the first time in American history, those mortgages, rather than being held by your local banks where you had to go in where they knew you and where they knew whether your father had a job or whatever else, were traded up to these anonymous institutions, to people who didn't even live in your community. Then they did something they'd never done before in American history. They sold them into the international market.  One of the real problems in places like Toledo and, I'm sure, in Cleveland, Congressman Kucinich, is that the workouts are very difficult to do because you're not sure who is the ultimate holder of your loan. How many of the millions of people being hurt by this go to the telephone and try to work out a deal with one of these companies? As for IndyMac, the company that just went belly-up last week, their CEO made a salary of $1 million, a bonus of $1 million, whatever. Now that institution from California is in trouble. Try to work out your loan. Who holds your paper? How do you get that person on the phone?  It's a totally anonymous, faceless system for millions of Americans, and it was meant to happen, and now the American people are being asked to become the insurance company for Wall Street--for investment banks and for Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, which are not insured institutions of the Government of the United States of America--to the tune of who knows how much--$1 trillion? $2 trillion? $3 trillion?
