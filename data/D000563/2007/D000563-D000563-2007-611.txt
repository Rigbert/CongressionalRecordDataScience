When you consider the fact that low-income students in America today and minority students are about 50 percent likely to graduate from high school--many of them drop out--they are out there. They are somewhere in America. They haven't reached their full potential and may never.  What the Senator shows us with this chart is that those who are lucky enough to get started toward earning a college degree--and the lower income categories have the toughest time--you have to believe, as I do, that many of those students who don't finish is because of financial reasons. These are students who are struggling and doing their best. I have seen them.  I can recall a young student in Springfield attending Lincoln Land Community College. She was a young woman who had a child while she was in high school, but she was determined that she was going to make it through college. She used to take her baby with her on a bus out to our community college, which is not in town but in the outskirts, and she had to get the last bus back into town every night. When I think about the sacrifice she was making to take that baby and catch that bus and make it out there, you knew how much she wanted it, but you also knew that she was right on the edge financially at any given moment, whether she could complete her education.  So what you are doing in this bill in giving these students a helping hand is not only going to mean more college graduates but, to the point the Senator raised, it is going to result in a fairer society in America, more opportunity, so that the disparity between incomes, the highest and lowest levels in America, is reduced. I thank the Senator for his leadership.
