 President, the senseless loss of life in San Bernardino continues to defy explanation. We have faith that law enforcement will continue working hard to uncover the truth behind this tragedy. Today, what we should all agree upon is that we will keep the victims and the families in our thoughts, that we as a Senate offer condolences to them, and that we as a Senate recognize the continuing efforts of law enforcement officials and first responders.                          ____________________
