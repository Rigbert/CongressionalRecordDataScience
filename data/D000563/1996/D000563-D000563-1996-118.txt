Speaker, let me tell my colleagues what this shameful debate is all about. Rather than risk offending the NRA, Speaker Gingrich would rather risk the lives of policemen and innocent people.  Today I received a letter from a Chicago policeman who puts his life on the line every day fighting gangs in that city. He sent me clippings of policemen killed in Chicago by these assault weapons and begged me to vote against this ban. The choice before this House is between the police and the gun lobby. The choice is between the safety of the men and women who put the badges on and put their lives on the line every day and the political power of the gun lobby. Vote no on this shameful bill.
