President, I was shocked a little bit this morning to read in the Washington Times a story by Ralph Hallow in which he quotes a statement that was supposedly attributed to me by Mr. Paul Weyrich. I would like to read it.  Hallow writes that:       Mr. Weyrich said that at his regular Tuesday meeting for      conservative leaders, Senator James Inhofe, Oklahoma      Republican,     accused Mr. Lott of having ``betrayed the national-security      interests of the country.''  I have to tell you, Mr. President, that I don't think anything like this has ever happened to me. Even though I don't have thin skin--I have been beat up by the liberal media quite often--this is not the case. I never made such a statement.  I even checked the tape of a TV show that I had with the gentleman, Mr. Weyrich recently, and I find nothing but compliments which I made about Mr. Lott. I did say on a couple of occasions that I disagreed with him on the chemical weapons stand. I disagreed with him on his suggestion in terms of potential punishment for Lt. Flynn. However, I was very complimentary of him.  Just a few minutes ago I received a memo from Paul Weyrich which clarifies the matter. I want to read into the Record the first half of that memo, dated this morning.       Once again Ralph Hallow has caused a problem. He called me      on my private line and asked my views on Lott and Lt. Flynn,      which I was happy to give. He asked me about the rest of the      movement, and I told him that at the Wednesday lunch we gave      Senator Inhofe a message to take back to the Steering      Committee which was supported almost unanimously by the 65 or      so in attendance. I then quoted Frank Gaffney as saying that      twice in a month Senator Lott had betrayed the security      interests of the United States. Instead, he attributes this      quote to Senator Inhofe, who refrained from criticizing Lott      even though he disagrees with him. Believe me, Hallow did not      misunderstand what I told him because he even called me back      and said he had interviewed Inhofe and he--Inhofe--refused to      be critical of Lott.  Thank you, Mr. President.                          ____________________
