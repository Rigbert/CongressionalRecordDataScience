President, today I have informed the minority leader that I will object to any unanimous consent request to proceed to S. 1272 or any legislation containing provisions that would override Oregon's physician assisted suicide law. I have notified the bill's sponsor and the committee chairman and ranking member to which it was referred.                          ____________________
