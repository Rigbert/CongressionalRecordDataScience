 President, these committee resolutions reflect the fact that Senator Blunt will remain chair and Senator Schumer will remain ranking member of the Rules Committee until the inaugural ceremonies have been completed.  It is my understanding that following the inauguration, Senator Shelby will become chair and Senator Klobuchar will become ranking member of the Rules Committee.
