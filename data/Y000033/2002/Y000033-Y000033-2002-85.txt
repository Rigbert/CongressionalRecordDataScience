Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  It is rare that I do this as the chairman of two committees over the period of the last 8 years, but I would like to acknowledge at this time the work that has been mentioned by other Members that have spoken, the work of the staff. This has been a long, trying period of time. I want to compliment the staff on the minority side but I also, because I pay their bills, would like to compliment Graham Hill, especially, for his work and his outstanding dedication and perseverance; Levon Boyagian, who has been with me now as the counsel for the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure; Mike Henry from the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure; Frank Mulvey; David Heymsfeld; Ward McCarragher; and, of course, Liz Megginson, who is my chief counsel.  I rarely do this because I know they are doing what they love to do, but this has been a very complex issue; it takes a lot of work, a lot of discussion, some which I do not have the patience for, and I will be the first one to admit that; but we worked together as a group collectively and fought out the battles and discussed it.  I can truthfully say I believe that this piece of legislation is a great step forward to accomplish what I am seeking to do and have the safest pipelines in the United States. Twenty-two million miles of pipeline exist in the United States. This will be the first time where we know they will be inspected in a period of time, they will be repaired under the system of this bill on time, we will not have the accidents, hopefully, that have been happening in the past, and we will be able to deliver that product to the homes that they so badly need to live their lives.  Again, I thank the staff for the work they have done on both sides of the aisle.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
