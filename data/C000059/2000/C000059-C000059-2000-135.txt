Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the Rotary Club of Riverside's 80th anniversary. From their very conception on April 20, 1920, when they received their charter from Rotary International, the Club has enriched the Riverside community by observing the Rotary motto, ``Service Above Self.'' Members of the club include community leaders in business, trade, professions and government.  The Rotary Club of Riverside has given to the local community by sponsoring projects to aid Riverside youth through the sponsorship of Bryant Elementary School; through an annual awarding of scholarships to deserving Riverside high school seniors, from the $200,000 John Cote Scholarship Fund; through the establishment of a vibrant Interact Club at Riverside Poly High School; and through contributions to the establishment of the Riverside Youth Museum.  On an international basis the Rotary Club of Riverside has contributed and supported the Rotary International Polio Plus program to eradicate polio in developing countries and regions worldwide; and a little closer to home, through materials, gifts and caring to the children of orphanages in Tijuana, Mexico, in partnership with the Rotarian of Centenario Rotary Club of Tijuana.  The Rotary Club of Riverside will officially observe its anniversary with a Picnic Celebration on April 2, 2000, in Riverside, CA. It will be attended by the club's members and their families, guests and dignitaries, including: the Honorable Ronald Loveridge, the mayor of Riverside; the Honorable Tom Mullen, chairman of the Riverside County Board of Supervisors representing the 5th county district; and the Honorable Rod Pacheco, California Assemblyman representing the 64th assembly district.  Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the Rotary Club of Riverside on its 80th anniversary and commend its local community and international service.                          ____________________
