The first is, if you like the health care you have, you can keep it.  We know the bill before us breaks this pledge because all but two in the majority voted to preserve the nearly $500 billion in cuts to Medicare, which includes $120 billion in cuts to Medicare Advantage.  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, or CBO, has confirmed that these cuts to Medicare Advantage mean that ``approximately half'' of the Medicare Advantage benefits will be cut for the nearly 11 million seniors who are enrolled in this program.  This vote confirms whether Americans will be able to preserve and keep the health care benefits they have and like. That answer, unfortunately, is no.  So now let's look at the President's second pledge: that he will not raise taxes on families earning under $250,000 or individuals earning under $200,000.  A number of my colleagues have pointed to comments made last year in Dover, NH, by then-Candidate Obama, who said:       I can make a firm pledge--  And we have heard this before--       . . . no family making less than $250,000 will see their      taxes increase--not your income taxes, not your payroll      taxes, not your capital gains taxes, not any of your taxes.  I think he said ``by one dime'' at the end of that.  Yet time and again in this bill, that pledge is also broken. This bill calls for nearly $500 billion in new taxes, penalties, and fees that hit virtually every American, including middle-class families making less than $250,000 and individuals earning less than $200,000.  Even though the majority has tried to disguise these taxes as various ``fees'' and presents them as being paid for by targeted health care industries, the reality is that this bill taxes the average American coming and going.  It taxes you if you have health insurance. It taxes you if you do not have health insurance. It taxes you if you use medical devices, such as a hearing aid or a pacemaker. It taxes you if you save on your own to pay for your health care expenses. And it effectively increases taxes for individuals and families with catastrophic medical expenses.  Americans should understand that the higher taxes called for in this bill will come straight out of their pockets, with the middle class bearing much of this tax burden.  Let me give you a few examples of the new taxes proposed and who will pay for them.  The bill imposes a 40-percent excise tax on health insurance providers that offer high-cost health insurance plans. This provision is the largest tax hike in the bill and raises almost $150 billion and will be paid for primarily by individuals--not the health insurance provider, but by individuals--through increased income and payroll taxes.  By the time this bill is fully implemented, 84 percent of this tax on ``high-cost plans'' will be paid by Americans who earn less than $200,000--taxpayers the President promised would not pay additional taxes.  Second, the bill imposes new taxes on health insurance providers and medical device manufacturers. Both the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation have said these taxes will be passed on to consumers in the form of higher insurance premiums. The new $60 billion tax on health insurance providers alone could raise premiums by as much as 2 percent according to some analyses, and that increase could come as early as next year.  Not only that, the $19.3 billion in new taxes on medical devices could increase costs for up to 80,000 medical products, such as heart stents, blood pressure monitors, eyeglasses, pacemakers, hearing aids, and advanced diagnostic equipment. Such a tax would stifle and will stifle innovation and reduce the ability for manufacturers to develop new lifesaving devices and technologies.  So make no mistake, the cost of this tax will be passed on to and paid for by anyone who uses a medical device, including those middle-class taxpayers the President has pledged will not experience any tax increase.  If you need a pacemaker or a stent, you will pay more for it because of these new taxes. If you need a diagnostic procedure, you will pay more for it because of this new tax.  Furthermore, under this bill, the floor for deducting medical expenses from income tax is raised from 7.5 percent to 10 percent of adjusted gross income. Those who will take this deduction are most often seniors and those with serious or catastrophic medical issues.  For a family of four, earning $57,000 in 2013, limiting the deduction means they would lose a tax deduction of $1,425. A family of four earning $92,000 would lose a tax deduction of $2,300.  It goes without saying, I think, that losing a portion of your tax deduction means you pay more in taxes. These are real dollars to hard-working Americans. This provision alone raises $15 billion in new taxes on Americans who deduct medical expenses.  Finally, this bill raises taxes for the more than 35 million Americans who participate in flexible spending accounts, or FSAs. For the first time, this benefit to middle-income workers is taxed to pay for new government spending and an expansion of entitlement programs.  FSAs are a key benefit for many families for whom health insurance does not cover or does not cover sufficiently some of their highest cost health care expenses such as dental, vision, as well as prescription drug costs. They are also important for individuals who manage chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, or cancer.  Flexible savings accounts allow the participants to set aside money out of their own pocket to pay for these necessary expenses. However, under this bill, the government caps how much can be set aside in an FSA account at $2,500, effectively raising the tax burden on certain FSA participants and increasing their health care costs.  The typical worker who contributes more that $2,500 to their FSA has a serious medical condition. This means that under this bill, workers with serious illnesses and earning an average of $55,000 will be paying more in taxes.  I have highlighted a few of the many tax hikes in this bill and the fact that the middle-class taxpayers will bear the brunt of these higher taxes, but if there are any doubts remaining about what this bill means for Americans' pocketbooks, let's consider this. An analysis by the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation looked at four tax provisions in the bill and how, when taken together, they will affect Americans. They looked at the tax credit for health insurance, the additional Medicare payroll tax, and several I have already mentioned, including the high-cost plan tax and the medical expense deduction limit. Their analysis shows that when this bill is in full effect, on average individuals making over $50,000and families making over $75,000 would see their taxes go up under this bill. Even after taking into account the premium tax credit, the subsidy that the government will provide to help people offset the cost of health insurance, when this bill is fully in effect, more than 42 million individuals and families or 25 percent--one-quarter of all tax returns under $200,000--will see on average their taxes go up as a result of this bill.  In addition, based on the same information, the Joint Committee on Taxation identified two groups of taxpayers. The first are those individuals and families who are not eligible to receive the premium tax credit to purchase health care, and second are those individuals and families whose taxes will increase first before they then see some type of tax reduction as a result of their premium tax credit. Taking these two groups together, the number is even more disturbing: 73 million individuals and families or 43 percent of all tax returns under $200,000 will on average see their taxes increase under this bill, says the Joint Committee on Taxation.  To put it another way, under this bill, for every one individual or family that benefits from the tax credit to purchase insurance, this bill raises taxes on three middle-income individuals and families. These tax increases are on top of those I discussed earlier, such as the new taxes on FSAs, so the estimates I have already mentioned understate the tax impact, again, on middle-income taxpayers. The JCT the Joint Committee on Taxation--has confirmed that these additional taxes, such as the FSA tax, will likely further raise the taxes of middle-income Americans.  All Americans, and middle-class taxpayers especially, need to take notice of what these higher taxes will mean for them and their families. They need to know these taxes will be used in part to pay for a vast expansion of the role of government in health care and more government intrusion into families health care choices.  Paying for health care on the backs of the middle-class and working Americans is the wrong solution for health care, violates the President's pledge to these taxpayers, and is terribly counterproductive in regard to the No. 1 issue facing this country, and that is jobs and the economy.  I urge my colleagues--I plead with my colleagues--to support the Crapo motion to prevent the enormous tax hike this bill inflicts on middle-class Americans.  Mr. President, I appreciate your indulgence. I know you are ready to go to your conference.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida.) The majority leader is recognized.                          ____________________
