Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the distinguished gentlewoman from Missouri (Ms. McCARTHY).  (Ms. McCARTHY of Missouri asked and was given permission to revise and extend her remarks.)  Ms. McCARTHY of Missouri. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer) for yielding me this time.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Goodling). The amendment is deceptively entitled the Worker Paycheck Fairness Act but is more appropriately named the Worker Gag Act.  The Shays-Meehan bill, of which I am a cosponsor, would ban soft money, regulate phony issue ads on television, and toughen disclosure requirements.  Above all, Shays-Meehan is fair, bipartisan, even-handed reform legislation.  In the guise of reform, the Goodling amendment undoes the balance achieved by Shays-Meehan, which seeks meaningful campaign finance reform to rid the process of the abuse of soft money and restore the people's voice in the electoral process.  I urge my colleagues to vote no on Goodling and support Shays-Meehan.  The Goodling amendment represents an unprecedented governmental intrusion into the internal operations of labor organizations, without a concomitant restriction on the communications of a corporation and its shareholders.                              {time}  1715
