Chairman, the amendment does not mandate that the Secretary of Transportation delete the private jet for the Commandant of the Coast Guard and Members of Congress. It merely says that the Secretary of Transportation must determine what is more important to the maritime safety of this Nation, private jet for the Commandant of the Coast Guard, Members of Congress and others, or 23 small boat lifesaving stations.  I think that we are just sending the issue back to Secretary Pena for another look, because I think perhaps, hopefully, his mind was not clouded by his two private jet trips the Commandant provided last year for $55,000, and hopefully he would look at this objectively and determine we do not need that private jet. It is a luxury jet. It is a personal aircraft. It is not a member of the fleet. It is not used for strategic or military purposes.
