Chairman, the gentleman used the term ``arrangement'' to describe what has occurred in our country on this particular issue. He said the reason a bill could not be brought up on the floor here is perhaps there would not have been a majority of votes.  Would the gentleman agree this is not a parliamentary system, this is not a monarchy, this is a Democratic republic?  Each of us does have a right to express our views and in this instance, yes, an arrangement was made by a handful of individuals in this Government, and we have not met our constitutional responsibilities. Would the gentleman agree this is not a parliamentary system or a monarchy?                              {time}  1645
