1605. I thank Senator Campbell for his leadership on our bipartisan legislation which is intended to save the lives of law enforcement officers across the country by helping state and local law enforcement agencies provide their officers with body armor, this issue. It has been a pleasure working with the senior Senator from Colorado to pass this vital legislation in the Senate. I also want to thank the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, for his strong support of S. 1605.  Far too many police officers are needlessly killed each year while serving to protect our citizens. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, more than 30 percent of the 1,182 officers killed by a firearm in the line of duty since 1980 could have been saved if they had been wearing body armor. Indeed, the FBI estimates that the risk of fatality to officers while not wearing body armor is 14 times higher than for officers wearing it.  Unfortunately, far too many state and local law enforcement agencies cannot afford to provide every officer in their jurisdictions with the protection of body armor. In fact, the Department of Justice estimates that approximately 150,000 State and local law enforcement officers, nearly 25 percent, are not issued body armor.  In countless incidents across the country everyday officers sworn to protect the public and enforce the law are in danger. Last year, an horrific incident along the Vermont and New Hampshire border underscores the need for the quick passage of this legislation to provide maximum protection to those who protect us. On August 19, 1997, Federal, State and local law enforcement authorities in Vermont and New Hampshire had cornered Carl Drega, after hours of hot pursuit. He had shot to death two New Hampshire state troopers and two other victims earlier in the day. In a massive exchange of gunfire with the authorities, Drega was killed.  During that shootout, all federal law enforcement officers wore bulletproof vests, while some state and local officers did not. For example, Federal Border Patrol Officer John Pfeifer, a Vermonter, was seriously wounded in the incident. I am glad that Officer Pfeifer is back on the job after being hospitalized in serious condition. Had it not been for his bulletproof vest, I fear that he and his family might well have paid the ultimate price.  The two New Hampshire state troopers who were killed by Carl Drega were not so lucky. We all grieve for them and our hearts go out to their families. They were not wearing bulletproof vests. Protective vests might not have been able to save the lives of those courageous officers because of the high-powered assault weapons, but the tragedy underscore the point that all of ourlaw enforcement officers, whether federal, state or local, deserve the best protection we can provide, including bulletproof vests.  With that and lesser-known incidents as constant reminders, I will continue to do all I can to help prevent loss of life among our law enforcement officers.  The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Act of 1998 will help by creating a new partnership between the federal government and state and local law enforcement agencies to help save the lives of police officers by providing the resources for each and every law enforcement officer in harm's way to have a bulletproof vest. Our bipartisan bill would create a $25 million matching grant program within the Department of Justice dedicated to helping State and local law enforcement agencies purchase body armor.  In my home State of Vermont, our bill enjoys the strong support of the Vermont State Police, the Vermont Police Chiefs Association and many Vermont sheriffs, troopers, game wardens and other local and state law enforcement officials. In January, I was honored to be joined by Vermont Attorney General William Sorrell, Vermont Commissioner of Public Safety James Walton, Vermont State Police Director John Sinclair, Vermont Fish and Wildlife Lieutenant Robert Rooks, South Burlington Police Chief Lee Graham, South Burlington Vermont Officer Diane Reynolds as we spoke about state and local law enforcement officers' need for body armor.  Since my time as a State prosecutor, I have always taken a keen interest in law enforcement in Vermont and around the country. Vermont has the reputation of being one of the safest states in which to live, work and visit, and rightly so. In no small part, this is due to the hard work of those who have sworn to serve and protect us. And we should do what we can to protect them, when a need like this one comes to our attention.  Our Nation's law enforcement officers put their lives at risk in the line of duty everyday. No one knows when danger will appear. Unfortunately, in today's violent world, even a traffic stop may not necessarily be ``routine.'' In fact, the National Association of Chiefs of Police just reported that 21 police officers were killed in the line of duty last month, nearly double the toll for the month of January in both 1997 and 1996. More than ever, each and every law enforcement officer across the nation deserves the protection of a bulletproof vest.  Our bipartisan legislation enjoys the strong support of numerous nation law enforcement organizations including the Fraternal Order of Police, Police Executive Research Forum, International Union of Police Associations, National Association of Police Organizations and International Brotherhood of Police Officers. The bill also enjoys the support of 38 attorneys general from across the country. Mr. President, I ask for unaminous consent to have printed in the Record letters of support for S. 1605 from all these national law enforcement organizations and the attorneys general.                                        Fraternal Order of Police,                                 National Legislative Program,                                 Washington, DC, January 14, 1998.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on the Judiciary,          Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy, I am writing to you on behalf of the      more than 270,000 members of the Fraternal Order of Police to      offer our strong support of legislation you plan to introduce      in order to establish a grant program to assist local law      enforcement agencies in purchasing body armor for their      officers.       This legislation will greatly increase the number of      officers wearing body armor--and it will save more lives. At      the May 15, 1997 Peace Officers' Memorial Day, the F.O.P.      honored the memories of one hundred and seventeen officers      who were killed in the line of duty in 1996. This year we      have already lost one hundred and sixty from our ranks.       While we know that there is no way to end the deadly risks      inherent to a career in law enforcement, we must do      everything possible to ensure that officers who put their      lives on the line every day also put on a vest. Body armor is      one of the most important pieces of equipment an officer can      have and often means the difference between life and death.      Hopefully, the bill you plan to introduce will increase the      quality and number of armored vests available to America's      law enforcement officers.       On behalf of the Fraternal Officer of Police, I commend you      for your leadership on this important issue and forward to      working with you once it has been introduced. If I can be of      assistance, please contact me or Executive Director Jim Pasco      in my Washington office, (202) 547-8189.           Sincerely,                                              Gilbert G. Gallegos,     National President.                                                                    ____                                            International Union of                                          Police Associations,                                                February 13, 1998.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Russell Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: On behalf of the Executive Committee      and the 80,000 rank and file law enforcement officers of the      International Union of Police Associations, AFL-CIO, we are      proud to endorse and support the ``Bulletproof Vest      Partnership Grant Act of 1998'' as introduced in the Senate      by yourself and Senator Campbell.       Law enforcement officers who put their lives on the line      everyday deserve state of the art body armor and because of      your commitment to law enforcement, officers will have the      protection that could mean the difference between life and      death.       We commend you for your support and legislation and we      pledge our continued assistance toward the enactment of the      ``Bulletproof Vest Partnership Act of 1998.'' Thank you.           Sincerely,                                              Arthur J. Reddy,                                              Legislative Liaison,     International Vice President.                                                                    ____                                    National Association of Police                                          Organizations, Inc.,                                Washington, DC, February 25, 1998.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Ranking Minority Member, Senate Judiciary Committee,          Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: Please be advised that the National      Association of Police Organizations (NAPO), representing more      than 4,000 police unions and associations and more than      220,000 rank and file law enforcement officers      enthusiastically and wholeheartedly supports S. 1605, the      ``Bulletproof Vest Partnership Act of 1998.'' I would like to      take this opportunity to thank you for your efforts in      scheduling the markup of S. 1605, for Thursday, February 26,      1998 at 10:30 am.       As you know, far too many law enforcement officers patrol      our streets and neighborhoods without proper protective gear      against violent criminals. Today, more than ever, violent      criminals have bulletproof vests and deadly weapons at their      disposal. We cannot allow criminals to have the upper hand.      This legislation is a necessary step in adequately protecting      law enforcement officers, who put their lives on the line      every day to serve our communities. This is why NAPO supports      your effort to help state and local law enforcement      departments provide officers with bulletproof vests.       Again, thank you for addressing S. 1605, which is a      legislative priority for NAPO. I appreciate your hard work      and commitment to the law enforcement community and if we can      be of any assistance please contact my office at (202) 842-     4420.           Sincerely,                                                    Robert Scully,     Executive Director.                                                                    ____                              Police Executive Research Forum,                                Washington, DC, February 20, 1998.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: I am writing to you on behalf of the      Police Executive Research Forum (PERF) to offer our strong      support for S. 1605, the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant      Act of 1997. This important piece of legislation would      establish a grant program to assist local law enforcement      agencies in purchasing body armor for their officers.       PERF, a nonprofit organization of progressive police      professionals who serve more than 40 percent of the nation's      population, is firmly committed to helping police obtain      equipment necessary to ensure their safety as they protect      the community. Between 1985 and 1994, more than 2000 police      officers had their lives saved by bulletproof vests. This      bill would greatly increase the numbers of officers wearing      bulletproof vests and will ultimately save more lives.       PERF commends you for your commitment to officer safety and      your leadership on this important issue. If we can be of any      assistance in the future, please feel free to contact me or      Martha Plotkin at (202) 466-7820.           Sincerely,                                                     Chuck Wexler,     Executive Director.                                                                    ____                                      International Brotherhood of                                              Police Officers,                                Alexandria, VA, February 10, 1998.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     United States Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: The International Brotherhood of Police      Officers (IBPO) is an affiliate of the Service Employees      International Union. The IBPO represents over 50,000 police      officers at the federal, state, and local level, including      IBPO Local 506, Brattleboro, Vermont.       On behalf of the entire membership of the IBPO I wish to      thank you for your sponsorship of S. 1605, ``The Bulletproof      Vest Partnership Act of 1998.'' This life saving legislation      will provide protection to police officers across the      country.       In the past few months alone, the IBPO family has dealt      with the tragic deaths of police officers in Boise, Idaho and      Atlanta, who     lost their lives in the line of duty. Every police officer      who takes a call knows the dangers facing them. That is why      this legislation is so crucial.       The number of police officers who do not have access to      bulletproof vests is astounding. Almost 150,000 law      enforcement officers do not have the ability to fully protect      themselves. Simply put, passage of this legislation will save      lives.       The entire membership of the IBPO looks forward to working      with you on this important issue. If you have any questions,      please feel free to contact me.           Sincerely,                                                 Kenneth T. Lyons,     National President.                                                                    ____              State of Vermont Office of the Attorney General,                                                February 26, 1998.     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Senate Committee on the Judiciary.     Hon. Ben Nighthorse Campbell,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Re: Bulletproof Vest Partnership Act of 1998 (S. 1605)       Dear Senators Campbell, Hatch and Leahy: As state attorneys      general, we are writing to express our wholehearted support      for Senate Bill No. 1605, the Bulletproof Vest Partnership      Act of 1998. In our view, this bill will be an invaluable      tool in helping to protect law enforcement officers      throughout the country who risk their lives daily while      serving their communities. This bill would provide much      needed matching grants to state, local and tribal law      enforcement agencies to be used to purchase armor vests for      their officers. We were particularly pleased to note the      provision for waivers of the grantee's matching contribution      in the event of a fiscal hardship by a particular law      enforcement agency.       As you are all too aware, state, local and tribal law      enforcement officers often find themselves in deadly      confrontations with highly armed and dangerous criminals. The      statistics cited in your bill make it imperative that every      officer in the country have ready access to body armor when      it is needed. Your bill will assure that all police      departments will have the resources to equip officers with      body armor as standard equipment. The bill will also allow      reimbursement to those officers who have had to purchase body      armor at their own personal expense.       This bill will enable more officers to wear armor when they      need it. It will definitely save lives. We appreciate your      support for this bill and urge passage of this important      legislation.           Sincerely,       William H. Sorrell, Attorney General of Vermont.       Gale Norton, Attorney General of Colorado.       Bill Pryor, Attorney General of Alabama.       Bruce M. Botelho, Attorney General of Alaska.       Grant Woods, Attorney General of Arizona.
