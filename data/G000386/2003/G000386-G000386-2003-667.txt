  Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment. I obviously do not rise in opposition to the goals the Senator from Maryland seeks, because I, along with Senator Graham of Florida--the two of us are sponsors of an amendment that would provide a $3,000 tax credit for family caregiving. But what we are involved with here is taking money from the tax reduction fund to put into another program. What we need to do is keep the tax reduction fund very strong because it is a growth package, it is a job package. We want to create jobs. We want an economic environment so when our men and women come home from Iraq there are jobs for our men and women. There is no job creation now. We want to create jobs. It is going to take a tax cut to create jobs.
