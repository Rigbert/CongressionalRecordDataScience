    [Excerpts from The World of the Watchers by Edward Pinkowski]                              Introduction       Almost a century after it was created, the equestrian      statue of General Casimir Pulaski in Washington, D.C., has      overshadowed discussion of many subjects, For example, very      few are familiar with the Polish roots of Frank C. Watcher,      who was elected in Baltimore, Maryland, as a Republican to      the 56th Congress in 1898 and was reelected three successive      times. None of the other congressmen then had a drop of      Polish blood.       When Abraham L. Brick, who came from South Bend, Indiana,      to Washington at the same time as Watcher, introduced a bill      for the erection of the monument to Pulaski, Watcher saw that      it had little support. He realized that if he didn't speak      out, none of his colleagues would pay attention to the bill      to honor the Polish hero of the American Revolution. He was      known as an efficacious man, with a cheerful smile, who      easily won others to his side. ``On the last day of the      session the Speaker of the House brought it up for      consideration,'' he told a reporter of the Baltimore Sun in      1902. ``The bill passed.''       It took years after that for the federal government to set      up a commission, find a site for the Pulaski monument in the      nation's capital, and work out the rest of the details. The      sculptor was Kazimierz Chodzinski, who had studied under the      famous Matejko in Krakow, Poland, and was the one who carved      the Kosciuszko statue before in Chicago. When his equestrian      statue of Pulaski was unveiled in 1910, critics said it was      the best they ever saw.                           City of Baltimore       Frank Charles Watcher was born September 16, 1861, in South      Baltimore, where the Baltimore and Ohio company built the      largest railroad station in the world in 1852 and the      stockyards butchered more hogs than any other city on the      Atlantic coast. Built on the Patapsco River not far from the      Watcher home, Fort McHenry, which Francis Scott Key      immortalized in the Star Spangled Banner, was used in the      1860s to hold thousands of Confederate prisoners of war.       When he was growing up, Frank Watcher dreamed of being a      tailor like his father. Upon graduation from St. Paul's      German English School, however, he got a job as a clerk for      $1.50 a week in a clothing store. In time, because of his      energy, determination, and brains, he managed a business.                            Political Career       The first important campaign of his life came in 1898 when      he received the Republican nomination for Congress. Nobody      expected him to win. One of the issues in his favor was      immigration. The Democratic Party, largely in Irish hands,      was against new immigration because the immigrants who came      mostly from Poland and Italy were taking the places of Irish      workers in mines and factories and working for less money. In      the coming election, the Polish citizens of Baltimore, most      of whom previously supported Democrats, voted in large part      for Watcher. He was elected to the Fifty-sixth Congress by a      majority of 122 votes.       Watcher ran again two years later and won by more than      2,071 votes. After three terms in Washington, he ran for      mayor of Baltimore. He won in the primaries and lost in the      general election by less than 500 votes.       His family was at his bedside when he died on July 1, 1910.      His body was followed to Loudon Park Cemetery by a long      cortege of political and business associates. The honorary      pall bearers included Speaker of the House Joseph G. Cannon.                          ____________________
