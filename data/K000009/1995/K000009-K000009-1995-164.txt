Speaker, I come to the well this evening to express my strong opposition to H.R. 961, the Clean Water Act amendments and why I urged its defeat. It steps back from the progress resulting from our Nation's commitment to clean water as a national treasure.  I represent a Great Lakes district along Lake Erie. Cumulatively, the Great Lakes contain 20 percent of all the fresh water on the face of the Earth. For those of us who remember when swimming or fishing in Lake Erie was hazardous to your health, the actions the House is taking to weaken Clean Water Act protections are backward-looking. I am astounded that anyone can fail to see the great progress we have made over the last 25 years to clean up our Nation's water. Today, after two decades, the job of cleaning up Lake Erie is one-half finished. Our progress is laudable, but the goal has not been achieved along our coast or on the Nation's other major waterways.  I can remember when the Cuyahoga River burned and when Lake Erie was declared dead. Some of our colleagues, Mr. Speaker, have apparently forgotten. We have made great strides toward renewing our water resources, but there is still a long way to go. In Ohio, 92 percent of our lakes and 60 percent of our rivers still cannot support fishing or swimming on a year-round basis. Some of our waters still cannot support aquatic life. Just last summer the city of Toledo found it necessary to pump fresh water into the Ottawa River just to restore some oxygen and flush out the polluted discharge from combined sewer overflows. The job of cleaning our waters is far from over. The task of cleaning up dozens of major toxic burial grounds leaching into our fresh water tributaries stands before us.  The aspect of H.R. 961 about which I am most concerned is the provision to make adherence to the standards of the Great Lakes initiative voluntary on the part of Great Lakes States. This initiative has been a model bipartisan effort to standardize water quality protections in the Great Lakes watershed. Over the last 6 years, Federal guidelines have been developed, which, under current law, the States have 2 years to implement. Under H.R. 961, adherence would be voluntary. States could choose which standards to implement [[Page H5054]] or they could choose to unilaterally weaken certain standards.  This might possibly be an acceptable program for waters within a State's boundaries, but seven States and another country adjoin the Great Lakes. Allowing eight different sets of standards for these waters is irrational. As different States adopt differing water quality standards, their efforts may be defeated by a neighboring State's program. Voluntary compliance may even lead to a race to the bottom for water quality as each State offers weakened standards as an inducement to bring polluting industries into their State or to keep them there. Mexico's policy of competing for investment with lax environmental standards may find its counterpart in interstate or international economic rivalries on our northern border.  The Great Lakes comprise 95 percent of the fresh surface water in the United States. That is a resource too valuable to risk. Yet today we have restrictions on the consumption of fish from these waters because of mercury and PCB pollution. Lake St. Clair and the southern shore of Lake Erie were closed for the better part of the month of August last year because of fecal coliform contamination. The job is far from done in the Great Lakes. This is not the time to minimize our efforts.  Setting consistent water quality standards in the Great Lakes watershed is the only reasonable way to protect these waters. The only way to ensure consistent standards is through entities such as the Great Lakes initiative. It once was common to find fish with festering lesions and tumors coming out of Lake Erie. Today it is rare, but it still happens. There used to be a viable commercial fishing industry on the lakes. That industry rapidly diminished as warnings about eating Great Lakes fish increased. We can restore that industry if we continue to clean up the lakes. That won't happen if we can't assure consistent water quality standards for the Great Lakes Watershed. Let's not weaken the Great Lakes initiative.  The bill we have before us also takes other major steps backward. H.R. 961 allows for increases in toxin discharges into our waters, and it weakens public notification requirements when swimming or fishing is unsafe. It lets industry off the hook by weakening requirements for pretreatment of industrial toxins before they are discharged into municipal wastewater treatment systems.  H.R. 961 also dramatically undermines attention to wetland habitats--which play such an important role providing storage areas for flood waters and which naturally filter pollutants--by removing half of them from regulatory oversight. And the bill completely ignores the serious issue of nonpoint source pollution and how to reduce toxic runoff from farms, yards, streets, and parking lots.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to be able to vote for a clean water bill that aims at meeting the original goals of the Clean Water Act, to make all our Nation's waters fishable and swimmable. But I am not going to have that opportunity. H.R. 961 will actually reverse the progress we have made under current clean water law. This bill will expose our communities, our water-dependent industries, and our fishery resources to continued and increased degradation. I want to support legislation that strikes an appropriate balance between a healthy economy and healthy water.                          ____________________
