 President, I ask unanimous consent that these letters be printed in the Record for S. 3649, a bill to provide for programs to help reduce the risk that prisoners will recidivate upon release from prison, and for other purposes.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                           National Fraternal Order of Police,                                 Washington, DC, November 9, 2018.      FOP Partners With President Trump on Criminal Justice Reform     Revised and amended First Step Act to be introduced next week       Chuck Canterbury, National President of the Fraternal Order      of Police, announced his support today for legislation      developed by the Administration to make important reforms to      our nation's criminal justice system.       ``The President and his team have been working hard on this      issue since Inauguration Day,'' Canterbury said. ``From the      outset, they let us know they wanted our input because this      effort could not succeed without our support. We are proud to      announce that by working together with the Administration and      leaders on Capitol Hill we have a bill that will make our      streets and neighborhoods safer, our police will be better      protected and improve the ability of our criminal justice      system to effectively rehabilitate offenders.''       The legislation, entitled the ``First Step Act,'' would      establish a comprehensive risk and needs assessment tool to      provide an individual profile of all Federal inmates. Those      offenders deemed to be at low risk to recidivate would be      given incentives and access to evidence-based recidivist      reduction programs to better prepare them to return to their      neighborhoods and become productive members of the community.       ``By individually targeting those offenders with the lowest      risk to re-offend, law enforcement and correctional officers      can better focus their resources,'' Canterbury explained.      ``The FOP played a key role in making sure that truly      dangerous offenders, like those who commit crimes while armed      and those who traffic in deadly narcotics like fentanyl, are      ineligible to participate in the First Step program.''       The legislation also contains certain sentencing reforms.      The FOP engaged with our allies on Capitol Hill to make sure      these changes are prospective and would not, except in the      case of the existing Fair Sentencing Act, be applied      retroactively. The bill also contains an FOP-backed provision      that would improve the safety of our Federal correctional      officers carrying firearms under the auspices of the Law      Enforcement Officers' Safety Act.       ``We have been proud to be a partner in this effort with      President Trump and are grateful for his leadership and for      his constant and unwavering support for law enforcement,''      Canterbury said. ``We look forward to working with him and      with Congress to get this bill to his desk.''       The Fraternal Order of Police is the largest law      enforcement labor organization in the United States with more      than 345,000 members.                                  ____                                      International Association of                                             Chiefs of Police,                                Alexandria, VA, November 11, 2018.     President Donald J. Trump,     The White House,     Washington, DC.       Dear President Trump: On behalf of the International      Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP), the world's largest      organization of law enforcement executives, I am writing in      support of the updated version of the First Step Act. We      applaud you and your Administration for your commitment to      law enforcement and to making lasting reforms to our criminal      justice system.       As you are aware, the IACP was supportive of the originally      introduced First Step Act, but did have some feedback on      changes that would further enhance the legislation. Your      Administration worked with the IACP throughout this process      to solicit our feedback and we applaud both you and your      Administration for ensuring that this legislation achieves a      proper balance of maintaining public safety while providing      rehabilitation services and early release incentives to      qualified federal prisoners.       The First Step Act contains several measures intended to      more effectively rehabilitate prisoners so that they are less      likely to reoffend after release and, thereby, are less      likely to cause additional harm to society. These measures      include education, job training, and other personal      development programs, along with incentives, such as good      time credits, to participate in these opportunities. The      proposed legislation includes an expanded list of 49      convictions that would ensure that truly dangerous offenders      are ineligible to receive time credits. In addition, the IACP      is also pleased that the revised legislation contains      provisions that ensure that certain sentencing reform      provisions, unrelated to the Fair Sentencing Act, can only be      applied prospectively thereby achieving the proper balance      between reform and maintaining public safety.       Once introduced in the Senate, the IACP looks forward to      working with Congress to continue to fine tune the      legislation. A key item that we would like to see addressed      is a notification system that will alert state and local law      enforcement agencies and their communities when a      rehabilitated offender is released into their jurisdiction.      Ensuring proper notification will enable law enforcement and      our communities to be aware when a rehabilitated offender      returns. Additionally, while the IACP agrees that a portion      of the savings associated with the reduction in recidivism      resulting from this legislation be invested back into the      Bureau of Prisons to continue evidence-based recidivism      reduction programs, it is also essential that a portion of      the savings be invested back into federal, state, and local      law enforcement.       In addition, further enhancements could be made to the      safety valve language. Before being eligible for any safety      valve provision, it is imperative that all pertinent      information and most importantly, information from local      authorities be reviewed. The facts and circumstances of the      original sentencing, including a review of any prior criminal      conduct or any other relevant information from federal, state      and local authorities should be considered before a      determination is made regarding a reduction in sentence.       Finally, and most importantly, the IACP is pleased with the      acknowledgement and commitment from the Administration that      there is a true need to establish a National Commission on      Law Enforcement and the Administration of Justice      (Commission) to examine criminal justice issues in a broader      and more strategic fashion. While the First Step Act aims to      provide a solution to one of the many issues we are currently      facing, it is not the ultimate fix to the multitude of issues      confronting the criminal justice system. To move forward in a      systematic way that provides cross-cutting solutions for      multiple disciplines and issues, we need the Commission to      serve as the catalyst for a long overdue strategic blueprint.      Again, we appreciate the commitment from the White House to      work towards the Commission's establishment, which has been      one of the IACP's top priorities for more than two decades.       On behalf of our more than 30,000 members, thank you again      for working with the IACP on this important issue. We look      forward to continuing to work together as this legislation      moves through the process.           Sincerely,                                                     Paul M. Cell,     IACP President.                                  ____         National Organization of Black Law Enforcement            Executives,                                Alexandria, VA, November 11, 2018.     The President,     The White House,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. President: On behalf of the National Organization      of Black Law Enforcement Executives (NOBLE), our Executive      Board, local chapters, and members, I am writing to express      support for the FIRST STEP Act (S. 2795/H.R. 5682). We      applaud the White House and Congress for soliciting feedback      from NOBLE and the law enforcement community in finalizing      the content of this very important legislation. We feel the      FIRST STEP Act strikes a balance between maintaining public      safety while improving re-entry, rehabilitation, workforce      training programs, and sentencing.       It is NOBLE's hope that this legislation strengthens bi-     partisan efforts in reforming this nation's criminal justice      system to ensure equity in the administration of justice. Our      organization joins many law enforcement leaders in the belief      that America can reduce incarceration levels while also      reducing crime.       Lastly, we encourage the White House and Congress to      continue to explore the establishment of a National Criminal      Justice Commission. The purpose of this commission would be      to undertake a comprehensive review of the criminal justice      system.       We thank all parties who helped in the development of the      FIRST STEP Act (S. 2795/H.R. 5682) and look forward to      working collaboratively in ensuring equal protection under      the law for all Americans.           Sincerely,                                                     Vera Bumpers,     National President, NOBLE.                                  ____                                                November 13, 2018.     Re Police Perspective: FIRST STEP Act (S. 2795) & Sentencing          Reform.     Hon. Donald J. Trump,     The White House,     Washington, DC.       Dear President Trump: I write to you today as Executive      Director of Law Enforcement Leaders to Reduce Crime &      Incarceration, a bipartisan group of more than 200 current      and former law enforcement officials.       Today, our nation faces new criminal justice challenges,      including a rise in opioid overdoses, an uptick in homicides      in some cities, and strained police-community relations.      While there is no one-size-fits-all solution, we as leaders      in law enforcement feel compelled to share our views on how      passing     prison and sentencing reform together is vital to keeping our      nation safe.       First, I wanted to share our briefing memo explaining how      the FIRST STEP Act and sentencing reform will improve public      safety. Americans trust us, as law enforcement officers, to      both secure the safety of their communities and advise      policymakers on how to advance that goal. We hope this      information helps ease any concerns surrounding the bill Our      position is also in line with that of the Fraternal Order of      Police, which recently endorsed bipartisan efforts toward      justice reform.       Second, I wanted to share our previous letter supporting      the FIRST STEP Act and sentencing reform sent to leaders in      Congress, explaining the necessity of passing sentencing and      prison reform together to reduce recidivism and increase      fairness. Over 60 of our members signed onto this letter,      writing everywhere from Virginia to New Orleans to Iowa, to      share their views. I have expressed similar views in the The      Hill, with Washington Police Chief Peter Newsham.       We are grateful for your unwavering leadership in      prioritizing public safety and the critical issues facing law      enforcement. I hope we can work together toward bipartisan      reforms.           Respectfully yours,       Ronal Serpas,       Executive Director, Law Enforcement Leaders to Reduce Crime      & Incarceration.       Former Police Superintendent, New Orleans, Louisiana.       Former Police Chief, Nashville, Tennessee.                                  ____                                                 National District                                        Attorneys Association,                                                November 13, 2018.     President Donald J. Trump,     The White House,     Washington, DC.       Dear President Trump: On behalf of the National District      Attorneys Association (NDAA), the largest prosecutor      organization in the country representing 2,500 elected and      appointed District Attorneys as well as 40,000 Assistant      District Attorneys, who collectively prosecute around 95      percent of the crime in the United States, I write to support      the revised First Step Act. This legislation is a bipartisan      effort to address front-end sentencing reform and back-end      prison reform, and our association is appreciative of your      efforts to partner with the Nation's prosecutors on this      important matter.       NDAA previously supported the Sentencing Reform &      Corrections Act (SRCA) during the last Congress as a      carefully crafted bipartisan compromise. After weeks of      discussions with White House and Senate Judiciary Committee      staff, our organization is confident that the revised First      Step Act strikes an appropriate balance between addressing      the needs of the current Federal prison population while      ensuring criminals are penalized appropriately.       Tasked with the constitutional duty of protecting the      communities we serve from bad actors while seeking justice      for victims of crime and protecting the innocent, our members      are acutely aware of the need for reforms to our criminal      justice system. As currently written, the revised First Step      Act includes much needed prison reform provisions that will      provide the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) with the guidance and      resources to assist in lowering recidivism rates for low-risk      prisoners. Further, the addition of four sentencing reform      provisions takes a precision-like approach to sentencing      guidelines associated with certain crimes. Absent meaningful      sentencing reform, where the truly dangerous are locked up      for an appropriate period of time and those with addiction or      mental health issues have the chance for treatment and      rehabilitation, rising recidivism rates will continue to      persist.       While the legislation makes its way to the Senate, NDAA      plans to continue engaging with your staff and law      enforcement stakeholders to improve the language in the      revised First Step Act. Specifically, our organization is      working to ensure any reinvestment of savings generated      because of front-end sentencing reform provisions is invested      back into state and local law enforcement and prosecutor      agencies to prevent crime, target drug trafficking      operations, train law enforcement and prosecutors in the      field and respond to other emerging issues within the      criminal justice system.       Our members continue to call for a new commission to      explore issues across the criminal justice system to ensure      law enforcement and prosecutors can protect the communities      they serve and respond to emerging issues in the field. In      partnership with your administration, we hope to make that      call a reality. As part of that commission, it is imperative      that the local prosecutor perspective is represented as the      legal end of the criminal justice system continuum. Without      it, a comprehensive review of the broader stakeholder system      is incomplete. NDAA looks forward to having one of our      members bring the state and local prosecutor's valuable      perspective to the table once the commission is established.       We appreciate your efforts, as well as the efforts of a      bipartisan group of Members of Congress and staff, to ensure      the American criminal justice system is continually improved      upon and seen as a model for innovative and cutting-edge      programming that we see in our own members' offices every      day. Thank you for working with the Nation's prosecutors and      NDAA on this historic effort.           Sincerely,                                                Jonathan Blodgett,                                                        President.
