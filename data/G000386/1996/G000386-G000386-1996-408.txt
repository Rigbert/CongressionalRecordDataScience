 President, I would like to speak briefly about Department of Defense [DOD] infrastructure costs.  DOD is expected to spend $152 billion in fiscal year 1996 on infrastructure. Infrastructure dollars are spent to maintain the bases, facilities, and activities that house and sustain the Armed Forces. They support costs.  The General Accounting Office [GAO] has just completed a report on DOD infrastructure costs. The report was prepared by one of GAO's best analysts, Mr. Bill Crocker.  The GAO's findings are truly amazing. Despite four rounds of base closures since 1988 and dramatic cuts in the force structure, there are no savings. DOD infrastructure costs are going up--not down.  We have had four rounds of base closures--1988, 1991, 1993, and 1995. This was the Base Realignment and Closure or BRAC process. And BRAC was quite painful for many communities.  Well, the driving force behind BRAC was ``to save money by reducing overhead.''  Mr. President, that was the promise. Streamline Defense Infrastructure and save money. That was the deal. The base structure exceeded the needs of a shrinking force structure. The whole idea was to close excess, obsolete bases and save money.  Well, once again savings promised by the Pentagon have evaporated into thin air.  Now, I know that base closings require upfront costs. In some cases, these are quite substantial. But the upfront costs are supposed to be followed by down stream savings. Secretary of Defense Perry made this very point in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee as recently as March 5, 1996.  This is what he said, and I quote: ``While BRAC initially costs money, there will be significant savings in the future.''  To back up his assertion, Mr. Perry points to the fiscal year 1999 budget.  Again, this is what Mr. Perry said, and I quote: ``In the FY 1999 budget, the Department projects $6 billion in savings from closing the bases, thus allowing a $10 billion `swing' in savings.''  He went on to say:       These and future savings from baseclosing will be devoted      to modernization.  Well, Mr. President, what happened to those savings?  The GAO can't find them.  The GAO audited the fiscal year 1996 to 2001 Future Years Defense Program or FYDP.  The Department's own numbers--the numbers in the FYDP--indicate that infrastructure costs will rise in the outyears.  Infrastructure costs rise as follows, beginning with fiscal year 1998: 1998, $147 billion; 1999, $152 billion; 2000, $156 billion; 2001, $162 billion.  Where are the savings promised by Mr. Perry?  Why are not those savings reflected in the department's books?  I think the GAO report provides a partial answer to the question.  It is true.  Base closing did produce some decreases in base support costs.  BRAC did produce some real savings.  But I underscore ``did,'' which is past tense.  Bureaucrats at the Pentagon don't look on savings like the average American citizen.  To bureaucrats, it is theirs to spend. It's not the peoples' money to be returned to the Treasury.  Put a sponge on it, and make it disappear. That is how they see savings.  As soon as the savings popped up on the radar screen, they grabbed the money and spent it.  Those savings are not being plowed into readiness and modernization--as Mr. Perry promised.  Those savings are being diverted into new infrastructure projects.  Those savings are being used to create more excess overhead.  ``Force Management'' is an excellent case in point.  Force Management is one of the infrastructure cost categories.  More money for force management sounds reasonable enough, but it does not stand up too well under scrutiny.  Force management covers such things as military and departmental headquarters and public affairs.  To me, more money in force management means fatter headquarters.  Fattening up the headquarters doesn't come cheap, either.  Spending for expanded headquarters will rise as follows, beginning in fiscal year 1998: 1988, $13.6 billion; 1999, $15.2 billion; 2000, $16.1 billion; 2001, $17.2 billion.  Now, Mr. President, why is DOD planning to beef up headquarters, when DOD continues to make dramatic deceases in the force structure?  A much smaller force structure should be much cheaper to manage.  Right?  And a smaller force should mean much smaller and fewer headquarters.  Right?  Not at the Pentagon.  As the force gets smaller and smaller, the headquarters are getting bigger and bigger. Why?  It's needed to accommodate a topheavy rank structure.  Base closures and realignments mean that some headquarters will have to be consolidated with others.  We know that.  But with continued shrinkage in the force structure, there still should be plenty of excess headquarters space.  There is no need to fatten up headquarters operations.  That just does not make any sense at all right now.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record two tables.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                      TABLE V-3--FORCE STRUCTURE a --PART V: FORMULATING THE DEFENSE BUDGET                     ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                   Cold war                                                                                                      fiscal year   Base force  Fiscal year  Fiscal year   BUR-based                                                      1990        plan b        1996         1997        plan c  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Army--active divisions.........................       18           12           10           10           10        Reserve component brigades d...............       57           34           47           42           42    Marine expeditionary force e...................        3            3            3            3            3    Navy aircraft carriers (active/reserve)........       15/1         12/1         11/1         11/1         11/1  Carrier air wings (active/reserve).............       13/2         11/2         10/1         10/1         10/1  Battle force ships (active/reserve)............      546          430          359          357          346    Fighter wing equivalents (active/reserve)......       24/12        15/11        13/8         13/7         13/7  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------a Dual entries in the table show data for active/reserve forces, except for carriers, which depicts deployable/   training carriers.                                                                                            b Bush Administration's planned fiscal year 1995 force levels, as reflected in the January 1993 Annual Defense    Report.                                                                                                       c Shown are planned force levels, which may differ slightly from those recommended by the BUR, but which are      consistent with its proposals.                                                                                d An approximate equivalent.
