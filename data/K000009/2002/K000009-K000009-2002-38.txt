Speaker, last night this House was kept in session to a ridiculously late hour because there was a divide on the Republican side of the aisle over our Interior bill, where we are supposed to be finding the money to keep our parks open with enough bathrooms and visitor centers and parking spaces to accommodate a growing American public.  They were mad because they said there was not enough money. Well, let me contend where they should look for the money. They should not look for the money in the Committee on Appropriations. They should go back to the tax committee and figure out who they gave the money to.  Richey Rich is going to make $20 million this year in our country. And if we look at the buy-out packages that they permitted to the chief executive officers in this country and the tax breaks alone in the Bush tax bill, the tax bill to Richey Rich will amount to $712,800 this year because his marginal rate was reduced to 3.6 percent. We might say, gosh, he is only going to make $19.8 million this year, at the same time as we struggle for pennies and are forced to increase fees at our national parks across this country.  The answer is not inside the Subcommittee on Interior, the answer is to go back to the tax committee and make every single American contribute to the betterment of this Republic.                          ____________________
