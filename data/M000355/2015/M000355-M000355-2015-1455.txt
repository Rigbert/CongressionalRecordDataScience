 President, on one final matter, I believe we are going to be hearing from the chairman of the Finance Committee shortly. Senator Hatch will be on the floor to discuss bipartisan trade promotion authority legislation which is important because we know that trade is the key to supporting high-quality American jobs and exporting more of the things American workers make and exporting more of the things American farmers grow.  Congress is working again, and this bipartisan bill is another sign of that. No legislation will ever be perfect, but Chairman Hatch and Ranking Member Wyden, along with Chairman Ryan in the House, put together an agreement of which we can all be proud. It protects and enhances Congress's role in the trade-negotiating process, while making sure Presidents of either party will have the ability to negotiate good agreements that can increase growth in our American economy and support many high-quality American jobs. They are marking up that bill today. I wish them the best of luck. We look forward to having it on the floor in the very near future.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.                          ____________________
