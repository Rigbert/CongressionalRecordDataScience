Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the motion to recommit to be offered later by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett). The motion simply says that section 527 political organizations that fail to disclose their donors will be subject to the gift tax.  It is time to fix our broken system of financing elections. This motion is an important step toward that goal. It would close a huge loophole by requiring simple disclosure by secretive political organizations and groups. The American people have a right to know. They have a right to know who is funding political campaigns in this country. They have a right to know who is trying to influence their votes. The American people have a right to a free and open election process.  Mr. Speaker, it is time to close this loophole. It is time to get rid of the secrecy. It is time to fix this mess.  The other body had the courage and voted with raw courage on yesterday to close this loophole. It is time for the House to do the same. I urge all of my colleagues to support the motion to recommit.
