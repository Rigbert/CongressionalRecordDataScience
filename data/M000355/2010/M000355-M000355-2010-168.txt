 President, my friend the majority leader mentioned the small business jobs bill. I recently had an opportunity to talk to Senator Snowe, who is the author of that legislation. I assured her we are anxious to move forward. I appreciate his bringing up the discussion we have been having about reaching a consent agreement that would allow us to expedite the bill. I know my friend from Nevada shares my view that small business is an area that needs attention. We are going to continue to try to come to agreement to move forward with that very important piece of legislation which I support and I believe most Members of my conference do as well.
