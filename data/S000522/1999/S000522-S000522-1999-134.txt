Mr. Chairman, during this past week the Communist People's Republic of China started a series of events to threaten Taiwan:  Starting just this last weekend and going into this week, China has been conducting the first military exercise in the Taiwan Strait since 1996, with soldiers chanting ``We will liberate Taiwan'';  Meanwhile the Communist Party newspapers ran the headline, ``Those who play with fire will get burnt'';  In addition, last Thursday, China declared that it has mastered the design technology for the neutron bomb.  In light of these imminent threats from mainland China, the U.S. Congress must send a clear message that we support our democratic ally Taiwan and that the U.S. will defend Taiwan from military attacks. Without that clear message, Communist China may be tempted to attack Taiwan and destabilize the world, hoping that the U.S. will stand aside, particularly when the Clinton Administration advocates for ``one China.'' If there were one democratic China, the U.S. Congress and the people of the United States would support it. For now, there is only one democratic State in China--The Republic of China on Taiwan--so we will support Taiwan.  The people of Taiwan have spoken with their votes to stay separate from the Communist mainland until there is democracy for all. We respect their votes and their voice. We commend them for building this flourishing democracy regardless of threats from the Beijing. I support the amendment from my colleagues Mr. Andrews, Mr. Rohrabacher, Mr. Deutsch, Mr. McNulty, Mr. Calvert, Mr. Wu, and Mr. Bilirakis, to declare that we stand with our democratic allies, and we will defend democratic Taiwan.  Ms. McKINNEY. Mr. Chairman, we have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.
