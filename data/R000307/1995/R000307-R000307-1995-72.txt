Chairman, I join the gentleman from Wisconsin.  As the ranking Republican Member on the House-Senate Joint Committee on Printing, I have been alarmed with the dramatic losses being incurred by the GPO. The gentleman from Maryland asked if anybody has been down to the GPO. I have, many, many times.  This year the GPO estimates its losses to be nearly $10 million. The Joint Committee has requested four different studies over the last several years to be conducted by the GAO, and Arthur Andersen, and the Public Printer's GPO 2000 study, to determine the cause and options to reduce these losses. This is $10 million.  I think it is far more sensitive to employees to really gradually try to reduce the work force, if we can, than at a future date to be forced to totally eliminate the entire agency.  The gentleman from Maryland has indicated that the argument that we are going to have RIF's here and it is going to cost money--that is false and shortsighted. We do not have to go to RIF's. The GPO can do it. It is not required to utilize RIF's. Even if the GPO chooses to do so, the amendment will still save taxpayers over $6 million.  We are talking about 350 positions. This has been a glidepath but, again, this agency has lost over $10 million. They are under orders from the Joint Committee to quit losing money, and it is not the fault of the employees. It is that the GPO is the victim of a technological revolution in regard to printing.  The gentleman's amendment is in good standing. It is the continued way to go to save money. We will await the studies and see if we can make further savings. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment of the gentleman from Wisconsin.
