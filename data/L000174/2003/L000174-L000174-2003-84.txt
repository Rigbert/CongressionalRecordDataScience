We have a number of annual appropriations bills on which the Senate has yet to act. We do know the law requires us to finish those by September 30. We are now well into November and we have yet to act on them.  We should look at the purpose of some of these appropriations bills that are being held up while we are wasting time trying to do things for political points. We are holding up the appropriations for America's veterans. What a bad time to send that signal, when our veterans, and many who are about to become our veterans, are serving so bravely in Iraq and Afghanistan.  We are holding up appropriations for law enforcement. As one who served for 8\1/2\ years in law enforcement, I know how much our law enforcement people rely on those funds. We are holding up appropriations for the State Department. We are holding up appropriations for the Federal judiciary. We are holding up appropriations for housing. We are holding up appropriations for many other things. But we will talk and talk and talk about three or four judges.  There is unfinished business of providing a real prescription drug benefit for seniors, but we will instead talk and try to make political points. We have the Nation's unemployment, having seen for 8 years adding a million jobs a year, having seen in the last 2\1/2\ years losing more than a million jobs a year. We talk about the economy improving. Tell that to the American families who can't find a job, or find two or three jobs because they are so low paying they are working 80 hours a week and not having time to be with their children or their families.  We see the corporate and Wall Street scandals, the mutual funds, and others. Those concern those of us who have invested and placed our trust and financial security at risk in the securities market. I think of a number of people in Vermont who are approaching retirement time and see these scandals where their money is being taken away and they see a Senate unwilling or unable to move legislation addressing that.  Of course, we are not doing oversight on the war in Iraq. We are signing blank checks, but we are not doing oversight.  Lowest Vacancy Rate in 13 Years: I mention this only because, instead of considering these very important matters--matters that seem to be neglected by both the White House and the Congress--Republican leadership insists on rehashing the debate on one of a tiny handful of judicial nominees in which further Senate action is unlikely. Certainly, when the Republican leadership was considering the judicial nominees of a Democratic President in the years 1995 to the year 2000, they showed no concern about stranding more than 60--let me repeat that, more than 60--of President Clinton's judicial nominees without hearings or votes. They did not demand an up-or-down vote on every nominee. They were content to use anonymous holds to scuttle scores of nominees.  This is not a question of having a filibuster or a cloture vote. If one member, just one member of the Republican caucus objected to one of President Clinton's nominees, they didn't have to stand up here and say so. They could just let their side know and the person was never given a hearing, never given a vote.  There were numerous extraordinarily well-qualified people. In fact, they stood by while vacancies rose from 65 in January 1995 when the Republicans took over the majority, to 110 when Democrats assumed Senate leadership in the summer of 2001. Republicans presided over the doubling of circuit court vacancies from 16 to 33 during that time by simply refusing to allow President Clinton's nominees to have a vote. As I said, over 60 of them were never allowed to have a vote.  McCarthyite Smears: So why do they insist that the Senate now consume this precious floor time to rehash the debate on one of the President's most controversial nominees to the independent Federal judiciary, the nomination of William Pryor? Perhaps it is to give some on the Republican side another chance to continue to make false arguments about judicial nominations. Perhaps it is to give some platform for baseless and McCarthyite accusations that Senators oppose Mr. Pryor because of his religion.  This is the worst of religious McCarthyism I have heard, although there are aspects that are actually amusing. We had one of these Republicans go on a Sunday morning show, I guess, to accuse me of being anti-Catholic. When asked about it, we responded I didn't see it because my wife and I were at Mass, as we are on every Sunday morning, and that was when the program was on. But I suspect it is to distract from the real concerns that affect Americans every day.  The facts show the Senate has made progress on judicial vacancies in those areas where the administration has been willing to work with the Senate. Yesterday, the Senate confirmed the 168th of President Bush's judicial nominees.  Incidentally, I should point out, of that 168, 100 of them were confirmed during the 17 months the Democrats controlled the Senate, and I was chairman; 68 of them during the 17 months the Republicans controlled the Senate.  It is kind of hard to say we are partisan on this when in 17 months we confirmed 100 of the President's nominees and in the 17 months the Republicans confirmed 60. Actually, we could have confirmed several more had the Republican leadership just scheduled votes on these noncontroversial nominations. The truth is, in less than 3 years' time the number of President Bush's judicial nominees the Senate has confirmed has exceeded the number of judicial nominees confirmed for President Reagan, who was the all-time champ to get judges confirmed in the first 4 years in office. Everybody acknowledges that President Reagan had more judges confirmed in his first 4 years than any President ever had in the Republican-controlled Congress and Republican-controlled Senate. He confirmed more judges in 4 years than anybody else until President Bush, who has had 7 more Federal judges confirmed in less than 3 years than President Reagan did in 4.  To give you some idea, here are the Clinton nominees over a period of, actually, 5 years: 248 were confirmed, and 63 of them were blocked by the Republicans--63. Some are ones where we had cloture votes and we won on the cloture votes and got them through. Twenty percent of President Clinton's nominees were blocked by the Republican-controlled Senate.  Between 2001 and 2003, President Bush sent 16 through, and 4 were blocked; or 2 percent were blocked. Actually, 2 percent is pretty darned good.  Look at what has happened on vacancies when the Republicans were in the majority. Look at how vacancies skyrocketed because they were blocking usually by a one-person anonymous filibuster. President Clinton's nominee vacancies skyrocketed. During the 17 months when I was chairman and the Democrats were in the majority, look at how we quickly brought down those vacancies of all of President Bush's nominees. Ironically, President Bush nominated people to fill vacancies created because the Republicans refused to allow President Clinton's nominees to go through. Of course, they continue to go down.  If debates like this are staged to give some a platform for repulsive smears that Democrats are opposing Mr. Pryor because of his religion, they will have to enter a realm of demagoguery, repeating false allegations and innuendo often enough to hope that some of their mud will stick.  Senate Democrats oppose the nomination of William Pryor to the Eleventh Circuit because of his extreme some, with good reason, use the word ``radical''--ideas about what the Constitution says about federalism, criminal justice and the death penalty, violence against women, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the Government's ability to protect the environment on behalf of the American people. Of course, those substantive concerns will not do much to help raise money for the Republican Party or seem provocative in a flyer placed on windshields late on the day before an election and hardly get a mention on the evening news. So some Republican partisans will be putting the truth to one side. They dismiss the views of Democratic Senators doing their duty under the Constitution to examine the fitness of every nominee to a lifetime position on the Federal bench and choose, instead, to use smears and the ugliest accusations they could dream up.  This started in the aftermath of the first rejection of the Pickering nomination in the Judiciary Committee. After the committee voted not to recommend him to the full Senate, insinuations were made on this Senate floor that Democrats opposed him because he is a Baptist. From that time to now, I have waited patiently for Republican Senators to disavow such charges which they know to be untrue.  Just a few weeks ago, Republican Senators on the Judiciary Committee trotted out an offensive cartoon targeting a nominee, and asked us to denounce it. Even though it was taken off a website run by two private individuals, of whom I had never heard before and who have no connection to Democratic Senators, we appropriately denounced it without hesitation.  Abusing Religion For Wedge Politics: But when slanderous accusations were made by Republican Senators, and ads run by a group headed by the President's father's former White House counsel and a group whose funding includes money raised by Republican Senators and even by the President's family, no apologies or denunciations were heard. Other Republican members of the Judiciary Committee and of the Senate have either stood mute in the face of these McCarthyite charges, or, worse, have fed the flames.  These accusations are harmful to the Senate and to the Nation and have no place in this debate or anywhere else. Just a few weeks ago, President Bush rightly told the Prime Minister of Malaysia that his inflammatory remarks about religion were ``wrong and divisive.'' He should say the same to members of his own party. Today, Republican Senators have another chance to do what they have not yet done and what this Administration has not yet done: Disavow this campaign of division waged by those who would misuse religion by playing wedge politics with it. I hope that the Republican leadership of the Senate will finally disavow the contention that any Senator is being motivated in any way by religious bigotry.  An Extreme and Divisive Nominee: Let us take William Pryor. Many of us opposed his nomination to the Eleventh Circuit because of his extreme--in fact, some would view radical--ideas about what the Constitution says about federalism and what the Constitution says about criminal justice and the death penalty, his views about violence against women, or the Americans With Disabilities Act, or the Government's ability to protect the environment on behalf of all American people--not just the environment to protect just Republicans or just Democrats but all Americans.  I am stunned as I read and reread reports. Just to see how radical his ideas are, just today I learned of the sworn affidavits made under oath by the former Republican Governor of Alabama, Bob James and his son. They explained the circumstances under which Governor James came to appoint Mr. Pryor as attorney general. We keep hearing about how Attorney General Pryor just looks at the law, he will just stand by the law, and he will call them as he sees them. In sworn affidavits, the Governor who appointed him said Mr. Pryor was only hired after making explicit promises--explicit promises--that he would defy court orders up through and including orders of the Supreme Court of the United States.  This is a man we want to give a lifetime tenure on the court of appeals, which is one step below the United States Supreme Court; somebody who would take a job where he has made promises that he would defy court orders, including the Supreme Court of the United States; a person who takes an oath to uphold the Constitution but says give me the job and don't worry about that oath, I promise I will defy them.  These statements were made under the penalty of perjury by a former Republican Governor of Alabama. He recounts how Mr. Pryor persuaded him that he was right for the job by showing them research papers from his time in law school about nonacquiescence in court orders. Indeed, the Governor and his son say that Mr. Pryor's position on defying court orders changed only when he decided he wanted to become a Federal judge.  I have been here 29 years. I don't remember any President, Republican or Democratic, who would think of sending up a nominee who has told people he will get his job with a promise that he will defy courts. This is so violative of even what Mr. Pryor said in sworn statements before the Senate Judiciary Committee.  Assuming that the sworn statement of the former Republican Governor of Alabama and his son are true, this information is consistent with extremism.  Elsewhere, Mr. Pryor's record is shocking. I cannot imagine any President--I have been here with six Presidents, Republican and Democrat--who would send somebody up here with that kind of a record.  I pride myself in voting for nominees of Presidents. President Ford, President Carter, President Reagan, former President Bush, President Clinton, and even the current President Bush, I probably have voted for 98 or 99 percent of all the nominations. But this is one that never should even have come to us. It is not a question of whether to vote it up or down--it shouldn't even be here. In fact, the President ought to withdraw this nomination because, if this affidavit of Governor James is true--and he did make it under pain of penalty of perjury--that means Mr. Pryor sat with Governor James and promised to undermine the very basis of the stability of the United States Government and its legal system.  I don't understand how any Senator, Republican or Democrat, can continue to support this nomination.  There are a whole lot of other reasons.  Again, I cannot believe any President would send a nominee here who has done this.  There are some other reasons he shouldn't be a judge on the Eleventh Circuit. These reasons have prompted a chorus of opposition of individuals and organizations and editorial pages across the Nation, the South, the East, and the West. Organizations and individuals concerned about justice before the Federal courts include Log Cabin Republicans, Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, Alliance for Justice, and many others have provided the committee with their concerns and bases for their opposition. We have received letters of opposition from organizations that rarely take positions on nominations who feel strongly about this one and are compelled to write, including the National Senior Citizens Law Center, Anti-Defamation League, Sierra Club, and others.  I ask unanimous consent that a list of all of the letters that have been sentin opposition to Mr. Pryor's confirmation be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:  Letters of Opposition to the Nomination of Bill Pryor, to the 11th                         Circuit Courts of Appeal                           elected officials     Congressional Black Caucus                     civil rights movement veterans     Rev.
