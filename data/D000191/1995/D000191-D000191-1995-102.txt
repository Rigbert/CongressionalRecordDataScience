 The other issue there would be, of course, the United States stands alone in the industrial world in not taxing foreign operations in the United States or multinational corporations. We have adopted such a limp section to the Code of taxation that virtually every major multinational and foreign corporation in this country pays no income taxes no matter how profitable they are because they upstream or downstream their profits to other lower tax countries. They are not paying their fair share, yet every day, every week, every American sees their taxes go up. They see the deductions out of their paychecks, but, no, Honda does not make any money in the United States of America. They just sell cars here. Toyota does not make money in the United States of America. They just sell cars here.  Mr. Speaker, if we adopted the same system of taxation that all of our major trading partners have adopted, the estimates are we could raise $40 billion to $60 billion next year; that is about a third of the deficit. We can raise it by just taxing the profits of multinational and foreign corporations the same way that every one of our major economic competitors does.
