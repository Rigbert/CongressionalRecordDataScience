 President, let me echo the remarks of the majority leader with regard to the painstaking process he and I have been through over the last day and a half trying to reach an agreement on the Iraq debate. I think it is an agreement that is satisfactory to both sides. It gives Senators an opportunity to express themselves on what is clearly, arguably, the most important issue on the minds of the American people at this particular juncture in our history, and we look forward to the debate starting shortly. Senator Inhofe will be here to control the time on our side, so let the debate begin.
