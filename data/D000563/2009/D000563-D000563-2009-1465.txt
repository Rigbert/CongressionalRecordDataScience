TITLE II--SECOND AMENDMENT ENFORCEMENT ACT     SEC. 201. SHORT TITLE.       This title may be cited as the ``Second Amendment      Enforcement Act''.     SEC. 202. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.       Congress finds the following:       (1) The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution      provides that the right of the people to keep and bear arms      shall not be infringed.       (2) As the Congress and the Supreme Court of the United      States have recognized, the Second Amendment to the United      States Constitution protects the rights of individuals,      including those who are not members of a militia or engaged      in military service or training, to keep and bear arms.       (3) The law-abiding citizens of the District of Columbia      are deprived by local laws of handguns, rifles, and shotguns      that are commonly kept by law-abiding persons throughout the      United States for sporting use and for lawful defense of      their persons, homes, businesses, and families.       (4) The District of Columbia has the highest per capita      murder rate in the Nation, which may be attributed in part to      local laws prohibiting possession of firearms by law-abiding      persons who would otherwise be able to defend themselves and      their loved ones in their own homes and businesses.       (5) The Federal Gun Control Act of 1968, as amended by the      Firearms Owners' Protection Act of 1986, and the Brady      Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993, provide      comprehensive Federal regulations applicable in the District      of Columbia as elsewhere. In addition, existing District of      Columbia criminal laws punish possession and illegal use of      firearms by violent criminals and felons. Consequently, there      is no need for local laws which only affect and disarm law-     abiding citizens.       (6) Officials of the District of Columbia have indicated      their intention to continue to unduly restrict lawful firearm      possession and use by citizens of the District.       (7) Legislation is required to correct the District of      Columbia's law in order to restore the fundamental rights of      its citizens under the Second Amendment to the United States      Constitution and thereby enhance public safety.     SEC. 203. REFORM D.C. COUNCIL'S AUTHORITY TO RESTRICT                    FIREARMS.       Section 4 of the Act entitled ``An Act to prohibit the      killing of wild birds and wild animals in the District of      Columbia'', approved June 30, 1906 (34 Stat. 809; sec. 1-     303.43, D.C. Official Code) is amended by adding at the end      the following: ``Nothing in this section or any other      provision of law shall authorize, or shall be construed to      permit, the Council, the Mayor, or any governmental or      regulatory authority of the District of Columbia to prohibit,      constructively prohibit, or unduly burden the ability of      persons not prohibited from possessing firearms under Federal      law from acquiring, possessing in their homes or businesses,      or using for sporting, self-protection or other lawful      purposes, any firearm neither prohibited by Federal law nor      subject to the National Firearms Act.
