 President, I am aware of that, and it gives me an opportunity, because I did not highlight it in my remarks, to compliment the Senator from Nevada because he is the brains behind that amendment. That amendment probably will do as much good--or at least almost as much good--as the underlying legislation. It is a part of this bill. It ought to be passed, and I am sure the Senator from Nevada will be constantly reminding people on the other side of the aisle that their voting against cloture has also, at least temporarily, killed this provision as well.
