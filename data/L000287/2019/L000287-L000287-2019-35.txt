Brenda Jones, who served as my communications director for over 15 years.  Ms. Jones came with a strong recommendation from my special assistant and had a resume and perspective that was unique to the United States House of Representatives. From the very first moment we met, I realized how fortunate I was to find Brenda.  Brenda Jones is a proud, native Washingtonian with a passion for social justice, history, and the arts. She studied the Civil Rights Movement, understood the challenges we faced, and dedicated her life to the work that remains. This vantage point provided a unique perspective and comprehension of the complicated matters facing my congressional district in Metro Atlanta and my work here in the United States Congress.  Before coming to Capitol Hill, Ms. Jones worked in media as a researcher for ABC News' Washington, D.C. Bureau, a writer and assistant editor at WTOP-AM News Radio, and a radio specialist of international activities for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. She later transitioned to public relations where she honed her skills in developing media strategies, coordinating national book tours for civil and women rights luminaries, and launching public education campaigns.  One of the things that I most appreciate about Brenda is her constant commitment to education--whether in life or academia. I believe that her centenarian father, Mr. Robert L. Davis and her late mother, Mrs. Myrtle Mac (Bowers) Davis, planted these seeds of excellence, and in Brenda they bloomed. As a graduate of National Cathedral School, Indiana University Bloomington, and Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism, Brenda returned to Harvard University to earn another master's degree in Public Administration, where she received the Gertrude Manley Fellowship in recognition of her outstanding leadership skills.  Ms. Jones invested her astute expertise and intellectualism in the United States House of Representatives. She brought life to her vision and took the role of communications director to new heights as she funneled depth and dignity into her work. Those, who know me, understand that I have a clear style--make it simple, make it plain. When Brenda joined my office, she made my words sing--in press releases, interviews, on the House Floor, in book forwards, in op-eds, and in speeches across the country and around the world.  Madam Speaker, Brenda quickly became the conscience of my office. For 15 years, she humbly and selflessly worked day in and day out to channel every ounce of her knowledge and experience into creating new methods of communicating and mastering unchartered territory. Ms. Jones created a national and international strategy to tell the story of my work in the Civil Rights Movement, as a Member of Congress, as a representative of Georgia's Fifth Congressional District, and as a legislator, who found a way to get in the way--and get things done.  Since she consistently refuses to step into the limelight, I was particularly proud when the public, her peers, and colleagues began to pay tribute to this dynamic woman. In 2010, Brenda earned the prestigious Theodore C. Sorenson Speechwriting Award. In 2012, we worked together on a book, Across that Bridge: Life Lessons and a Vision for Change, and we won the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Literary Work/Biography for her work in translating the philosophy and doctrines that inspired the foot soldiers of the Civil Rights Movement into advice for a new generation. A few years later, the National Journal honored Ms. Jones as one of the 20 Most Powerful Women on Capitol Hill in 2015, and the Stennis Center for Public Leadership selected her as a senior fellow in the 114th, Congress.  Somehow Brenda always found time to mentor aspiring professionals and build networks of kindred souls. In 2013, she founded the Capitol Hill Writers Workshop to develop the skills and art of professionals in a communal space. Brenda also served her communities--whether as a commissioner on the Humanities Council of Washington, D.C., in advisory capacities for the Sustained Dialogue, Inc. and the John C. Stennis Center for Public Service, or on the Committee of Visitors for Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government. She also shared her expertise with the Democratic National Committee for national conventions and our former colleague's, Rep. John Barrow, inaugural campaign. For years, this steady stream of colleagues, mentees, and people with whom she connected across the country and around the world became a permanent part of Brenda's extended circle.  In this day and time when Congress can feel more transactional than communal, Brenda was the nucleus of the Team Lewis family. Shortly before joining my office, Brenda lost her beloved husband Dr. Martin Wilson Jones, M.D., and I often felt that she took care of us with the selfless passion and dedication that he showed her. If you were feeling down and out, we could always trust that Brenda has natural teas, organic tips, and an astrological analysis to soothe your mind, body, and soul. She was often a comfort and confidante during our darkest days and hours.  For 15 years, Ms. Jones fiercely and unequivocally advocated for me, my constituents, and my work in Congress. It was an honor to know that I had this trusted senior advisor and seasoned communications professional in my corner. Although I will miss having Ms. Brenda Jones by my side, I wish her happiness as she transitions to exciting new opportunities and inevitable success.                          ____________________
