 President, I rise with my colleague from California and the chairman of the Appropriations Committee to address the dangerous gap that exists in the counterterrorism intelligence network in this country. Information pertaining to terrorist threats is not currently collected in a centralized place for review, analysis, and dissemination. Statewide counter terrorist data is therefore not accessible to every law enforcement agency that may need it. The collection, analysis, and accessibility of this information to law enforcement are critically important to protect the health and safety of citizens.  In late September, the California Governor and Attorney General signed a memorandum of understanding that established The California Anti Terrorism Information Center (CATIC) to address this critical problem. Every day, State and local law enforcement learn information that may be useful to Federal intelligence authorities or that may actually prevent terrorist events from taking place. Despite this obvious point, there is currently no reliable and secure system to ensure that this information flows back and forth among the right people in a rapid and organized manner.  The California Anti-Terrorism Information Center is designed to solve this problem by developing a sophisticated data system that includes trained intelligence specialist, extensive technology infrastructure, and strong safeguards to protect constitutionally guaranteed civil liberties.  This new system represents a crucial advance in counter-terrorism intelligence sharing and some federal agencies have already committed analysts to CATIC. Dozens of State and local personnel will also be detailed to the various investigative and analytic units of CATIC. I believe Federal resources are also a necessary component of this project if it is to achieve maximum effectiveness.
