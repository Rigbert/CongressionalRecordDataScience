 President, the House vote was on a point of order. In fact, this particular reform has been recommended by the House authorizing committee. Let us not make this more complicated than it is.  All this amendment does that the Senator from Kentucky has offered, in concert with the Senator from Utah, is require that on this--in this unique agency; it is different from any other agency in the Federal Government; it is three and three: three Republicans and three Democrats--to require that in this agency every 4 years the top two staff people enjoy enough confidence across party lines to be reappointed for 4 years.  In fact, Mr. President, this amendment ensures that the agency will, in fact, be operated on a bipartisan basis because any staff director or general counsel who, after 4 years in the office, cannot get the confidence of both parties, Mr. President, clearly is not operating on a bipartisan basis and therefore should not be reappointed.  So it is, in fact, this amendment that ensures that the Federal Election Commission achieves its original mission, which was to operate on a bipartisan basis.  I see that my friend from Utah is on the floor. I yield to him whatever time he may need.
