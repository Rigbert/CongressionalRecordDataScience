 We have perfecting amendments that have been cleared on both sides. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the first-degree and second-degree perfecting amendments that are at the desk be considered and agreed to en bloc and that the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table; provided further that the committee substitute be agreed to and considered as original text for the purpose of further amendment. I further ask unanimous consent that the next first-degree amendments in order be the following: a Senator Hatch and Senator Murray amendment on R, with a Bingaman second-degree amendment which is relevant to the first degree; then Senator Dodd dealing with outsourcing; then Senator Bunning and Senator Stabenow dealing with accelerating manufacturers' tax cut; and then the fourth amendment will be Senator Daschle or his designee.
