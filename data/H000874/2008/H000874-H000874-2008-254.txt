I think he and I have a difference on the perception of some of the items that he mentioned as being analogous to some of the other items that we have discussed.  On the AMT, for instance, there is a disagreement on that alternative minimum tax. The alternative minimum tax was not intended, I don't think by any of us, to impact the people that it is now impacting. I believe strongly that we ought to fix the AMT, not just for this coming year, but permanently, and we ought to pay for that. And the reason I think that we ought to do that is, A, it clearly falls within the ambit of PAYGO, and secondly, because I think that our generation incurred this liability and we ought to pay for that liability.  But some of the things that we have already mentioned I think are more analogous, not to tax extenders, giving additional tax relief or fixing the AMT, but are, as the UI is, unemployment insurance, directed to an emergency that confronts us as a result of a substantial downturn in the economy, which is analogous, I think, to the stimulus package, which is why we didn't consider that to be a PAYGO issue and were prepared not to address it in a PAYGO way.
