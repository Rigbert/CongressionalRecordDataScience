President, last Thursday Senate and House conferees reached final agreement on the Conference Report for H.R. 333, the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2002. I look forward to Senate consideration of this measure in September, following House action on the conference report.  It seems inevitable in a bill nearly five hundred pages in length, even with our most diligent efforts, that the conferees sometimes fail to catch all drafting errors. Shortly after the conference was concluded, it was brought to our attention that the effective date provision of Section 1234 contained an error. Section 1234 is not a new provision of law but a reiteration of current law, which Senator Baucus offered as a amendment to the Senate-passed bill. The House and Senate conferees agree to retain the provision during our conference. This section makes clear that a claim that is in bona fide dispute over the existence of liability, or the amount of that liability, cannot be used as a weapon for bringing an involuntary bankruptcy action.  This clarification is consistent with the 1984 legislative history of this portion of Section 303 of the Bankruptcy Code. It also tracks the decisions of all five Courts of Appeals that have ruled on the bona fide dispute bar to the bringing of involuntary bankruptcy actions. Section 1234 restates and strengthens Congressional intent that an involuntary bankruptcy action should not be employed by creditors seeking to gain more leverage than they would have if they litigated contract disputes in the proper judicial forum. A party to a dispute over the amount or liability for a claim should not also be disadvantaged by the stigma and expense of an involuntary bankruptcy proceeding. Our overcrowded bankruptcy courts should not be burdened with such disputes.  In as much as Section 1234 restates existing law, it is given immediate effect upon enactment. As it currently reads, due to a drafting error, it would not apply to cases now pending before the bankruptcy courts. This mistake would have a particularly perverse effect in the five federal circuits that have already ruled that the bona fide dispute standard applies to both liability and the amount thereof.  As soon as the conferees became aware of this mistake, we worked to fashion a correction contained in a concurrent resolution to be adopted simultaneously with the conference report. In order to dispel any confusion regarding Congressional understanding and intent in this matter, I am placing the relevant portion of the agreed upon Concurrent Resolution in the Record. It directs the Clerk of the House to correct the enrollment of H.R. 333 by amending it as follows:  ``Section 1234(b) of the bill by striking `shall not apply with respect to cases commenced under Title II of the United States Code before such date' and inserting `shall apply with respect to cases commenced under Title II of the United States Code before, on, and after such date'.''                          ____________________
