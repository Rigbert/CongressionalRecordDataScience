Speaker, I rise in support of the Hamilton resolution, and in opposition to H.R. 2770 and H. Res. 302. I, like most Americans, still have concerns about the deployment of United States troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but I believe that we need to support our troops.  I visited the former Yugoslavia in 1993. That visit alerted me to the dangers of American involvement in the conflict that has consumed the former Yugoslavia for the last 4 years. The animosities are profound, the terrain is difficult, and the underlying problems are political rather than simply military. Nevertheless, the Dayton Agreement is the last chance for a peaceful resolution of this war, and that Agreement rests on the participation of NATO as the implementation force. As a member of NATO, the United States is faced with a choice between making peace work or letting the contending forces slip inexorably back into the abyss of war.  I believe that the vast majority of Americans want us to choose peace. But they also want us to ensure that our involvement is limited in scope, complementary to the efforts of our European allies and not a substitute for their involvement, militarily prudent, and consistent with our national security interests.  Over the past few weeks, I have expressed these concerns to the administration. In particular, I have stressed the need for a more detailed exit strategy for disengagement of our forces, the need to ensure that we do not shoulder a disproportionate burden, the need to clearly identify our interests in the region and, most importantly, the need to take every reasonable precaution to protect our forces.  The administration has responded with a more focused and compelling discussion of their plans. They have laid out a more detailed exit strategy. They have made a more convincing case that the scale of American involvement is justified by the mission and by the comparative strengths of United States Military Forces versus those of our allies. Although I remain skeptical of claims that our national interest is implicated because our prestige is on the line or the survival of NATO is at stake, I do feel that a resumption of fighting could precipitate an expansion of the conflict. Such a development, with its very real potential to involve Greece and Turkey, would pose a significant threat to our national interest.  The administration and our military leaders have made repeated assertions that the forces are well trained, the mission is well defined, the rules of engagement are clear and permissive of preemptory action, and that more than adequate resources are available for our forces. Moreover, they have stressed that the primary mission of our forces is self-protection. These factors, and particularly the testimony of professional military officers, strengthens the claim that we have taken all reasonable precautions to protect our forces. Nevertheless, given the nature of this mission and the hostile environment of the former Yugoslavia, no one can rule out the possibility of casualties.  Although the foregoing efforts by the administration to justify the deployment of American ground forces have allayed opposition to the commitment of American forces, significant concerns remain. It will be incumbent upon the Congress to ensure that the limited scope and definite duration of the mission is maintained. It will be incumbent upon the Congress to ensure that our forces are continuously protected. These concerns will persist beyond this vote until our forces are withdrawn from Bosnia.  The Hamilton resolution clearly expresses our support for our forces while signaling our concerns. It is the right message to send to our forces and to those in the former Yugoslavia that may wish them harm. It stands in stark contrast to H.R. 2770 which would cut off all funding for United States Forces in Bosnia. This measure would put our forces already in Bosnia at risk. It would end any chance of a peaceful settlement of the conflict. It is a reckless and politically expedient measure unworthy of the American soldiers who are ready to do their duty. The Hamilton resolution is also in contrast to H. Res. 302 which opposes the President's policy while purporting to support the troops. Serious and sincere opposition to a policy requiring the deployment of American forces is incompatible with wishing them well on their mission. Rather, it represents a political straddle.  Finally, it is important to note that today's vote is not about authorizing the commencement of offensive operations by United States Forces. It is about peacekeeping. Our forces are entering a dangerous arena, but one in which the parties have already initiated a peace agreement. The President's constitutional authority to order our forces into Bosnia has not been seriously challenged. Thus, this vote is about our support of peacekeeping and our support of our forces. I believe that both are worthy of our support and, in the days ahead, our hard and unyielding scrutiny to ensure that neither the peace nor our soldiers are sacrificed needlessly.                          ____________________
