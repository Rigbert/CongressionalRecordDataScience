Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman for all of his hard on H.R. 4.  Mr. Chair, I am pleased that my amendment to codify the FAA's Unmanned Aircraft Systems Integrated Pilot Program is included in this en bloc package.  Drones are an innovation that I know our country is anxious to take advantage of. However, it brings with it a need to rethink and redefine some current policies. Aviation regulations that manage the flow of air traffic at 30,000 feet, or even 1,000 feet, do not make sense when managing the operation of a UAS 5 feet off the ground.  Congress should formally support this pilot program and learn from the data gathered here. We must also recognize the importance of non-Federal bodies like States, municipalities, and Tribal governments to be part of the drone oversight. This pilot program, which my amendment codifies and which stem from a White House proposal, will help us do just that, and it has been widely supported.  In fact, drone associations, traditional aviation groups, and large companies wrote in support of the pilot program. We hope that by Congress codifying the pilot program, the Department of Transportation will now expand the pilot program to further participation.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how much time is remaining on each side.  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Oregon has 5\1/2\ minutes remaining. The gentleman from Pennsylvania has 6\1/2\ minutes remaining.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Jayapal).
