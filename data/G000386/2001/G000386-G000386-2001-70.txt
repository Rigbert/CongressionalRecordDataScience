 President, I come to the floor today to cosponsor an amendment with the very distinguished gentleman from West Virginia, Senator Byrd.  Senator Byrd has crafted a very important and thoughtful piece of legislation designed to help the new Secretary of Defense bring some financial management reform to the Pentagon.  This legislation is the end result of a series of questions Senator Byrd raised at a hearing before the Armed Services Committee on January 11th. This was the hearing on the nomination of Mr. Rumsfeld to be the next Secretary of Defense.  Senator Byrd's questions pertained to the Pentagon's continuing inability to earn a passing grade, or ``clean'' audit opinion, on its annual financial statements.  Under the Chief Financial Officers or CFO Act, the Pentagon must prepare financial statements each year. These are supposed to be an accurate reflection of all the department's assets and liabilities. The financial statements are then subjected to an independent audit by either the General Accounting Office or the Inspector General.  Senator Byrd's questions pertained to the department's poor performance on the latest audit.  Senator Byrd questioning with this telling point: ``DOD's own auditors say the department cannot account for $2.3 trillion, I repeat $2.3 trillion, in transactions in one year alone.''  I believe that Senator Byrd's question had a profound effect on Mr. Rumsfeld. I think they sent shock waves through the whole department.  Since that time, Senator Byrd's staff and my staff have been working together to find a remedy.  Our amendment is a byproduct of that process, and Senator Byrd deserves most of the credit for advancing this initiative through the committee review process.  It is a great honor and privilege for the Senator from Iowa to work with someone of Senator Byrd's stature. Senator Byrd is a highly respected leader in this body and throughout our government. And when he tells the Pentagon, or any other agency for that matter, to shape up and fly right, they pay attention. They do what he asks.  As many of my colleagues know, I have been wrestling with this problem for a number of years. And quite frankly, I have not had a whole lot of success in getting the job done.  With Senator Byrd's leadership, I am now confident of success. With his leadership, I believe that meaningful reform is possible.  And my confidence is further reinforced by the attitude of the new leadership across the river over in the Pentagon.  My gut sense is that Mr. Rumsfeld was truly shocked by Senator Byrd's assessment.  As a former chief executive officer in a large corporation, Mr. Rumsfeld knows and understands the importance of having accurate financial information at his fingertips. It's absolutely essential for making informed decisions. It is essential for success.  He understands that the financial statement audits are a valuable diagnostic tool. They allow us to examine the patient's vital signs. It's kind of like doing a cat-scan on the government bookkeeping operation. If the books are in order and the numbers add up, it's so easy to roll them all up into a top-line financial statement that can stand up to scrutiny by auditors.  Mr. Rumsfeld grasped the magnitude of the problem immediately. He knows that the Secretary of Defense cannot possibly make good decisions with lousy information.  Having accurate, up-to-date financial information at his fingertips is mandatory--especially today when we appear to be on the brink of war.  The demand for financial resources is starting to escalate rapidly. If DOD does not know what it has in the inventory today and how much it is spending from one day to the next, then how could it possibly know what it needs?  I want to be certain that my colleagues understand the goal of the CFO Act. The key to this process is not passing some audit with flying colors. That's not it at all. This is no mickey mouse bean-counter exercise.  The goal is to have accurate financial information in the hands of those responsible for making decisions. A ``clean'' opinion tells us that they will have it when they need it. A ``clean'' opinion will tell us that they are in a position to make informed decisions about what needs to be done.  A disclaimer of opinion, by comparison, says they don't have it and can't make informed decisions. That's bad, but that's exactly where DOD is today.  Secretary Rumsfeld's response to Senator Byrd's questions was so encouraging. It was music to my ears.  Secretary Rumsfeld's response tells me that he understands the problem completely, and he wants to solve it. He knows he has to solve it, if he is to be a successful and effective secretary.  Secretary Rumsfeld made a personal commitment to me to clean up the department's books.  His Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Dov Zakheim, has made a personal commitment to me to fix the books.  And Mr. Zakheim's senior deputies, like Mr. Larry Lanzillotta, have made a personal commitment to me to fix the books.  So, I now see a willingness in the Pentagon to get a handle on this problem. That's half the battle right there, the will to get the job done.  To my knowledge, that attitude never existed at the Pentagon in the past.  In the past, I fought endlessly with Mr. Hamre and his predecessors. They denied the problem even existed. Clearly, we have moved way beyond that stage.  Mr. Rumsfeld and his team understand the problem and want to fix it. If the will is there, as I think it is, I think we can succeed this time.  I would like to assure my colleagues that this is not an attempt to legislate a solution. So long as the Secretary is committed to reform, a legislative solution is unnecessary.  I see our amendment more as a device to help the Secretary get the job done.  Our only objective is to help the department acquire the tools it needs to put accurate, up-to-date financial information at the secretary's fingertips.  First, our amendment establishes a Senior Financial Management Modernization Executive Committee.  This group will supervise the acquisition of highly integrated accounting systems and computer technology.  These systems will be designed to produce reliable financial statements. Those capabilities simply do not exist today.  This group will report directly to Secretary Rumsfeld.  Second, the amendment provides some much needed relief. Right now, the Inspector General is pouring audit resources down a rat hole. It makes no sense whatsoever to audit financial statements that are notoriously unreliable. It's a total waste. That practice will be suspended temporarily.  Third, while some audits are suspended, the Secretary must provide an estimate of when reliable financial statements will be available for audit.  Fourth, the department is put on notice that it has four years to get the new systems up and running.  Mr. President, every member of this body understands that the elimination of the terrorist threat to this country is the top defense priority for the foreseeable future. We understand and accept that .  Countering this terrible threat must take priority over everything else.  At the same time, I hope that efforts to ferret out fraud, waste, abuse and mismanagement are not left behind in a cloud of dust. They have a place, even in the current environment.  It will be up to Secretary Rumsfeld to decide how and where reform fits into the new priorities.  We have been repeatedly told that the coming campaign against terrorism will be long and difficult. If it is long and difficult as predicted, then we will need to be certain that we don't waste precious resources. Waste and mismanagement could get in the way of our efforts to win the war against terrorism.                           Amendment No. 1703
