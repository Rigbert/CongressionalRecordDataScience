Res. 171       Whereas the Bush Administration and the Clinton      Administration have both worked relentlessly to build on the      Middle East peace process that began in Madrid in October      1991, with the goal of achieving a comprehensive, lasting      peace between Israel and all its neighbors;       Whereas on September 13, 1993, the first major breakthrough      of the Madrid peace process was achieved when Israel and the      Palestinians signed the Declaration of Principles on Interim      Self-Government Arrangements on the White House lawn;       Whereas September 13, 1995 marks the second anniversary of      this important breakthrough;       Whereas the United States has pledged to support the      Israel-Palestinian Declaration of Principles through      diplomatic and political efforts, the provision of      assistance, and other means;       Whereas the May 4, 1994 Cairo Agreement between Israel and      the Palestinians resulted in the withdrawal of the Israeli      army from the Gaza Strip and the Jericho Area and the      establishment of a Palestinian Authority with responsibility      for those areas;       Whereas Israel and the Palestinian Authority are continuing      negotiations on the redeployment of Israeli troops our of      Arab population centers in the West Bank, the expansion of      the Palestinian Authority's jurisdiction into the areas      vacated by the Israeli army, and the convening of elections      for a Palestinian council;       Whereas the Israeli-Palestinian Declaration of Principles      helped pave the way for the October 25, 1994 signing of a      full peace treaty between Israel and Jordan, which      established full diplomatic relations and pledged to resolve      all future disputes by peaceful means;       Whereas the Israeli-Jordanian peace treaty has resulted in      rapid normalization and unprecedented cooperation between the      two nations in security, economic development, the      environment, and other areas;       Whereas the Israeli-Palestinian Declaration of Principles      helped pave the way for Israel to establish low-level      diplomatic relations with Morocco and Tunisia, and to      initiate official contacts with Qatar, Oman, and Bahrain;       Whereas the six nations of the Gulf Cooperation Council      have announced their decision to end all enforcement of the      secondary and tertiary boycotts of Israel;       Whereas extremists opposed to the Middle East peace process      continue to use terrorism to undermine the chances of      achieving a comprehensive peace, including on August 21,      1995, when a suicide bomber blew up a bus in Jerusalem,      killing one American and four Israeli civilians;       Whereas the issue of security and preventing acts of      terrorism is and must remain of paramount importance in the      Israeli-Palestinian negotiations; and       Whereas compliance by the Palestine Liberation Organization      and the Palestinian Authority with all of their solemn      commitments is essential to the success of the peace process:      Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That the Senate--       (1) expresses its support for the Israeli-Palestinian      Declaration of Principles on the second anniversary of its      historic signing;       (2) supports the efforts of Israel and the Palestinians to      conclude an agreement on implementation of the second phase      of the Declaration of Principles;       (3) condemns, in the strongest possible terms, all acts of      terrorism aimed at undermining the Israeli-Palestinian peace      negotiations and other tracks of the Middle East peace      process, and calls upon all parties to take all necessary      steps to prevent such acts;       (4) calls upon the Palestine Liberation Organization and      the Palestinian Authority to comply with all of their      commitments;       (5) welcomes the progress made toward peace between Israel      and its neighbors;       (6) commends those Middle Eastern leaders who have      committed to resolve their differences through only peaceful      means;       (7) reiterates its belief that a comprehensive, lasting      peace between Israel and its neighbors is in the national      interest of the United States;       (8) encourages all participants in the Middle East peace      process to continue working to achieve lasting peace      agreements while adhering fully to all commitments made and      agreements reached thus far;       (9) calls upon the Arab states to demonstrate their      commitment to peace by completely dismantling the Arab      boycott of Israel in its primary, secondary, and tertiary      aspects; and       (10) strongly supports the Middle East peace process and      seeks to effect policies that will help the peace process      reach a successful conclusion.
