President, I associate myself with the comments of Senator Collins, who described the amendment extremely well. I, too, rise in opposition to the proposed amendment for all the reasons she listed. She was quite vivid and quite concrete in numerous examples: individuals in Afghanistan who have assisted us who are in jeopardy if they don't get an opportunity to come to the United States and people in Jordan who fight with us each day. Who can fail to recall the horrific scene of the young Jordanian pilot who was burned by ISIS? That was a Jordanian patriot fighting with the United States of America against the common enemy, ISIL. Unfortunately, he is deceased. But to tell his family members and his fellow countrymen that they can't come here as they qualify through rigorous procedures as a refugee and are granted asylum--all these reasons have been so well spoken by Senator Collins. So I won't go on, but I want to make clear that I, too, oppose the amendment.
