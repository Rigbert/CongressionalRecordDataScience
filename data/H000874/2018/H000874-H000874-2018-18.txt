You haven't passed any plan on homeland security. You haven't brought it to the floor. It passed out of the committee. You have not brought it to the floor in 340 days.  Here we are, with agreement on six bills, Mr. Leader. We have reached agreement. We have worked hard to get to that agreement.  Now, yes, you have a faction of your caucus that has told you from time to time, ``my way or no way,'' even when you had agreement on six-sevenths.  Mr. Boehner had the same problem, and he decided he was going to leave here because he had the ``my way or no way,'' ``my way or the highway,'' ``my way or here's your hat and get out.''  Mr. Leader, you have not told us a plan. We have been discussing this for, literally, all year, and we have a very significant, substantive disagreement. And you haven't brought it to the floor to press your view and send it to the Senate.  I don't know why you haven't brought it to the floor. We haven't had any debate on the floor on this issue. We are prepared to debate that bill.  But what we are not prepared to do is hold hostage six-sevenths of the appropriations bills that remain to be done, which we have agreed upon, worked on, and are ready to go. All you tell me is: We are prepared to do that, but we have got to pass all seven bills. If we don't get everything we want, we are not going to do it.  I understand, because you have the President of the United States saying: ``I am proud to shut down the government.''  What kind of irresponsibility is that?  He wants the wall. I know he wants the wall. We are a democracy, however, not an autocracy, not a dictatorship. We are a democracy, and the wall has not passed this House. There is no agreement on the wall, and we think the wall is a bad strategy.  There are more resources deployed to the South, the southern border, than at any time, I think--I haven't checked this exactly--in my service in the Congress of the United States. So it is not like we have not put a lot of Border Patrol, a lot of technology, a lot of fencing. We have supported substantial security at the border.  Now the President wants more. I get that. But we are holding hostage six-sevenths of the appropriations bills, six out of seven, because the President is going to be proud to shut down the government.  Now, I don't want to be too painful, but we had an election just a few weeks ago, and the President made it very clear he wanted to build that wall. He sent troops down to the border, at tens of millions of dollars' cost. Of course, under the law, they can't deal with law enforcement. And, yes, there were some people that came at the fence, and they were pushed back.  But the fact of the matter is that there is border security. Can we makeit better? Yes. Do we want to make it better? Yes. Will we work with you to do that? Yes. But you are not going to get us to believe something is good that we don't think is good.  You can pass it. The President can sign it. I get that. And we lose. But you haven't brought it to the floor. You don't have a plan to get that done, 330, I guess, 340 days into the year.  So I am, Mr. Speaker, saying, why, when we have agreement--I say six-sevenths. Very frankly, we have agreement on the homeland security bill except for the wall, one item, so, essentially, we have probably 99 percent agreement. But it is my way or the highway, with no plan, as I understand it, to get us from where we are today, where we were 2 weeks ago, and where I am fearful that we will be on Wednesday at 6:30 p.m., because we have no plan to get from where we are to where we need to be.  We have offered two plans. You don't like either one of them. One was a CR for the rest of the year, for everything, for the remaining. We don't like that. That is not our plan, but it is one option, and we would support that if you bring that to the floor.  The other option, of course, is to pass the six bills. We will vote for them, all of them. You can put them in a package. Then do a CR on the homeland security, and we will have further discussions about that, and we will see what the democratic process results in.                              {time}  1145  It hasn't passed the House. We are not for it. We are prepared to debate it. If it passes and the President signs it, it will be law and my friend will do it, but don't hold the rest of government hostage for something on which there is deep disagreement not only by us, but within my friend's own party.  I implore my friend, on Wednesday at 6:30, bring those six bills to the floor. We will vote for them. Hopefully, his folks who worked to get them in place will vote for them. We will pass them, and we will avoid another stupid, as I said, shutdown of the government of the United States.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I respect my friend. I even follow my friend on Instagram. And today is Thursday, and I almost feel like he is throwing a Throwback Thursday up, because now he calls a shutdown stupid.  But in this Congress, that is not what he did. In this Congress, he actually whipped to have a shutdown. I did think it was stupid then, and I think going into a shutdown is stupid now. That is why I want to solve the problem.  Mr. Speaker, my friend says: Can we make the border better? Yes. He keeps talking about the wall. I just talk about security.  When he described what is happening along the border, it was interesting, the words he chose. He said there were ``some people'' down there. I am sure the rest of America has watched what has gone on down there, gone on down there before it even got into Mexico, where they broke down their wall and came across, where they stormed and they threw things at our Border Patrol.  I think the border could be more secure. I know my friend lives in Maryland, but to those of us who live in a border State, maybe we understand this a little differently.  Now, I am the first one who believes in legal immigration. This has nothing to do with it. This is about keeping the country safe. And if two sides cannot sit down to solve a fundamental problem, it is bad for the country.  There is a check and balance, as the gentleman well knows. There is a House; there is a Senate; and then there is an administration, a President, who either signs or vetoes a bill.  The gentleman started the conversation earlier very proud of the fact that he passed all 12 bills. We have done that before, too. The test is really the final end, does it get all the way there?  We are 75 percent there. Twenty-five percent should not stop us, and we should be able to get it done.  But in the gentleman's quest of talking about passing all 12 bills, they didn't become law. Why? Because of the Senate and the 60 votes there.
