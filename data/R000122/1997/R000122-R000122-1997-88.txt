Again, I don't think any of us are suggesting that pharmaceutical and device manufacturers are going to--some may, but I hope not--deliberately try to bait and switch. But the market is evolving so much and there is so much innovation that if the FDA can't, by reviewing the literature, make an estimate of what a device might be used for and ask for data on that likely use, then I think we are really constraining FDA--as I said before, putting blinders on the FDA.  That, I think, would be a mistake in policy. And I also feel, based upon my sense of the progress we have made to date, that this is not an unsolvable issue. This issue is one that there is compromise language, with which we can both provide for innovation, we can provide for marketing, we can avoid cumbersome demands by the FDA. But we can still give the FDA the authority to say, ``Listen, you are marketing this device for a very specific use, but we are aware that it would likely be used two or three others ways. How does this device work in those contexts?'' This is a very serious issue.  Once again, without the efforts of the Senator from Massachusetts to try to focus on these issues, it well could have been lost in the clamor of getting out of here and getting on with other business. It would be, in the long run, unfortunate for the public health of the American people.  Let me conclude by saying that it is vitally important in ensuring when the bill passes--and I believe we all hope it passes--it passes in a way we will all be proud of and will deal with all these issues that, leaving no unintended loophole or unintended consequences. I hope that we will have thought it through, worked it out and come up with legislation that will provide for the kind of technological innovation we all want, provide for the kind of efficient regulatory review that we all want and certainly protect the safety of the American public which not only we want but the American people demand. I yield the floor.
