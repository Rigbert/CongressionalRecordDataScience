  The second concern I have about the proposal is the inclusion of offsets which we have not had an opportunity to fully consider or with respect to which we have some policy concerns. An example of that is the revival of the environmental excise tax offered, referred to as the ``Superfund tax.'' As you might expect, I believe the bill passed by a bipartisan majority with 64 votes in the Senate in November, which we are not going through again, represents a more balanced bill, one that provides longer-term benefits, including increased certainty and reduced complexity for planning.  In addition, I raise a point of order that the budget does not meet reconciliation instructions to the Senate. It is an issue of germaneness, Mr. President.
