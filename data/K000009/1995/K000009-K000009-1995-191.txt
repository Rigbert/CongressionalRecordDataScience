Speaker, I am very pleased this evening to rise to discuss the issue of welfare reform and jobs and perhaps looking at it at a different perspective than some of my colleagues who have stood today. It is amazing what people do not say on this issue, and I think far too many Members of this body are looking through the wrong end of the telescope on opportunity.  There is no question that America's families and America's welfare families often fail to remain whole because America's job-producing machine is failing.  In my own home district of northwest Ohio, half the people, I repeat, half the people on welfare are working people. Half the men, half the women are not unwilling to work. They work everyday. Some work two and three jobs. But they still remain on welfare.  Half the people on welfare in my home district are there for one reason only, and that is to receive the health benefit. Half cannot receive a health benefit through their private sector employment and so they fall on to the welfare rolls as the only hope to receive health insurance.  About 15 percent of the people on welfare in my home region are blind or disabled or elderly, and the remaining 30 percent, adults and children, are really what most of this discussion has been focused on.  And we are all for moving able-bodied people into the work force, but I want to concentrate on the half of the welfare rolls that nobody talks about, and those are the people who are out there hustling everyday, and they do not earn enough to buy the basic necessities.  And I have found it rather ironic that, as the House has labored through this welfare reform discussion, it has been interesting to read the newspaper headlines today. In the Washington Post, the lead story, U.S. trade gap soared in January, economists warn of weaker dollar, and the economic growth of this country over the next year dropping a full percentage point because of difficulties we face in our trade and economic policies.  The Wall Street Journal, major story today, United States trade deficit widened in January to a record $12 billion as peso woes and the problems with NAFTA and the Mexico bailout have a terrible impact inside our own economy. And for every billion dollars of  [[Page H3721]] additional deficit another 20,000 jobs lost in this country.                              {time}  2230  And nobody in Washington really cares.  Another article, ``Dollar Declines Still Further on News of Trade Gap,'' and it talks in the New York Times, ``United States Trade Deficit Soars to Record, Mexico Worsens Problem.''  Today the value of the U.S. dollar dropped again on international markets, and today it was also reported that our Nation's trade imbalance in January dropped 68 percent, got 68 percent worse, the largest ever in a single month in the history of this Nation, another 20,000 jobs, times 20,000, times 20,000, $12 billion of additional deficit, more lost jobs in this country in sectors that the newspapers tell us are very clear in telecommunications, another 30,000 jobs will be lost, in electrical machinery, in office computing machines, the places where we would like to put people who still remain on welfare and are not working, into good jobs, will not be there. The numbers are telling us this.  We know that the wages and buying power of our people have not gone up for 20 years, and we know that thousands and thousands of jobs are being eliminated across this country at companies like Boeing, which is going to lay off another 7,000 workers, and companies like Fisher Price in New York who just announced several hundred more workers out, but do you think anybody here in Washington really hears or understands what is going on?  And there is a major continental economic crisis here in North America that nobody is really talking about in this Chamber caused by NAFTA that is already causing market instability and is going to have far reaching economic consequences for our Nation and for Mexico, lower wages, higher interest rates, a worsening trade situation for our Nation with more lost sales and jobs and a deluge of cheap Mexican imports coming into our market. Five billion dollars from our Treasury has already gone down to Mexico, and another 15 billion scheduled as soon as it can be drawn down.  Does the Contract on America say anything about America's economic plight? No.  Does it say anything about what I have just discussed? No.  The blame is all put on welfare recipients, the majority of whom work in my district. What a shame.                          ____________________
