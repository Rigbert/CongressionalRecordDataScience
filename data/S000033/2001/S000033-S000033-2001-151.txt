 Speaker, today I recognize the outstanding work done by participants in my Student Congressional Town Meeting held this summer. These participants were part of a group of high school students from around Vermont who testified about the concerns they have as teenagers, and about what they would like to see government do regarding these concerns.  I am asking that these statements be printed in the Congressional Record, as I believe that the views of these young persons will benefit my colleagues.  On Behalf of Kevin Decausemacker Regarding Gun Control, May 7, 2001       Kevin Decausemacker. Thank you for this opportunity. It is      a really great thing you let the youth of Vermont come and      express their opinions.       Congressman Sanders. Thanks very much for coming, Kevin.      Give us your name for the record.       Kevin Decausemacker. The year was 1938.       Congressman Sanders. Your full name.       Kevin Decausemacker. I'm sorry. I'm a little tired. I'm      Kevin Decausemacker. A little hard to pronounce. The year was      1938, one year before the invasion of Poland. It was now that      Adolf Hitler implemented the first example of gun control. He      prohibited the Jewish people from owning firearms, and by so      doing took substantial power away from the people. He made it      easier to commence his mission of genocide with little      resistance from his victims. This is what a government can do      with too much power: Whatever it wants. Our government has      created three different branches to limit the power it      possesses. The United States promotes a government of the      people, by the people, and for the people. The more we      constrict the rights that the Second Amendment states we      have, the more power is taken away from the people and given      to the government. I feel that the more power the government      has, the more the people are at risk of being taken advantage      of by it. Why implement gun control then? Solely for safety.      However, if safety is the main concern, in England and      Australia, where there are strict gun-control laws, there      have been rising breaking-and-entry and burglary numbers. So      what gun control has done there has                                       ____On Behalf of Jory Hurst, Robby Short, Emily Wright, and Kerry McIntosh      Regarding, School Standards, Tracking in Schools, May 7, 2001       Jory Hurst. On the program, I think it listed us as doing--     we are switching topics. We are doing the tracking, and the      other group is doing drop-out rates. Not that it matters. We      go to Mt. Anthony Union High School, which is a very      socioeconically diverse school, especially for Vermont. And      coming into high school, there are kids coming in from lots      of different educational backgrounds, so people have all      different kinds of experience. In our school, you kind of      have to track classes, just because of where everybody is at.      So we have five different levels of tracking. There is the      honors, there is the college prep, there is the B, there is      the applied, and then there is the remedial. We want to talk      about some problems we see in tracking, even though we feel      it is necessary. In our school, the honors is about 10      percent honors, about 25 in the college prep, 35 percent in      the B, and about 30 percent of the kids are in IEPs,      individual plans, and they are in special classes.       Robby Short. Let me talk about getting into honors. It all      starts out in the 7th and 8th grade. You have to take a test      in 7th grade. It is a math test, and then, the next year, if      you pass the math test--I think it is 75 percent--you get      into honors classes for the 8th grade year, which is, you end      up getting into--all your core classes are honors classes.      Which is kind of unfair, because it is just a math test that      decides English, social studies and science. And if you are      not in 8th grade honors, and you're going into high school,      you are pretty much on your own getting into honors for your      9th grade year. You have to try your hardest with the      guidance office, if you have come in contact with many      conflicts. And if you are in honors, you automatically get      into it in the 9th grade. Once you get into high school, it      is really a battle to try and get into honors classes. Some      students have it easy and some don't. The students that have      it easy usually have a teacher backing them up by just really      fighting for them with the guidance office to get them in.      And the other students have to go through tutoring over an      entire summer. They have to double up in math classes--not      just in math classes, but double up on honors classes in high      school, and drop like classes that they really need. If we      could come up with one of one set of standards that gives      everyone equal chances, it would be the best for all.       Emily Wright. Jory was talking about how there is honors      and college prep, and then there is B, and then the       Kelly McIntosh. Another negative effect of tracking that      must be kept in mind is that it can create like social class      systems in the schools. Like students are grouped according      to what track they're in, like the honors students, the B      students, college prep, and often the groups of students,      often they do have similar interests, but they are just      always together. And integration is important, because being      with the same group all the time allows for no variety, and      you don't really get to see other perspectives. Like a      student coming from a different area from you. And also, some      of thee academic class systems can lead to generalizations      that can go through nonacademic categories, such as with      social things with friends and/or into sports, and this isn't      good. And often kids are grouped and branded into certain      classes. Like if a student is grouped as a B student, then      this can be a self-fulfilling prophesy, and they will never      really want to succeed because they will think that they      can't, because they're not in honors, and people don't look      at them with the same respect. But we just need to look at      everybody as an individual, and then this problem will really      go away. And have more school unity. And teachers and      students alike need to keep in mind that there is more to a      person than their academic ranking.
