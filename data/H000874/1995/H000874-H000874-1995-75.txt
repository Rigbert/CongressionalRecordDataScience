Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments, and I think he is correct. If we put aside this partisan bickering, we could in fact move forward. My friend knows we do have differences. He and I are good friends and we differ on issues. Both sides of the aisle differ on issues. What we are trying to do is move this forward.  One of the frustrations I have, as the gentleman knows, is that you are absolutely correct when you represent that there may be a difference in the size of Government, but there is not a difference in the fact that the size that we agree on should continue to operate effectively and efficiently. That could be accomplished, of course, by what we call a simple CR; that is, simply saying at such level as can be agreed upon Government will operate while we debate.                              {time}  0930  The problem we have, as all of us know, is that for the last eight or nine words as to whether or not we agree on a particular formulation to get to a balanced budget, which is not per se affected by the operations of Government, obviously the operations of Government and the size will be affected by the balanced budget, but not the other way around. I do not know whether we can get there. I would hope during today that we all work very diligently to try to come up with some sort of formula that will get the Government back to work on Monday while we debate the differences that we have, and I appreciate the gentleman's comments. I hope that is the direction we can go.
