President, America's antitrust laws play a vital role in protecting consumers and ensuring a competitive marketplace for business. The vigorous enforcement of these laws also helps promote and maintain the efficiency of our markets by promoting competition, innovation, and technological development. Today, I am pleased to join Senator Kohl and Senator DeWine in introducing the Antitrust Criminal Investigative Improvements Act of 2005, legislation that will provide the Department of Justice with long overdue authority in investigating and prosecuting criminal antitrust violations.  Congress acted in 1890 with passage of the Sherman Antitrust Act to prohibit abusive monopolization and anticompetitive practices. Since that time, the Department of Justice's enforcement efforts have benefited consumers in terms of lower prices, greater variety, and higher quality of products and services. Despite the value and impact of criminal antitrust cases, however, criminal antitrust investigations do not currently qualify for judicially approved wiretaps. While the Justice Department may engage in court-authorized searches of business records, it may only monitor phone calls of informants or the conversations of consenting parties.  The Antitrust Criminal Investigative Improvements Act of 2005 will add criminal price fixing and bid rigging to the many crimes that are already ``predicate offenses'' for wiretap purposes. More than 150 ``predicate offenses'' are currently included in Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act, including crimes of lesser impact and significance than criminal antitrust violations. In light of the seriousness of economic harms caused by violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act, the inability of the Justice Department to obtain wiretaps when investigating criminal antitrust violations makes little sense. Moreover, the evidence that can be acquired through wiretaps is precisely the type of evidence that is essential for the successful prosecution and prevention of serious antitrust violations. This bill equips the Department of Justice investigators and prosecutors to enforce zealously the criminal antitrust laws of the United States.                                 ______                                       By
