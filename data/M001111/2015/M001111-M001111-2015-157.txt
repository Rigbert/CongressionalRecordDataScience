 President, I think we all believe that in our country all students should have access to a quality public education regardless of where they live or how they learn or how much money they make. Education is one of the smartest investments we can make.  Chairman Alexander and I are working together on a bipartisan process to fix the broken No Child Left Behind law. I believe we are going to makeprogress in the coming weeks. I appreciate his working with me.  The fact is that this amendment is not needed. The common core was not mandated by the Federal Government. Race to the Top did not mandate adoption of common core. ESEA waivers have not mandated the common core. Federal law already prohibits the Federal Government from requiring States to adopt certain standards or curriculum.  By the way, this is a ``spending neutral'' reserve fund that I think we all should be aware of for the first time in this Republican budget.  For all of those reasons, I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment.
