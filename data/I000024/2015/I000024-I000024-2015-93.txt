There was opposition in our committee. I think a lot of the people on the committee were surprised when we passed it on a bipartisan basis. Then, of course, once it got down to the floor--this is going to have support from all corners.  Again, yes, it was a bipartisan effort. It is kind of rewarding to have that happen now and then. This is a good example.
