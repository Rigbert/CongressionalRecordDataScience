 Grassley, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Manchin, and Mr. Portman) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:                              S. Res. 261       Whereas over-the-counter and prescription medicines      approved by the Food and Drug Administration have been      determined to be safe and effective when used properly;       Whereas the abuse of such medicines can be extremely      dangerous and produce serious side effects;       Whereas according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health      Services Administration's 2010 National Survey on Drug Use      and Health, the nonmedical use of prescription drugs has      risen, with 2.5 percent of the population engaging in      nonmedical use of prescription drugs in 2008 and 2.8 percent      of the population engaging in such use in 2009;       Whereas the 2010 National Survey on Drug Use and Health      illustrates that the abuse of prescription medications such      as pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives      is second only to marijuana, the most commonly abused illegal      drug in the United States;       Whereas the 2010 Monitoring the Future survey, funded by      the National Institutes of Health, indicates that      approximately 5 percent of teenagers in the United States      report having abused an over-the-counter cough medicine to      get high, and prescription and over-the-counter drugs account      for 8 of the 14 most frequently abused drugs by students in      grade 12;       Whereas the 2010 Monitoring the Future survey also      indicates that the intentional abuse of cough medicine among      students in grades 8, 10, and 12 is at 3.2 percent, 5.1      percent, and 6.6 percent, respectively;       Whereas according to research from The Partnership at      DrugFree.org, more than one-third of teenagers mistakenly      believe that taking prescription drugs, even if not      prescribed by a doctor, is much safer than using street      drugs;       Whereas the lack of understanding by teenagers and parents      of the potential harm of such powerful medicines makes it      more critical than ever to raise public awareness about the      dangers of the abuse of such drugs;       Whereas when prescription drugs are abused, such drugs are      most often obtained through friends and relatives;       Whereas parents should be aware that the Internet gives      teenagers access to websites that promote the abuse of      medicines;       Whereas the designation of ``National Medicine Abuse      Awareness Month'' promotes the message that over-the-counter      and prescription medicines should be taken only as labeled or      prescribed, and such medicines can have serious or life-     threatening consequences when used to get high or in large      doses;       Whereas the designation of ``National Medicine Abuse      Awareness Month'' will encourage parents to educate      themselves about the problem of abuse of over-the-counter and      prescription medicines, and talk to their teens about all      types of substance abuse;       Whereas observance of ``National Medicine Abuse Awareness      Month'' should be encouraged at the national, State, and      local levels to increase awareness of the abuse of medicines;       Whereas educational tools, training programs, and      strategies have been developed by the national organization      that represents 5,000 anti-drug coalitions nationwide and the      association representing makers of over-the-counter      medicines, in order to help local coalitions demonstrate the      best ways to engage and educate parents and grandparents,      teachers, law enforcement officials, doctors, other      healthcare professionals, and retailers about the potential      harms of cough medicine abuse;       Whereas a partnership of nonprofit associations      specializing in raising media awareness about substance abuse      and organizations that represent the leading makers of over-     the-counter drugs have developed a nationwide prevention      campaign that utilizes research-based educational      advertisements, public relations and news media, and the      Internet to inform parents about the negative teen behavior      of intentional abuse of medicines, in order to empower      parents to effectively communicate with their children about      this dangerous trend and to take necessary steps to safeguard      prescription and over-the-counter medicines in their homes;      and       Whereas educating the public on the dangers of medicine      abuse and promoting prevention of medicine abuse are critical      components of what must be a multi-pronged effort to curb      prescription and over-the-counter medicine abuse: Now,      therefore, be it       Resolved, That the Senate--       (1) designates the month of October 2011 as ``National      Medicine Abuse Awareness Month''; and       (2) urges communities to carry out appropriate programs and      activities to educate parents and youth about the potential      dangers associated with medicine abuse.
