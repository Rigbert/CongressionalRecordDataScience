Madam Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.  First, let me say to the distinguished majority leader, I want to thank him for his leadership on a broad range of human rights issues. And I think it speaks volumes that the first trip as majority leader that you put together was to Darfur to try to promote peace and reconciliation. So I very much want to commend you for that.  I also thank you for your compliments to Frank Wolf and I; but I would add to that, when you talk about going to remote places, that also applies to you. I think Members should know that there were a number of trips that we undertook during the dark days of the Soviet Union when human rights were being crushed daily. I will never forget a trip we took to Lithuania, led by then Chairman Hoyer when Lansbergis, the President, was under siege, was literally surrounded by Soviet Black Berets. And we went there, to be a presence, to be a deterrent. Just prior to our arrival, more than a dozen people were murdered at TV tower, the gentleman will recall, but he nevertheless led our delegation to Vilnius and I do believe it had an impact in trying to mitigate further bloodshed. That's just one example. So I want to commend the distinguished majority leader for his leadership on Darfur.  Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to Ms. Sheila Jackson-Lee.  (
