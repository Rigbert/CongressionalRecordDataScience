 To give you an idea of how this issue has been distorted, it was stated by the administration that, in the event that we do adopt the lower standards for ozone and particulate matter, they said it would only cost $9 billion. Yet, last week, when we had Mary Nichols, the EPA's Assistant Secretary for Air, she stated that the cost would be $9.1 billion, a very uneven number, making us believe there is some scientific reason for that, when, in fact, the Reason Foundation, out in California, concluded, in its study, that the cost is not going to be $9.1 billion if we adopt these standards. Instead, they say it is going to be somewhere between $90 and $150 billion. In fact, the President's own Council of Economic Advisers put the cost at $60 billion for the ozone standard alone.  If we split the difference between the $90 and the $150 billion, that means that for a family of four on average income, it would cost them approximately $1,600 a year--$1,600 a year--to do something for which there is not adequate science to justify it. Second, the administration, in their scare tactics, back in November, said in the event we do not do this, it is going to result in 40,000 premature deaths a year. In December, they dropped that down to 20,000 premature deaths a year. In April, it came down to 15,000 premature deaths a year. Again, many groups now say it is less than 1,000.  It was kind of interesting, because when we had the people who are trying to claim the number of premature deaths that would be there if we did not lower these ozone and particulate matter standards, I described the death of my beloved mother-in-law, which took place on New Year's Day. She was 94 years old. It was one of those deaths that was a real blessing; the time was here. Yet, the circumstances under which she died would have qualified her, according to these so-called experts, to be counted as a premature death.  I think we have also been told things that are not true by the administration, when they say how many people are going to be affected. I have a chart here that we found by some accident, of the Southeastern part of the United States. This came out of the EPA. This is not my chart. What they are trying to say is only the counties, if we lower these standards, in the dark green would be affected in terms of having to come into compliance. Now we see these concentric circles around here covering more than half of this whole region, admitting at one point there would have to be some controls. They call this level 1 control region; level 2 control region--this would be level 2. In other words, the areas actually subject to some form of regulation under these new standards are much larger than people are sometimes being led to believe. So we are getting information that is certainly not consistent with the facts.  Another criticism I have with the administration is how they have tried to sell this idea by singling out certain people. Certainly the Presiding Officer, being from Kansas, and the former chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, understands that this would have a tremendous effect on the agricultural community throughout the United States. You would have Government saying when you can disk, when you can till, when you can burn off a field, when you can use fertilizers, when you can harvest a crop. I can tell you right now, if you ask the average farmer in America what his biggest problem is, it's not the taxes; it's the overregulation that takes away hisfreedoms. I have often said, every time you increase regulation, you take away a degree of individual freedoms. That is exactly what they have done.  So we have an administration which now says to the farmers, don't worry, we are going to exempt you; you are not going be affected by this. Then they went to the U.S. Conference of Mayors--and I have to say that I used to be the token conservative on the board of directors of the U.S. Conference of Mayors when I was mayor of Tulsa, OK. It's not really a conservative operation. Yet, they voted, in San Francisco, overwhelmingly, to reject these standards, and these are the mostly Democrats talking, not Republicans.  Why are they concerned about it? They are concerned about it because they know if we bring these standards down, those mayors are going to be running cities that will be out of attainment. This will be another, probably the most severe, of what they call the unfunded mandates that has been out there.  The administration also tried to single out small business, to say this is not going to affect small business. They even said that to one of the Congressmen from Louisiana: Well, you have seven parishes, but don't worry, we won't make you do anything, we'll get the people to the west so when the air flows over it is going to clean up your air. So it has been a very dishonest campaign by the administration. I really believe during the August recess we are going to be able to show the American people what this is really all about.  Last year we passed two significant laws. One is called SBREFA, the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Act--SBREFA. The thrust of this bill is you can't pass a new rule, a new regulation, unless you explain its effect on small business. So, during one of our committee meetings, we asked the Director of the EPA, ``Why is it that you have not explained what the effect of this will be on small business?'' The response was, ``There is no effect on small business.''  I can assure you, Mr. President, all these farms that are small businesses--I can assure you, any small business that has an electric bill, when they say this is going to increase the electric bills by somewhere between 8 and 10 percent, that's an impact on small business. The response of the EPA is, ``Wait a minute, all we are saying to the States is you have to come into attainment. You have to figure out how to do it. And whatever you do to your citizens to make that happen is your responsibility. So we--the EPA--are not the ones saying we are imposing a hardship.''  We passed another bill, the unfunded mandates bill, that says we cannot pass regulations here that result in an unfunded mandate to political subdivisions below the Federal Government. Consequently, I can assure you, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the National Association of Governors, and the National Association of State Legislators, the National League of Cities and all these groups that are so concerned about this, they know exactly what an unfunded mandate is.  I anticipate, when the time comes that these standards are put into effect, or set, that there are going to be some lawsuits. I think the American Truckers Association already stated they are going to be suing the EPA. So my concern is, with all these lawsuits that will take place, that we resolve this issue to some satisfaction now, before we get locked in endless litigation. the best way to avoid this happening, the best way to avoid these arbitrary, onerous, and unjustified regulations, would be to go ahead and pass this legislation, which is S. 1084.  I believe S. 1084 and H.R. 1984 will be passed, and I think they will be passed with a large enough margin to sustain a veto.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.                          ____________________
