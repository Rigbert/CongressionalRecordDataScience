 President, today Tunisia celebrates the 42nd Anniversary of its Independence from France. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate them for their many successful endeavors of the past 42 years.  Last year, Tunisia and the U.S. celebrated the bicentennial of the ``Treaty of Peace and Friendship.'' This celebration marked the longest unbroken friendship treaty in the history of the two countries. Throughout our long relationship the United States and Tunisia have experienced cooperation based on respect and our mutual commitment to freedom, democracy, and the peaceful resolution of conflict.  Despite its location in a very volatile area of the world, Tunisia has been a leader in promoting stability and peace in Africa and the Middle East. It has been a voice of moderation in the Arab-Israeli peace process promoting dialogue and improved relations. It was the first Arab State to host an Israeli delegation and to hold a multilateral meeting of the peace process. In 1996, Tunisia and Israel opened interest sections in each country and established full diplomatic relations.  Tunisia also has made impressive economic strides. It has successfully graduated from development assistance to become a self-sufficient nation. The people of Tunisia enjoy the highest standard of living in the region. These improvements have come about through the devotion of vital resources to the promotion of its people, education, and economic reform.  In the past 12 years, the government has focused its economic development on privatizing many of the state-owned companies and reforming the financial and banking systems. As a result, Tunisians have developed a diverse and market oriented economy where they have experienced not only domestic success but increased international standing. Tunisia is a member of the World Trade Organization and enjoys duty-free access to the European Union and most Arab countries.  Tunisia has been a friend and ally to the United States for many years. I look forward to continued cooperation and friendship in the years to come. As Tunisia celebrates its 42nd anniversary of independence, I offer my sincere congratulations on their many successful accomplishments.                          ____________________
