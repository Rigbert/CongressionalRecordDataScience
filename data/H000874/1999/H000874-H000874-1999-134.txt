Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Before the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Portman) leaves the floor, I want to again make the comment that he has done some extraordinary work, positive work, helpful work on this entire issue. He is of course from the authorizing committee, the Committee on Ways and Means, a senior member of the Committee on Ways and Means. I appreciate his remarks. Because this is not a partisan issue.
