Chairman, I would simply follow up on the colloquy that the gentlewoman from California and the gentleman from Alabama had and would note that the committee directs the Secretary to report back by September 1 of this year in anticipation of the conference. So I do appreciate the chairman's cooperation.  Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Sabo).
