Speaker, I rise in opposition to this bill, and I will speak later on some of the other parts.  I want to talk about the ``abouts'' stuff that is reauthorized in this bill after the NSA itself stopped doing it earlier last year.  What ``abouts'' collection means is that, for example, if you have two jihadists that are in Pakistan and are communicating with each other that they didn't like something that Mr. Nadler said against jihadists, the FBI can pick up the name ``Nadler'' and go into all of his emails, all of his texts, all of the information that they have on him and be able to see what Mr. Nadler had said about jihadists and much, much more. That is why this bill opens the door to something that the NSA has closed itself.  We will hear from people who support ``abouts'' collection that Congress has got a chance to review it. They give us 30 days to do it. We can't get anything done in 30 days.  Vote ``no'' on the bill.
