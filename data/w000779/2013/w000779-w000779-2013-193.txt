President, before he leaves the floor, let me commend my colleague from Minnesota for making so many thoughtful points in this effort to deal with climate change. Having returned from Oregon, with a whole host of meetings in connection with Earth Day, the Senator is spot-on in speaking about the enormity of the problem. It is very clear that the planet is getting warmer, drought is becoming more serious, the fires are becoming more catastrophic and the storms increasingly brutal. It is very clear that now Democrats and Republicans must come together around this issue.  The Senator and I serve together on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. This will be priority business for us, and his thoughtful remarks today are yet another effort in terms of trying to bring people together. The focus of the Senator's remarks has been not to say it is this person's fault or another person's fault, it is about how Democrats and Republicans need to come together.  I commend my Democratic colleague for his good speech and the good fortune to chair the subcommittee on Energy and Natural Resources, where he will be able to focus on these issues.  I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in morning business for up to 30 minutes.
