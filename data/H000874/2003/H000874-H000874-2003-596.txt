Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Mr. Edward D. Casey on his retirement from the Capital-Gazette Newspapers, and his election to the Maryland press association's hall of fame. I would also like to thank him for his years of service to our community.  For 30 years, Mr. Casey has been the editorial voice of the Capital. In March when he is officially inducted, he will join 35 other outstanding newspaper men and women who have been similarly honored over the years by the Maryland-Delaware-D.C. Press Association.  Mr. Casey is respected throughout Maryland for being a pioneer and effective advocate for the freedom of information project, especially during his service as president of the Maryland-Delaware-D.C. Press Association.  Prior to joining the Capital, Mr. Casey was editor of the Daily Advance in Dover, NJ for six years. He began working in newspapers as a sports editor in 1957 at the Binghamton Press in New York. He also worked as a sports editor for the Endicott Bulletin in New York and managing editor of the Binghamton Sun-Bulletin.  I congratulate Mr. Casey in his retirement, and I wish him every success in his future endeavors.                          ____________________
