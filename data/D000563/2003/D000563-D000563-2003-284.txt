President, let me just say that we can argue for some time as to whether this is a guaranteed entitlement. This much I can guarantee you. In a nation where 40 million people rely on Social Security for their checks, and where their families rely on receiving them, trust me; the people who are elected to this Chamber and the House of Representatives will be responsive to guaranteeing the future of Social Security. There is much less political risk when it comes to the future of Social Security than there is market risk when you decide that you are going to take a chunk of your savings and hope that you happen to retire at the right moment when the stock market is on the up tick rather than the down tick. The market risk is far greater than the political risk.  We might be able to suspend the rules of political science in this debate. We certainly cannot suspend logic, common sense, and mathematics.  If you wonder why this Nation is in deficit, listen to the argument on the other side. They will allow workers to opt out of Social Security and go into personal accounts and argue here calling this demagoguery when we raise the question that even if these workers opt out, that did not endanger Social Security. That doesn't add up. Once the workers opt out, there is not enough money to make current payments to retirees. They cannot explain to you how they will make up the difference. That is the problem--if we are going to maintain benefits, make it voluntary and not penalize current Social Security retirees. You have to explain to us how we make up the difference.
