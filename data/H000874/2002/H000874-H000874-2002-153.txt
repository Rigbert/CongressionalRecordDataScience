Speaker, I thank my friend, the gentlewoman from Hawaii, who is one of the senior Members of this House and who has seen, I think, over time, the development of title IX, the enactment of title IX, and the impact that title IX has had.  I certainly associate myself with her remarks, that while we are obviously pleased at the progress that has been made, we ought not to believe that everything that can be done or should be done has been done.  Mr. Speaker, this month, as we have said, marks the 30th anniversary of title IX of the Education Act Amendments of 1972. This legislation prohibits sex discrimination in educational institutions that receive Federal funds. It has been instrumental, in my opinion, in helping women get into educational programs where they had previously been underrepresented, such as the math and sciences. It has helped to encourage women to break job barriers and obtain careers, such as engineers, doctors and mathematicians, which in turn has diversified our workforce and infused our society with an energy and potential that had not been tapped for centuries.  It is really incredible, when we think of this country and we think of how we excluded on the basis of gender so many talented people. I am the father of three daughters. I have one grandson, but I have three daughters. And the concept that these incredibly talented, energetic people would have been excluded based upon their gender is despicable. We have come a long way in this country not only on gender but on race, ethnicity, and national origin. Title IX was a tremendous contributor to that progress.  Perhaps the biggest achievement of title IX is the fact that it has leveled the playing field for men and women in sports. It mandates equal treatment for playing opportunities, access to athletic scholarships, equipment, facilities, and coaching. The numbers paint a powerful portrait. In the 30 years since title IX, the number of girls participating in high school sports has skyrocketed from 200,000 to almost 3 million, an 800 percent-plus increase. At the intercollegiate level, the number of participants is five times greater than before title IX was enacted.  The best athletic team that we had participate in the Summer Olympics in Rome was the girls softball team. Those young women were the best in the world. Watching women's basketball now, and the Mystics are doing very well, as the gentlewoman may know, in Washington. I think we have won six or seven straight, the best start we have had in the Women's Professional Basketball Association. I am old enough, I hate to admit, to remember the women's basketball game when there were three full courts and three back courts, as if women could not run from one end of the court to the other end of the court. It was one of the dullest games I have ever seen. And not only was it dull for the spectators, it was dull for the players. Now, of course, we see the incredible athleticism the women display in playing basketball, clearly, frankly, as good as the men. The difference being the men are bigger and, therefore, with a 10-foot basket, have an advantage.  But what an appropriate thing it was to say we are going to treat people based upon, as Martin Luther King said, the content of their character or the abilities that they have.                              {time}  1600  We said that in the Disabilities Act. We said it in title IX, how important it is for us to continually emphasize it is what people can do that we need to focus on, not their gender or race or disability, not some arbitrary and mostly capricious distinction that we draw.  Clearly, the dated stereotype that women are not interested in athletics has been shattered as the door of opportunity continues to open.  Just think of Venus and Serena, two extraordinary sisters, the two best tennis players in the world, the Williams sisters. Clearly there is not a man on this floor, period, that would want to play them with any consequence to losing because we clearly would lose badly.  Title IX has allowed the desires and passions of millions of women to be realized. They participate in sports. They enjoy sports. They succeed in competitive sports.  My oldest daughter played 4 years of varsity basketball in high school in theCatholic Girls League here in Washington, D.C., which is an extraordinarily good league.  Competitive athletics have increased the academic success of young women and make it less likely that they will become involved with alcohol and drug abuse. The emotional and physical benefits women and girls gain from participation are invaluable. We know that physical participation is important, not only for your physical but also your mental capacities.  At a time when many young women become critical of their appearance and grapple with eating disorders and low self-esteem, sports helps young women develop confidence and a positive body image. In the long term, athletic activities decrease a woman's chance of developing heart disease and breast cancer. So it is truly extraordinarily helpful.  Mia Hamm, and what an extraordinary athlete she is, the captain of the U.S. soccer team, which won the 1999 Women's World Cup, once stated, ``What I love about soccer is the way it makes me feel about myself. It makes me feel that I can contribute.'' She is part of the daughters of title IX who have paved a path for millions of female athletes to follow. Her statement hits the nail right on the head, as it highlights the self-confidence and teamwork skills sports helped to develop and define.  Title IX is, of course, not without its critics, but I think for the most part they are misguided. They blame title IX for eliminating some men's minor sports, but the reality is title IX provides institutions with the flexibility to determine how to provide equity for their students.  A March 2001 GAO study found that 72 percent of colleges and universities that added women's teams did so without cutting any men's teams. In fact, men's overall intercollegiate athletic participation has risen since the passage of title IX. This truly was a win/win situation for men as well as and particularly for women.  Part of the problem lies with the larger of the men's sports, such as football and basketball, which consume a majority of men's total athletic budget. The complaint to be brought against title IX is that it does not go far enough, that the advancement for women in education and athletics, no matter how positive, must go further.  As part of today's celebration of title IX, I would like to recognize Dr. Deborah A. Yow, the athletic director for the University of Maryland. I have told this story before, and I am not sure if the gentlewoman from Hawaii (Mrs. Mink) or the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lofgren) have heard this story. The gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Coble) is a crusty, conservative Member of the House of Representatives; a wonderful human being, a good-hearted human being, but not one that I perceive in the forefront of feminism in America, and I say that affectionately.  He knows full well that I am closely associated with the University of Maryland. He came up and said, you know what, you have got a woman you ought to hire at the University of Maryland. She is a friend of mine, Deborah Yow, and is under consideration to be the athletic director at the University of Maryland.  Now, at that point in time there were no women athletic directors at the level 1-A schools. But the fact that the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Coble) came up to me and said Deborah Yow could do that job, I went back to my office and picked up the phone and called the then-president of the University of Maryland, who is now our new chancellor of our system, and told him, Britt, I have just talked to a person, this Deborah Yow must be extraordinary. Shortly thereafter, Deborah Yow was hired. She is now the athletic director, and of course we finished 10-1 in football and won the national basketball championship, under a woman athletic director. Those were men's teams; and we have won numerous championships in lacrosse and field hockey for our women's teams.  Her sister is a major athletic leader in our country as well. Her outstanding career achievements serve to exemplify the important contributions made by women in the athletic arena, as well as to our entire society.  In a male-dominated profession, 91.6 percent of athletic directors in Division I universities being men, Debbie has not only met the challenges of her profession, but she has raised the bar for all. Under Debbie's leadership, the Terrapins ranked nationally as one of the top 20 athletic programs in the country, according to U.S. News and World Report. The University of Maryland under her leadership has established an incredibly strong athletic program with exemplary student athletes, coaches and administrators.  Mr. Speaker, in closing, let me thank the gentlewoman from Hawaii (Mrs. Mink) for focusing on this historic event. In 1972, when the Congress and the country said we are going to make sure that everybody, irrespective of gender, can participate equally and achieve to the extent of their character and their ability, we made a statement and adopted a policy that has made America a better country.
