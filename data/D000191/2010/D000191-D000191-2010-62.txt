 You can't have a free market economy when people can collude, when they can get together to limit markets and competition, when companies become so huge they dominate urban areas and entire States; one company. Consumers have virtually no choice in much of America. They have to eat those huge rate increases or not. We can take a meaningful step here today to bring down the cost of health insurance for all Americans. The Consumer Federation of America says this will save consumers $10 billion next year, and they say that's nothing. Well, say that to your consumers at home if you vote against this bill.  Creating these loopholes undermines the entire effort here today. We do not need these loopholes. We need this industry to play by the same rules as every other industry in America.  Vote against the motion to recommit, and vote for competition and consumer protection for all Americans in health insurance.  With that, I yield back the balance of my time.
