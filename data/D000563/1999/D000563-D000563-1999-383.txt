Yes, many years ago when we were on the Budget Committee in the House, we worked together on medical research and dramatically increased the amount of money for it. It was one of the prouder moments serving on Capitol Hill. I have found, as I have gone across Illinois and around the country, that virtually every American family agrees this is an appropriate thing for the Federal Government to do--initiate and sponsor medical research.  A family never feels more helpless than when a disease or illness strikes somebody they love. They pray to God that the person will survive, and that they can find the best doctors. In the back of their minds they are hoping and praying that somewhere somebody is developing a drug or some treatment that can make a difference. And that ``somewhere,'' many times, is the National Institutes of Health in Washington, DC, in the Maryland suburbs nearby.  If we take the Republican approach of cutting dramatically the Federal budget in years to come for a tax break for wealthy people, we jeopardize the possibility that the NIH will have money for this medical research. That is so shortsighted.  It is not only expensive to continue to provide medical care to diseased or ill people, but, frankly, it is inhumane to turn our backs on the fact that so many families need a helping hand. I sincerely hope before this debate ends, we are able to bring Republicans around to the point of view that when we talk about spending on the Democratic side, it is for the basics--transportation, fighting crime, helping education, and medical research. I would take that out for a referendum across this land. I think that is the sensible way to go.  I yield the remainder of my time.
