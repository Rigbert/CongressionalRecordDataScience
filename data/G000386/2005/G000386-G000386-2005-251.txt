 President, tomorrow we will resume consideration of the tax relief reconciliation bill with 10 hours of debate remaining under the agreement just reached. We have a lot of work to do on this bill and on other must-do legislative items before we adjourn for the Thanksgiving holiday. Senators should be ready for late nights with many votes. Before we leave this week, we will need to act on the tax relief bill, as well as appropriations conference reports, the PATRIOT Act conference report, and another short-term continuing resolution. The majority leader has asked Senators to remain flexible in that a weekend session is very likely.                          ____________________
