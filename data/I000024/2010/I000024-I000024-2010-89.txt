I know my friend from Vermont would not intentionally say something that is not true. Sometimes he does not have and sometimes I do not have the actual facts, so inadvertently we might misrepresent.  Let me just say as far as Exxon is concerned that from 2004 to 2008, they paid more than $18 billion in U.S. Federal income taxes, and that is just some of the taxes they pay.  I have to say this, though. The whole discussion on this--the Sanders bill would effectively put the small and the marginal producers in America out of business. Before I go into that in any detail, let me just share this. It is interesting, when I listen to liberals talk about doing away with drilling, with oil and gas and coal and nuclear--if you do that, you cannot run this machine called America. Every time they talk about doing something to stop production, as they are doing right now in the gulf--a lot of these people are using and exploiting the tragedy in the gulf to try to retard or stop all production in America. Consequently, this is something where we would be in a position where we would be so rationed in oil and gas that we would have to be more dependent on many of these countries on which we do not want to be dependent.  We did a study. I think this would surprise the Chair. If we didn't have any political restrictions on what we could do in North America, we could completely eliminate our reliance upon the Middle East for any gas or oil within 4 years. That is pretty shocking. Our problem is not that we do not have enough oil and gas. We have more reserves than any other country. A CRS report came out with that just the other day.  What I want to do is give my honorable friend a chance to respond to my statement, and then I will reserve the remainder of my time to discuss in a little more detail how this affects the very small, marginal operators in America.
