Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of this amendment and commend the gentlewoman from New York [Mrs. Lowey], and the gentleman from Virginia [Mr. Wolf], for their leadership in proposing this amendment. Indeed, I attempted to offer a similar amendment to H.R. 1561, the Foreign Aid Authorization bill, but as my colleague from New Jersey explained, because of this construction of the rule, I was effectively prevented from doing this.  In 1992, my former colleague from Rhode Island, Mr. Machtley, offered successfully an amendment to cut training for funding for the training of Indonesia military in response to flagrant abuses of human rights in East Timor. When Congress cut this money, it send two strong messages: First, to the Government of Indonesia that the U.S. will not tolerate any more human rights abuses by the military in East Timor, and, second, to the East Timorese, who were finally given hope that someone had listened to their call for help and provided them a voice in the face of oppression.  Today we are debating a bill which effectively restores this money. That might be appropriate if the conditions in East Timor had improved, but in fact they have not.  I would like to emphasize that this amendment is not about the efficacy of American military training and the value of exposing foreign military personnel to our professional military instruction. No, this is about sending a strong signal concerning the abuse of human rights in East Timor.  In June and July of last year, Indonesian troops committed acts of sacrilege against the East Timorese church and clergy. The courts are still sentencing people to long prison terms for speaking to journalists or sending information critical of the government. On January 12 of this year, Indonesian soldiers killed six men outside Dili. These six civilians were shot in retaliation for a guerrilla attack the day before, but sources present indicate that the six were never involved in the attack.  At a joint hearing before the International Relations Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific and International Operations and Human Rights on March 16, the Director of the Human Rights Watch stated, ``In East Timor, violations of fundamental rights have been especially severe, and have worsened dramatically since the APEC summit meeting in Djakarta last November.''  When we are cutting aid to Africa and are cutting many, many worthy programs, it seems incongruous we would be giving money in the face of these human rights abuses.  I would urge my colleagues to accept the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from New York [Mrs. Lowey]. I would urge them to send a strong signal to the Government of Indonesia that we will not tolerate further human rights abuses in East Timor.  A headline in the New York Times in November of last year stated, ``Timorese worry world will now forget them.'' Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues not to forget them, to stick to the precedent we have now established. We have taken a stand. We can make a difference. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support the Lowey-Wolf amendment.                              {time}  1945
