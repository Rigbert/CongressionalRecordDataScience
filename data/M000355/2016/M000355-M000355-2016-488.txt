 President, one thing my good friend the Democratic leader always used to remind me of when he was the majority leader is the majority leader always gets the last word. So I will take advantage of that tonight.  For anyone who may still be watching C-SPAN 2 at this late hour, let me suggest the Democratic Party ought to be renamed the ``dysfunction party.'' When they were in the majority they didn't function and when they are in the minority they do not function.  Let's just take a look at the last couple of weeks. A Zika MILCON bill goes through here with every Democrat supporting it, and then all of a sudden they do not like it. A CARA bill goes through here with not a single Democrat opposing it, and then they refuse to sign the conference report. And now what the Democratic leader is saying is that the Republican Senate needs to guarantee what the democratic House will do as a condition for passing a bill through the Senate that every single Democrat on the Committee on Appropriations supported. It came out of committee unanimously.  This is the definition of dysfunction. So, apparently, what we will witness here shortly is our Democratic friends, all of whom on the committee supported the bill, preventing us from taking it up because they want us to get a guarantee from the House as to what the House result will be. That is not the way it works. The way you pass a law is the Senate passes a bill, the House passes a bill, and you negotiate with each other and with the administration.  So the hour is late and the die seems to be cast. It is my understanding that when I yield the floor, we will be going to a vote; is that correct, Mr. President?
