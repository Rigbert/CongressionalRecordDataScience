He said: When you look at this budget and you project what this administration and this budget are headed to, it is the concentration of wealth and power in America, the breakdown of our effort to enlarge the middle class in America and, frankly, to accept--sadly--the reality of the haves and have-nots, the disparity in income.  We don't find in this budget an effort to lower the ladder to allow people to come climbing up, as your parents and my parents and we did in our own lives.
