 Gregory Jaczko. As I said yesterday, I am not surprised by Jaczko's resignation. Even Democrats on the Commission testified before Congress that his inappropriate conduct as chairman resulted in a hostile work environment for women and threatened to undermine the mission of the NRC itself. But what should surprise us all, is how this administration could remain silent for more than a year after the allegations of Jaczko's offensive behavior first surfaced.  Jaczko's alleged behavior is unacceptable in any workplace.
