 And I think the point that has to be made over and over again is that at a time when America, for working people, is becoming a poorer and poorer country, at a time when the gap between the rich and the poor is growing wider, when so many middle-income people need help, what an absurdity, what an outrage that the U.S. Government today, the President and leaders of Congress are proposing not to stand with middle income people, not to stand with the poor or the working people, but they are going to provide $40 billion of loan guarantees to very, very profitable Wall Street investors.  And if that does not tell you who controls the U.S. Congress, then I think you may never know it.  I would hope very much that we can turn this process about.  I think, I say to the gentlewoman from Ohio [Ms. Kaptur], it is going to come to the floor next week?
