Mr. Speaker, owning a home is part of the American dream. But it can become a nightmare when homeowners face foreclosure. In Metro Atlanta we have one of the highest foreclosure rates in the country--one in every 54 households is in foreclosure.  Too often these are people who have lost their jobs or are dealing with an illness. They have lost their home, they are out of money and they are suffering. They should not be hit with a huge tax bill from the IRS.  Cancelled debt is not income, and treating it like a paycheck adds insult to injury. Today we change the tax code to protect people who are losing their home from also having to pay a large tax penalty.  It is the right thing to do and I encourage my colleagues to support this bill.  The material previously referred to by Mr. Lincoln Diaz-Balart of Florida is as follows: Amendment to H. Res. 703 Offered by Mr. Lincoln Diaz-Balart of Florida       At the end of the resolution, add the following:       Sec. 3. That immediately upon the adoption of this      resolution the House shall, without intervention of any point      of order, consider the resolution (H. Res. 479) to amend the      Rules of the House of Representatives to provide for      enforcement of clause 9 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House      of Representatives. The resolution shall be considered as      read. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on      the resolution to final adoption without intervening motion      or demand for division of the question except: (1) one hour      of debate equally divided and controlled by the chairman and      ranking minority member of the Committee on Rules; and (2)      one motion to recommit.                                  ____       (The information contained herein was provided by      Democratic Minority on multiple occasions throughout the      109th Congress.)        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous      question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.      A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote      against the Democratic majority agenda and a vote to allow      the opposition, at least for the moment, to offer an      alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be      debating.       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of      Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the      previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or      control the consideration of the subject before the House      being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous      question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the      subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling      of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the      House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes      the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to      offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the      majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated      the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to      a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to      recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:      ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman      from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to      yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first      recognition.''       Because the vote today may look bad for the Democratic      majority they will say ``the vote on the previous question is      simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on      adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no substantive      legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' But that is      not what they have always said. Listen to the definition of      the previous question used in the Floor Procedures Manual      published by the Rules Committee in the 109th Congress, (page      56). Here's how the Rules Committee described the rule using      information from Congressional Quarterly's ``American      Congressional Dictionary'': ``If the previous question is      defeated, control of debate shifts to the leading opposition      member (usually the minority Floor Manager) who then manages      an hour of debate and may offer a germane amendment to the      pending business.''       Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives,      the subchapter titled ``Amending Special Rules'' states: ``a      refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a      special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the      resolution to amendment and further debate.'' (Chapter 21,      section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: Upon rejection of the      motion for the previous question on a resolution reported      from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member      leading the opposition to the previous question, who may      offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time      for debate thereon.''       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does      have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only      available tools for those who oppose the Democratic      majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the      opportunity to offer an alternative plan.
