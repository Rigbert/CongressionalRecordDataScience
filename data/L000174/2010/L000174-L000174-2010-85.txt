Presdient, today the Senate will pass sensible legislation with practical benefits for U.S. military veterans. The bill I have offered will add military veterans to the list of groups eligible to receive excess property donations from the Federal Government. This bill is a bipartisan effort to recognize the sacrifices that members of our Armed Forces make every day for our country, and I am proud to be its author. While it is only a small token of appreciation, this legislation gives back to veterans groups by allowing them access to a large inventory of goods from which they could not otherwise benefit. I appreciate the Senate acting swiftly to consider this bill.  The FOR VETS Act enables military veterans to receive surplus goods donations through the Federal Government's property distribution program. The types of goods donated through this program include computers, trucks, snowmobiles, home appliances and electronics. These items will be of valuable use to our military veterans, and I am pleased to sponsor legislation that gives them the right to claim useful goods through this program. The FOR VETS Act is legislation for and about American veterans.  The Administrator of General Services oversees this ongoing property liquidation and distribution program, which currently donates property to medical institutions, providers of assistance to the homeless, universities, and child care facilities, among others. Given the surplus of available goods, military veterans' groups are simply being added into this pool of recipients for property that might otherwise go unused.  I thank the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee ranking member, Senator Collins, for working with me on this bill. This was a bipartisan effort, as legislation to support our veterans should always be, and I look forward to its prompt consideration by the House, and to the President signing it into law.
