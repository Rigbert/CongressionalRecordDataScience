The preamble was agreed to.  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:                               S. Res. 38       Whereas on January 30, 2005, Iraq held its first democratic      elections in nearly half a century;       Whereas after more than 3 decades of enduring harsh      repression and lack of freedom, millions cast ballots on      January 30, 2005, to determine the future of their country in      an election widely recognized as a success by the      international community;       Whereas the hard work, contributions, vision, and      sacrifices of the Interim Iraqi Government in undertaking      major political, economic, social, and legal reforms and, in      conjunction with the efforts of the Iraqi Independent      Electoral Commission, in ensuring that Iraq held nationwide      elections on January 30, and in not being intimidated by      terrorist and insurgent forces resulted in the successful      elections of January 30;       Whereas on January 30, President George W. Bush stated that      the election in Iraq was a ``milestone'' in Iraq's history      and that the ``world is hearing the voice of freedom from the      center of the Middle East'';       Whereas the January 30 election is another step in the      process of developing a free and democratic Iraq;       Whereas the people of Iraq cast votes to freely choose the      275-member Transitional National Assembly that will serve as      the national legislature of Iraq for a transition period,      name a Presidency Council, and select a Prime Minister;       Whereas the Transitional National Assembly will draft the      permanent constitution of Iraq;       Whereas the election establishes a credible process for      governing Iraq under a mandate from the majority of the      people of Iraq for a new Iraq in which all communities are      represented, minority rights are respected, and violence is      not tolerated;       Whereas an estimated 14,300,000 Iraqis were registered to      vote at more than 5,000 polling stations across Iraq and in      14 other countries;       Whereas, with 256 political entities composed of 18,900      Iraqi candidates standing for election in 20 different      elections (the national election, 18 provincial elections,      and Kurdistan Regional government election), voter turnout      demonstrated widespread enthusiasm for self-determination;       Whereas Iraqi security forces joined with United States and      Coalition forces in providing security for the elections;       Whereas despite these efforts, many Sunni Iraqis in some      provinces did not vote because of fear and intimidation;       Whereas the United Nations Electoral Assistance Division      and other nongovernmental organizations provided technical      support and assistance to the Independent Electoral      Commission of Iraq and the Iraqi Interim Government;       Whereas the people of Iraq will again exercise their      popular will through a national referendum in October 2005,      when the Transitional National Assembly presents a draft      constitution for Iraq;       Whereas national elections based on that constitution are      then to be held in December 2005 to choose an Iraqi      government in a manner prescribed by the constitution;       Whereas it is in the interest of Iraq, the Middle East, the      United States, and the international community that Iraq      successfully transitions to a functioning democratic state,      as this may serve as a catalyst for peace and stability in      the region; and       Whereas the Iraqi government needs assistance from the      broader international community to further develop governing      capacity, train effective security forces who can defeat the      terrorists and insurgents and maintain law and order, improve      economic conditions, and maintain essential services, such as      the delivery of electricity, gasoline, and water: Now,      therefore, be it       Resolved, That the Senate--       (1) commends the people of Iraq on the successful      nationwide elections held in Iraq on January 30, 2005, and      recognizes the elections as another step in developing a free      and democratic Iraq;       (2) recognizes the desire for freedom and liberty of all      individuals who served as candidates, campaign workers,      United Nations and Iraqi election officials, and voters in      the January 30, 2005, elections in Iraq and congratulates the      new members of the Transitional National Assembly and the      leaders of the provincial and regional governments;       (3) urges the new leadership of Iraq to move forward with      drafting the constitution, upholding the law, and holding a      referendum on the new constitution in October 2005;       (4) encourages participation of all groups and communities      in the drafting of a new constitution and the formation of a      permanent government for Iraq;       (5) recognizes and honors the sacrifices made for freedom      and liberty in Iraq by the people of Iraq;       (6) commends the Iraqi security forces, and the U.S. armed      forces and Coalition forces, who ensured the elections could      be conducted in a relatively safe, secure, and credible      manner;       (7) condemns and deplores all acts of violence and      intimidation against the people of Iraq by members of the      former Iraqi regime, insurgents, and other extremists and      terrorists;       (8) supports the establishment of a fully democratic Iraqi      government that respects the rule of law, promotes ethnic and      religious tolerance, respects the rights of women and all      minorities, provides security and stability for the people of      Iraq, and has the capacity to maintain basic services such as      the delivery of sufficient electricity, gasoline, and water;       (9) believes that it is in the interest of the people of      Iraq, the Middle East, the United States, and the      international community that Iraq transitions to a fully      democratic state, and that doing so may serve as a catalyst      for peace and stability in the region;       (10) calls on the international community, particularly      Arab states, countries with predominantly Muslim populations,      and all North Atlantic Treaty Organization member states, to      provide military and police personnel to train and assist      Iraqi security forces and to otherwise assist in the      political and economic development of Iraq;       (11) encourages the newly-elected transitional government      of Iraq to ensure that all Iraqis, including members of the      Sunni religious community, are represented in the      Constitution-writing process and in the new Iraqi cabinet to      improve the prospects for national unity and consensus; and       (12) looks forward to welcoming Iraq into the world      community of democratic nations.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and to lay that motion on the table.  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.                          ____________________
