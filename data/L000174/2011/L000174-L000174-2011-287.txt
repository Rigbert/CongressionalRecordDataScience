President, I support the confirmation of David S. Cohen to be Undersecretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Crimes. Mr. Cohen previously served as the Assistant Secretary for Terrorist Financing, and has previously served in the Department of the Treasury's General Counsel's Office. His strong record of service is commendable and his expertise will serve him well in this new role.  Mr. Cohen's nomination has been carefully considered by the Committee on Finance and the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, both of which favorably reported the nomination of Mr. Cohen to the full Senate.  The Committee on the Judiciary has jurisdiction over some of the crimes that Mr. Cohen will fight in his new role at the Department, both at the international and domestic level. I appreciate Mr. Cohen's commitment to me that he will make himself available to the Committee on the Judiciary for hearings and activities within the committee's legislative and oversight jurisdiction that overlap with the Undersecretary's responsibilities. As the committee considers terrorism financing, material support for terrorism, and money laundering, among other topics, I look forward to working with Mr. Cohen.                          ____________________
