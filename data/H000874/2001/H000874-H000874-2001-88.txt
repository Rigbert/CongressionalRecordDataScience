Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Moran), who has been so focused on the needs of Federal employees, and their pay and benefits; he has been extraordinarily helpful in years past and this year in fashioning a bill to ensure that Federal civilian employees are treated fairly and that we have the ability to not only retain our excellent public employees, but also to recruit, to fill the vacancies that will occur in increasing numbers in the years ahead.
