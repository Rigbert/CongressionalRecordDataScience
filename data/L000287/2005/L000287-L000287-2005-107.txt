Mr. Speaker, not so long ago, 40 years ago, in many parts of the American South, it was almost impossible for people of color to register to vote. Just 40 years ago, people of color had to pay a poll tax and pass a so-called literacy test in some States in the South. There were black men and women who were professors in colleges and universities, black lawyers and black doctors who were told that they could not read or write well enough to register to vote. People were turned away from the courthouse when they attempted to register. Some were jailed.  Forty years ago, on March 7, 1965, about 600 black men and women, and a few young children attempted to peacefully march from Selma, Al, to Montgomery, to the State Capital, to dramatize to the world that people of color wanted to register to vote. And the world watched as we were met with night sticks, bull whips; we were trampled by horses and tear gassed.  Eight days after what became known as Bloody Sunday, President Johnson came to this very Chamber and spoke to a joint session of Congress. He started off that speech on March 15, 1965 by saying: ``I speak tonight for the dignity of man and for the destiny of democracy.'' President Johnson went on to say: ``At times, history and fate come together to shape a turning point in a man's unending search for freedom. So it was more than a century ago at Lexington and at Concord. So it was at Appomattox. So it was last week in Selma, Alabama.''  And during that speech, 40 years ago, President Johnson condemned the violence in Selma, and called on Congress to enact the Voting Rights Act. Echoing the words of the civil rights movement, he closed his speech by saying ``And we shall overcome.''  Forty years ago, Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, and on August 6, 1965, it was signed into law.  Because of the action of Congress and the leadership of a President and the courage of hundreds and thousands of our citizens, we have witnessed a nonviolent revolution in America, a resolution of values, a revolution of ideas. The passage of the Voting Rights Act helped expand our democracy and open up our democracy to let in millions of our citizens.  We still need to keep the voting rights act strong. The Voting Rights Act must be reauthorized. Not just reauthorized, it must be renewed and strengthened. The vote is the most powerful, nonviolent tool that our citizens have in a democratic society, and nothing, but nothing, should interfere with the right of every citizen to vote and have their vote count.  Mr. Speaker, the history of the right to vote in America is a history of conflict, of struggling for the right to vote. Many people died trying to protect that right.  For millions like me, the struggle for the right to vote is not mere history; it is experience. The experience of minorities today tells us that the struggle is not over and that the special provisions of the Voting Rights Act are still necessary.  I am proud to be the sponsor of H. Con. Res. 216, a resolution commemorating the 40th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act, which I introduced with my colleagues from the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Sensenbrenner, Mr. Conyers, Mr. Chabot and Mr. Nadler. In that resolution, we pledge to ``advance the legacy of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 by ensuring the continued effectiveness of the Act to protect the voting rights of all Americans.''  I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to protect the voting rights of all Americans.  Today we celebrate how far we have come. We celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act.                          ____________________
