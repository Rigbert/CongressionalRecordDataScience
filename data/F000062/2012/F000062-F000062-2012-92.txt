 President, I rise today to introduce legislation, with Senators Blumenthal, Brown, Cantwell, Merkley, Vitter, and Wyden, that will codify an agreement reached by the nation's largest egg producer organization, the United Egg Producers, and the largest animal welfare organization, the Humane Society of the United States.  In its most simple terms, the legislation sets a national standard for the treatment of egg-laying hens and the labeling of eggs.  As of today, 6 States, including California, have set their own standards about how egg-laying hens should be raised, and 18 other States allow citizen ballot initiatives could initiate similar laws in the future.  These State standards will make it difficult for egg producers to freely ship across State lines.  Starting in 2015, eggs produced in Iowa, Indiana and other egg-exporting states can no longer be shipped to California because the hens will have been raised in cages that do not meet California's standards.  Different standards in Michigan and Ohio will take effect later, further adding to the patchwork of regulations.  As States with disparate standards continue to protect their own egg producers by banning the sale of eggs from States with lower or no standards, a complicated web of State laws will impair interstate commerce.  I have met with a number of egg producers and their concerns vary.  For some producers, different regulations increase costs because new cages must be designed for each State in which they operate.  Other producers fear that egg prices in states without regulations will plummet as imports flood their market.  Some egg producers selling to national grocery stores will have to produce eggs that meet different standards in different States.  Concerns don't end with producers.  Consumers can expect to see higher prices at grocery stores and restaurants will have to pay more for every egg they prepare.  Millions of individuals, including myself, are concerned about the living conditions of these animals.  That is why I am pleased to introduce this legislation today. The United Egg Producers and the Humane Society of the United States worked for over a year to reach this compromise, and I believe it is one that strikes a very fair balance.  Producers must enlarge cages for egg-laying hens and allow space for the birds to engage in natural behaviors such as nesting and perching.  Producers will have up to 18 years to meet this standard and make the required investments.  The legislation will officially outlaw the practice of starving chickens to increase egg-production, a cruel practice that is rarely used today, and one with consensus to end.  The bill will also lead to improved air quality in hen-houses by prohibiting excessive ammonia levels and it requires humane euthanasia of spent hens. This is also already common practice in the industry.  At its heart, this legislation is about protecting the future of the egg industry.  The egg industry brought this legislation to Congress and has asked us to help them implement the uniform regulations needed to survive and grow.  With this legislation, egg producers will have the market certainty they need and a reasonable timetables to make the required changes.  Producers need these uniform national standards so they can invest in new cages without facing the risk of more stringent state laws rendering their investments moot.  The egg industry is prepared to make these investments, many of which can be accomplished during the normal course of replacing aged equipment.  In addition to promoting industry stability, this bill will save jobs and strengthen the economy.  Furthermore, consumers are already embracing these reforms. Polls indicate broad support for the provisions in this bill and for humane treatment of egg-laying hens in general.  A recent survey found that 64 percent of Americans say that these newer facilities should be required through Federal legislation.  A majority, 58 percent, of American consumers also support a national standard.  The survey found 92 percent of consumers support the industry transitioning to these new enriched cages.  Candidly, it is not often that we see this sort of compromise in Washington.  Two groups that have been in fundamental conflict for years sat down and reached a deal.  The egg industry and the Humane Society are lock-step in their support for this bill. They are joined in endorsing the bill by the American Veterinary Medical Association and the Consumer Federation of America.  Even though the egg industry supports this bill, some still target this legislation as anti-agriculture they suggest the legislation will somehow be applied to, or set a precedent for Federal regulation of other industries.  That is simply not the case.  I want to be clear: requirements in the Egg Products Inspection Act Amendments of 2012 only apply to the production of eggs. The bill will not affect any other agricultural product including beef, pork, poultry and milk.  This legislation is a responsible compromise between those who advocate for more humane treatment for egg-laying hens and those who put breakfast on our tables.  I hope that even in this partisan climate we can enact this commonsense and widely endorsed legislation.  This legislation protects restaurants, bakers, food processors and American consumers from unnecessarily high egg prices. It protects egg producers from having eggs they can't sell.  This legislation is a reasonable, widely-supported solution to a real, costly and growing problem. The bill has the support of the United Egg Producers, which represents nearly 90 percent of the Nation's egg industry, as well as nine state and regional egg producer groups, more than 100 individual egg farms and more than 880 other family farms.  I urge you to join me in supporting this important legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3239       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
