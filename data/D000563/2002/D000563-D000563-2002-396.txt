BOND. Mr. President, unless it is from the majority whip, I would prefer to go on with my statement. I have told the Senators that I would hope to be able to complete this in less than 15 minutes, if I could reclaim the floor.  First, there was a statement by my friend, the Senator from Arizona, that there is nothing going to be done to improve fuel efficiency under the Levin-Bond amendment.  I refer the Senator from Arizona to section 801, the very first page. It directs the Secretary of Transportation to issue new regulations setting forth increased fuel economy standards for automobiles that are determined on the basis of maximum feasible average fuel economy levels, taking into consideration the matters set forth in subsection F. That essentially lists all of the factors included in the National Academy of Sciences study.  Frankly, it says, ``setting forth increased average fuel economy standards.''  There have been questions raised by the Senators from Massachusetts and Arizona as to whether there would be any action by the Department of Transportation. It is important to point out to whoever still remains that Secretary Mineta, in July of 2001, requested that Congress remove riders preventing the Department of Transportation from revising the current CAFE standards.  Once Congress did that, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration--which I will refer to as NHTSA--moved expeditiously in resuming CAFE rulemaking and published a notice on January 24, and on February 7 issued a request for comment for new CAFE standards for light trucks, requested public input. On February 1, the Secretary sent a letter to Congress urging that DOT be given the necessary authority to reform the CAFE program. The administration has requested an increase in NHTSA's budget to accomplish the development of the new standards and has begun updating its 1997 analysis of vehicle size.  So I think NHTSA, which the National Academy of Sciences study said should move forward, has shown it is willing to do so and that it is anxious to do so.  Now, one other item has been raised. My colleague from Massachusetts had a great line, a wonderful line, saying they had the most efficient workers and the U.S. auto industry can turn out the best cars around but they are forbidden to do so by the ``terrible management.'' It is all the management and the designers. Do you know something, Mr. President. The people saying they don't want those minicars are the consumers. The people who determine what the national auto- and truck-buying public consume are the consumers themselves.  There are some in this body who think we can tell them that it is good for you, eat your spinach--even if you don't like it. They tried to tell them to eat their spinach. They got 50 different small cars that meet very high standards. Yes, by God, some of them are golf carts. I love the golf carts. They are going to be all over the place if we have this absolutely arbitrary 37-mile-per-gallon fleet average, or 35, or whatever they come up with in their secondary amendment. We are going to be driving lots of golf carts because they will make it. But only 1.5 percent of vehicle sales in the United States today--even though there are 50 different models--are of the mini subcompacts that get the very high miles per gallon average.  For those people who want to drive them and want to save gasoline, more power to them. That should be their choice. That should be the consumer's choice. There have been a lot of statements made about the fact that, well, the only arguments against increasedCAFE are from the automakers. There are those of us who are supporting the Levin-Bond amendment who believe that the basis for our concern and for our amendment is the National Academy of Sciences study.  I had my breath taken away by the attacks on the National Academy of Sciences, but I will quote some figures from it.  The Senator from Massachusetts said it is technically feasible and potentially economical to improve fuel economy without reducing vehicle weight or size. It goes on to say that two members of the committee believe it may be possible to improve fuel economy without any implications for safety, even if down-weighting is used. So that statement from the National Academy of Sciences shows that the rest of the members of the panel said it would have an impact on safety.  Furthermore, the committee states that it recognizes the automakers' responses could be biased, but extensive downsizing that occurred after fuel economy requirements established in 1970 suggest that a likelihood of a similar response to further increases in fuel economy requirements must be considered seriously. From this, I repeat the message previously received--that we will be getting into smaller cars that are more dangerous.  Speaking of smaller cars, my colleague from Massachusetts talked about the Escape hybrid electric vehicle. Well, the rest of the story, and what he did not tell you, is that the Escape, which is the basic car, can only tow 1,000 pounds. It is a small front-wheel drive. The hybrid would cost $3,000 to $5,000 more, and it is 1,000 pounds lighter. Now, 1,000 pounds is a significant factor because that is basically what the lower weight of vehicles after the CAFE standards went into effect--what resulted in the roughly 2,000 deaths per year that the National Academy of Sciences foresaw.  There may be some people who want the hybrid electric vehicle. But if I were driving young children in my family around, I don't think I would want to go with a smaller car. There is no assurance that the consumers are going to buy it. That is the problem with some of these command-and-control decisions from Washington. They say that if we direct the manufacturers to build it, then the consumers will buy it. Well, American consumers like to make choices themselves. Sometimes they say we are not going to buy them.  The 10 most fuel-efficient cars in America account for only 1.5 percent of auto sales. In a recent survey of attributes, they show that the consumers value safety, comfort, utility, performance, and fuel economy ranks at the bottom.  In addition, when we talk about the technological improvements, Congress is not making the laws of physics. We are not changing science.  The safety improvements add weight to the vehicles. The heavier the vehicle, the more energy it takes to move it down the road and it results in a decrease in fuel economy.  The National Committee of Sciences report said:       If an increase in fuel economy is affected by a system that      encourages either downweighting or the production in sale of      more small cars, some additional fatalities would be      expected.  In addition, the Senator from Massachusetts said unequivocally that NAS, in its report, said a fleet of 37 miles per gallon could be reached with existing technology and without any loss of jobs.  That is just simply not true. Nobody can find a reference in this wonderful National Academy of Sciences report. I hold it up. It is a little dog eared. I have been looking for the statement cited as gospel by the Senator from Massachusetts. It is not in there. There are not even any fleetwide numbers in the report. Rather, there are cost-efficient fuel economy levels for 10 different subclasses of light-duty vehicles. Nowhere are those numbers sales weighted to yield a fleet average.  Of the six cost-effective scenarios examined by the National Academy of Sciences panel, is there even 1 of the 10 classes estimated to be able to reach that level? There are subcompact and compact cars which under a 3-year payback period could get up to 30 miles per gallon, and the highest light truck value is only 24.7 miles per gallon.  The National Academy of Sciences report in no way suggests that a 37, 35, 32--whatever number you want to give me--is achievable.  Also, my friend from Massachusetts cited a Consumers Union study on possible safety effects. Unfortunately, that CU study used an invalid comparison of vehicle crash death rates published by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety to suggest that drivers of Honda Civics are at less risk than drivers of Chevrolet Surburbans. The Insurance Institute says:       Such a claim is absurd on the face of it. Plus, the      comparison is invalid. The two death rates are not      statistically different, as indicated by the confidence      bounds we published. Also . . . nonvehicle factors such as      use patterns and driver demographics influence vehicle death      rates, and these are likely to vary across different vehicle      types such as small cars . . . and very large sport utility      vehicles.  I ask unanimous consent this letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                           Insurance Institute for                                               Highway Safety,                                     Arlington, VA, March 6, 2002.     Hon. Christopher Bond,     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Bond: This is in response to your request for      reactions to statements in a letter sent by the Consumer      Union (CU) to members of the Senate on possible safety      effects of pending fuel economy legislation. The CU letter      seriously misrepresents the adverse safety consequences of      reducing vehicle weights to improve fuel economy.       First, CU uses an invalid comparison of vehicle crash death      rates published by the Institute to suggest that drivers of      Honda Civics are at less risk than drivers of Chevrolet      Suburbans. Such a claim is absurd on the face of it. Plus the      comparison is invalid. The two death rates are not      statistically different, as indicted by the confidence bounds      we published. Also (as noted in our publication) nonvehicle      factors such as use patterns and driver demographics      influence vehicle death rates, and these are likely to vary      across different vehicle types such as small cars (Civics)      and very largest sport utility vehicles (Suburbans).       Even though we pointed out to CU the potential influences      of nonvehicle factors on the computed death rates, the letter      claims that ``when we take all crash factors into account in      the real world the Honda Civic had fewer driver fatalities      than the Chevrolet Suburban.'' This is a complete      misrepresentation. Nonvehicle factors such as use patterns      and driver demographics were not taken into account. The      claim that ``all crash factors'' were taken into account is      wrong. No nonvehicle crash factors were accounted for when      the death rates were computed.       Second, the CU letter distorts basic facts concerning      occupant safety and vehicle weight. The evidence is      overwhelming that the lightest passenger vehicles (which      consume less fuel per mile) offer much less protection to      their occupants than heavier vehicles (which consume more      fuel per mile). It also turns out that the safety benefits to      vehicle occupants diminish as vehicles get heavier and      heavier, so we don't have to choose the heaviest passenger      vehicles to get good crash protection. Still, we should      avoid the lightest ones.       It is sometimes claimed that the high crash risks for      occupants of light vehicles are entirely due to the adverse      consequences of collisions with heavier passenger vehicles      and, therefore, it is the heavy vehicles that are the      problem. It is correct that heavier vehicles increase the      risks for occupants of light vehicles in two-vehicle crashes,      but this effect makes only a relatively small contribution to      the high risks for light car occupants. Our October 30, 1999      newsletter, Status Report (enclosed), pointed out in an      article on crash compatibility that almost 60 percent of the      deaths of occupants of the lightest cars (
