Speaker, I rise to say a few words in honor of the 14th annual National Science and Technology Week.  During this week the National Science Foundation performs its most important public outreach activities of the year; getting children excited about science and technology. This year's theme for National Science and Technology Week is ``Polar Connections.'' It draws attention to the scientific research being performed in the Arctic and in the Antarctic.  The North and South Poles are truly unlike any place on the planet. As Chairman of the Science Committee, I've had the opportunity to travel to Antarctica to visit NSF's South Pole Station, and I can tell you that it is a remarkable place. The men and women who perform research at the South Pole work under conditions that make the winters in Wisconsin look comparatively easy. For example, in 1989 researchers from the University of Wisconsin measured temperature variations at the South Pole ranging from -7  deg.F to -117  deg.F. The South Pole receives less than a foot of snow per year, yet it is covered by an ice-sheet that is nearly two-miles thick. Geographically it is 1.5 times the size of the continental United States and a year's worth of supplies must be fit onto the one supply ship that ventures to Antarctica once a year. When the sun goes down on March 21st, it doesn't come up again until September 21st.  This week's activities were not designed simply to draw attention to the Poles, but rather to the work being performed there. The North and South Poles are unique, natural laboratories and offer matchless opportunities to study our environment.  Highlighting the combination of the important and unique research being performed at the Poles and the harsh and dangerous living conditions there is, in my opinion, a great way to make children curious about science and technology. When children are introduced to the conditions at the Poles, they may wonder: How can anything survive in such cold conditions? How do you study geology when the ground's under two miles of ice? How do you get everything you need to the South Pole? How do you fit a year's supply of goods on one ship? Getting kids to ask these questions is the goal of National Science and Technology Week. I think that ``Polar Connections'' is a terrific theme for National Science and Technology Week, and I am confident that this year's activities will be a great success.  I must add that just as they did last year, the National Science Foundation has once again set up it's ``Ask a Scientist or Engineer'' phone-bank at 1-888-718-3026. The phone-bank will be open on Wednesday, April 29th, from 9:00 am to 8:00 pm. This year's e-mail address is [emailÂ protected] More information about National Science and Technology Week can be found at NSF's web-page at www.nsf.gov.  Mr. Speaker, I encourage my fellow Members to strongly support this program, and joinwith me in celebrating National Science and Technology Week.                          ____________________
