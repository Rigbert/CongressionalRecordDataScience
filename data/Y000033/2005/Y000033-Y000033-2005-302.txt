Mr. Speaker, today, I am introducing legislation which will correct an injustice to five Southeast Alaska Native villages.  For over 25 years, the Southeast Alaska Villages of Haines, Ketchikan, Petersburg, Tenakee and Wrangell have been denied fundamental rights and compensation afforded other Alaska Native villages under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA). ANCSA fails to recognize these five villages for the purposes of establishing urban or village corporations under the Act. Consequently, the Alaska Natives from these villages have been denied the rights afforded other Alaska Natives to proper settlement under ANCSA of historical land claims.  A significant number of Natives enrolled at each of the villages of Haines, Ketchikan, Petersburg, Tenakee and Wrangell during the original ANCSA process, but they were denied the opportunity to establish village or urban corporations in 1971. Consequently, although Natives enrolled to these villages during the ANCSA process and did become at-large shareholders in the regional corporation forSoutheast Alaska, Natives from these five communities were denied rights to land and local resources that Natives enrolled to other village and urban corporations in Southeast Alaska received under ANCSA.  ANCSA prohibits the Native villages in Southeast Alaska from obtaining an administrative and/or judicial solution. Section 11 of ANCSA establishes a general process for determining Native village eligibility for villages outside Southeast Alaska. A completely different process was set forth under Section 16 of ANCSA for determining the eligibility of Native villages in Southeast Alaska. Unlike Section 11, there is no provision in Section 16 providing an appeal right or other procedures for qualification of Southeast Alaska Native villages not included in the original list.  Appeals to the Alaska Native Claims Appeal Board of the U.S. Department of the Interior in 1974 and 1977, on behalf of Natives enrolled to the villages of Haines, Tenakee and Ketchikan were denied based on a narrow, technical reading, of ANCSA Section 16. The Appeals Board ruled that Section 16 prevents the Board from even considering whether ``unlisted'' Southeast villages could be determined eligible for benefits, thus precluding any administrative or judicial redress.  In 1994, a congressionally directed study determined the omission of these Southeast Alaska Native villages from ANCSA to be erroneous. In 1993, the Federal government contracted with the Institute of Social and Economic Research (ISER) at the University of Alaska, Anchorage, to prepare a report on the status of these villages. ISER presented its report to Congress in February 1994, concluding that the eligibility requirements for villages eligible to form Native corporations were met by the Native communities of Haines, Ketchikan, Petersburg, Tenakee and Wrangell. The report notes that, with the exception of Tenakee, the communities appeared on early versions of Native village lists, and their subsequent omission was not clearly explained in any provision of ANCSA nor in the accompanying legislative history. In short, the ISER report found no distinction between the five communities and other Southeast Alaska communities listed in Section 16, and thus no justification for omission of these five Southeast Native communities from ANCSA.  A solution to the myriad of issues that have prevented a resolution to this situation has presented itself in past congressional sessions. These past legislative attempts have failed for a variety of reasons outside the control of the Southeast Alaska Native villages. My legislation addresses these issues and seeks to build a solid, bipartisan coalition of support among key members of Congress, the Administration, and other outside interest groups. The legislation presents a compromise that has been favorably received by the affected villages, Sealaska Corporation, the state and others. The elements of the compromise include the following:  The Native residents enrolled to the five Native villages will be allowed to organize five urban corporations, one for each unrecognized community.  The newly formed Corporations would be provided the following compensation package:  The Congress would recognize the five communities as Alaska Native Villages, pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act.  The Secretary of the Interior would offer, and the Urban Corporation for each community could accept, the surface estate to approximately 23,000 acres of forest lands.  Sealaska Corporation, the Native Regional Corporation for Southeast Alaska, would receive title to the subsurface estate to the designated lands.  The Urban Corporations for each community would receive a lump sum payment to be used as start-up funds for the newly established Corporation.  The Secretary of the Interior would determine such other appropriate compensation to redress the inequities faced by unrecognized communities for the past 30+ years.  I thank my colleagues and urge your support for this important legislation for five Southeast Alaska communities.                          ____________________
