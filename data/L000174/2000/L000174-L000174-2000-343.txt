President, May 6th marks the 75th birthday of Dr. William Sloane Coffin. Protestants for the Common Good is celebrating that day with a tribute to Dr. Coffin in Chicago, and I want to take a moment to call the Senate's attention to the life of this remarkable man.  I should begin by mentioning that since his retirement, Bill has lived in Vermont, and I am proud to represent a man whose dedication to peace, the environment, and social justice I have long admired.  William Sloane Coffin first came to the world's attention during the 18 years he served as the Chaplain of Yale University. As an outspoken and courageous supporter of civil rights and a founder of Clergy and Laity Concerned for Vietnam, he often sacrificed his own safety to ensure and protect the rights of others. He protested against segregation laws in the South, and with Dr. Benjamin Spock against the war in Vietnam. Anyone who was fortunate to hear him speak on these great moral issues of our time remembers his tremendous eloquence, passion and conviction. What many people may not know is that he also served his country as an infantry officer in Europe during the Second World War.  From New Haven, Dr. Coffin moved to New York City where he became the Senior Minister at Manhattan's Riverside Church. His soaring oratory inspired people from all walks of life.  Regularly challenging those who attended his services to seek justice in their own lives, Dr. Coffin set an example by consistently doing so himself. He founded the Church's well-known disarmament program, traveled throughout the world promoting peace and respect for human rights, and remains the President Emeritus of ``SANE/FREEZE: Campaign for Global Security.''  Mr. President, I have been fortunate not only to know of William SloaneCoffin but to know him personally. He has had an extraordinary impact on his community, his state, his country, and the world. His conscience is like a beacon, which challenges and guides us all.  Not long ago, I celebrated my 60th birthday. I hope that 15 years from now I will be able to look back at my own life, and look forward to the days ahead, with the sense of accomplishment, pride, and commitment to equality, justice and peace that William Sloane Coffin should feel on the occasion of his 75th birthday.  Happy birthday my friend.                          ____________________
