 President, I rise for the purpose of making a unanimous consent request for a piece of legislation that is within my jurisdiction, and then, also, as a favor to another person, to make a unanimous consent request. Before I make that unanimous consent request, I would like to make a short statement, and then have Senator Baucus make a short statement before I proceed to the unanimous consent request. May I go ahead?
