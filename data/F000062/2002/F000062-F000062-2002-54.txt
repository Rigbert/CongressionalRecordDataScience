 President, I rise today to introduce the Comprehensive Seaport and Container Security Act of 2002 to protect against terrorist attacks on or through our Nation's seaports. I would like to thank Senators Kyl, Hutchison, and Snowe for joining me in sponsoring this bill.  Currently, our seaports are the gaping hole in our Nation's defense against terrorism. Of the over 18 million shipping containers that enter our ports each year, 6 million come from overseas. However, only 1 or 2 percent of these containers are inspected, and inspections almost invariably occur after the containers arrive in the United States.  The problem is that single container could contain 60,000 pounds of explosives, 10 to 15 times the amount in the Ryder truck used to blow up the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma city, and a single container ship can carry as many as 8,000 containers at one time. Containers could easily be exploited to detonate a bomb that would destroy a bridge, seaport, or other critical infrastructure, causing mass destruction and killing thousands.  Worse, a suitcase-sized nuclear device or radiological ``dirty bomb'' could also be installed in a container and shipped to the United States. The odds that the container would never be inspected. And, even if the container was inspected, it would be too late. The weapon would already be in the United States--most likely near a major population center.  There is no doubt in my mind that terrorists are seeking to exploit vulnerabilities at our seaports right now.  For example, a recent article in the Bangkok Post notes that ``Al-Qaeda is among international terrorist organisations responsible for an increase in piracy against ships carrying radioactive materials through the Malacca Straits. . . . The terrorist groups' main aims were to obtain substances such as uranium and plutonium oxide for use in so-called dirty bombs.''  In addition, any attack on or through a seaport could have devastating economic consequences. Every year U.S. ports handle over 800 million tons of cargo valued at approximately $600 billion.  Excluding trade with Mexico and Canada, America's ports handle 95 percent of U.S. trade. Two of the busiest ports in the world are in my home State of California: Los Angeles/Long Beach and at Oakland.  We cannot inspect every container coming into the United States, but we can do a better job devoting our attention to cargo that could put our national security at risk. The legislation we introduce today will ensure that we devote the limited resources we do have to inspect cargo in the most efficient and effective manner. It will allow us to reduce the size of the haystack to make it easier to find the needle.  Since September 11th, the Federal Government has taken steps to secure our airports and our borders, however, we still have not adopted a blueprint for helping protect America's 361 seaports. While the Senate passed S. 1214, a bill written by Senator Hollings last December, and the House has also passed a port security bill, conference negotiations are still ongoing.  I hope the conferees will adopt the provisions in this bill before they complete their work in conference because I believe that this bill is the only legislation that thoroughly addresses the issue of port security from the point cargo is loaded in a foreign country to its arrival on land in the United States.  We have known for a long time that America's ports needed an extensive security strategy and upgrade. In the fall of 2000, a comprehensive report was issued by the Interagency Commission on Crime and Security in U.S. Seaports. I testified before the commission and I believe its report makes a number of sensible suggestions on how we can improve security and fight crime at seaports.  Before the September 11 terrorist attacks, S. 1214 was drafted to try to implement many of the commission's recommendations. Before the bill passed the Senate in December 2001, the sponsors made some additional changes to help prevent a terrorist attack. However, I believe that there is much more Congress can do to prevent terrorists from launching a terrorist attack through our seaports.  The legislation I am introducing today will complement the Hollings bill and the seaport security legislation passed by the House. Together, I believe the provisions in these three bills will erect a formidable security barrier at our seaports.  I believe that Al Qaeda is planning to attack the United States again soon and that it may well try to do so through a U.S. seaport. Indeed, the Al Qaeda training manual specifically mentions seaports as a point of vulnerability in our security.  In addition, we know that Al Qaeda has succeeded in attacking American interests at and through seaports in the past. Let me mention some examples.  In June, the FBI issued a warning for Americans to be on the lookout for suspicious people wanting training in scuba diving or trying to rent underwater gear. Law enforcement officials fear that Al Qaeda operatives could try to blow up ships at anchor or other waterfront targets.  In May the FBI received reports that Al Qaeda terrorists may be making their way toward Southern California from a Middle Eastern port via merchant ships. Catalina Island--22 miles off the coast of Los Angles, was mentioned as a possible destination for about 40 Al Qaeda terrorists.  In October 2001, Italian authorities found an Egyptian man suspected for having ties to Al Qaeda in a container bound for Canada. He had false identifications, maps of airports, a computer, a satellite phones, cameras, and plenty of cash on hand.  In October 2000, Al Qaeda operatives successfully carried out a deadly bombing attack against the U.S.S. Cole in the port of Yemen.  In 1998, Al Qaeda bombed the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Evidence suggests that the explosives the terrorists used were shipped to them by sea. And the investigation of the embassy bombings concluded that Bin Laden has close financial tries to various shipping companies.  I believe that this legislation would go far to make the United States less vulnerable to a terrorist attack. The main provisions will: 1. Establish a risk profiling plan for the Customs Service to focus their limited inspection capabilities on high-risk cargo and containers, and 2. Push U.S. security scrutiny beyond our Nation's borders to monitor and inspect cargo and containers before they arrive near America's shores.  These provisions complement and extend a strategy Customs Commissioner Robert C. Bonner is already in the process of implementing. To prevent a weapon of mass destruction from getting to the U.S. in the first place, Customs has entered into formal agreements with a handful of foreign governments to station U.S. inspectors at ports overseas to profile high risk cargo and target suspicious shipments for inspection.  The Comprehensive Seaport and Container Security Act will also: Designate an official at each U.S. port as the primary authority responsible for security. This will enable all parties involved in business at a port to understand who has final say on all security matters.  Require the FBI to collect and make available data relating to crime at and affecting seaports. With more data, law enforcement agencies will be able to better identify patterns and weaknesses at particular ports.  Require ports to provide space to Customs so that the agency is able to use its non-intrusive inspection technology. In many cases, Customs has to keep this technology outside the port and bring it in every day, which prevents some of the best inspection technology, which is not portable, from being used.  Give Customs responsibility of licensing and overseeing regulated intermediaries in the international trade process, these intermediaries handle over 80 percent of all cargo in international trade. Currently, the U.S. Federal Maritime Commission oversees most of these intermediaries, but Customs will have more resources to oversee this regulation.  Require shippers bound for U.S. ports to transmit their cargo manifests with more detailed information at least 24 hours prior to departing from a foreign port.  Impose steep monetary sanctions for failure to comply with information filing requirements, including filing incorrect information, the current penalty is only a maximum of $1000 or $5000, depending on the offense. The Seaport Commission found that about half of the information on ship manifests was inaccurate.  Require all port employees to have biometric smart identification cards.  Restrict private vehicle access to ports.  Prohibit guns and explosives at ports, except when authorized.  Mandate that radiation detection pagers be issued to each inspector.  Requires the Transportation Security Administration to set standards to ensure each port has a secure port perimeter, secure parking facilities, controlled points of access into the port, sufficient lighting, buildings with secure doors and windows and an alarm.  Require all ports to keep sensitive information on the port secure and protected. Such information would include, but not be limited to maps, blueprints, and information on the Internet.  Require the use of high security seals on all containers coming into the U.S.  Require that each container to be transported through U.S. ports receive a universal transaction number that could be used to track container movement from origin to destination. Require shippers to have similar universal numbers.  Require all empty containers destined for U.S. ports to be secured.  Fund pilot programs to develop high-tech seals and sensors, including those that would provide real-time evidence of container tampering to a monitor at a terminal.  I believe that Congress should act quickly on this legislation. This bill could very well prevent the arrival or detonation of a nuclear ``suitcase bomb'' or radiological ``dirty bomb'' at a U.S. seaport-an attack that could bring U.S. seaborne commerce to a grinding halt, leaving our economy and national security in shambles.  In closing, I want to thank staff at the Customs Service, Transportation Security Administration, Coast Guard, and various ports for their helpful comments on this legislation. I also want to thank a ``working group'' of experts I assembled for their suggestions regarding the bill. These experts included former government officials, industry executives, and security consultants.  I also want to thank Senator Hollings and the other members of the Commerce Committee for the work they have done on the port security issue. I have spoken to Senator Hollings about the bill I am introducing today, and my staff is working with his staff and with the staff of other conferees to come up with comprehensive seaport security legislation.  I hope that the legislation ultimately adopted by the conference includes the Comprehensive Seaport and Container Security Act of 2002. I would urge the conferees to work quickly to draft a final bill that we can send to the President's desk before September 11.  Mr President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2895       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

SEC. 204. SHIPMENT PROFILING PLAN.       (a) In General.--The Commissioner of Customs, after      consultation with the Director of the Office of Homeland      Security and the Under Secretary of Transportation for      Security, shall develop a shipment profiling plan to track      containers and shipments of merchandise that will be imported      into the United States for the purpose of identifying any      shipment that is a threat to the security of the United      States before such shipment is transported to a United States      seaport.       (b) Information Requirements.--The shipment profiling plan      described in subsection (a) shall at a minimum--       (1) require common carriers, shippers, and ocean      transportation intermediaries to provide appropriate      information regarding each shipment of merchandise, including      the information required under section 431(b) of the Tariff      Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1431(b)) as amended by this Act, to      the Commissioner of Customs; and       (2) require shippers to use a standard international bill      of lading for each shipment that includes--       (A) the weight of the cargo;       (B) the value of the cargo;       (C) the vessel name;       (D) the voyage number;       (E) a description of each container;       (F) a description of the nature, type, and contents of the      shipment;       (G) the code number from Harmonized Tariff Schedule;       (H) the port of destination;       (I) the final destination of the cargo;       (J) the means of conveyance of the cargo;       (K) the origin of the cargo;       (L) the name of the precarriage deliverer or agent;       (M) the port at which the cargo was loaded;       (N) the name of formatting agent;       (O) the bill of lading number;       (P) the name of the shipper;       (Q) the name of the consignee;       (R) the universal transaction number or carrier code      assigned to the shipper by the Commissioner of Customs; and       (S) any additional information that the Commissioner of      Customs by regulation determines is reasonably necessary to      ensure seaport safety.       (c) Creation of Profile.--The Commissioner of Customs shall      combine the information described in subsection (b) with      other law enforcement and national security information that      the Commissioner believes will assist in locating containers      and shipments that could pose a threat to the security of the      United States to create a profile of every container and      every shipment within the container that will enter the      United States.       (d) Cargo Screening.--       (1) In general.--Customs Service officers shall review the      profile of a shipment that a shipper desires to transport      into the United States to determine if the shipment or the      container in which it is carried should be subjected to      additional inspection by the Customs Service.
