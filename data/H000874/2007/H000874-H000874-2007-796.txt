 The fact is, Madam Speaker, Paul Hays--with his deep, crisp, commanding voice--is perhaps more recognizable to regular viewers of C-SPAN than many of the Members of Congress who are privileged to serve here.  Since 1789, the House has employed reading clerks, who are responsible for reading aloud the text of bills, amendments, motions, messages, special rules and other privileged resolutions, and veto messages.  Our reading clerks almost always have been appointed from the ranks of existing House employees who have extensive prior floor experience.  And, Paul--a graduate of Georgetown University--is no exception.  In fact, Paul was appointed reading clerk in 1988 by my very good friend and a great public servant, the former Republican minority leader Robert Michel of Illinois.  It is no coincidence, Mr. Speaker, that--given his speaking talents--Paul intends to do voice-over work in the future.  Paul, we thank you for your service and wish you well in the future.                          ____________________
