Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume.  I want to again thank Chairman Dingell, Ranking Member Barton, and certainly Lois Capps for her leadership on this issue. I again rise in support of H. Res. 760, a resolution supporting the goals and ideals of Children's Health Month.  The overarching goal of designating October each year as Children's Health Month is to draw attention to the need to provide access to health care, insuring preventative care, seek cures for diseases and chronic conditions, and promote healthy living habits for all of America's children.  There has been much discussion recently both on the floor and in the media about children's health care. The objective, obviously, to cover the health needs of children is of paramount concern, particularly with low-income children. Children's Health Month should remind us of that important message. I stand in support, and ask that my colleagues support the resolution as well.  I reserve the balance of my time.
