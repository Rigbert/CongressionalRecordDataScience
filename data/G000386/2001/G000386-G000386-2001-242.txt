 It is wrong. It is bad.  Every taxpayer who pays income tax gets a marginal rate tax cut under this bill. Let's make that clear. Every taxpayer gets a tax reduction.  I do not know how many amendments we have had on this bill to kill the marginal rate tax reductions we have. We have had a flood of amendments from the other party. Not one amendment from the other party has been adopted yet. And I have to wonder, what has happened to bipartisanship? Is bipartisanship dead and buried, when just 5 months ago we talked so much about it? If so, I and Senator Baucus have not been invited to the funeral. I urge the defeat of this amendment.
