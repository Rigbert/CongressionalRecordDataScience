President, on September 13, 1998, the town of Cavendish, Vermont will be holding a very special event to commemorate the remarkable life of Phineas Gage. Phineas Gage was the victim of a freak head injury that occurred in Cavendish, and the effect his injury had on his personality resulted in a breakthrough in the understanding of brain function.  To commemorate the 150th anniversary of Phineas Gage's accident, the town of Cavendish has planned a two-day celebration. A beautiful town in southern Vermont, lying on the original tracks of the Rutland-Burlington railroad, Cavendish has initiated and organized the Gage celebration. At the heart of the commemoration events will be a historic festival in the Cavendish town center. The festival will include tours along the historic railway, artifact displays, including the first public display of Gage's skull and tamping rod, and Vermont artisan and craft demonstrations.  The residents of Cavendish citizens are to be commended for their leadership and hard work in planning these events.  To more fully explain the events of September 13, 1848, and the importance of this day for medical history, at the conclusion of my remarks and those of my colleague from Vermont, I ask that the story of Phineas Gage provided by the town of Cavendish be printed in the Record.
