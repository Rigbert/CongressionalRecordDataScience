President, Vermont athletes are no strangers to the U.S. Winter Olympic team. In 2009, the Hartland, VT, raised Kevin Pearce was readying himself to be a member of that team when tragedy struck. During a routine half-pipe training session for the 2010 Olympics, Kevin suffered a traumatic brain injury and was nearly killed when he crashed and struck his head. Since then, Kevin, with the support of his family, has worked to recover and heal from that terrible accident. I have heard firsthand from Kevin how instrumental his younger brother David was in providing positive feedback and encouragement as he completed his physical therapy. Together with his older brother, Adam, Kevin started the Love Your Brain Foundation, which offers support to survivors of traumatic brain injuries, their families, and their caregivers.  The Love Your Brain Foundation recently held its free annual retreat in Lincoln, VT. The foundation's mission extends beyond simply providing support to survivors; it also works to raise broader public awareness about the condition. Kevin, Adam, and those who support the mission of the Love Your Brain Foundation believe that traditional treatment options, as well as alternative methods of care, can help survivors of traumatic brain injuries lead full and healthy lives. The foundation's annual retreat enables people from around the country, and some from Canada, who are dealing with traumatic brain injuries to share their own personal stories and to sharpen skills in workshops focused on music, yoga, and nutrition education.  Whether the result of sporting accidents or from a vehicle crash, injuries sustained on the hiking trail or the battlefield, there is still much to be learned about traumatic brain injuries and how best to help those who sustain them recover. That is why the work of the Love Your Brain Foundation makes a real difference.  Kevin Pearce's life forever changed the day of his accident. He and his family have taken that tragedy and turned it into an opportunity to advance public awareness. His story is one we can all be inspired by, and his road to recovery is one we should all from and seek to emulate.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a May 28 article written by Vermont Associated Press reporter Lisa Rathke, entitled ``Injured snowboarder helps brain injury survivors,'' be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Associated Press, May 28, 2016]            Injured Snowboarder Helps Brain Injury Survivors                            (By Lisa Rathke)       Lincoln--A near-fatal halfpipe crash while training for the      2010 Olympics ended Kevin Pearce's snowboarding career and      changed his life forever. Six years later, Pearce, 28,      continues to cope with his traumatic brain injury that he      will carry with him for the rest of his life and he's helping      other survivors do the same.       Pearce, who grew up in Vermont, and his brother started the      Love Your Brain Foundation to support traumatic brain injury      survivors and caregivers. The foundation provides workshops      for yoga teachers to cater their classes to brain injury      survivors. It also offers a free yearly retreat for those      with traumatic brain injury and their caregivers that is      taking place this week in Lincoln, Vermont, and hopes to      offer retreats in other parts of the country.       The foundation raises money to cover these activities and      is working on educating young athletes about the importance      of ``loving their brains''' and preventing concussions.       About 50 people from around the country and Canada are      attending the third annual event that also features nutrition      education, art, music and other mindfulness activities.      Attendees can also share their personal stories.       ``There was a huge missing piece to traumatic brain      injuries and there's such an unknown for so many people of      what to do after they sustain this injury,'' said Pearce,      following a morning yoga class at the retreat in a barnlike      building on a hillside.       Alternatives such as acupuncture, yoga and meditation are      proving helpful to traumatic brain injury survivors in their      recoveries, said Dr. Roger Knakal, medical director of      physical medicine and rehabilitation and the University of      Vermont Medical Center.       One of the hardest parts about traumatic brain injuries is      that they are invisible injuries, said Pearce's brother Adam.       The biggest eye-opener was how isolated people can become      from a brain injury, he said. ``When you have a brain injury,      you feel so not normal,'' said Pearce. ``You're thrown back      into the regular world. You're expected to be as you were      before this. We're not able to do that because we're now a      new person.''       Pearce was considered, along with Shaun White, to be one of      America's top athletes in the sport at the time of his crash.      On New Year's Eve in 2009, he struck his head during half-     pipe training in Utah. He was in critical care for a month      and then acute care for two weeks before moving to a      rehabilitation center in Denver. He had to relearn how to      walk, talk, even swallow. The family then moved back to      Vermont where he continued rehab.       Pearce, who now lives in Bend, Oregon, continues to do      cognitive therapy and is seeing eye therapists in Chicago to      help with vision problems. He maintains a busy schedule,      speaking to various groups about his story and the importance      of ``loving your brain'' and showing the 2013 documentary      about him called ``Crash Reel.''       Ari Havusha, 20, of Vancouver, returned to the retreat for      the third time this year. He said he suffered several severe      concussions and an eye injury as a teen soccer player and      another severe concussion later during a college fall. He      lives with a constant headache.       Havusha withdrew from McGill University in Montreal and      returned home, where he became anxious and depressed. His      mother pointed to the Love Your Brain retreat and right away,      Havusha said, he knew he had to do it. ``It was a huge      turning point for me,'' he said. ``I saw other people and      their traumatic stories and I was able to connect with other      people. Suddenly I was kind of lifted out of that isolation I      felt so heavily.''                          ____________________
