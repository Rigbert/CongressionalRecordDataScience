Speaker, I would like to just point out that the gentleman from California who just addressed this House never appeared before the subcommittee. The gentleman said he served on the Committee on Appropriations before.  When the WIC issue was being hotly debated in the subcommittee, the gentleman never walked in the door. When we were debating this in the full committee, the gentleman never made his appearance. And when his colleague from his side of the aisle circulated the letter on WIC, he never signed the letter saying that he supported the current level, a level of funding to support current recipients. So it seems to me the gentleman truly is a Johnny-come-lately to the battle.  As far as holding hearings this fall, the problem is the people being cut off today, not next fall. That is why we need the supplemental appropriation bill passed with that money in there. Waiting until next fall does not solve the current problem we are having, which goes to prove the gentleman really does not understand the program to begin with and what this fight is all about.  I think to ice out one of your colleagues who has fought this hard on the issue is truly a disgrace to the institution.                         Parliamentary Inquiry  Mr. McINNIS. Mr. Speaker, I have a parliamentary inquiry as to whether or not the gentlewoman's words are a violation in regards to the Johnny-come-lately comments and so on, questioning the motives of the Member.
