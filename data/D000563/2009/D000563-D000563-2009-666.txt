President, this year, the State of Illinois has designated September 15, 2009, as Carbon Day. As an official State holiday, communities across the State are encouraged to focus on reducing our State's carbon footprint and preserving our environment. Schools, organizations, businesses, and communities throughout Illinois will participate in organized events ranging from tree plantings to those promoting recycling and composting.  Carbon Day allows Illinois residents to find their own ways to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and participate in the fight against global warming. Most of us don't think too much about how our daily activities contribute to greenhouse gases. This new State holiday asks people to think about that and offers ideas each of us can use to make a difference.  We do need to act. Global warming likely will lead to more severe heat waves and more fierce storms. That affects all of us. These are weather patterns that compromise air and water quality, reduce agricultural productivity, and threaten public health.  The simple step of planting a tree this fall can make a difference in someone's carbon footprint. One tree alone can absorb as much carbon dioxide as a single car can produce over 26,000 miles of driving. The more trees we plant, the greater the impact. One acre of trees may remove up to 2.6 tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere in 1 year alone. Trees planted in the fall generally require less water than those planted in the spring, making this a good time to get started.  Every person can contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and work to provide future generations with a healthy environment. This September 15, I urge the people of Illinois to participate in Carbon Day events throughout the State, learn about the simple steps they can take to reduce their carbon footprint, and have a lasting impact on their environment.                          ____________________
