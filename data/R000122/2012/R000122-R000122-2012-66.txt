President, I rise today in support of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, which is pending before the Senate this week.  This legislation will give the FDA, through five agreements made between the agency and industry, the resources to approve additional drugs and devices every year for their safe and effective use. Without these agreements, the FDA, starting in October, would lack these resources which are necessary to approve new drugs and devices, and they would also lack resources to monitor the safety and efficacy of those drugs already on the market. This would result in a reversal of decades of work modernizing our drug and device approval and safety programs.  I am particularly pleased that for the first time, the generic pharmaceutical industry will provide the agency with $1.5 billion over 5 years for faster product reviews. In fact, the essence of the legislation is that the industry is actually providing resources for the monitoring and for the approval of drugs. Getting generic drugs onto the market sooner will help lower costs for individuals and families as well as for the Federal and State governments.  This measure would also significantly improve FDA's regulatory authority, including its ability to help prevent drug shortages and to partner with the private sector to develop new medications to treat life-threatening diseases that have become resistant to antibiotics, which is a very important measure included within this legislation.  I wish to recognize especially Chairman Harkin and Senator Enzi for their very thoughtful, very deliberative, and extremely important work.
