I think it is not only in good faith, but he is talking about the range of voices that we heard in the hearing, but I am persuaded by Mr. Gray, and I believe he was much more definitive in his selection of $100 million.  In response to my question to Mr. Miller, the former director of OMB, candidate for the Senate in the State of Virginia, recently, and someone else who is involved in the business community, he sort of said ``Sure, $100 million that is fine. We cannot have every regulation,'' and I am paraphrasing, but clearly there was no objection to the $100 million threshold.
