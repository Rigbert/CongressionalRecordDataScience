Those are the issues we are talking about. They are a subset of what I argue is the larger issue.  The larger issue: Is the Senate going to be the Senate? Or is it some type of smaller House of Representatives where the leadership dictates what is coming to the floor, what judge's name might come up, what bill might come up, what amendment might come up, when it all comes about? That, I think, is the key point.  Let me take up another key point in terms of the demonstration of why we are not doing our duty. We have before the Senate a very difficult vote on extending permanent normal trade relations to China. It is a very difficult vote. We know that. It is a vote that bedeviled the House of Representatives. It was controversial. It was difficult. But after intense pressure and vigorous debate, the House of Representatives brought it to a conclusion and voted.  Now that measure is before the Senate. It is controversial. It is, like so many other things, languishing. It could have been accomplished weeks ago. The business community would argue vociferously it should have been accomplished weeks ago. It has been couched in many terms, but one term I think is most compelling is that it is a critical national security vote. It is a critical national security vote. Yes, it is about trade. Yes, it is about economic impacts within the United States and around the world. But it is also about whether or not we will continue to maintain a relationship of engagement with China, or if we reject it, or if we delay it indefinitely and open up the distinct possibility of confrontation and competition with China.  Yet this critical national security vote, this critical vote which is probably the No. 1 objective of the business community in this country, again languishes.  Some would say there are reasons. We want to talk about Senator Thompson's and Senator Torricelli's amendment about proliferation. But, again, it is symptomatic of a situation in which the Senate is not responding as it should to its constitutional and to its public responsibilities because of the political calculus.  Our side is not immune to political calculation. But the leadership of this body has created a situation in which avoidance of difficult issues, nullification of constitutional responsibilities and obligations to confirm judges, and deferment of critical national security issues for short-run advantages, is the standard of performance. I believe that is not the role the Senate should play and that is the heart of this discussion today.  Let me suggest one other point with respect to the business of the body. We confront a range of issues that deal with those world-shaking, momentous issues like China trade policy; issues with respect to domestic tranquility; the safety of our streets; the funding of the appropriations bills for law enforcement when it comes to firearms.  Then there are issues that are not important to the vast number of Americans in the sense it doesn't affect them directly but are critically important to many Americans. One is a measure I have been trying to find the opportunity to bring to the floor, and that is to somehow help the Liberian community in this country who came here in 1990, in the midst of their violent civil war, and who for the last decade have been in the United States. They have been residing here. They have been contributing to our communities. Many of them have children who are American citizens. Yet they are in a position where they face deportation October 1. The clock is ticking.  This is not an issue that is going to galvanize parades through every Main Street in America. But for these roughly 10,000 people who are caught up in this twilight zone while they are here, they want to remain here with their children, many of whom, as I said, are Americans, but they face a prospect of being deported back to a country that is still tumultuous, still dangerous, still threatening to them and many others.  This is legislation that has been supported by Senator Chafee, my colleague from Rhode Island, Senator Hagel, Senator Wellstone, Senator Kennedy, Senator Landrieu, Senator Kerry, and Senator Durbin, legislation that will materially assist these individuals. But, once again, we are not moving with the kind of rapidity that allows for the easy accommodation of this type of legislation on the floor. I hope it does come up soon, but I think it represents the cost of this overcontrol and this inflexibility, perhaps, that we are seeing as the management leadership style here today.  Let me just briefly set the stage about the need for this legislation. Liberia is a country that has the closest ties of any African nation to the United States--it was founded by freed slaves in the middle 1800s. Its capital is Monrovia, named after President Monroe. It is a country that did its utmostthroughout its existence in the 1800s and the 1900s, to emulate American Government structure, at least. But it erupted into tremendous violence in 1989 and 1990. Over the next several years, 150,000 people fled to surrounding countries. Many of them came to the United States--many being about 14,000. In March 1991, the Attorney General recognized that these individuals needed to be sheltered, so he granted temporary protected status, or TPS.  Under TPS, the nationals of a country may stay in the United States without fear of deportation because of the armed conflict or extraordinary conditions in their homeland. People who register for TPS receive work authorizations, they are required to pay taxes--and this is precisely what the Liberian community has done in the United States. They went to work. They paid taxes. However, they do not qualify for benefits such as welfare and food stamps. Not a single day spent in TPS counts towards the residence requirement for permanent residency. So they are in this gray area, this twilight zone. They have stayed there now for 10 years because the situation did not materially change for many years.  Each year, the Attorney General must conduct a review. The Attorney General did conduct such a review and continued to grant TPS until a few years ago, until the fall of 1999, when the determination was made that the situation in Liberia had stabilized enough that TPS was no longer forthcoming.  At that, many of us leaped to the fore and said the situation has changed. The situation has changed in Liberia, but it has also changed with respect to these individuals here in the United States. They have established themselves in the community. They have become part of the community. Their expectations of a speedy return to Liberia long ago evaporated and they started to accommodate themselves--indeed many of them enthusiastically--to joining the greater American community.  The situation changed in Liberia. The change there was more procedural than substantive. What happened was the situation in which there was an election, which was monitored by outsiders, which elected a President, the former warlord, Charles Taylor.  Based upon this procedural process change, the State Department and others ruled, essentially, that the situation was now ripe for the return of Liberians from the United States and surrounding countries to Liberia. But at the heart, the chaos, the economic disruption, the violence within Liberia did not subside substantially. As a result, Liberians here in the United States have genuine concerns about their return to Liberia. What has happened most recently, because this is an evolving situation, is that Charles Taylor, the President, again, duly elected President, has not renounced all of his prior behaviors because it is strongly suggested that he has been one of the key forces who is creating the havoc in the adjoining nation of Sierra Leone.  All of us have seen horrific photographs of the violence there, of children whose arms and hands have been cut off by warring factions in Sierra Leone. The Revolutionary United Front is one of the key combatants in that country. Part of this is an unholy alliance between Taylor and the Revolutionary United Front for the purpose of creating, not only mischief, but also for exploiting diamond resources within Sierra Leone for the benefit of Taylor and the benefit of others. But all of this, this turmoil, once again, suggests that Liberia is not a place that is a stable working democracy where someone, after 10 years of living in the United States, could return easily and gracefully and immediately.  Last year at this time, after being approached by myself and others, the Attorney General determined that she could not grant TPS again under the law. But she did grant Deferred Enforced Departure, or DED, to Liberians, which meant the Liberians could remain in the United States for another year but essentially they are being deported. It is just stayed, delayed for a while. They have been living in this further uncertainty for the last year.  My legislation would allow them to begin to adjust to a permanent residency status here in the United States, and hopefully, ultimately, after passing all of the hurdles, to become citizens of this country.  They arrived here, as I said, about 10 years ago. They came here with the expectation that they would have a short stay and would be home, back in their communities, back in Liberia, but that expectation was frustrated, not by them but by the violence that continued to break out throughout Liberia.  Now they have established themselves here. They are part and parcel of the community, and they are extremely good neighbors in my State of Rhode Island, as well as in other parts of this country. I believe equity, fairness, and justice require that we offer these individuals the opportunity to become permanent resident aliens and ultimately, as I said, I hope they will take the opportunity to become citizens of this country.  Our immigration policy is an interesting one, idiosyncratic in many cases, but it is important to point out there are several other countries around the globe that have already dealt with a problem like this: Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Spain, and Great Britain. After a certain length of time, even if you are there temporarily--certainly 10 years is a sufficient time--you can, in fact, adjust your status to something akin to permanent resident of the United States and pursue citizenship.  We have done this before. We have made these types of adjustments for other national groups that have been here and for many of the same reasons: Simple justice, length of stay, connections to the community of America, continued turmoil in their own countries. For example, in 1988 we passed a law to allow the Attorney General to adjust to permanent status 4,996 Polish individuals who had been here for 4 years, 387 Ugandans who had been here for 10 years, 565 Afghanis who had been here for 8 years, and 1,180 Ethiopians who had been here for 11 years.  The 102nd Congress passed a law which allowed Chinese nationals who had been granted deferred enforced departure after Tiananmen Square to adjust to permanent residency. Over the next 4 years, 52,968 Chinese changed their status.  In the last Congress, we passed legislation known as NACARA. Under this law, 150,000 Nicaraguans, 5,000 Cubans, 200,000 El Salvadorans, and 50,000 Guatemalans who had been living in the United States since the eighties were eligible to adjust to permanent residency status. A separate law allows Haitians who were granted DED to adjust to permanent residency.  As one can see, we are not setting a precedent. We are doing what we have done before in response to similar motivations: fairness, length of stay here, turmoil in the homeland to which we propose to deport these individuals.  Another important point is why we believe we have a special obligation to Liberia. As my colleagues know--and I have mentioned before--this is a country that shares so much with the United States.  In 1822, a group of freed slaves in the United States began to settle the coast of western Africa with the assistance of private American philanthropic groups and at the behest of the U.S. Government. In 1847, these settlers established the Republic of Liberia, the first independent country in Africa. Five percent of the population of Liberia traces their ancestry to former American slaves. They modeled their constitution after ours. And they used the dollar as their currency.  Before the 1990 civil war, the United States was Liberia's leading trading partner and major donor of assistance. When Liberia was torn apart by civil war, they turned to the United States for help. We recognized that special relationship, and we offered aid to Liberia. We offered it, as I said, to assist those who were fleeing destruction and devastation. We should continue to do that. We have had a special relationship with Liberia over history, and we have formed a special relationship throughout this country with those communities of Liberians who have been here for a decade and who seek to stay.  Again, this is some of the legislation we could be considering, some of the legislation with which we could be dealing if we had a process that allowed that free flow of legislation to the floor.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that two letters be printed in theRecord: A letter from Bill Gray, President of the College Fund, and a letter from the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service.  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                             The College Fund,                                      Fairfax, VA, April 19, 2000.     Hon. Jack Reed,     U.S. Senator, Senate Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Reed: I write to let you know of the great      importance I attach to the passage of legislation that would      allow Liberian nationals already in the U.S. for almost ten      years to become permanent residents. Your legislation, S.      656, the Liberian Immigration Fairness Act, would accomplish      this important goal.       The United States has always shared a special relationship      with Liberia, a country created in 1822 by private American      philanthropic organizations for freed American slaves. In      December 1989, civil war erupted in Liberia and continued to      rage for seven years. USAID estimates that of Liberia's 2.1      million inhabitants, 150,000 were killed, 700,000 were      internally displaced and 480,000 became refugees. To date,      very little of the destroyed infrastructure has been rebuilt      and sporadic violence continues.       When the civil war began in 1989, thousands of Liberians      fled to the United States. In 1991, the Attorney General      granted Temporary Protected Status (TPS) to these Liberians,      providing temporary relief from deportation since ongoing      armed conflict prevented their safe return home. For the next      seven years, the Attorney General annually renewed this TPS      status. Last summer, Attorney General Reno announced that      this TPS designation would end on September 28, 1999.      Throughout 1999, Liberians faced the prospect that they would      be uprooted and forced to return to a country still ravaged      by violence and repression. However, on September 27, 1999,      President Clinton granted non-citizen Liberians living in the      United States a reprieve, allowing them to remain in the      country and work for one additional year.       The Department of Justice estimates that approximately      10,000 Liberians are living in the United States under      protection of our immigration laws. There are significant      Liberian populations in Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, Maryland,      Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Georgia, Minnesota, Rhode      Island, and North Carolina. For the past decade, while      ineligible for government benefits, Liberians have been      authorized to work and are required to pay taxes. They      married, bought homes, and placed their children, many of      whom were born in this country, in school. Despite their      positive contributions to our communities, their immigration      status does not offer Liberians the opportunity to share      fully in our society by becoming citizens.       When they first arrived, these nationals of Liberia hoped      that their stay in this country would indeed be temporary.      But ten years have passed and they have moved on with their      lives. Liberians have lived in this immigration limbo longer      than any other group in the United States. More importantly,      other immigrant groups who were given temporary haven in the      United States for much shorter periods have been allowed to      adjust to permanent residency: Afghans, Ethiopians, Poles and      Ugandans after five yeas and 53,000 Chinese after just three      years. It is time to end the uncertainty that Liberians have      lived with for so long. It is time to allow them the      opportunity to adjust to permanent residency as our nation      has allowed others before them.       Following our Nation's tradition of fairness and decency, I      am pleased to add my personal support to S. 656 in order to      offer Liberians the protection they deserve.           Sincerely,     William H. Gray III.                                  ____                                          Lutheran Immigration and                                              Refugee Service,                                    Washington, DC, March 7, 2000.     Hon. Jack Reed,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Reed: On behalf of the undersigned      organizations, we urge your support of the Liberian Refugee      Immigration Fairness Act of 1999 (S. 656). This Act would      provide relief and protection for some 15,000 Liberian civil      war refugees and their families now residing in the United      States.       Since March of 1991, over 10,000 Liberian civil war      refugees have resided in the United States. Recently, they      were granted an extension of their temporary exclusion from      deportation when President Clinton ordered the Attorney      General to defer their enforced departure. Granted for one      year, the order is set to expire in September of this year.      Against this general background, legislation has been      introduced by Senator Jack Reed (D-RI) to adjust the status      of certain Liberian nationals to that of lawful permanent      residence. We strongly support Senator Reed's proposed      legislation, S. 656. We view this bill as being vital to the      basic protection of and fairness towards Liberian civil war      refugees.                             justifications       The Liberian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act of 1999 would      protect Liberian refugees and their families from being      forcibly returned to a nation where their life and freedom      may still be threatened. Even the Human Rights reports from      the U.S. Department of State and Amnesty International have      called attention to the continuing pattern of abuses against      citizens by the Liberian government. Additionally, the      legislation would protect against the dissolution of families      as Liberian parents are forced to choose between leaving      their American born children in the U.S. or taking them back      to Liberia if they are deported. Further, after nearly a      decade of living in the U.S., Liberians have established real      ties in their local communities and as such, forced      deportation would simply be wrong. Finally, it is imperative      that Liberian civil war refugees be accorded the same      favorable treatment as other refugee groups seeking relief in      the United States.       We remain appreciative to Congress for its continued      attention paid to the general issue of immigration relief for      those in need, and we trust the same will be devoted to the      Liberians. We appreciate your consideration of these      comments.           Sincerely,                                           Ralston H. Deffenbaugh,                                                        President.       On behalf of:       Nancy Schestack, Director, Catholic Charities Immigration      Legal Services Program.
