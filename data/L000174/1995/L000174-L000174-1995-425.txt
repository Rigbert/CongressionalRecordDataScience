President, I rise today in tribute to Gen. Carl Mundy, who retires this Friday after 38 years of service to our Nation.  Carl Mundy has made his career around a title that we as Americans have held sacred for over 200 years: leader of Marines. He was commissioned in 1957, at the height of the cold war, and served a tour in Vietnam, where he was wounded and decorated for bravery.  Carl Mundy has had the difficult job of leading the corps during the difficult transition out of the cold war and into the uncertainties of today's world. But under his leadership, as the Marines have reduced their forces, they have maintained the professionalism and esprit that have been demonstrated throughout our history.  On Carl Mundy's watch, Marines participated in dangerous operations around the world that were executed with such quiet excellence that many Americans barely notice. The mission in Somalia was fraught with danger, and from the initial intervention to the recent quiet withdrawal of U.N. forces, General Mundy's Marines were there.  The Haiti invasion was equally dangerous, and our Nation's Marines were up to the task of bringing democracy back to that poor nation.  Most recently, Marines showed their flexibility and bravery by rescuing downed Air Force pilot Scott O'Grady from hostile Bosnia, an extraordinary feat that demonstrated why I call the Marines our 911 force--they are the ones you call in the middle of the night and who are ready to go.  Throughout it all, Carl Mundy's determined leadership was there, extending from the halls of the Pentagon down to the fresh privates who march with that unique Marine swagger off the famous drill fields of Parris Island, SC. I know, because my son Mark was one of those young privates.  The life of a Marine is difficult, and when Marines are gone for months at a time doing dangerous work, no one bears that burden more than the families who are left back at home. They are the unsung heroes of our military, and I want to pay special tribute to Carl's wife Linda, and his children Elizabeth, Carl III, and Timothy. I know that Carl is proud that both his sons wear the Marine uniform, and that serves as further testimony to the sense of duty that pervades the Mundy family.  Carl may come across as the prototypical square jawed Marine, but I know him as a man with a sense of humor and the confidence to laugh at himself. I also have it on good authority that he has a secret life as Carl Mundy, the country and western songwriter who can work a mean cut bucket bass and can sing every verse of ``Mountain Dew.''  Mr. President, I have gotten to know General Mundy in the last 4 years through my work on the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. I have found him to be a vigorous advocate for the Marine Corps and, I am proud to say, a friend. On behalf of many of us here in the Senate, I want to extend my sincere thanks to Carl Mundy for a career of service to our Nation, and offer our best wishes to the Mundy family for a fulfilling and well-deserved retirement.                          ____________________
