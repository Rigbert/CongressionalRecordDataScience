Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  I have voted every time to continue our process against my leadership. I was not going to say anything, but when you referred to the bridge-to-nowhere as a scandal, when you voted for it four times, most of the people in this room voted for it four times. It was always transparent. I was always proud of my earmarks. I believe in earmarks, always have, as long as they are exposed.  But don't you ever call that a scandal.                      Announcement by the Chairman
