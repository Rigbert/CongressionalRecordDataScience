 President, I rise to submit a resolution on Immigrant Heritage Month, which is recognized every June. This resolution honors the accomplishments and contributions of immigrants, pledges to celebrate our immigrant heritage, and joins the American people in commemorating our immigrant roots.  Since our founding, the United States has been a nation of immigrants. Immigrants from all over the world have sought to start anew in the United States. Whether they were seeking to practice their religious and political beliefs without interference or obtain new professional or educational opportunities, the United States has been a refuge for those seeking a better life.  We have benefited tremendously as a result. Immigrants have played a vital role in our Nation's history, shaping the economic, cultural, and social development of our society. Immigrants have helped build our nation's cities and railroads, developed some of our most cutting-edge businesses, and fueled inventions from the telegraph to the smartphone.  Individuals and families from Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, and the Americas have all contributed to our Nation's fabric, enhancing the diversity and vibrancy of our communities and forming the melting pot for which our country is known.  In addition, immigrants have defended our Nation since the Revolutionary War. As of this month, over 30,000 lawful permanent residents are currently serving in the United States Armed Forces. I imagine many more immigrants would join as well if they were afforded the opportunity. Between 2002 and 2015, more than 102,000 immigrants have become U.S. citizens while serving in the U.S. Military in Iraq, Afghanistan, Germany, Japan, and elsewhere.  Our Nation's food supply also depends upon the work of immigrants. Over 70 percent of agricultural workers in the U.S. are foreign born. These workers help feed American families and support U.S. farms and businesses. Without their help, we would struggle to harvest our Nation's crops and feed our people.  Immigrants also have made impressive contributions in business and technology. Immigrants or children-of-immigrants have started more than 25 percent of all new businesses in the U.S., including more than 40 percent of Fortune 500 companies. These businesses have created tens of millions of American jobs, and they exceed over $4.5 trillion in revenue annually. In Silicon Valley, over 44 percent of technology startups had at least one immigrant founder between 2006 and 2012.  One of our country's greatest exports, our culture, has been enhanced by immigrants from all corners of the globe. From Broadway to Hollywood, our country's unique contributions in the performing arts, art, music, literature, media, fashion, and cuisine have been shaped by immigrants.  I urge my colleagues to join me in observing Immigrant Heritage Month to recognize the contributions of immigrants to the United States, as well as our nation's strong immigrant heritage.                          ____________________
