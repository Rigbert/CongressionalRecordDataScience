Chairman, I would like to engage in a colloquy with the Chairman of the committee.  Mr. Chairman, I thank you for the opportunity to discuss one of ISTEA's most vital safety initiatives, the rail-crossing safety program.  Last year, I testified before the Subcommittee on Surface Transportation in support of legislation which I have introduced to change the formula for ISTEA's rail-crossing safety program which allocates funds to States based on a number of rail-crossing accidents and fatalities.  Although BESTEA does not change the formula by which these funds are distributed, I do want to commend my colleague for increasing by 41 percent funds allocated to the highway rail-crossing safety program in BESTEA. As this bill moves to conference, I ask my colleague to ensure that that priority funding be maintained.  Several hundred people are killed, and thousands more injured, every year in the United States as a result of vehicle-train collisions at highway-rail grade crossings. Just last week, a resident of Lake Station, Indiana died when a train struck his car at a rail crossing without gates, marked only by stop signs.  Although BESTEA does not change the formula by which these funds are distributed, I do want to commend you for increasing, by 41%, the funds allocated to the Highway-Rail Grade Crossing Safety Program in BESTEA. As this bill moves to conference, I ask you to ensure that this priority funding is maintained.
