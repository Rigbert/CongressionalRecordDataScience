President, I rise today to join my colleague Senator Kohl in introducing the Ballistics, Law Assistance, and Safety Technology Act. This legislation would build on the success of the existing National Integrated Ballistic Information Network by requiring, for the first time, ballistics testing of all new firearms so that law enforcement can more effectively trace bullets or cartridge casings recovered from shootings.  As we have learned from the horrific series of sniper shootings in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area over the past week, law enforcement already has the technology to link bullets or casings found at separate crime scenes back to a single gun. Every firearm has individual characteristics that are as unique to it as fingerprints are to human beings. When a gun is fired, it transfers these characteristics, in the form of small, sometimes microscopic scratches and dents, to the projectiles and cartridge casings fired in it.  These unique fingerprints offer a great crime-solving tool for law enforcement. When bullets or cartridge casings are found at a crime scene, firearms examiners can use the marks for comparison, to determine whether or not the bullets or casings were expelled from a suspect's firearm. If a firearm is recovered at the scene, a test fire of the weapon creates example bullets and cartridge casings for comparison to those found in or near a victim. Bullets and casings found at one crime scene can also be compared with those found at another in order to link the crimes.  On the national level, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms recently combined their ballistics identification programs into the National Integrated Ballistic Information Network, or NIBIN, which provides for the installation and networking of automated ballistic imaging equipment in state and local law enforcement agencies across the country. Because thousands more pieces of recovered ballistic evidence can be compared using digital automation than would be possible using only manual comparisons, links between otherwise seemingly unrelated crimes are discovered, and investigative leads are generated for police followup.  Ballistics imaging technology is already demonstrating its potential to revolutionize criminal investigation. But a major tool for law enforcement is missing here, and that is a national ballistics fingerprint system that would enable law enforcement to trace crime scene evidence back to a suspect. The current NIBIN system provides valuable information on guns that have been used in crime, but unless such a gun was used in a previous crime for which ballistics evidence was collected and entered, the bullets or casings from the crime scene will find no match in the NIBIN system. No ballistics data are available for most of the estimated 200 million guns in this country, and no ballistics fingerprint information is being collected on the three to five million new guns coming into commerce in the United States each year. As a result, law enforcement usually has no way to trace the evidence back to a specific firearm and, ultimately, a suspect.  The bill we are introducing today would give law enforcement the tools it needs to fight violent crime by requiring gun manufacturers and importers to test fire all new firearms, prepare ballistics images of the fired bullet and cartridge casings, and make these records available to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms for entry in a computerized database which would be shared with state and local law enforcement agencies across the country. The bill also provides $20 million per year for ATF to help gun manufacturers and importers comply with these requirements by installing or upgrading ballistics equipment at or near the places of business of manufacturers and importers.  I have no doubt that the National Rifle Association and some in the gun industry are going to say that what we are proposing is tantamount to establishing a national registry of gun owners. I want to point out that this bill does not require the submission to law enforcement of any information beyond the ballistic images produced by test firing the gun. The names of any people or businesses that buy guns from federally licensed manufacturers or importers will continue to be kept in the files of those manufacturers and importers just as the law requires today. Law enforcement would only have access to this information in the context of a criminal investigation, for example when the evidence from a crime scene matches a ballistics fingerprint record for a gun produced and sold by a certain manufacturer or importer.  We should have taken these steps years ago. If we had, maybe the ballistic evidence from this week's sniper shootings would match an image in the law enforcement database, and we could save lives by identifying and arresting this cold-blooded killer before he strikes again. But the gun lobby has prevented the creation of an effective ballistics database by portraying this as a national gun registry. In fact, they have been so successful that even though two States, Maryland and New York, have created a ballistics fingerprint system for all guns sold in those States, the ATF's NIBIN system is not even allowed to access those records, nor can law enforcement agencies in other States look at the records through the NIBIN network. We will never know how many violent crimes may go unsolved because of this insane restriction on law enforcement's ability to do its job.  We have a responsibility to give law enforcement authorities the tools they need to quickly track down and bring to justice those who would use firearms to prey on our communities. The bill we are introducing today will do that by taking full advantage of the crime-fighting benefits that ballistic imaging and analysis can provide. I urge all of my colleagues to support this important legislation.                                 ______                                       By
