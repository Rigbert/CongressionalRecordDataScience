 President, we are prepared to accept Shelby amendment No. 1230, the fertilizer research study, and I understand that the Republican side is willing to accept the Heflin amendment numbered 1241 related to sarin gas.  I ask unanimous consent that both of them be called up, and then at the appropriate time, I am willing to accept them both en bloc.
