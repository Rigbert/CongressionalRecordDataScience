It is a good one.  Frankly, we could do very well in this Senate this year if we could protect children through better managed care legislation and give all of our citizens a real voice in our health care decisions through an ombudsman program. This will be a very satisfactory and very successful endeavor for all of us in the Senate.  With that, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from New Hampshire.
