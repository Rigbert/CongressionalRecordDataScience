Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to introduce a bill to amend the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971 at the request of the Alaska Federation of Natives. This bill is the result of the work of the legislative council of the Alaska Federation of Natives to correct existing technical problems with the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [ANCSA]. I am introducing the bill to begin the review process and to receive input of the State of Alaska, various Federal agencies, Native entities, and individuals affected by this bill. I fully expect the input process to refine and expand the legislation, and invite such input.  I expect to work closely with George Miller, my ranking minority member to resolve any differences we may have with specific provisions in the bill. Further, we look forward to receiving further suggestions for additions to this package and working with Alaska Senators Ted Stevens and Frank Murkowski to perfect the package. Ultimately, it is our intention to investigate and resolve controversial provisions which would prevent final passage of this bill.  This bill makes a number of technical changes to ANCSA which addresses issues not anticipated at the time of passage of ANCSA. As the legislation is designed to resolve specific problems, it contains several provisions, and will probably contain more as a result of the hearing and input process. To offer a flavor of the nature of the legislation, a few illustrations are in order.  For example, the bill would reinstate approximately 50,000 acres which were taken away by an Executive order in 1929 to the Elim Native Corp. This provision would reinstate and allow the Elim Native Corp. to receive their land entitlement selections.  Another provision would extend the exemption period from estate and gift tax for stock through its period of inalienability.  Another would amend ANCSA to correct an inconsistency in current Federal law by allowing regional corporations to elect to acquire oil, gas, and coal estates reserved to the Federal Government beneath native allotments surrounded by or adjacent to subsurface lands convey to the corporations pursuant to section 12(a) or (b) of ANCSA.  Mr. Speaker, I offer this bill at this time to begin the process of reviewing each of these important provisions and others which affect Alaskans. I welcome input to add to, subtract from and amend this proposal so that a non-controversial substitute may be offered at a later date.                          ____________________
