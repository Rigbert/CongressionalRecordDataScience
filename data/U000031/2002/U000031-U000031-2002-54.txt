In the days past, and, obviously, in the days ahead, we have some big votes next week if we take this welfare reform bill up. This is an important component of that. I am delighted we passed it out of my committee, the Committee on Energy and Commerce, on a strong vote of 35 to 17, and we have to make sure we carry the day when we take this issue to the House floor for debate next week.
