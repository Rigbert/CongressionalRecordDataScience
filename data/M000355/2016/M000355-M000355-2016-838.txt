 President, yesterday the Senate passed the American Manufacturing Competitiveness Act, a bipartisan bill that--as my friend, the chairman of the Finance Committee, observed--shows our ``commitment to helping our economy with more jobs, bigger paychecks, and a stronger American manufacturing base.''  Later today the President will sign into law the Defend Trade Secrets Act, another Senate-passed bill that promotes our economy and helps create and retain American jobs. Both of these bills are the result of the work of two dedicated committee chairmen, Senator Hatch and Senator Grassley. They are also the result of a Senate that is back to work for the American people.  I thank the Finance Committee and Judiciary Committee chairmen for their efforts to advance these bills, just as I thank Senators Burr, Portman, Toomey, and Flake for their diligent work to help support American businesses and the economy through their efforts to pass the American Manufacturing Competitiveness Act.                          ____________________
