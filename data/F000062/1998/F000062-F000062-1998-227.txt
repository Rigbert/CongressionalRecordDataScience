 President, I am pleased to support Senator Murray's amendment today to create a reserve fund for adding 100,000 public school teachers and to reduce class sizes in the early grades to 18 students per classroom.                  california's schools are overwhelmed  I come from the State that has some of the largest class sizes in the Nation in our public schools. In 1994, California's schools averaged about 30 students per class, the highest in the country. In 1995-1996, when the average pupil teacher ratio for all grades, elementary and secondary in the Nation was 17.3 students per teacher, in California, it was 24.0.  In the 1993-1994 school year, in elementary schools, California had 29.4 students per class while the U.S. average was 24.1. For secondary schools in 1993-1994, the average California classroom had 29.7 students while the average U.S. classroom had 23.6 students, according to the National Center for Educational Statistics.  When one computes total teaching staff per pupil, again, California's number are substantially higher than national rates, says NCES. In 1995-1996, California's pupil-teacher ratio was 24.0, compared to the U.S. average of 17.3 pupils per teacher. The 1997 estimate likewise has California exceeding national rates: California, 22.7 students per teacher; U.S. 17.0 students per teacher.  Today, many classes have 40 or more students per teacher. Our students and teachers are crammed into every available closet, cafeteria and temporary building available. At John Muir Elementary School in San Bruno, one class spent much of the year on the stage of the school's multipurpose room as it waited for portable rooms to arrive. Los Angeles Unified School District has 560,000 seats for 681,000 students.  To add to the problem, California will have a school enrollment rate between 1997 and 2007 of 15.7 percent, triple the national rate of 4.1 percent. We will have the largest enrollment increase of all states during the next ten years. By 2007, our enrollment will have increased by 35.3 percent. To put it another way, California needs to build seven new classrooms a day at 25 students per class just to keep up with the surge in student enrollment.  The California Department of Education says that we need to add about 327 schools over the next three years, just to keep pace with the projected growth. But these phenomenal construction rates will only maintain current use. They do not begin to relieve overcrowding, our current large class sizes.  Fortunately, California has embarked on an effort to reduce class size, providing state funds to local school districts to hire more teachers for grades K through 3. The goal is to cut class sizes from 28.6 students to no more than 20 students in grades K through 3. California is spending $2.5 billion over two years to cut class size and the annual cost of this reform will be about $1.5 billion. California has created at least 17,000 new classes and over half of the State's 1.9 million eligible students are now in classes of 20 or fewer students. A similar federal effort, like President Clinton's initiative and Senator Murray's amendment, can complement California's effort.                    smaller classes improve learning  Studies show that student achievement improves when class sizes are reduced.  California's education reforms relied on a Tennessee study called Project STAR, in which 6,500 kindergartners were put in 330 classes of different sizes. The students stayed in small classes for four years and then returned to larger ones in the fourth grade. The test scores and behavior of students in the small classes were better than those of children in the larger classes. A similar 1997 study by Rand found that smaller classes benefit students from low-income families the most.  Sandy Sutton, a teacher in Los Angeles's Hancock Park Elementary School, used to have 32 students in her second grade class. In the fall of 1997, she had 20. She says she can spend more time on individualized reading instruction with each student. She can now more readily draw out shy children and more easily identify slow readers early in the school year.  The November 25, 1997, Sacramento Bee reported that when teachers in the San Juan Unified School Districts started spending more time with students, test scores rose and discipline problems and suspensions dropped. A San Juan teacher, Ralphene Lee, said, ``This is the most wonderful thing that has happened in education in my lifetime.''  Other teachers say that students in smaller classes pay better attention, ask more questions and have fewer discipline problems.  A San Diego initiative to bring down class sizes found that smaller classes mean better classroom management; more individual instruction; more contact with parents; more time for team teaching; more diverse instructional methods; and a higher morale.  Smaller classes make a difference.                 smaller classes require good teachers  Class sizes cannot be reduced without hiring more teachers. And these teachers must be trained and credentialed teachers.  California has 21,000 teachers on emergency credentials. Unfortunately, in California nearly 22,000 of the 240,000 public school teachers in California are not fully credentialed or have not passed a basic skills test. Half of California's math and science teachers did not minor in those subjects in college, yet they are teaching. The October 13, 1997, U.S. New and World Report reported that in Los Angeles, ``new teachers have included Nordstrom clerks, a former clown, and several chiropractors.''  California will need up to 300,000 new teachers in the next decade because of our escalating enrollment. A 1996 analysis by Policy Analysis for California Education found that my state could only expect about 9,000 new credentialed teachers per year in current trends continue.  Without good teachers, no plan, however visionary or revolutionary, can improve student learning. But sadly, a November 1997 report card by the National Commission on Teaching and America's Future ranked California near the bottom of states in the quality of our public school teaching force because we have some of the highest proportions of uncertified or undertrained teachers, particularly in math and science. The Commission defined ``well-qualified'' as a teacher with full certification and a major in their assigned field. By this measure, only 65 percent of the state's teachers meet the standard. Nationally, that figure is72 percent. In California, 46 percent of high school math teaches did not minor in math. The national average is 28 percent.                               conclusion  There is hardly a more worthy endeavor than strengthening our schools' ability to better educate our children. The Murray amendment before us today can make an important contribution in partnership with state and local efforts by providing extra resources to reduce class sizes and hire more teachers.
