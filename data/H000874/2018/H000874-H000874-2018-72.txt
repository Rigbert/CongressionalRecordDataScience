Speaker, it is my time.  This is the most autocratic Congress in which I have served. It has had the most closed rules. And the majority leader brings to the floor his version of what he wants to say and how he wants to characterize it. No consultation with us, no amendments allowed, and then we say we are not going to vote against ICE agents. We honor the work that they do. We honor the sacrifices they make. We honor the critical role they play in defending our country and enforcing our laws.                              {time}  1145  But, Mr. Leader, we are not going to take it or leave it. We are not going to vote ``no'' on a resolution that purports simply to honor our ICE agents. If it were simply that, it may have been a different matter.  But, Mr. Speaker, I would hope that the majority leader would stop talking about--there are some people in his party who say absolutely absurd things at the very highest level of his party, and I haven't brought them up.  Mr. Speaker, I asked a simple question. The Speaker of this House said he was going to bring issues to this floor individually, vote them up or down. I asked the leader: Will you bring a bill to the floor which will stop the separation of children from their parents? He says he did. 113 of his colleagues on his side of the aisle thought it was a bad bill and voted ``no.''  Mr. McCARTHY. Will the gentleman yield?
