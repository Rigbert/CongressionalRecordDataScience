President, there are a few of us who want to come down and talk a little bit about specific things in our States that are reaching a crisis point by having to participate in ObamaCare. But before doing that I want to make just one comment to make sure it is in the Record and that we can talk about the election that took place over in Afghanistan.  We have had quite a time over there. We have lost actually 2,197 of our own troops in Afghanistan, and we have had about ten times that many who have been injured. So it has been a real crisis for a lot of people. For a long period of time things had been going well. I think when the decision was made by this President to pull everything out at a given time things started turning around a little bit. Now they are in the middle of a--in Afghanistan the election took place. I know we are not supposed to say this, and there is no official position--I want to make that clear--by the United States of America, but to me there are two people running against each other. There is a good guy and a bad guy--that holdover from the old administration, whose name is Ashraf Ghani, who is Karzai's chosen one, who is one who would continue to go in a lack of leadership and not take advantage of the opportunities they have right now; then Abdullah Abdullah is the other one.  My concern with this--and I expressed this concern on the Senate floor about 3 weeks ago. I said: I know we have deadlines. We are going to have a primary, which we already had. Then we are going to have a primary runoff. Then on June 22, which is 2 weeks from today, there will be an official declaration as to who won the primary runoff.  The Presiding Officer is fully familiar with this. We talked about that this morning. Well, in this runoff situation, we have found a lot of discrepancies. It seems to me that while I consider one guy to be the good one and one to be the bad one, all of the mistakes that were made and the irregularities that were found were found in favor of Ashraf Ghani, as opposed to Abdullah Abdullah.  Let me give you an example. In one of the provinces--it was the Wardak Province--Ghani's vote count went from about 17,000 in April to 170,000 in the runoff. Stop and think about that. That is almost mathematically impossible. When you consider the number of registered voters there, this number actually exceeds the number of registered voters. So you went from 17,000 in the same province when they went through the primary back in April, and then that jumped up by tenfold to 170,000 in the runoff. That is an increase of 1,000 percent over April's result. All of those, of course, were in an area where--it is in a part of the country where Ghani's vote was more favorable.  Then the other thing I think is unprecedented, I think we all know in our own States, whether it is in West Virginia, Oklahoma, or any of the rest of them, the vote percentage turnout is less in rural areas than it is in urban areas. In urban areas you have to go next door to vote. It is very convenient. In many rural areas, certainly in my State of Oklahoma, you have to drive maybe 30 or 40 miles to vote. So the percentage turnout is less. It happens that Ghani's support comes from the rural areas. In this runoff election that just took place, they had a 75-percent turnout in those areas. At the same time, in the urban areas, they only had a 24-percent turnout.  First of all, I do not think we can name one election in history that had a larger turnout in a rural area than it did the urban areas in the same election. So we are looking at something that could not happen and logically it did not happen. That was something that certainly worked in the favor of Ghani's election.  Right now everyone agrees on one thing; that is, that the election was at least falsified. If not, it was just a rigged election. There are a lot of organizations out there--the European Union, for example, and the U.N. and other groups such as OSCE, which is the Office of Security and Cooperation in Europe--that all agree we should have an audit of this election--at least an audit which should include some independent source. So I want to get on record now, because I fear if nothing is done in the next 14 days, he will be declared the winner, with these discrepancies, I think that would be doing a great disservice to the people of Afghanistan. They would lose faith in their system, because what I am saying here on the Senate floor they already know.                              Health Care  Let me jump into another area I am very interested in, as is every Member of this body. I can remember back in the 1990s we had what was referred to as ``Hillary health care.'' At that time, there were several members of Parliament--one of them was up here and we had a hearing. That person said: You know, it is hard for us in the United Kingdom to understand why we have had this type of socialized medicine for as many years as I can remember--this is his quote. He said:       Yet we are now finally realizing that your system over in      the United States is a much better system. We are now      starting to discard the whole socialized medicine system.  That is something we saw way back in the 1990s. It came again with the Affordable Care Act or ObamaCare. We have a lot of examples in my State of Oklahoma, heartbreaking accounts. Since the rollout last fall, my office has been flooded with stories from Oklahomans who found ObamaCare to be one massive broken promise from President Obama.  These stories include a woman from Broken Arrow, OK, who reported a 20-percent increase in her monthly premiums.  A father from Owasso, OK, shared a story--I talked to all of these individuals personally--of his son and daughter who serve as missionaries in Indonesia. Their health care deductibles in the United States have more than doubled from $1,200 per person to $2,600 a person.  One teacher, a public schoolteacher from Copan, OK, who teaches--actually not in public school, it is adjunct college classes. She shared that not only did she have her work hours cut but is now paying $950 a month in premiums for health care with a $6,000 deductible.  Another teacher from Sallisaw, OK--that happens to be the strawberry capital of the world in case you guys did not know that--shared that her deductible increased by $1,000 from last year.  A man from Noble told us his company modified health plans to match the ObamaCare requirements. It is a company he owns. He says these changes cost him a 40-percent increase in his out-of-pocket expenses and his premium costs.  A man from Tulsa who lives actually in my same neighborhood has a family of five. He works for a small business. He shared with us that he is now paying $4,000 more for insurance than he had paid a year ago.  This November, a new open enrollment period will begin in at least one State, Virginia, which has already reported an astounding 22-percent increase over the past year.  All of that is happening. People from any State, any of the 50 States, could come down and talk about the individual cases in their States. We have one good thing that is going on right now. We have a great attorney general by the name of Scott Pruitt. Scott Pruitt, the attorney general from Oklahoma, has a lawsuit. It is called Pruitt v. Burwell. Oklahoma has standing to proceed on a case that the IRS acted beyond Congress's intent in its effort to impose penalties in States that have Federal exchanges.  We have 36 States that have Federal exchanges. These exchanges are--well, first of all, the administration had a motion to dismiss. It was overruled 11 months ago, so this is a real case. The State has asked for summary judgment.  Success in this case would mean the dismantling of the ObamaCare employer and individual mandates for all 36 States that have at least a partially federally facilitated exchange. I guess you can say it might end up being our attorney general from the State of Oklahoma is going to be the one who is going to be the most successful in doing something about this thing we should have learned a long time ago was not going to work.  I have a personal interest in this, having had--there are states or countries that have socialized medicine. We have Canada, we have Great Britain, we have many other countries. In making a study of these, you find there is limited coverage for people when they reach a certain age.  I see our good friend from Wyoming who is a medical doctor. He has given his second opinion many times. In one of those he talked about you get past a certain age, you are unable to get the treatment. I happen to have had occasion to have four bypasses at an age when in some countries I would not have qualified.  It is something we have been very active in. We are going to hopefully be the heroes from the State of Oklahoma in offering relief to at least 36 of our States.  I yield the floor.
