  I spoke about the necessity of the Finance Committee having the freedom to use revenue we can raise by closing these tax loopholes, and the necessity of getting a bipartisan bill out of committee to do it. I think the Senator from North Dakota spoke very well about some of the problems we have with corporations and schemers and scammers using the Tax Code to avoid taxation, by ridiculous things like leasing a subway for a city in the United States, where there is no risk or economic substance to the process. We want to close those loopholes.  I thought I ought to bring to the attention of the Senate one of the bipartisan bills out of committee that was using some of those loophole closings. They definitely have an impact upon some major industries and jobs in this country where they are going to be hurt, because the World Trade Organization has ruled contrary to our trade agreements, the foreign sales corporation, and the extraterritorial income provisions we have had to make to make our business competitive with European business. Since that is ruled out, a lot of jobs in major corporations--Microsoft and Boeing, to name a couple--are going to be hurt and be uncompetitive because of that.  We are taking some of the loophole closing money that is available to offset the revenue, to reduce corporate tax from 35 down to 32, so our businesses can be competitive. We can save jobs at Microsoft and Boeing which would otherwise be uncompetitive as a result of the foreign World Trade Organization ruling.  I don't want the Senate Finance Committee's hands to be tied by a scheme that thinks this money can be used four or five times and can be spent on domestic programs, when we have to have this money to offset very important tax provisions we want to get passed. Saving jobs through this JOBS bill that was before the Senate last week, and will be up again in 2 weeks, is an ideal place to use that revenue.  I yield the floor.
