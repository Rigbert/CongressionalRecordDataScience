President, on September 5, 1995, York County Technical College opened its doors in a hotel in Wells, ME, with five associate's degree and certificate programs and 156 students. Now known as York County Community College, the college in 2015 has three campuses, more than 30 programs, and some 1,700 full and part-time students. I congratulate this remarkable institution for 20 years of contributions to the people of Maine's southernmost county and to our entire State.  This truly is a community effort. In the years before the school was established, business, civic, and education leaders in York County formed Partners for Progress, a coalition to address the challenge of developing a better-trained workforce for a fast-changing global economy. The demand for technical education was immediately apparent: by 1997, in just its third year, the numbers for enrollment and programs both tripled. In recent years, York County Community College has twice been named one of the fastest-growing community colleges in the Nation.  In 2003, Maine's outstanding technical college system expanded its mission to become a community college system that enhances skills, strengthens our State's economy, and increases access to college. Nearly one-half of York County Community College students are first-generation college students, and some 40 percent of graduates go on to enroll at a 4-year college. Under the leadership of President Barbara Finkelstein, a dedicated faculty and staff, and a committed YCCC Foundation, York County Community College reaches out in many ways. With programs for seniors and students of high school age and younger, lifelong learning is a core part of the school's mission. The Center for Entrepreneurship encourages the innovation that is essential to our economy. Arts and culture offerings and the ``Eggs and Issues'' speakers program enrich the entire community.  The people of Maine are proud of our community college system. The reason is clear: students of all ages and backgrounds are finding affordable tuition and the skills they need to succeed. They are finding real value.  York County Community College is an important part of that success. Since its inception, the college has educated more than 20,000 people in many fields, including medical fields, technology, business management, skilled trades, and many other occupations. It has fueled the economy, created opportunity, and helped improve the quality of life for all. The accomplishments of York County Community College during the past 20 years are inspiring, and I know the best is yet to come.                          ____________________
