This provision also requires an analysis by the U.S. Department of Transportation and the State of Maine to study the effects of the increase on safety, road and bridge durability, energy use, and commerce. The U.S. Department of Transportation will report its findings to Congress. This Maine pilot project does not have any impact on other States' weight laws and regulations.  By way of background, let me explain why this pilot project is needed. Under current law, trucks weighing 100,000 pounds are allowed to travel on the portion of Interstate 95 designated as the Maine Turnpike, which runs from Maine's border with New Hampshire to Augusta, our capital city. At Augusta, the turnpike designation ends, but I-95 proceeds another 200 miles north to Houlton. At Augusta, however, heavy trucks must exit the modern four-lane, limited-access highway and are forced onto smaller, two-lane secondary roads that pass through cities, towns, and villages. The same problem occurs for Maine's other interstates like 295 out of Portland and 395 in the Bangor-Brewer area.  Trucks weighing up to 100,000 pounds are already permitted on interstate highways in New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and New York as well as the Canadian Provinces of New Brunswick and Quebec. The weight limit disparity on various segments of Maine's Interstate Highway System is a significant impediment to commerce, increases wear-and-tear on our secondary roads, and, most important, puts our people needlessly at risk.  Diverting trucks onto these secondary roads raises critical safety concerns. In fact, there have been several accidents, some of which have tragically resulted in death, which have occurred after these large trucks were diverted onto secondary roads and through smaller communities. For example, in May 2007, a 17-year-old high school student from Hampden, ME, lost her life when her car was struck by a heavy truck on route 9. The truck driver could not see the car turning onto that two-lane road as he rounded a corner. Interstate 95 runs less than three-quarters of a mile away, but Federal law prevented the truck from using that modern, divided highway, a highway that was designed to provide ample views of the road ahead.  A year earlier, Lena Gray, an 80-year-old resident of Bangor, was struck and killed by a tractor-trailer as she was crossing a downtown street. Again, that accident would not have occurred had that truck been allowed to use I-95, which runs directly through Bangor.  In June 2004, Wilbur Smiths Associates, a nationally recognized transportation consulting firm, completed a study to examine the impact a federal weight exemption on non-exempt portions of Maine's Interstate Highway System would have on safety, pavement, and bridges. The study found that extending the current truck weight exemption on the Maine Turnpike to all interstate highways in Maine would result in a decrease of 3.2 fatal crashes per year. The study also found that the fatal accident rate on the secondary roads was 10 times higher than on the turnpike, and the injury accident rate was seven times higher.  While improving safety is the key objective, a uniform truck weight limit of 100,000 pounds on Maine's interstate highways also would reduce highway miles, as well as the travel time, necessary to transport freight through Maine, resulting in economic and environmental benefits. Moreover, Maine's extensive network of local roads would be better preserved without the wear and tear of heavy truck traffic.  Interstate 95 north of Augusta, ME, where trucks are currently limited at 80,000 pounds, was originally designed and built for military freight movements to Loring Air Force Base at weights much heavier than 100,000 pounds. Raising the truck weight limit would keep heavy trucks on the interstates, which are designed to carry more weight than the rural State roads.  The argument that 100,000 pound trucks would cause greater road deterioration is misguided. Current Maine law requires that vehicles carrying up to 100,000 pounds on State roads be six-axle combination vehicles. Current Federal law requires that vehicles carrying 80,000 pounds be five-axle. Contrary to erroneous assumptions, six-axle 100,000 pound vehicles are not longer, wider or taller than the five-axle 80,000 pound vehicles. The six-axle 100,000 pound vehicles, which include an addtional set of brakes, allow for greater weight distribution thereby not increasing road wear and tear. Further, stopping distances and safety are in no way diminished, and preliminary data from studies conducted by the Maine State Police support this statement. That is why Maine's Commissioner of Public Safety, the Maine State Troopers Association, and the Maine Association of Police all support this pilot project.  A higher weight limit in Maine will not only preserve our rapidly deteriorating roads, but will provide economic relief to an already struggling trucking industry. Trucks weighing up to 100,000 pounds are permitted on interstate highways in New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and New York as well as the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick and Quebec. Maine truck drivers and the businesses they serve are at a competitive disadvantage.  Last year, I met with Kurt Babineau, a small business owner and second generation logger and trucker from Maine. Like so many of our truckers, Kurt has been struggling with the increasing costs of running his operation. All of the pulpwood his business produces is transported to Verso Paper in Jay, ME, a 165-mile roundtrip. This would be a considerably shorter trip if his trucks were permitted at 100,000 pounds to remain on Interstate 95. Instead, his trucks must travel a less direct route through cities and towns. Kurt estimated that permitting his trucks to travel on all of Interstate 95 would save him 118 gallons of fuel each week. At last year's diesel cost of approximately $4.50 a gallon, and including savings from his drivers spending less time on the trip, he could have saved more than $700 a week, and more than $33,000 and 5,600 gallons of fuel annually. These savings would not only be beneficial to Kurt's bottom line, but also to his employees, his customers, and to our nation as we look for ways to decrease the overall fuel consumption.  An increase of the Federal truck weight limit in Maine is widely supported by public officials throughout Maine, including the Governor, the Maine Association of Police, and the Maine Department of Public Safety, which includes the State Bureau of Highway Safety, the Maine State Police, and the Bureau of Emergency Communications. I have several letters of support from these officials and organizations, which I will submit for the record with my statement. The MaineLegislature also has expressed its support for the change having passed resolutions over the past several years calling on Congress to raise the Federal truck weight limit to 100,000 pounds in Maine. I urge my colleagues to support this important provision in the Fiscal Year 2010 THUD appropriations bill.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                               State of Maine,                               Augusta, Maine, September 10, 2009.     Hon. Daniel Inouye, Chair,     Hon. Thad Cochran, Ranking Member,     Appropriations Committee, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Hon. Patty Murray, Chair,     Hon. Christopher S. Bond, Ranking Member,      Subcommittee on Transportation, HUD and Related Agencies,          U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Inouye, Cochran, Murray and Bond: As the FY      2010 Transportation-HUD Appropriations bill nears debate in      the U.S. Senate, I would like to again express my strong and      unwavering support for Section 194 of the bill, which would      permit the state of Maine to conduct a one-year pilot program      to assess the benefits of allowing increased weight limits      for heavy vehicles traveling on any part of Maine's      Interstate highway system. My support is grounded in my      conviction that this pilot will establish that the higher      weight limits on Maine's Interstates will improve the safety      and efficiency of heavy vehicles operating on Maine Roads.       Currently, on Maine's Interstate highway system, higher      state truck weight limits may be enforced only on Interstate      95 beginning in Kittery and on the Maine Turnpike portion of      I-95, which ends in Augusta. Lower federal truck weight      limits are enforced on all other Maine Interstate highways.      As you know, only the United States Congress can change      Interstate truck weight limits, and MaineDOT has been working      with the Maine Congressional delegation for some time to pass      a federal law to rectify this problem. The current situation      negatively impacts the safety of Maine's highways, the health      of Maine's economy, and the durability of its highways and      bridges. Thus, I strongly support inclusion of section 194 in      the FY 2010 DOT-HUD Appropriations Bill.       Maine has a long history of allowing trucks at 100,000-lbs.      gross vehicle weight (GVW) to operate on the Maine Turnpike      portion of I-95 south of Augusta, with a record of positive      economic, environmental and safety outcomes. An extension of      this practice to the remainder of the Maine Interstate      highway system would divert 100,000-lb. trucks from secondary      roads lined with numerous schools, intersections, driveways      and traffic lights, and put them on the highway      infrastructure that is designed to handle such demands.       A MaineDOT Engineering Opinion signed in June 2008 by five      of our top bridge and infrastructure engineers, including the      department's Chief Engineer with more than 50 years of      highway engineering experience, stated that, ``. . . it is      the professional opinion of the undersigned that Maine's      interstate system can support the addition of the 100,000-     lb. GVW vehicles to Maine's interstate traffic stream,      without any noticeable or significant damage to the      system's infrastructure.''       More specifically, MaineDOT study findings indicated that      an Interstate truck weight exemption would save the State of      Maine between $1.3 million and $2 million annually in bridge      and pavement costs. A companion 2004 Maine DOT study of the      currently exempted Maine Turnpike estimated that the federal      truck weight exemption on that highway, which allows higher      state weight limits, saves the state between $2.1 million and      $3.2 million annually in bridge and pavement costs. Also, the      increased pavement consumption of a six-axle combination      truck compared with the five-axle truck is relatively small      due to the advantage of adding an axle to offset the weight      increase and to the reduced number of trips by the loaded      vehicle. A federal truck weight exemption would annually      remove an estimated 7.8 million loaded truck-miles of travel      from Maine's primary and secondary road system, diverting the      traffic to the safer Interstate highway system.       From an environmental standpoint, the federal truck weight      exemption would reduce Maine's and the nation's dependence on      foreign oil by eliminating the need to divert to less direct      routes, thereby reducing overall fuel usage. In addition,      increasing payload capacities reduces the number of truck-     miles traveled for a given load, thereby reducing fuel usage.      Fewer trucks on the road and lower fuel usage also result in      lower emissions--a direct environmental benefit.       Also, the State of Maine just completed a study entitled      ``Estimating Fuel Consumption and Emissions in Maine: A      Comparative Analysis for a Six-Axle, 100,000-1b. Vehicle.''      The study was prepared by the American Transportation      Research Institute. Preliminary findings included significant      efficiency improvements and trip-specific emissions      improvements in the comparison of two different parallel      routes--an Interstate route and a state highway route.      Efficiency improvements measured in miles per gallon were      determined to be 14-21 percent on the Interstate route.      Emissions were also expected to decrease by 6-11 percent for      CO2 and 3-8 percent for NOX and MNHC on      the Interstate.       In summary, enacting a federal truck weight limit exemption      on the currently non-exempt Maine Interstate highway system      would:       Reduce truck crashes on Maine's highways;       Reduce the number of trucks necessary to haul a given load;       Allow heavy truck traffic on the much safer Interstate      highway system;       Divert many through-trucks from congested town centers with      schools, gas stations, intersections, crosswalks, etc.;       Reduce regional transportation costs, making Maine industry      more competitive with its neighbors and enhancing interstate      and international trade;       Reduce net fuel consumption; and       Save $1.3 to $2.0 million annually in infrastructure costs      by reducing impacts.       As Senate action on the FY 2010 DOT-HUD Appropriations Bill      moves forward, I want to voice my strong support for Section      194, which will promote safer and more efficient truck      movement on Maine's highways.           Sincerely,                                                 John E. Balducci,     Governor.                                  ____                                                   State of Maine,                                  Department of Public Safety,                                   Augusta, ME, September 9, 2009.     Hon. Susan Collins,     U.S. Senate, Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the Maine Department of      Public Safety, I am writing in support of your efforts to      include a one year pilot program in the FY2010      Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations      Bill to allow trucks weighing up to 100,000 pounds to operate      the entire length of the Interstate Highway here in Maine. We      strongly believe that such a program will allow all Mainers      to travel more efficiently and especially more safely along      our rural roads if this were to occur.       Last year in Maine, 155 people tragically died on Maine's      highways. 23 of these deaths involved large trucks. We also      know that of these 23 deaths, more than 80% occurred on our      rural roads. We attribute many of these deaths to the fact      that large trucks are forced by current Federal law and      policy to exit our safe, divided 4-6 lane interstate highway      at Augusta, a mere 100 miles into Maine, and travel along two      lane rural roads. Many of these trucks are then forced to      travel six to eight hours or more along our rural roads to      reach their destinations instead of being allowed to travel      along the divided highway.       These roads pass through our villages, our towns, past      churches, schools, shopping centers, parks and Little League      fields. Unlike our major highway that limits access, thereby      cutting down on collisions, these rural roads have thousands      of locations where roads cross, people enter from parking      lots and private driveways and young children, adults and      elderly people walk, bike and run.       Each time you add an access point to these roads, you      increase the potential for a tragic accident to occur. Each      time a truck is forced to travel along an undivided highway,      the potential for other vehicles to cross over into its lane,      to unexpectedly pull out in front of the truck, for a young      child to run into the roadway or for a bicycle to swerve into      the lane of travel, increases dramatically. Each of these      incidents is a tragedy waiting to happen.       The Maine Department of Public Safety, which includes the      State Bureau of Highway Safety, the Maine State Police and      the Bureau of Emergency Communications, strongly supports      your proposal. State and Federal Motor Carrier statistics      that have been gathered over the years tell us that every      time you can get a large truck off a small rural road and      onto a divided limited access highway, the chance to avoid      accidents and prevent death greatly increases. The proposed      bill is a smart, practical and well reasoned approach to this      problem. The Maine Department of Public Safety wholeheartedly      supports your efforts.       Please feel free to contact me at my office at 207 626 3800      if there is any further information I can provide to you in      support of your efforts. Thank you for your time and      dedication to the efforts to make Maine's roads safer for all      of our citizens and visitors.           Sincerely yours,                                              Anne H. Jordan, Esq.     Commissioner of Pubic Safety, State of Maine.                                  ____         State of Maine, Department of Public Safety--Maine State            Police                                  Augusta, ME, September 10, 2009.     Hon. Susan Collins,     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: I am writing on behalf of the Maine      State Police to support your efforts to increase gross      vehicle weights on Maine's non-exempt Interstate highway      system. The changes you propose will not only benefit the      economy of the State of Maine, but will significantly improve      the safety of Maine's roads.       As you know, Maine allows gross vehicle weights of up to      100,000 lbs. on six-axle tractor semitrailers on state      highways. As a result, when they reach the non-exempt      portions of Maine's Interstate highway system heavy      combination trucks that would travel on the Interstate system      are diverted to the state highway system. This results in      100,000 lbs. trucks traveling through busy downtown     areas, through population centers, through congested      intersections and next to schools and playgrounds.       A June 2004 report prepared for the Maine Department of      Transportation (MaineDOT) concluded that allowing 100,000      lbs. trucks on the non-exempt Interstate Highways in Maine      would result in fewer crashes. This report indicates that the      crash rates on non-Interstate facilities in the study network      are more than 2 1/2 times higher than the crash rate on the      non-exempt Interstate System. In addition, the fatal crash      rate on non-Interstate facilities is nearly 10 times the      fatal crash rate on Interstate facilities while      incapacitating injury crashes are more than twice as      prevalent. National studies have found a strong relationship      between road class and crash risk. Findings from these      reports indicate that trucks traveling on rural interstates      are 3 to 4 times less likely to have a fatal crash than      trucks traveling on rural state and county highways.       Safety is a primary concern of the Maine State Police.      Given that the Interstate highway system is the safest road      network for heavy vehicle operations, we fully support your      efforts to allow 100,000 lbs. six-axle semi-trailers on the      non-exempt portion of Maine's Interstate highway system.           Sincerely,                                          Col. Patrick J. Fleming,     Chief, Maine State Police.                                  ____                             Maine State Troopers Association,                                  Augusta, ME, September 11, 2009.     Hon. Susan Collins,     Dirksen Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: I last wrote to you in 2005 in      support of your efforts to increase the gross vehicle weights      to 100,000 lbs. on Maine's non-exempt Interstate highway      system. At that time, I wrote in my capacity as Chief of the      Maine State Police. After retiring in 2007, I moved into the      private sector as a labor consultant providing services to,      amongst others, the Maine State Troopers Association (MSTA).      It is on their behalf that I write today. I might add that my      personal sentiments in support of your efforts have not      waivered and if anything have strengthened.       The statistics continue to support the increase, both from      an economic, and to my mind most importantly, a public safety      standpoint. The proposed one year pilot program will provide      an opportunity for due diligence on the part of policy makers      and policy implementers by way of an analytical survey of the      results of moving heavy trucks off the secondary roads and on      to the Interstate system which was engineered for such      traffic. This also will allow for policy decisions to be made      based on facts and not simply emotion or speculation.       MSTA's members are on the front line of Maine's highway      safety efforts and are responsible for enforcing State and      Federal commercial vehicle laws and regulations. They see no      down side to this proposal. And as compelling as the data is,      intuitively it just makes sense. While the naysayers believe      it will increase risk, no data supports that notion.       Safety remains the primary concern of Maine's Troopers as      it did in 2005. For that reason we offer our support in your      efforts to move 100,000 lb. six-axel semi-trailers on the      non-exempt portion of Maine's Interstate system. Thank you      for your efforts on this important initiative.           Sincerely,                                                  Craig A. Poulin,     Executive Director, MSTA.                                  ____             Maine Association of Police, South Portland, ME,                                             September 9, 2009.     Senator Susan Collins,     Dirksen Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins, The Maine Association of Police      offers and urges support of your efforts to include a one      year pilot project in the FY 2010 Transportation, Housing and      Urban Development Appropriations bill to allow trucks      weighing up to one hundred thousand pounds to utilize the      full length of Maine's interstate highway system.       Currently, federal law prohibits trucks weighing more than      eighty thousand pounds from traveling the I-95 corridor from      the city of Augusta, north. Because the Maine Turnpike, also      designated as I-95, is a private, toll road, this prohibition      does not exist from the New Hampshire border to Augusta.       This inconsistency creates a situation in which commercial      vehicles not conforming to the federal weight restriction are      forced to leave the interstate system and travel state      secondary roads. As law enforcement first responders, this      forced departure from the interstate system is of great      concern. Given the nature and daily use of secondary roads      vital to Maine citizens, this restriction creates an      unnecessary risk by forcing these commercial vehicles off of      a system that is specifically designed and engineered for      this type of commercial traffic.       The pilot project also provides for the diligent study of      the impacts that this temporary change will have on Maine's      interstate system to address concerns that many would have as      to the long term impact of commercial traffic. An unintended      side benefit also provides an opportunity for Maine Law      Enforcement to gauge the impact of removing this traffic from      secondary roads through crash reporting and other statistical      data. It also affords law enforcement a clear venue to direct      enforcement and safety operations as they relate to      commercial vehicle issues.       The one year pilot project provided by this current budget      takes a common sense approach to address an important issue      in Maine that has gone unattended. It provides the      opportunity to study the balance between an effective and      efficient commerce system, fuel efficiency and environmental      impacts, but most of all, the safety of Maine citizens and      those who visit our great state. We look forward to the      committee's support of your efforts in making this      opportunity a reality.           Sincerely,                                                      Paul Gaspar,     Executive Director.                                  ____                                               September 11, 2009.     Hon. Susan Collins,     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the Coalition for      Transportation Productivity (CTP) and its 120 members      nationwide, I am writing to express strong support for      Section 194 of the FY 2010 Transportation-HUD Appropriations      Bill now pending before the Senate. This provision would      enable the state of Maine to conduct a one-year pilot program      to test the impact of allowing 100,000 pound, six-axle      single-trailer trucks to access Maine's interstate highway      network.       CTP was organized to promote the passage of federal      legislation giving each state the option to increase its      interstate vehicle weight limit to 97,000 pounds for six-axle      trucks if the state determines that the infrastructure of      these roads can safely accommodate the heavier loads. Maine      officials have determined that their state roads are fully      capable of handling these loads. It is important to note that      highway safety, environmental performance and economic      productivity would all be improved by allowing this pilot      program to occur.       Increasing the interstate weight limit would allow      businesses and shippers to carry a specific amount of freight      using fewer trucks. This is especially significant for      highway safety because accident rates among heavy vechicles      are strongly tied to the vehicle miles traveled (VMT), and      consolidating freight would reduce VMTs to make roads safer.      It is important to note that since the United Kingdom raised      its gross vehicle weight limit for six-axle vehicles in 2001,      fatal truck-related accident rates have declined by 35      percent. More freight has been shipped, while the number of      VMTs to deliver a ton of freight has declined.       Moreover, the current interstate weight limit often forces      trucks to travel on rural roads that often wind through      towns, passing schools and private driveways, where accidents      are more likely to occur. The provision would put these      trucks on better-engineered, divided interstate highways,      where they can safely and efficiently transport goods.       Allowing six-axle vehicles to carry more weight would also      yield cleaner air and greener shipping by cutting fuel use      and carbon emissions. A 2008 American Transportation Research      institute study found that six-axle trucks carrying about      100,000 pounds get 17 percent more ton-miles per gallon than      five-axle trucks carrying 80,000 pounds. More efficient      shipping means a smaller carbon footprint.       Finally, raising the interstate vehicle weight limit will      have widespread economic benefits. At a point when many      producers are facing tough economic times and smaller      budgets, the provision will enable them to reduce the number      of weekly shipments--cutting costs, spurring investment and      protecting valuable jobs.       Futhermore, producers in Maine and across the country are      currently at a productivity disadvantage because Canada,      Mexico and most European countries now have higher truck      weight limits. Harmonizing weight limits with our major      trading partners will ease the cost of moving U.S. goods into      international markets and stop costly freight consolidation      at our ports and border crossings. With Canada's higher      weight limits, the provision in Maine would help Northeastern      producers compete for market share and efficiently export      goods.       It is a fact that allowing heavier, more efficient trucks      to operate on our nation's interstates would improve safety,      reduce environmental impact and strengthen the economy. CTP      applauds Sen. Collins for introducing the provision.           Sincerely,                                                      John Runyan,     Executive Director.                                  ____                               American Trucking Associations,                                                   Washington, DC.     Hon. Daniel Inouye,     Chairman, Committee on Appropriations,     U.S Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Inouye: The American Trucking Associations      supports Senator Collins' efforts to secure a 1 year pilot      program in the Fiscal Year 2010 Transportation and Housing      and Urban Development Appropriations bill that would allow      for more productive vehicles to be operated on Maine's      interstate highways. The inclusion of this provision will      improve safety, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and benefit      Maine's economy.       Under current law, six axle vehicles with a gross vehicle      weight of 100,000 lbs are allowed to operate on the Maine      Turnpike (I-95) from     the New Hampshire border to Augusta, ME. Upon reaching      Augusta, however, the federal weight preemption on the      Interstate Highway System forces trucks weighing more than      80,000 lbs off of I-95 onto smaller secondary roads which are      less safe than Interstates. The removal of the federal      prohibition would allow trucks on the roads that are best      suited for them.       This pilot project is also an effective strategy for      mitigating the impacts of carbon dioxide on climate change      due to the reduction in fuel use as a result of fewer trips      needed to deliver a given amount of freight. A recent study      found that more productive vehicles could reduce fuel usage      up to 39% with similar reductions in greenhouse gas      emissions.       Furthermore, the allowance of more productive vehicles on      the Interstate will help to alleviate Maine's current      economic disadvantage. Jurisdictions surrounding Maine all      have significantly higher weight limits on their highways.      New Hampshire and Massachusetts both allow trucks up to      99,000 lbs. and Canada allows for truck weights greater than      100,000 lbs. Maine's inability to allow for higher weight      limits has made it a virtual island unto itself.       ATA encourages the Committee to include the Maine pilot      project as part of the final FY 2010 THUD Appropriations      bill. This is good public policy and we commend Senator      Collins for her efforts to address Maine's needs.                                             Timothy P. Lynch,                                            Senior Vice President,                                     Office of Legislative Affairs
