  Mr. DeFAZIO. Another real problem confronting America, another symbolic gesture by the Republican leadership. The thirteenth House vote on opening the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge to drilling.  Now, real action would require taking on the price gouging, collusion, and market manipulation of big oil. Reign in the speculation in the commodities market, save 25 cents a gallon. Impose a windfall profits tax, reopen or build new refinery capacity, 70 cents a gallon. Take on the OPEC cartel but no, they are not going to take on big oil and protect American families who are reacting with shock and awe to costs at the pump because it might slow the gusher, the gusher of campaign contributions flowing into the Republican coffers. So families across America will pay 50 bucks to tank up this weekend and the Republicans will pretend they care.                          ____________________[Pages H3234-H3235]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                              {time}  1045                           REAL ACTION NEEDED  (Mr. DeFAZIO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)
