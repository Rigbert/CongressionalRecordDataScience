 President, we are just talking about common sense. In other words, Congress passes a law. We want to tax at a certain level and a certain group of people. A lot of times those laws have been in place for a long period of time. Congressional intent was followed for a long period of time. And then there is somebody sitting in some bureaucracy--in this case, the Treasury Department--that says, oh, no, that is not what Congress intended; this is what they intended. Then he changes it. We don't have a process for reviewing that. This legislation will give a process for that review. But we will not find ourselves in a position of having to correct something that is contrary to congressional intent, but also with the idiotic situation that we somehow have to come up with revenue to offset a change of policy that we never intended in the first place.  So I applaud the Senator and thank him for not bringing it up at this point.  I yield the floor.
