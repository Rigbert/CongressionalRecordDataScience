 President, I rise very briefly to explain my absence on rollcall vote No. 271. This was a procedural vote to instruct the Sergeant at Arms. I was attending a conference with Ambassador Richard Holbrooke and was involved in a discussion of Bosnia and the enforcement of the Dayton Peace accords. I was unable to return to the Senate for the vote.                          ____________________
