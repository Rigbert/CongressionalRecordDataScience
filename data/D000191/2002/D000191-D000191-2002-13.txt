  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, the President had an opportunity to show strong leadership and get tough with corporate crooks yesterday. His speech was long, 27 minutes, on rhetoric but is short on action.  The Business Roundtable and the National Association of Manufacturers applauded loudly; they endorsed it. Of course, they are the same people who fought every reform that was proposed over the last decade that could have prevented these abuses. They loved the President's proposal because it was short on action.  The aide to the White House said, well, the proposals were watered down over the last few weeks because the President did not want to hurt the economy by imposing too much regulation. Hurt the economy? What has WorldCom done by evaporating $80 billion of equity, thousands of jobs and people's IRAs and 401(k)s? What has Enron done by manipulating the energy market and driving up energy costs in the western United States by 40 percent, while Ken Lay, the President's favorite guy, stole $100 million? That is hurting the economy.  We need action, not rhetoric.                          ____________________
