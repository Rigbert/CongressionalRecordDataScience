 I was very impressed with the work of Senator Alexander on the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. He worked with all our members to make sure we replace the No Child Left Behind Act--which I think most Americans agree is not working today--with a bipartisan approach. I am hopeful we can bring it to the Senate floor and move it through quickly because this is a law that does need to be fixed.
