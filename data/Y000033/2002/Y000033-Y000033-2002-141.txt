Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, I agree with the gentleman. What I am suggesting to the people and those of us who support the American Indians, as I do, I think it is the responsibility of Congress. Because if we look at the trust, if we look at the trust, if we look at what is said about the American Indians, the trust belongs to the Congress.                              {time}  1115  We have been neglectful in not pursuing and making sure that this issue had been solved in previous years.  So I am asking us to sit down, as the gentleman mentioned before, and say, let us solve this problem, because they owe their money to themselves. We have spent that money somewhere. It is our responsibility.  Like the gentleman says, they will say, we will not appropriate, we do not have the money. But somewhere along we have to step up to the plate and say listen, we have spent that money, we owe it to them, and we ought to take it and get it to them as soon as possible and shut the doors.
