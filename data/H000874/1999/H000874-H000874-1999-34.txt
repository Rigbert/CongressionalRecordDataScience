Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I want to thank the gentleman from Guam for his contribution. I might want to say, as well, that I had the opportunity of being on the West Coast just a few days ago and there was a former broadcaster on Guam, a journalist with whom I talked, and she said whenever there was a problem from an historical or political perspective that the media had in Guam and wanted some expert information, they would call Dr. Underwood who was a distinguished historian and teacher and get advice and counsel and he always knew the answers. He makes an appropriate point, the 440 Members indeed that make an impact on this body.  Mr. Speaker, I again want to congratulate the gentleman from Connecticut for his leadership.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
