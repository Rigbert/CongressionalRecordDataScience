 DOLE. I do not know if those are gun amendments or not. I have not looked at the amendments. I want to stick to terrorism. I want to see what the end result is, when we would finish the bill. But I underscore what the Senator from Utah said. I attended the White House meeting. Everybody was saying ``They are going to make this a big gun fight.'' We said ``No, we are not going to do that. We are not going to offer any of the so-called gun amendments.'' And then we have them all offered on the other side, or many offered on the other side.  We say no. We accommodate the President. He wants to get the bill passed. The President was at the Air Force Academy and blasted Congress for not passing a bill. Mr. President, 67 amendments were filed by Democrats. We only saw seven of those amendments before Monday. We did not know where they were. We did not know what the other 60 were.  I just suggest we are going to either complete this bill or we are going to have a cloture vote in the morning. If we do not get cloture it is out of here. It is gone.
