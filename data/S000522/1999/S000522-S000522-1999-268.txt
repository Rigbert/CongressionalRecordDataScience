Mr. Speaker, in the decade since multi-party elections first began to be held in what were the one-party states of East-Central Europe, the political leaders and societies of many of these states have committed themselves to building democratic institutions, respecting the rule of law and tolerating social diversity. Some have done well; others have not. One country which should have done well, but so far has not, is Croatia. I ask, ``Why?''  Many will assert, with considerable credibility, that Croatia faced until 1995 the added burdens of Yugoslavia's violent demise, bringing months of conflict in 1991, and the occupation of considerable territory by Serb militants. We should not minimize the sense of victimization felt by the people of Croatia at that time. Indeed, I was in Vukovar in 1991, when it was still under siege, and personally saw the awful things that were happening to the people there. Similarly, we cannot ignore the effect in Croatia of the continued presence of Croats from Bosnia-Herzegovina who still cannot safely return to their homes in what is now the entity of Republika Srpska.  However much one may want to give Croatia the benefit of the doubt, in the eight years since the tragic events following the assertion of statehood, and four years since the occupied territories were either retaken or set for subsequent reintegration, Croatia has become accustomed to its newfound independence. Its people have increasingly seemed desirous of becoming a more united part of European affairs, including through the development of ties with the European Union and NATO. They are part of a sophisticated, well-educated society, feel more secure within their borders, and want greater freedom and prosperity for themselves and their children. Analysts have, for at least two years, viewed the country as being in a stage of real transition. Unfortunately, as this transition moves forward, it meets greater resistance from those who have become entrenched in, and enriched by, the power they hold. This resistance manifests itself in two ways, the gross manipulation of the political system to the advantage of the ruling party, and the continued reliance on nationalist passions.  Regarding political manipulations, elections must be held within the next three months, yet there is no date, no new election law that provides a free and fair standard, no loosening of the grip on the media. More specifically, there continues to be a so-called ``diaspora'' representation, which effectively is the same as giving almost ten percent of parliamentary seats to the ruling party up front. Moreover, for some time the authorities considered scheduling the elections within a few days of Christmas, a rather blatant attempt to manipulate popular sentiment and voter turnout.  The ruling party is maintaining its control over Croatia's broadcast media. Defamation laws have resulted in hundreds of prosecutions, both criminal and civil, of journalists and publishers for critical comments deemed ``criminal'' for allegedly insulting the honor or dignity of high officials. In Croatia, it seems that alleged criminal activity by officials uncovered by independent journalists can be protected under a broad definition of ``state secrets.''  On the nationalist front, Serbs (who once represented over ten percent of Croatia's population) still have difficulty returning home--many fled in 1991 and 1995--and those who have returned face difficulties in getting their property back or obtaining government assistance. Statements by officials often create an environment which make individuals believe they can get away with more direct, physical harassment of the Serbs. While many Serbs may not be able even to participate in the voting for the upcoming elections, Croatian authorities are considering the reduction from three seats to one seat for Serb representation in the Croatian Parliament, or Sabor. Meanwhile, the ``diaspora'' vote sways the loyalties of Bosnia's indigenous Croat population, and Croatian President Tudjman recently resurrected notions of a Croat entity in Bosnia-Herzegovina. While Croatia's citizenship law still makes it difficult for members of the Serb and sometimes other minority communities to get citizenship, voting rights are extended to ethnic Croats abroad on the discredited basis of blood ties alone.  Tudjman further claimed this last week that Croatian generals cannot be held accountable for the commission of war crimes and crimes against humanity. His resistance to cooperation with the International Tribunal in The Hague is reprehensible, and, if it continues, warrants a strong response by this Congress.   Mr. Speaker, Croatian courts recently convicted Dinko Sakic, a commander of the Jasenovac concentration camp in Croatia during World War II. The trial and its outcome say something positive not only about Croatia's courts; the attention in Croatia given to this case indicates an ability to acknowledge a horrible period in the past. More broadly, Croats realize they must seek justice for the past and move forward so that they do not sink their personal futures in the pit of extreme nationalist aspirations.  I hope, Mr. Speaker, the leaders of Croatia today will come to their senses, and abide by the wish of the people to live in full freedom, true justice and greater prosperity. Signs of this would be: (1) holding an election which, from the campaign period to the vote count, is free and fair according to both international observers and domestic ones who should be permitted to observe; (2) cessation of the relegation of ethnic Serbs to the status of second-class citizens whose presence, at best, will be tolerated; and (3) surrendering to The Hague all indicted persons, including Mladen Naletilic (aka ``Tuta'') now that Croatia's own courts have cleared the way, and the information and documents which the Tribunal may request.  Only with progress in these areas can Croatia take its proper place in Europe and the world. Mr. Speaker, I ask Croatia's leaders, when that will be?                          ____________________
