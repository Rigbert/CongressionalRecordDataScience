President, today my colleague Senator DeWine and I are submitting a concurrent resolution to support the consumer education efforts of the National Funeral Directors Association during National Funeral Services Education Week, September 21 through 27, 2003.  When we are called upon to make funeral arrangements it is often at an emotional time when making important funeral-related decisions are confusing and difficult. In order to help remove confusion and concerns about funeral service planning, the National Funeral Directors Association is beginning a nationwide consumer education effort the week of September 21. The theme of the educational effort is ``For a Life Worth Celebrating'' which reflects funeral directors efforts to meet the needs of families who want a meaningful service that celebrates their loved one's life.  This important week will provide consumers an opportunity to ask questions, obtain information about how to make informed funeral-related decisions. Funeral directors across the country will hold special community events including ``open houses'' and events in local malls, schools or community centers.  I would encourage the public to participate in these activities so they can become informed consumers and I urge the Congress to support this educational effort.                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED       SA 1740.
