If we are going to amend the Constitution of the United States to take on this awesome responsibility, a document which all of us have sworn to uphold and defend, should we not be in a situation where there is no other recourse, where we have a situation where State statutes are being stricken, where there is some controversy at hand as to whether or not crime victims across the United States are being accommodated? The test of necessity seems to me to be the threshold test which we should meet before we come together on the floor of the Senate to consider an amendment to the Constitution of the United States.  Would the Senator from Vermont comment on that, please?
