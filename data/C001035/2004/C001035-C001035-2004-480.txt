President, I congratulate the senior Senator from Maine for her comments and her work on this issue. As a member of the Intelligence Committee she has understood very early the need for significant intelligence reform. The provisions included in the Collins-Lieberman bill that created an inspector general for the new national intelligence authority are the direct result of the legislation sponsored by the senior Senator from Maine.  I thank the Senator for her expertise and her leadership. This is an area, as she indicated, on which she has been working for many years. We very much value her contributions to the debate.  I know of no other requests to speak tonight.                          ____________________
