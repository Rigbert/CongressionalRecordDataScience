 But other tax-exempt groups that do exactly the same kinds of issue ads, such as 501(c)(4)s, such as the Sierra Club, and 501(c)(5)s, such as the AFL-CIO, would not have to publicly disclose their donors.  So the problem is, if the idea is to have comprehensive disclosure, we have left out a huge percentage of those who are involved in political activity. The two that I mentioned happen to almost always be in support of candidates on the other side of the aisle. It would also not include the American Trial Lawyers Association.It would not include groups such as Public Citizen, and environmental groups. As I mentioned, organized labor, all of whom would be exempt.  As I understand, the point of the sense-of-the-Senate amendment of the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee which would be offered, as I understand it, after a motion to table the McCain amendment is approved, would call for a comprehensive approach. The majority leader is going to address the issue of when to do that. It is my opinion--I know he will announce it is his opinion--we ought to do that this year in this session because disclosure is, as the Senator from Arizona has pointed out, an area where we have been largely in agreement. It is a question of making sure that this is the right kind of disclosure and not a kind of selected partial disclosure which happens to have the practical effect of leaving out, in my view, most of the major players who engage in issue advocacy in this country.
