Speaker, our country observed Yom HaShoah, or Holocaust Remembrance Day, this past Sunday, which recalls the global tragedy of state-sponsored systemic annihilation and persecution of European Jewry by Nazi Germany and its collaborators as well as millions more deaths of people who were of Roma extraction, the disabled, Slavic peoples, homosexuals, Jehovah's Witnesses, and potential dissidents.  I would like to include in the Record an article from the Toledo Blade in our district, a front-page story last Sunday entitled ``Survivors Urge World to Never Forget Horror,'' which recounts the story of some of the heroic survivors in our district in Ohio.  In our country, 150,000 to 170,000 survivors remain today. The horror of the Holocaust has affected countless souls across this globe. Our district is home to persevering survivors like Mrs. Clara Rona, whose words I will place in the Record today, and so many others who never should have had to make this sacrifice, but she remains a woman of hope.                 [From toledoblade.com, Apr. 11, 2010]                  Survivors Urge World To Never Forget                           (By Ryan E. Smith)       Living through the Holocaust was one thing. Remembering it      is another.       Clara Rona still remembers the smell of human flesh being      incinerated at Auschwitz, seeing smoke wafting through the      air and knowing it was somebody's mother.       She won't allow herself to forget a moment--not the      beatings, the hunger, or the baby who was killed in a toilet      in her presence. At age 89, the West Toledo woman still talks      openly about the horrors of which humanity is capable.       And yet.       ``I wish I had dementia,'' she says, pleading in her      Hungarian accent. ``I don't want to remember.''       Between 150,000 and 170,000 survivors of the Holocaust      probably remain in this country, according to the United      States Holocaust Memorial Museum, and there are fewer than a      dozen believed to live in the Toledo area. All face the same      dilemma: How to balance the responsibility of being the last      living threads to the systematic killing of 6 million Jews      with the pain of memory.       Today is Yom HaShoah, or Holocaust Remembrance Day. Now and      in the days to come people will gather at events to urge the      world, ``Never again! Never forget!''       But Rena Mann won't be among them.       The 83-year-old has never opened up to anyone--not her late      husband nor her children--about what she endured in two      concentration camps during World War II. Maybe it's because      it hurts too much. Or maybe it's because she's afraid the      world doesn't want to know.       ``Do people care?,'' the Sylvania Township woman asked.      ``On the one hand I don't want it to be forgotten, and on the      other hand I feel that people are really, in the future, not      going to care.''                           Pain and suffering       Born in Berlin, Mrs. Mann was 12 and living in Poland when      the war began. After her mother died of blood poisoning and      her stepfather was trapped in a newly formed ghetto, she was      sent to stay with family in another town.       This was no death camp, but already the terror had begun.      She remembers being awakened in the night and sent to the      market to watch Jews being hanged. Their crime? Baking bread,      which was forbidden.       ``As an example they were hung, and we all had to watch      it,'' Mrs. Mann said.       Before she turned 14, Mrs. Maim was sent away to a factory      and forced into slave labor. It was hard work involving water      and spools of flax that left her fingers and feet      frostbitten.       Mostly what she remembers is the hunger. There was a bit of      bread that was supposed to last three days and some potato      soup at night that might not have any potato at all.       ``We got, like we used to say, too much to die from and too      little to exist,'' Mrs. Mann said.       Two years later she moved to another camp, where she slept      in an abandoned factory with broken windows, no water or      privacy, and vicious guards who would kick and push. A Polish      song written by her girlfriends still resounds in her head.      It concludes:       Who knows if I'll ever see / My mother's tender home. /      This is a song of despair, / Of Jewish pain and suffering.       ``That song is always with me and I don't want to take it      with me to my grave,'' Mrs. Mann said.       She never talked about the four years she spent in camps      before being liberated in 1945. No one really asked.       ``I am actually a coward,'' she said. ``It's true. Because      I am pushing it away, or have been pushing it away.''       Maybe now, though, after all these years, the pain is far      enough behind her that she can let it out.                              Eyewitnesses       Mrs. Mann isn't alone in her hesitation, according to      Arthur Berger, senior adviser at the United States Holocaust      Memorial Museum in Washington. But as survivors continue to      die at a rapid rate, it becomes more and more crucial to      record their stories--in print or on video but also in      person, he said.       ``Nothing compares to a real person telling you about their      own lives,'' Mr. Berger said. ``No one can replace the      survivors. No one, can replace the eyewitnesses to history.''       Rolf Hess, 75, of Holland was one of those eyewitnesses,      but he never spoke of what happened during the war until last      year when a granddaughter interviewed him for a school      project about his experience as an immigrant.       ``That sort of opened up a can of worms on my part,'' he      said. ``It has been in the past, and it still is, a very      difficult thing.''       The native of Germany was not even 5 years old when the      Nazis invaded Poland in 1939. Yet he has vivid, emotional      memories of being separated from his mother after they were      taken to a camp and split up from his father.       ``We were at a train station, just my mother and I,'' he      said, voice cracking. ``That I remember. And she gave me a      little book that I still have with some pertinent      information, with my birth date.''       To this day he doesn't know what happened to his family.      All he remembers is rummaging through garbage at a children's      camp looking for food and being scared to death, even after      escaping to America in 1942 with other children as a refugee.       ``I can remember in Cleveland where I was out in the      backyard and I heard an airplane and I scurried underneath a      bench for protection,'' he said.       Only recently has he started investigating his own past to      fill in the gaps of his memory.       ``I finally have come to grips with the whole situation,''      he said.                         `Dying in slow motion'       For Dr. Aron Wajskol, 85, of West Toledo, the question has      never been whether to share his horrible story--the way his      starving father died in a ghetto, how his mother perished at      the death camp Auschwitz, how he nearly succumbed to the      bone-crushing work of concentration camps.       For him, the question was how. How do you make someone      understand what it was like?       ``Its like describing being on the moon,'' the retired      anesthesiologist said. ``Hearing about the facts and truly      understanding the facts are different things.''       The son of a textile factory worker in central Poland, Dr.      Wajskol remembers the restrictions that went into effect      within days of Germany invading his country. His father's job      was taken away. His school was closed. Jews were forbidden      from using public transportation and forced to wear Stars of      David to distinguish them from non-Jews.       ``Many families who could afford [to] fled Europe,'' Dr.      Wajskol said. ``Mine couldn't.''       Within months, the city's Jewish population was forced out      of its homes and squeezed into a tiny ghetto. It had no sewer      system and little running water. People were dying in the      streets of starvation--Dr. Wajskol calls it ``dying in slow      motion''--and corpses went unburied for days.       ``Even in death it was suffering,'' said Dr. Wajskol, who      was 17 at the time.       His father was among those wasting away, and he eventually      died of tuberculosis.       All the while, Jew were rounded up and deported. At first      for work, later for extermination. When Dr. Wajskol was taken      to a labor camp in 1944, hauling around 110-pound sacks of      cement while surviving on bits of bread actually seemed like      a reprieve.       ``At least death wasn't surrounding us,'' Dr. Wajskol said.      ``We knew they needed us. We were productive for them.''       To keep himself going, Dr. Wajskol imagined that there      would be an end to all of this one day, that he could go back      to school, that he would see his mother and sister again. His      sister managed to survive but had to watch her mother be sent      to the gas chamber.       This continued for 10 months until he was evacuated to the      Buchenwald concentration camp due to the Soviet advance.      After spending five days locked up in a crowded cattle car      with no food or water, where he had no choice but to sit on a      dead body, he was released to something even more      frightening: SS guards with skulls on their caps, terrifying      German shepherds, and the skeletal faces of the prisoners.       ``It looked like a nightmare,'' he said.       Here he learned the pain of standing for hours in the      penetrating cold of winter without socks or underwear. In a      subcamp where his first job was to even out rocks for a steam      roller, he came to understand the Nazi goal of ``annihilation      through work.''       Before long, he was on the move again, this time on foot to      escape the approaching Americans.       ``This was a real, real death march,'' Dr. Wajskol said.       They marched through patches of snow from dawn until the      evening, always under the watchful eye of the SS, who were      ready to shoot the slow or weak. Still, Dr. Wajskol and a      friend managed to escape, dashing into the forest and running      until they were out of breath.       Dr. Wajskol will never forget how he felt once the war was      over.       ``Feeling free after 5\1/2\ years of slavery, playing with      death constantly, I can't describe it with normal language,''      he said.       But he tries. He has told his story to high school students      and traveled to his old home in Poland with his wife and son.       ``In the beginning it was very hard to revive all these      things,'' he said. ``[But] I strongly believe that it's      important to talk about it, make people aware of it, because      of the enormity of what happened.''                           Trinity of terror       As director of the Ruth Fajerman Markowicz Holocaust      Resource Center of Greater Toledo, Hindea Markowicz knows      about the importance of preserving this history. As the      daughter-in-law of Holocaust survivors, she feels it too.       ``I have worries because history in the schools is being      taught so differently,'' she said. ``It's lucky if they have      a paragraph included in the history books.''       The resource center, housed in the offices of the United      Jewish Council of Greater Toledo in Sylvania, on the other      hand, features hundreds of books and other educational      materials. There are videos of local survivors and a book      written by her father-in-law, Philip Markowicz, called My      Three Lives, which includes his experiences during the      Holocaust.       It's one thing to read about these events in books, quite      another to hear about them from someone in person. That's why      Mr. Markowicz, 86, of Sylvania has told his tale and why      Sylvania Township resident Al Negrin speaks to students in      Florida, where he spends the winter.       ``I talk because I want people to know what was going on,      so they have a chance, if something happens again, to prevent      it,'' said the 86-year-old from Greece.       Mr. Negrin--whose mother, brother, and sister went with him      to Auschwitz but were immediately sent to the crematorium--     recalls a trinity of terror: the German guard who stood      threatening with a rifle butt, the civilian supervisor with a      whip, and the fellow inmate in charge of the group armed with      a stick.       ``Everybody was yelling `Arbeit! Arbeit!' Work! Work! Work!      If you stop for a while to take a breath, one of those three      objects will come over your head.''       It was not sustainable and his father eventually succumbed      while moving to another camp. It was just a week before the      group was liberated.       ``My father was weak, could not walk. I tried to get him      with my shoulders but the German guard said `No, you can't do      that because after a while then you'll be weak,' '' Mr.      Negrin said.       ``I left him in the side of the street. I kissed him good-     bye, and that's the last time I saw him.''                       `He never talks about it'       Norman Gudelman, 78, went about sharing his story in      another way. He wrote it down.       It took more than six decades and some prodding from his      wife, but he finally took his suffering and made it tangible.      The result is a sprawling letter to his children on the      occasion of his 75th birthday. It covers everything from his      youth in modern-day Moldova to his escape to Palestine after      the war to his arrival in America.       Mr. Gudelman of Sylvania Township remembers being carefree      as a youth, despite the anti-Semitism that was prevalent      around him. His restaurant-owning parents shielded him from      the world's hate, at least until the Soviets arrived in 1940,      arresting and executing Jews and banishing others to Siberia.       When Romanian forces returned in 1941 with the Germans,      things were no better.       ``Romanian soldiers came to our house, and ordered all the      Jews out,'' Mr. Gudelman wrote in his letter. ``Start      walking. Leave the home, the business, our possessions and      go.''       He was 10 years old then. Today, Mr. Gudelman is happy to      talk about his experience during the war, but there's a sense      he'd prefer to defer to his written statement than relive--     yet again--what happened in too much detail.       ``He never talks about it,'' said his wife, Fanny. ``I      don't ask questions. I want it [to] come from him.''       When he does speak, Mr. Gudelman can tell you about how the      group marched endlessly from one camp to another, begging for      food when there was a chance to slip away. In the camps, they      crowded into windowless rooms and slept on cement floors.       ``They wanted to get rid of us,'' he said.       It worked. He and his sister were orphaned within a year or      two       That may be what saved them. When the Soviets returned and      chased the German and Romanian armies out, orphans were sent      to ghettos to stay with Jewish families, Mr. Gudelman said.      From there, he eventually made his way to the future state of      Israel. Thanks to a relative in Toledo, Mr. Gudelman      ultimately came here and became president of State Paper &      Metal Co., Inc.       He decided to write all this down for posterity, he said,      because, ``sooner or later I'm going to forget, or sooner or      later I'm going to pass away.''       His letter's massage is simple: ``Maybe in your lifetime      you will read books about the unbelievable cruelty of those      times. Believe them.''                              Finding hope       Then there's Mrs. Rona, who insists on picking away at the      scabs of the past.       ``I want to remind myself,'' she said. ``They say I'm a      masochist--my friends, my psychologist.''       Her reminiscences rarely come without a few tears, but      maybe it's for the best.       ``When I'm crying, really it's good for me,'' she said.       The only child of a butcher in Pecs, Hungary, Mrs. Rona      wanted to be an art teacher, but those plans were scuttled      when the Germans invaded. Her family was relocated from its      large house, and at one point they were living in a stable.      Later they were among those taken to Auschwitz, 80 people      squeezed into each rail car.       Mrs. Rona was 23--tough, young, and strong--but also naive.      All she brought was a change of clothes and a bottle of      cologne, which she used to wash her mother when she fainted.      Mrs. Rona still regrets that she never traded the latter for      water despite her mother's pleas.       ``I feel guilty,'' she said. ``I cannot forgive myself.''       It was night when they arrived and they were divided into      two lines. Her mother and aunt went to the left--``straight      to the gas,'' Mrs. Rona said. Her father was transferred to      another concentration camp and later died.       Mrs. Rona divided her time between several camps and      remembers it as a dazed experience.       ``You think about food, but nothing else. You become like      an animal,'' she said. ``One spoon of soup means one day's      survival.       ``There was electric wire. Some people ran into it because      they couldn't take it and they got killed,'' she continued.       Mrs. Rona, who found out after the war that she could not      bear children, is certain that it is the result of her      treatment during the war. None of the women in the camp      menstruated, she said.       When one woman gave birth to a child in the camp, Mrs. Rona      said she was forced to be present as it was put in a toilet      by fellow prisoners. Otherwise, both the mother and baby      would have been executed, she said.       When the camp was evacuated in April, 1945, as the end of      the war approached, Mrs. Rona said she was in no shape for      walking. Desperate, she and another woman hid in the rain      under some bushes and simply waited for the group to head off      before dawn.       When she finally made her way to safety in Prague, Mrs.      Rona estimates that she weighed about 50 pounds. She went      back home hoping to find her father, but he was gone      forever--along with more than 50 other family members. Only      three cousins survived.       ``I was so angry,'' she said. ``Still the anger, it's      burned me.''       Even as she left for Palestine and made her way to Toledo,      where she worked with children at the Jewish Community Center      of Greater Toledo, that anger never left.       How could it when there were mass killings in the former      Yugoslavia? Rwanda? Darfur?       ``I thought after, when we got freed, the world will be so      beautiful. They'll learn,'' she said. ``They didn't because      it's repeating the same things somewhere else in a different      way.''       And yet.       Mrs. Rona still speaks, making public her private hell. She      does this because 65 years after the Holocaust she still has      something that can offset the pain:       Hope.                          ____________________
