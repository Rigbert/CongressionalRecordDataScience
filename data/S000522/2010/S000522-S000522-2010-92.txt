Mr. Speaker, by a 12-point margin, Americans say the Administration's health care plan is a ``bad idea,'' according to a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey.  And the number of people who call the health plan a ``bad idea'' has reached a new high.  But you won't hear about this from the national media--not even NBC, who conducted the poll. During a report about the survey on NBC's Nightly News, anchor Brian Williams failed to mention this finding.  Other polls show even greater opposition to the Administration's plan. According to Investor's Business Daily, Americans want Congress to ``start fresh'' by 61 percent to 32 percent.  NBC and the national media should give the American people the facts about health care, not hide them.
