Speaker, today I commend eight dedicated teachers from Northwest Indiana who have been voted outstanding educators by their peers for the 1999-2000 school year. These individuals, Debra Ciochina, Douglas DeLaughter, Brenda Greene, Dennis Keithley, Martin Kessler, Marilyn Qualls, Martiann Recktenwall and Sharron Thornton, will be presented the Crystal Apple Award at a reception sponsored by the Indiana State Teachers Association. This glorious event will take place at the Broadmoor Country Club in Merrillville, Indiana, on Wednesday, May 3, 2000.  Debra Ciochina, from Crown Point Community School Corporation, has taught for 30 years. Currently, she teaches at Crown Point High School, where she has been the assistant director of the Crown Point High School Theater for five years. She also coaches the Crown Point High School Dance Team. As a freelance director, choreographer and performer for community theaters and schools, she has written and produced various original productions. Debra not only finds interesting ways to help her English and Speech classes learn important concepts, she also makes her students enjoy learning. Her charismatic personality transfers enthusiasm for her subject area to her students. She embraces the idea that each of us must find an individual passion and be true to one's convictions.  Douglas DeLaughter is described by his peers as an outstandingly professional and dedicated teacher. He has taught for 17 years, and is current working within the School Town of Munster. Doug has dedicated himself to understanding and displaying the aspects of being a professional in the field of education. His enthusiasm and love for education is truly contagious, for Doug inspires those around him to strive for excellence. Doug's commitment and love for children and their education has been seen in the number of hours he devotes to his job, the number of committees he has taken a leadership role in, and the programs he has instituted.  Brenda Greene has been a role model, inspiration and a coach during her 22 years of teaching. She currently teaches Speech and English in the North Newton School Corporation. Her commitment to students is obvious. As a professional educator, Brenda works closely with her students during and after school, ensuring that they do their best. Her colleagues know her as a dedicated teacher because she puts so much time into coaching the speech team, serving as a Building Representative, and fighting for the improvement of education.  Dennis Keithley teaches Language Arts at Lowell Middle School and has been a teacher within the Tri-Creek School Corporation for 31 years. Dennis graduated from Lowell High School and returned to teach in Lowell where his family has lived for many years. Dennis is a true champion of his students. He attends sporting events, music programs, drama productions, and graduation exercises in support of the students. Not only does Dennis care about his students, he also cares about his co-workers. Dennis has worked tirelessly for the Tri-Creek Teachers Organization by serving as its co-president for the last eight years. Additionally, he has served on the negotiating team, the high school air quality committee, the retirement benefits committee, the finance committee, and the teacher's evaluation committee. Dennis' dedication to the profession of teaching is exemplary.  Martin Kessler teaches math in the School Town of Highland. He has been a dedicated teacher to all of his students for the past 31 years. His sense of humor and teaching style has withstood the test of time. He is an entertainer as much as an educator and the kids love it! Martin makes learning math fun even for students who have had difficulty in the past. Through his caring attitude, Martin exhibits a great deal of thoughtfulness towards both student and teachers. He is involved in the local Indiana Teacher's Association and always supports his fellow teachers with action, not just words.  Marilyn Qualls from the Lake Central School Corporation always puts kids first. Throughout her career as an elementary teacher she has made personal sacrifices of time and effort to make sure each child in her classroom succeeds. Additionally, as a Building Representative, member of the District Council, and part of the bargaining team, she has always represented the teachers to the best of her ability. Marilyn is a continuous source of enthusiasm for her students and others as well.  For the past 20 years, Martiann Rectenwall has been an asset to the Hanover Community School Corporation. She creates interesting and innovative lessons that inspire her students to reach their fullest potential. Martiann inspires creative thought and promotes higher level thinking skills in all of her lessons. Her colleagues know her as a dedicated teacher since she puts so much time into developing special projects for her students. For Martiann, working extra hours or creating new teaching strategies to help her students achieve is not unusual.  Sharron Thornton from Lake Central School Corporation is truly a devoted educator. Throughout her 25 years career at Peifer Elementary School, she has trained numerous student teachers. Her guidance is very important because of her methods of dealing with children and academics. She strives to be approachable and communicates well with administrators, fellow teachers, students and parents. Her special inner core of education-related beliefs and opinions are well received and respected.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my distinguished colleagues to join me in commending these outstanding educators on their receipt of the 1999-2000 Crystal Apple Award. The years of hard work they have put forth in shaping the minds and futures of Northwest Indiana's young people is a true inspiration to us all.                          ____________________
