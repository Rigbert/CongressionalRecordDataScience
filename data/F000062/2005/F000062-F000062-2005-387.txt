 President.  I would like to discuss the nomination of William Pryor to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. I have closely reviewed Judge Pryor's record, and based upon it, I believe that Judge Pryor would have difficulty putting aside his extreme views in interpreting the law. Consequently, I do not believe that Judge Pryor should be confirmed to a lifetime appointment on the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals.  Before President Bush's recess appointment of William Pryor to the Eleventh Circuit in February 2004, Pryor had not been a judge. As a result, he lacks a record as a sitting judge through which his judicial temperament and impartiality may be examined. Consequently, one must look to Judge Pryor's actions and statements throughout his career.  In his career, Judge Pryor has primarily been a politician, and considering the vehemence with which he has advocated his political views, I have serious concerns that he can set aside those views and apply the law in an independent, non-partisan fashion.  First, I want to be very clear about one thing. My objection to confirming Judge Pryor to a lifetime seat on the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals has nothing to do with Judge Pryor's personal religious beliefs.
