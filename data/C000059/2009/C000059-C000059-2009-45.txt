Speaker, in 1996, I created the E-Verify program, and I will not idly stand by while a coalition of pro-amnesty groups and their allies in big business kill this program in the dead of night. The American people have repeatedly voiced their support for employment verification; yet, we find that, once again, special interests win out.  While nearly 1 trillion taxpayer dollars are going to be spent in this Reid/Pelosi stimulus plan, there is no assurance that the job it created will go to American workers. Amendments to reauthorize the E-Verify program, which expires on March 6 and requires any entity receiving stimulus funds to participate in E-Verify, both of which had been accepted in the House Appropriations Committee, were stripped out of the bill without discussion or debate.  The one candle in the darkness of this disastrous bill was the reauthorization requirements to use E-Verify. Now, we are left with legislation that places the interests of illegal immigrants above those of hard-working American families and leaves this bill at the foot of future generations.
