Speaker, this book has not hit the best seller list yet, but it should. This lays out the agenda of the President for the future of our economy, jobs, Social Security, and other programs. Actually, we have got to give the principal author, Mr. Mankiw, the President's chief economic adviser, some points for extraordinary honesty.  A quote from page 229, in reference to trade, of course, the United States of America is running a huge and growing trade deficit. We will borrow more than one-half of $1 trillion, $500 billion, from overseas to finance this. We are hemorrhaging jobs. U.S. corporations flee overseas to exploit cheap labor and Mr. Mankiw says that is all to the good. ``When a good or service is produced more cheaply abroad, it makes more sense to import it than to make or provide it domestically.''  He went on to say that exporting trade jobs realizes the dream of free trade that economies have talked about for 2 centuries.                              {time}  2000  But then he says not to worry, because, of course, we have a comparative advantage. Well, the question would be, a comparative advantage in what?  Well, since they told us first we are going to lose those obsolete manufacturing jobs, which I disagreed with, because I do not think you can be a great Nation if you do not make things anymore, but then they said, do not worry, we are going to go to the intellectual jobs. We will do those sorts of things, and we will protect those through these trade agreements. Well, we now find we are exporting those intellectual jobs, and, in fact, we are also losing them to unfair trade.  But, remember, this President supported Most Favored Nation status for the bloody dictators of Beijing, the Communist Government of China, because of the insistence of U.S. corporations. It says here, do not worry, we will defend our intellectual property against countries like China, which regularly steal it. It said that if you bring intellectual property into China, within 24 hours it will be on the streets in counterfeit form; but yet this administration, which says if a country is found to be in violation of their obligations under a trade agreement, the United States could retaliate against those countries, against the entire range of transactions covered by the agreement.  That is right. Could. But guess what? Will not. How many trade complaints has the United States filed against the Communist Government of China for wholesale theft of American intellectual property, which is leading to our $124 billion trade deficit with China and the flood of U.S. jobs into that country? None. Zero. None.  A company in my district, Videx, an American dream. The guy started with Hewlett-Packard and came up with a new scanner technology. It is all made in America. All of it. He employs 160 people directly, and even in Texas he has contractors making this good. He has also developed an electronic lock. One day he found out, and he is operating in 44 countries, that he had been cloned. His company had been entirely cloned in China, including the Website, including the software language that says U.S. copyright or patents, translated into Chinese. The Chinese had even gone one better. They took the Videx Website and put a little waving American flag up in the corner on this phony Website for a Chinese company, and condoned by the Chinese Government.  I thought, well, certainly the Bush administration, who say they want rules-based trade, they will help this company. They are for small business; they will help this company. We went to the Commerce Department and the answer was, nope, sorry, you are out of luck. In fact, in a conference call just 2 weeks ago, this company, Videx, Corvallis, Oregon, was told by the Bush Commerce Department, those great defenders of free trade, intellectual property and rules-based trade, that, in fact, they would do nothing to enforce their intellectual property rights or prevent the theft of their entire company and product in China, as is happening to dozens of other American firms, because the big corporations do not want such complaints filed against China because it might make them mad, and they might lose access to the cheap labor to produce the goods that they export back here.  That is what this administration is all about. They talk about small business, but they are just there for a few multinational corporations. They have a real chance here to help an American company to save hundreds of American jobs, to stop the Chinese from stealing that product and the product of many other American firms and stop stealing those jobs. All they have to do is file a complaint.  The company cannot file the complaint at the World Trade Organization. The Bush people stacked the deck. The only way it can be filed is by the United States Government and the Commerce Department, and they are refusing to do that. If they care about jobs, if they care about the future of this country, they will eschew these radical free trade policies. And they are not only free trade, they are theft policies being pursued by other countries against the U.S.  This is not a level and fair trade field, and it is time that things changed. But I doubt very much under this administration that they will, because small companies cannot afford to contribute the millions of dollars to the reelection campaign that the big ones can.                          ____________________
