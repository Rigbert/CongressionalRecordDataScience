Chairman, first I want to thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Clinger] and the subcommittee chairman, the gentleman from Indiana [Mr. McIntosh], for their work to make sure that this legislation will not in any way impede the routine regulatory decisions and actions vital to commerce in a very workmanlike fashion, which my colleagues have done. They have addressed the concerns of the Committee on Agriculture; I appreciate that; with report language that clearly states this legislation is not intended to apply to the marketing orders and our ability to distribute the vital commodities that we have to do.  This legislation is good for agriculture, it is good for rural and small town America, and it is long overdue.  Now some of my colleagues across the aisle, I understand their concern, but they have expressed very reasonable concerns about the law of unintended effects, that this moratorium will endanger essential regulations. That is not the case. This bill exempts routine administrative action and most of the warnings that have been raised by the majority.  Now I realize virtually every Federal agency is under marching orders by this administration to warn of impending doom and that the regulatory sky will fall. That is not going to happen now. I am also sure that agency lawyers can interpret legislation to provoke all sorts of legal problems, if they so choose.                              {time}  1310  That does not have to be that way. We should not have a problem.  The other side of the story in reality is that regulatory overkill pouring out of this town has endangered the economic well-being and the essential services of virtually every community, every county, every State, every business up and down Main Street; every hospital, every school, everybody in America. The total cost, $600 billion nationwide, and it is breaking the back of our local government.  What is at stake is the very confidence of the people of the United States and their faith in our Government. We are regulating our citizens out of business with a shotgun, You-are-guilty-until-proven-innocent approach. The gentleman from South Carolina [Mr. Spratt] said we should not throw the baby out with the bath water. Right now the bath water would not meet the clean water standards, the soap would not be labeled right, the tub would be judged unsafe, and parents could not bathe the baby without proper instruction, certification and schooling. It is time for moratorium.
