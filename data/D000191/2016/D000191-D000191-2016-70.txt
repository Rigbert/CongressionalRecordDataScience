Chairman, of course, I have tremendous respect for the chairman of the committee, but it wasn't quite an accurate statement.  Courts have found that what Fish and Wildlife said is: If you want to have delisting and manage the wolf, you must adopt an acceptable management plan. Courts have found that neither Wyoming nor Minnesota have adopted adequate management plans. In fact, we have seen basically management to the point of extirpation. Even in States that have theoretically adopted plans, like Idaho, they are attempting to reduce the population to unsustainable levels.  There is a fabulous ``Dear Colleague'' from Mr. Ribble showing the biggest, fiercest, ugliest looking wolf I have ever seen attacking a small school child. Of course, there have been no wolf attacks in the lower 48 in the recorded history of the United States, but that is what we are protecting against here tonight.  They talk about predation on cattle. If we had better management of cattle, better husbandry--it is, basically, disease and weather are the biggest cause of loss of cattle. Then the number two cause is other predators. That would be coyotes. And guess what? Wolves kill coyotes. And wolves' preferred prey is not cattle.  So what is this insane obsession with killing wolves? I don't get it. I mean, were you frightened by a wolf as a small child. I don't get it. This is an incredible, iconic top species which actually helps regulate the ecosystem. Look at Yellowstone since we had wolves reintroduced there and how much more healthy it is.  I just don't get this irrational behavior. I would urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment and don't substitute political science and stupidity for science.
