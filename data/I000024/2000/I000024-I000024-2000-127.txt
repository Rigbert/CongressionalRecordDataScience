President, I am pleased that the State Department has filed an Article 84 petition with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). This will provide the basis for the United States to demonstrate that the European Union's (EU) hushkit regulation is not in accordance with international noise standards set by ICAO and is essentially targeting U.S. aerospace. Already this unfair regulation has hurt U.S. aerospace companies and workers because of the uncertainty it has introduced into the marketplace. Accordingly, it is imperative that the Administration pursue this Article 84 forcefully to show that we will not stand for discriminatory rules that hurt U.S. interests. If we do not make this point clearly, strongly, and now, we will have done nothing to prevent future efforts by the EU to act without regard to international standards and in ways designed to harm the United States' longstanding primacy in aerospace.  Filing an Article 84 is the beginning of what may be a long process. The mere fact that it may take a period of time should not serve as an inducement to the Administration to seek to shortcut the ICAO process by entering into a negotiated settlement that does not fully protect our aerospace industry and workforce. Further, we must make clear that the principle of adhering to international standards is essential in an industry as global as aviation. If we fail to demonstrate the seriousness with which we take this matter, we will inevitably have done nothing more than encourage the EU to try such incursions in the future.  I can assure you that I and many others will be working to see that the right message is delivered on this critical matter.                          ____________________
