Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his information.  Mr. Speaker, it is a time for us to be together, to be united as Americans, not as Republicans or Democrats, Liberals or Conservatives, and I thank the majority leader for his leadership in that effort and in remembering Officers Griner and Bailey and Cabrera, and all of their colleagues in the Capitol Police, and with our prayers for Steve Scalise and the others who have been injured. I thank the majority leader, and I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________
