President, every year in May we commemorate National Police Week, a time to reflect upon the sacrifices made by the men and women who serve in law enforcement. In particular we honor those who have made the ultimate sacrifice and died in the line of duty. Our law enforcement officers risk their lives every day to protect and serve our communities in Vermont and across the country. This year I am proud to say that Congress has come together to deliver more than just rhetoric in honor of this service. This year we are providing something much more important--tangible, lifesaving protection for hundreds of thousands of law enforcement officers. On Tuesday, the House of Representatives joined the Senate and passed my bipartisan reauthorization of the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program.  I originally worked with former Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell to establish the Bulletproof Vest Partnership program in the wake of the Carl Drega shootings on the Vermont-New Hampshire border. While the Federal officers engaged in a shootout with Drega were equipped with body armor, many of their State law enforcement counterparts were not, which resulted in the death of two State troopers. Now, nearly 20 years later, this program has provided more than 1.2 million protective vests to more than 13,000 law enforcement agencies around the country, including more than 4,400 vests for Vermont officers; yet the program's charter expired in 2012, and I have been working to reauthorize it ever since. The Senate passed the bipartisan measure coauthored by Senator Lindsey Graham last year. I am proud that the House has now done the same, and the legislation is headed to the President's desk for signature. This program saves lives and proves that Congress can work together to protect those who protect us.  While the Bulletproof Vest Partnership will continue to protect officers, we must never forget the more than 20,000 fallen officers enshrined on the walls of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial. These walls stand as a testament to the dedication and commitment of our brave law enforcement officers. Officers like Sergeant Gary A. Gaboury, a patrol commander in Shaftsbury and member of the State police dive team, who tragically died 24years ago today, on May 12, 1992, as he was attempting to recover a drowning victim. No matter how old these wounds are, our communities must not forget the sacrifice of Sergeant Gaboury and others in uniform.  Tomorrow the names of 252 fallen officers will be added to the walls of the memorial. Among those who will be added to the wall is Vermont State Trooper Kyle Young, who tragically died last September. Trooper Young, who suffered heat stroke during a training exercise, was the first line-of-duty death in Vermont in 12 years. Like so many of his fallen colleagues, Trooper Young died while working to be a better public servant. He hoped to be promoted to the agency's tactical team, and he died showing the same grit and determination that he showed throughout his life, always trying to achieve the next goal. Trooper Young was only 28 years old and the father of two young girls. He was an outstanding high school athlete who went on to serve in the U.S. Air Force, with tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. His colleagues described him as an active trooper who, with less than 2 years on the job, quickly found his calling.  The tragedy of Trooper Young's death will not be forgotten, nor will the lives of 23 other Vermont law enforcement officers who have died in the line of duty. Vermont is fortunate to be served by so many professional and dedicated public servants in law enforcement. That is why I have worked so long to provide law enforcement officers with what they need to keep both themselves and their communities safe. It is my hope that the reauthorization of the Bulletproof Vest Partnership program will do just that--and will help keep names off that wall.                          ____________________
