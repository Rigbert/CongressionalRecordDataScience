Speaker, it is my great pleasure to congratulate Ivy Tech College for ranking first out of 25 Indiana colleges and universities offering technical education programs. This honor, which is being awarded to Ivy Tech State College for the second consecutive year, is a tremendous honor for the northwest Indiana Ivy Tech campuses, as well as the communities they serve.  Ivy Tech is a major provider of technical education in northwest Indiana. The college continues to build upon its success by keeping abreast of the technological needs of northwest Indiana. Within the past year, Ivy Tech has added several new specialities and programs in accordance with the demand for specific business and health care technologies. Ivy Tech currently offers a physical therapist assistant program, which was developed in cooperation with the Methodist hospitals, to meet the demand for physical therapist assistants in hospitals and other healthcare settings. In addition, Ivy Tech has developed a banking and financial management speciality, in conjunction with Bank One, to enhance the education and skill level of banking employees, as well as others interested in the banking and financial services industries. Ivy Tech's East Chicago, IN, campus currently offers a new speciality in construction technology to assist in developing the skills of individuals interested in steel framing and other areas of construction.  These new fields, along with Ivy Tech's many other programs, will not only enhance the employment potential of area residents, but improve the region's potential to provide the jobs and services necessary for long-term economic stability. Perhaps the best indicator that Ivy Tech's efforts have been successful is their increased enrollment. Within the past two years, the college has shown a steady rise in student enrollment at all three of its northwest Indiana campuses, located in Gary, East Chicago, and Valparaiso. Ivy Tech attributes this growth to its success in generating a greater public awareness of its capability in the area of technology, as well as the partnerships it has forged in providing the region with a more highly skilled workforce.  The northwest Indiana Ivy Tech campuses relish the honor of this first place ranking because it reinforces the college's standing commitment to providing Indiana residents with state-of-the-art technical education programs. Today, more than ever before, training in technology is at the forefront of education across the country.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in congratulating Ivy Tech State College on the outstanding recognition it has received. The quality educational programs this institution has offered over the years, have provided a wealth of opportunity for many in northwest Indiana.                          ____________________
