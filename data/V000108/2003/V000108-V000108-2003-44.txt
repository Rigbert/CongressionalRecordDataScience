Speaker, it is with great respect and admiration that I wish to congratulate the members of the Crown Point Lions Club as they celebrate their 60th anniversary. To commemorate this special occasion, the Crown Point Lions Club will be having an anniversary banquet on October 18, 2003 at the St. Matthias Hall in Crown Point, Indiana.  The Crown Point Lions Club is a part of Lions International, which is the largest service organization in the world and includes over 1.4 million members throughout more than 193 countries. The mission of the Lions Club is ``We Serve,'' and the Crown Point Lions Club has selflessly given their support to the Northwest Indiana community, especially the people of Crown Point, in many ways. The Club has given financial support to 30 local organizations and schools, as well as contributed to seven state, national, and international programs. During Easter and Thanksgiving, the Lions donate food to those in need. They have provided sight and hearing testing machines to many local schools, helped the Crown Point Girls Softball Team get lighting for their field, as well as contributed to the good of the community by providing a Braille computer to a local student who is blind.  Throughout the past 60 years, the members of the Crown Point Lions Club have offered their dedication and support to their noble cause of serving their local community. Each year the Lions Club helps many local students obtain hearing aids and eyeglasses. Also each year they give a $1000.00 scholarship to a local student whose educational concentration is in hearing and sight related areas. This year, the Crown Point Lions Club is helping the community build a pavilion at the Lake County Fairgrounds.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating the members of the Crown Point Lions Club on the 60th anniversary of their noble organization. These giving and selfless individuals continue to dedicate their time and unrelenting efforts to serve their local community, as well as all of Northwest Indiana. It is their great desire for helping others that makes their organization and efforts such a motivating force in the First Congressional District, and I am proud to represent them in Washington, D.C.                          ____________________
