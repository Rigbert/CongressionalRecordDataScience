President, let me say to the Senator from Delaware, whom I admire for his expertise on foreign policy, I think all of us have an obligation to learn from, to ask, to seek guidance, to seek expertise from other Members, and I hope it is in that spirit that we are able to do this.  As Chairman of the Emerging Threats Capabilities Subcommittee on Armed Services, I work very closely with Senator Lugar on the Counterthreat Reduction Program. I do not think I can do the job without talking to Senator Lugar. SenatorNunn and Senator Lugar put that together, the Nunn-Lugar program. I talk with Senator Lugar a lot in regard to his perspectives on foreign policy.  I have not taken the opportunity that I probably should have to talk with the Senator from Delaware at great length--we talk about some things but certainly not enough. I welcome the Senator to come to the Intelligence Committee in regard to any desire he might have to go over or to review any of the intelligence material that pertains to foreign policy. All of that does, as a matter of fact. It was the State Department that pretty much got it right in the WMD review in regard to possible WMD in Iraq, and we know that and we respect that. We made a special effort to invite the State Department in, and we will be happy to visit with the Senator from Delaware about that.  I yield the remaining time I have to a member of the Foreign Relations Committee who is always telling me about the need to tie in the relationship with regard to foreign relations and intelligence. He is the distinguished vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee. We work together in a bipartisan way. We have gone through pretty tough times. We achieved a 17-to-0 vote in regard to the WMD inquiry.  We are not trying to deny information to anybody. We want to share it. We want to learn, especially from people such as Senator Biden.  I yield my remaining time to Senator Rockefeller.
