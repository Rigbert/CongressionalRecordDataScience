  Recall that I said reducing the 27 percent rate to 25 percent will benefit married couples with taxable income over $45,000. Now look at the median income distributions on this chart.  There is not one State on here that has a median family income of less than $45,000.  So you can see that our proposal will benefit everyone, not just an elite few, from a few selected states.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my second chart be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.
