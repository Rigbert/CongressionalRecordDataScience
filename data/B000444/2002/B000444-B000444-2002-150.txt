 We, the U.S. Senate, if they meet what each of us individually thinks is the minimum criteria or the maximum criteria, we take it seriously. This is not just a gesture of sending you money to help you move toward democratization to modernize your military. We, like the President, mean it.  So if the Senator does not agree with--and I understand--the statement by President Bush, which I happen to agree with, which I fully respect, then he should not support this. I happen to agree with President Bush and the other, as the Senator says, ``rhetoric'' in this piece of legislation.  So all it commits the United States to is to say the same thing President Bush said: We believe that all of Europe should be open and free, and that we will consider NATO membership for all European democracies that seek it and are ready to seek the responsibility NATO brings. That is what it commits us to, and that is why I support this.  I thank my colleague.
