Speaker, I rise today to honor Trish Arredondo for her lifelong contributions to the health and well being of Northwest Indiana. This is a very special pleasure as Trish is a close personal friend. I have known her for the better part of two decades and have seen firsthand the efforts of her dynamic accomplishments on behalf of her friends, neighbors, and community.  Trish Arredondo is currently President and Chief Executive Officer of the Planned Parenthood Association of Northwest/Northeast Indiana. During Trish's tenure, Planned Parenthood has made a vast impact on our community in the areas of both health care and education. The organization has grown three fold in the number of clients, and has tripled the geographic area served.  Trish spearheaded a capital campaign that has allowed the organization to purchase its headquarters and originate a ``mini-grant'' awards program designed to bring research funding to special aspects of women's health care such as breast cancer. She has been instrumental in increasing public awareness in women's health issues such as cervical cancer and teen pregnancy. Under her direction, the organization increased its medical services to include testing for Tuberculosis and Hepatitis B. Planned Parenthood is the sole provider of health care services for 75 percent of the 40,000 patients it serves annually. This evolution of the organization's role in community care has become an invaluable part of Northwest Indiana's health care system.  In addition to her role in Planned Parenthood, Trish Arredondo also gives much of her time back to the community. She is a member of the Northwest Indiana Executive Council, the Governor's Council on Health Care 2000, the Rape Task Force, the Welfare to Work Council, and is a charter member of the Northwest Council for Teen Pregnancy. She is a past member of the Northern Indiana Arts Association and was named as one of the most influential women in Northwest Indiana by the Times newspaper in March, 1997.  Mr. Speaker, I salute Trish Arredondo for her professional achievements and her many years of dedication to the betterment of our community. We in Northwest Indiana are truly thankful to have someone of Trish's talents on our team. Her life's work has been on behalf of those less fortunate in our community, and we are extremely grateful for her dedication and perseverance. Please join me in wishing her a happy and healthy retirement.                          ____________________
