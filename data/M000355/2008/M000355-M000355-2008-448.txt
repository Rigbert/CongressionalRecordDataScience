 President, it is my understanding they will not be able to do that. So in addition to the retroactive liability issue, which clearly is not solved by failing to act, we have this problem that the Senator from Arizona has raised with regard to new targets. We are clearly more vulnerable as a result of allowing this legislation to expire, which will happen Saturday if the House of Representatives does not act.
