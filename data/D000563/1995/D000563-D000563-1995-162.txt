Chairman, I am going to ask for a rollcall vote on this to establish the bipartisan support which we have discussed today on the floor, not only for the HACCP process, but for a speedy and expeditious process that brings these rules to a point where they will be protecting American families. I just wanted to make that point. I will be asking for a rollcall vote on the motion offered by the gentleman from New York [Mr. Walsh]. I think it will demonstrate the bipartisan feeling we have on this issue.
