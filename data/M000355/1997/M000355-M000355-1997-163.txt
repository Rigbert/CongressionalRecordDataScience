 President, I have come to the floor today to raise a matter that is of great concern to me and that is the inequitable repayment policy of the Appalachian Development Highway System [ADHD] Program. States like Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, Mississippi, and New York, which have prefinanced Appalachian road projects, are reimbursed at a 70-percent Federal match, while States expending funds for new mileage receive an 80-percent match.  Unfortunately, this error will cost Kentucky at least $7 million if it isn't corrected. Kentucky is one of five States to prefinance Appalachian development highway projects. According to the Appalachian Regional Commission, this error will cost those States up to $30 million.  It is my understanding that this inequity is due to clerical error that occurred during consideration of the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1978. Language amending subsection (f) regarding regular highway funding was included, but subsection (h) on prefinancing was inadvertently left out. Both the Carter and Reagan administrations attempted to fix this inequity, but not of the efforts have succeeded.  I have requested the assistance of both the bill managers in correcting the problem. I have also sought the advice of Senator John Warner, the chairman of the Subcommittee on Transportation, which has the responsibility of authorizing this program. I appreciate their willingness to assist me in finding a solution to this problem.  Mr. President, I would like to ask the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Shelby his views on this matter.
