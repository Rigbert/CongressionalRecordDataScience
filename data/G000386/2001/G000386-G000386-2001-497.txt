 President, I concur with my colleagues that the Trade Adjustment Assistance Act needs a thorough review to protect workers who lose their jobs or income as a result of import competition. I am committed to a top to bottom review of the Act this year and to work with members to make the necessary changes.  The amendment (No. 37) was withdrawn.
