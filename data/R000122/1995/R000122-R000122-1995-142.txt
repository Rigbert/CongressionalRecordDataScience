Speaker, I rise today to salute Alphonse Auclair, a distinguished individual from Rhode Island who through his dedication and hard work, has selflessly served the people of Rhode Island in many capacities.  Mr. Auclair is a lifelong resident of Rhode Island. He was born in Woonsocket, RI and was educated in area schools. On his 18th birthday, November 9, 1942, Alphonse enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps. After serving his country with valor and distinction in the Pacific, including the battle for Iwo Jima, Aphonse Auclair returned to Rhode Island.  Mr. Auclair served as a police officer in the city of Woonsocket from 1952 through 1977, when he was elected to represent his community in the Rhode Island State Senate. In this capacity, Mr. Auclair was a champion of veterans issues in Rhode Island. In 1962 he helped to found the St. Joseph's Veterans Association, which has played a key role in veterans affairs in Woonsocket ever since. In addition to working to improve the lives of Woonsocket's veterans, Mr. Auclair was instrumental in the building of a monument dedicated to the many Rhode Islander's that made the supreme sacrific in the Vietnam war.  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the citizens of Rhode Island, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring a truly exceptional individual, Alphonse Auclair.                          ____________________
