 President, I wish to recognize a venerable Kentuckian and veteran, Leonard Dishman. Mr. Dishman, along with a group of other veterans, was recently a participant in an honor flight visit to Washington, DC, and he was also recently recognized for his accomplishments in service by his hometown of Monticello.  World War II veteran Leonard Dishman experienced an unforgettableday on October 1 of this year when he, along with 75 other veterans, participated in honor flight. This memorable day began for Mr. Dishman at 4 a.m., when he and his daughter departed for the Lexington airport.  Upon arrival, he and his fellow veterans were greeted by Governor Matt Bevin and others who were there to wish them a good trip. Mr. Dishman's guardian for the trip, Larry West, commander for the local Disabled American Veterans, expressed how honored and proud he was to be a part of such an ``inspirational day.''  Honor flight provides an opportunity for veterans to visit the memorials in Washington honoring their service to our country. When Mr. Dishman and the other veterans landed in DC, they were given a police escort to every stop they made in the city. They visited the World War II Memorial, the Korean War Memorial, and Arlington Cemetery before they flew back to Lexington in the evening, where they were welcomed back by lines of people waving flags.  Mr. Dishman told his guardian, Larry West, that it had been ``the best day of his life.'' That same day, Mr. Dishman, a native of Monticello, was escorted by police with his family back to his hometown, where he was presented with a declaration proclaiming October 1, 2016, ``Leonard Dishman Day.''  Honor flight is very close to my heart, as my own father served in World War II in the European theater, and I am grateful to have had the privilege of meeting with several honor flight participants in the past. I am extremely proud to represent Leonard Dishman, such a remarkable man and veteran here in the Senate, and I extend my thanks for his service. I am sure my colleagues join me in expressing gratitude for his service as well. He truly represents the best of Kentucky.  An area publication, the Outlook, recently published an article detailing Mr. Dishman's day with the Honor Flight program. I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                   [From The Outlook, Oct. 12, 2016]     Dishman has memorable day on Honor Flight to Washington, D.C.       Saturday, October 1 is a day that 91-year-old Leonard      Dishman will never forget. He packed a whole lot of memorable      experiences in less than 24 hours, beginning with an early      morning flight from Lexington to Washington, D.C. and ending      with a special ceremony commemorating a day in his honor back      in his hometown of Monticello.       Dishman, a World War ll veteran, was among 75 veterans who      participated in Honor Flight that day. Dishman, like so many      veterans, had never gotten the opportunity to visit the World      War II Memorial, until he participated in Honor Flight.       Honor Flight's mission is to fly World War II, Korean War      and Vietnam veterans to Washington, D.C. for a one-day, all-     expenses-paid visit to the memorials that are dedicated to      their service and sacrifices. The October 1 Honor Flight was      one of only two this year, and it was sponsored by Toyota      Manufacturing.       The day began very early for Dishman and his family,      according to his daughter, Anneda Guffey. They left for the      airport about 4 a.m. Once at the airport, the celebration      began, as organizers had put together a big send-off for the      veterans. Governor Matt Bevin and others were there to wish      them well on their day.       Larry West, commander for the local Disabled American      Veterans, served as Dishman's guardian for the trip.       ``It was such an honor for me to be a part of this,'' West      said. ``It was just an inspirational day, and I am proud to      have been part of it.''       West and other members of the local D.A.V. learned more      about Honor Flight when Gary Campbell from the organization      spoke to them about it earlier this year. Since Dishman was      the oldest member of the local D.A.V., West thought it would      be a great experience for him. He noted that the priority of      Honor Flight is to involve World War II veterans.       Also at the send-off were members of a sorority that      provided breakfast for the veterans and their families. Once      the plane landed in Washington, D.C. the group enjoyed a      police escort to every stop along the way.       West noted that they also visited the Korean War Memorial      and the Vietnam War Memorial. The group went to Arlington      Cemetery, where they watched the changing of the guard and      the placing of the wreaths.       After a jam-packed day of touring different memorials, the      veterans and their guardians flew back into the Lexington      airport, where a heroes' welcome awaited them.       Two lines of people waited, waving flags and cheering. West      noted it was just like a parade.       ``Leonard worked the crowd . . . He had a ball,'' said      West. ``He told me later that this was the best day of his      life.''       It was about to get even better, as the group of local      residents returned to Monticello. Dishman and his family were      greeted by policemen who escorted them to the area near      Ringley Tire on North Main Street. Family and friends greeted      Dishman and he was presented with a proclamation designating      October 1, 2016 as ``Leonard Dishman Day.''       The proclamation noted the many military accomplishments of      Dishman, including receiving the Bronze Star of the      Philippine Islands for Liberation, two overseas bars, the      Atlantic Pacific Theater Ribbon, the Army of Occupation Medal      of Japan, the Good Conduct Medal, the Combat Infantry Badge      and the American Defense Medal.       Dishman was named the D.A.V. Veteran of the Year in 2011.       Dishman was overwhelmed by the turnout and the reception he      received.       ``I want to express my appreciation to D.A.V. Commander      Larry West, who was my guardian for the day, to the      Monticello Women's Club, the Monticello Police Department,      the Wayne County Sheriff's Department and the Monticello Fire      Department, as well as the citizens of Monticello and my      family and friends, all of whom took part in this event,''      stated Dishman. ``It was thrilling to see how our little town      pulled together and accomplished an event my family and I      will never forget. I thank you all from the bottom of my      heart for this amazing gift you gave me.''                          ____________________
