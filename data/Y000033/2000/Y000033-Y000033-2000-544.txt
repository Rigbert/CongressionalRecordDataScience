Mr. Speaker, today, I filed the bill report for H.R. 701, the Conservation and Reinvestment Act of 1999. This bill represented an agreement fashioned after five days of Resource Committee hearings and months of Member negotiations. On November 10, 1999, the Resources Committee ordered this historic measure out of Committee by a bipartisan vote of 37-12.  This legislation is the most comprehensive conservation and recreation legislation the Congress has considered in decades and provides permanent funding for valuable conservation and recreational opportunities that will benefit the lives of all Americans.  Title I provides $1 billion each year to create a revenue sharing and coastal conservation fund for coastal states and eligible local governments to mitigate the various impacts of OCS activities and provide funds for the conservation of coastal ecosystems. Several provisions ensure that the valuable funding provided by this title does not prove to be an incentive for additional oil and gas drilling, especially in areas subject to pre-leasing, leasing, or development moratorium. The intent of this legislation is to provide for conservation and recreational opportunities, and the authors and supporters deliver on that pledge.  Title II provides $900 million to guarantee stable and annual funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) at its authorized level. This dedicated funding would provide for both the state and federal programs included in the LWCF, while protecting the rights of private property owners. Even with the protections won during our negotiations, some feel this bill does not adequately address property rights. While not eliminating land acquisition nor the Land and Water Conservation Fund, H.R. 701 creates a Federal land acquisition process and provides safeguards to private land owners that dramatically improve the status quo.  Title III provides $350 million for wildlife conservation and education. This title, crafted by Congressman Dingell and myself, uses the successful mechanism within the Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act (commonly known as Pittman-Robertson). The new source of funding will nearly double the historic contribution made by sportsmen through Federal funds available by Pittman-Robertson and the Federal Aid in Sportfish Restoration Act (commonly known as Dingell-Johnson). Since 1937, these programs have contributed more than $5 billion, matched by the states, to benefit wildlife and fish.  Title IV provides $125 million to be used for matching grants for local governments to rehabilitate recreation areas and facilities, and provide for the development of improved recreation programs, sites and facilities.  Title V provides $100 million for the programs within the Historic Preservation Act, including grants to the States, maintaining the National Register of Historic Places, and administering numerous historic preservation programs, including support for Congressionally authorized Heritage areas and corridors.  Title VI provides $200 million for a coordinated program on Federal and Indian lands to restore degraded lands, protect resources that are threatened with degradation, and protect public health and safety.  Title VII provides $150 million for annual and dedicated funding for conservation easements and funding for landowner incentives to aid in the recovery of endangered and threatened species.  Since oil and gas royalty payments are not deposited into the federal Treasury as an end-of-year lump sum, revenue held within the ``CARA Fund'' accrues interest. Up to $200 million of this annual interest will match, dollar for dollar, the amount appropriated during the annual Congressional Appropriations process for the Payment In-Lieu of Taxes and Refuge Revenue Sharing programs. This provision is intended to fully fund these two programs.  Because of the breath of this measure, H.R. 701 enjoys the support of 294 Members of Congress. These supporters range from the most southern areas of Florida to my most Northern home of Alaska. Countless governors, county commissioners, and mayors have rallied around this initiative. I hope that the Congressional Leadership joins with us to pass this historic bill into Law this year.                          ____________________
