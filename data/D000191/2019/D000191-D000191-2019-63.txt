Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1984, the Disclosing Aid Spent to Ensure Relief, or DISASTER Act, introduced by the gentleman from California (Mr. Peters).  In 2018 alone, there were 14 natural disasters that each resulted in more than $1 billion in losses. Already in 2019, the President has granted over 50 major disaster emergency or fire management declarations under the authorities of the Stafford Act.  While insurance partially covers the cost of disaster recovery, the Federal Government, along with State, local, Tribal, and territorial partners, is spending billions of dollars annually to respond to and recover from these events across more than three dozen departments and agencies. That results in the fact that there is no clear and consolidated information regarding Federal spending on disasters.  The DISASTER Act would change that by requiring the Office of Management and Budget to annually compile and publicly release a report on disaster-related spending across the Federal Government.  I thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Peters) for introducing this bill so that we can obtain, in the future, this vital consolidated information and have it also be available to taxpayers of the United States.  Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this commonsense measure. It will do more to shed light on how limited taxpayer resources are being spent. Doing so will help better inform how we prioritize policies and spending to drive down disaster-related expenditures in the future and more effectively provide relief.  Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this bill. I urge my colleagues to join me in support, and I reserve the balance of my time.
