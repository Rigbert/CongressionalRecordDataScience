Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge the outstanding talents of Ms. Samantha McElhaney, a resident of Clinton, MD and a recent graduate of Suitland High School in Prince Georges County.  As a student of the prestigious Performing Arts Magnet School Program at Suitland, Samantha studied opera, singing in both French and Italian. Not only is Ms. McElhaney a gifted singer, but she is also a driven student and athlete. She enjoys studying biology, and has been recognized as a superior shot-putter and discus thrower. Outside of her vocal training, studying, and athletics, Ms. McElhaney has found the time to share her talents with the community by singing in the choir at Ebenezer AME Church in Fort Washington.  I am pleased to submit to my colleagues an article by David Montgomery which appeared in the Washington Post. It is my hope that this article will give further insight into the achievements and future of this talented young woman.                [From the Washington Post, June 1, 1995]            Powerful Voice May Carry 17-Year-Old a Long Way                         (By David Montgomery)       In the age of rock and rap, fine U.S. opera singers are      rare, so it caused a stir when Samantha McElhaney was      discovered recently in the practice studios of Suitland High      School.       ``She has the potential to be one of our great American      opera singers,'' said Elayne Duke, president of the Rosa      Ponselle Foundation, an opera talent underwriting group      outside Baltimore. ``This [talent] maybe will come along once      in our lifetime.''       ``I would call her a wunderkind,'' said Myra Merritt, a      Metropolitan Opera soprano who has taught McElhaney. ``She      has one of those dramatic, heroic, epic, full-throated voices      that comes along once in a lifetime.''       The object of all this effusion is a studious 17-year-old      soprano from southern Prince George's County. She is no      pampered diva. In her senior year at Suitland, she drives      herself to achieve good marks in biology, her favorite      subject. Last year she was one of the top high school shot-     putters and discus throwers in the county. She can bench-     press 185 pounds.       Most of all, she sings.       ``I wake up and get in the shower, I'm singing,'' she said.      ``I'm walking around the house, and I'm singing.''       At school, in addition to regular voice lessons, she spends      her free time in the practice studio. Her teachers say      McElhaney's voice is a remarkable gift, but it would have      remained the vocal equivalent of an uncut diamond if she had      not poured enormous work and study into her singing. Her gift      has become her responsibility.       ``She's very meticulous about her voice, her instrument,''      said Ronald Johnson, coordinator of visual and performing      arts at Suitland. ``She takes a lot of care and pride in her      instrument.''       McElhaney is one of many vocal talents nurtured at      Suitland, which has a performing arts magnet program. The      mellifluous singing in French and Italian that the audience      hears during senior recitals is the most obvious clue that      the rigorous art of opera is being passed down to a new      generation.       ``It is our opinion here at Suitland that our students must      be versatile,'' Johnson said. ``Along with the spirituals      [and other musical styles], we want to make sure our students      have a very strong background in classical music.''       McElhaney's relationship with music goes way back. She      could talk before she was a year old, and she started singing      soon after. Her nickname, Mandy, bestowed by her dad, comes      from the Barry Manilow song of the same name.       The family lives in Clinton. Robin McElhaney, her mother,      is executive assistant to the president of a trade      association, and Samuel McElhaney, her father, is a technical      information specialist for the State Department. McElhaney's      sister, Adrienne, 13, has been admitted to Suitland's vocal      program; she shows a talent for singing Broadway show tunes.       Growing up, McElhaney sang whenever the opportunity arose,      in the middle school chorus, in the choir at Ebenezer AME      Church in Fort Washington. Before she got to Suitland, music      was just a hobby. Her main goal, even as a 12-year-old, was      to make all the right moves that would lead to a good      college. She considered music a means to that end. She      realized she could use her singing to audition for Suitland's      academically challenging magnet program. She sang ``Amazing      Grace'' and passed the audition.       In McElhaney's junior year, her teachers noticed a      significant change in her voice. By senior year, there was      stunning improvement. Her voice had lost its ``breathiness''      and acquired a lyric timbre.       It was the voice of a much more seasoned performer than a      17-year old shower singer.       For the first time, McElhaney allowed herself to dream of a      career as an opera singer.       This spring, she won the prestigious        Rosa Ponselle Gold Medallion, named after one of the first      great American divas, who lived in Baltimore.       At her senior recital last month, McElhaney was resplendent      in a red dress with a black velvet jacket and a red      handkerchief. Before the piano began each piece, she would      bow her head, then she would look up and her face would      appear transformed, becoming tragic, comic, coy, as befitted      each selection.       The French and Italian lyrics soared and swooned and filled      the auditorium.       To lend her performance authenticity, she imagined a      private meaning for each piece that matched the emotion      communicated by the composers. So, when she sang ``Pur      dicesti, o bocca bella,'' by Antonio Lotti, a spritely solo      about a beloved and beautiful object, she was thinking      ``about me asking my father to get me a car, o bocca bocca      bella!'' she said.       She got six standing ovations. When the recital was over,      Samuel McElhaney brought up a bouquet of roses for his      daughter the diva.       The experts say she has the talent to become one of the      great voices of her generation--but they add a big if.       ``The next few years will be the most critical part of her      life,'' said Duke, of the Ponselle foundation. ``This is      where she is going to develop as a singer or lose her voice      altogether. That depends on where she will study and with      whom she'll study.''       Everyone has an opinion about how to manage the rising      star's career. Duke thinks McElhaney ought to study with a      private coach for two years, spend a year in Italy, make her      debut at age 21 and never mind getting a college degree.       McElhaney, for her part, cares too much about college to      forgo it. Besides, private opera coaches don't offer      scholarships. She is leaning toward accepting a scholarship      to New York University, which has a music program. If her      opera dreams don't pan out, she'll have a degree to fall back      on.       But she has faith in her gift: ``I love singing, and I know      it can carry me far.''                               ____________________
