Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers on this legislation. I do urge the passage of the legislation as a classic example of where people are working together to have a place to rest and save some great art. I congratulate the gentleman for introducing the legislation. So I urge the passage of the legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
