I mentioned on the floor yesterday that in the Appropriations Committee, we reported 12 bills, including the State and foreign operations bill. It passed, 30 to 0. It and the other bills have now been put on a shelf to collect dust by the House Republican leadership. We will probably never get a chance to vote on them. By doing so, by deciding to put the government on autopilot and drafting another continuing resolution instead, they will reduce by almost $500 million the amount that the Senate provided for fiscal year 2017 for the security of our diplomats and embassies abroad. It is very similar to what the House did when they refused to support the Senate's higher amount for embassy security prior to the Benghazi attack. They didn't want to admit it, as they spent tens of millions of dollars of taxpayers' money investigating the lack of security in Benghazi, blaming everyone but themselves. It will be interesting to see if they acknowledge that they are again cutting funds for embassy security.                          ____________________
