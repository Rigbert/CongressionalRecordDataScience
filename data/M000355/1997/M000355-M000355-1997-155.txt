 President, I want to commend the Senator from Alabama. I think this is a very, very important amendment. It certainly relates not only to the debate currently before us, but to the debate yet to be had in the coming months, or maybe even next year, about a global tobacco settlement, if that should be forthcoming.  I yield the floor.
