 President, on an entirely different matter, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate, on Monday, February 8, at 5 p.m., proceed to executive session to consider the following nomination: Calendar No. 360; that there be 30 minutes for debate on the nomination equally divided in the usual form; that upon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate vote without intervening action or debate on the nomination; that if confirmed, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action and the Senate then resume legislative session.
