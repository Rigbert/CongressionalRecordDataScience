 I will tell my friend, like the majority leader, I had a discussion today with Mr. DeFazio, who is the ranking Democrat on the relevant committee, Mr. Shuster being the chairman. I know they have had some discussions, but I also know that they are not very close to an agreement. I know that neither one of them likes the Senate bill that was sent to us. The majority leader and I had discussions on that. We didn't take that up. I thought that was probably the right thing for the majority leader to do, to not take it up.  Again, the majority leader says he is engaged. I would hope he uses his good office to get us to a place where we can pass a bill in a bipartisan fashion as, during my 34 years, has normally been the case. That extends for a significant period of time--no less than 5 years--at levels that are necessary to meet the infrastructure needs of this country, both from an economic standpoint and a national security standpoint.  I yield to my friend if he wants to say anything further. If not, Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________
