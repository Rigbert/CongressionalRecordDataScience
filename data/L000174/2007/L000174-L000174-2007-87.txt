 Mr. President, this debate is as much a discussion of principles that are vital to American ideals and to the American soul as it is a debate about who is going to act as the Attorney General for the next 14 months.  During the Judiciary Committee's consideration of this nomination earlier this week, Senators Kennedy, Kohl, Feingold, Durbin, Cardin, Whitehouse, and I made clear the fallacy that would disregard settled law and discredit America's role in the struggle for liberty and human dignity, something we should all support.  On the way to rationalizing support for a particular nominee, just as with rationalizing support for a particular piece of legislation, it may be tempting this once--just this once, we might tell ourselves--tacitly to abet the arguments of those who want to define torture down to make it something less. Whatever the temptation--whatever the temptation, this once--we cannot rationalize away our core American ideals, the rule of law, and the principle that in America, not even the President is above the law.
