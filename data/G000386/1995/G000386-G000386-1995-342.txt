 President, today I am here to reintroduce revenue neutral legislation to reinstate the exclusion from gross income of contributions in aid of construction--known as CIAC--to a water or wastewater utility. Joining me as cosponsors are Senators Pryor and Reid. Senator Reid has taken the lead on this issue for a number of years.  This legislation has passed as an amendment in the Senate on two occasions. It is my hope that this year we will finally be successful in passing this legislation and having the President sign it into law.  Utilities are capital-incentive industries. Historically, they have received the capital for the construction of a utility extension directly from new customers, either through the developer or small municipality. The customer contributes this property, or a cash equivalent, to the utility. In this manner, existing customers will not [[Page S2845]] face rate increases every time the utility gains new customers.  Prior to enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, CIAC were not included in the gross income of an investor-owned utility and therefore were not subject to Federal income tax. In addition, utilities could not take tax depreciation or investment tax credits on CIAC. The 1986 act repealed section 118(b) of the Internal Revenue Code and thus subjected CIAC to tax as gross income. As we all remember, the 1986 act had two basic premises as its core. One, the tax base would be broadened and rates would be lowered. Two, cuts in individual rates would be offset by increases in the corporate tax burden. Clearly the authors of the 1986 act intended to ensure that the burden of corporate taxes was spread to all industries including utilities.  The removal of the exclusion from gross income of CIAC was intended as a tax on utilities. In practice, the CIAC tax is not a tax on utilities, but a tax on utility customers, primarily on developers and home buyers. State utility regulatory bodies, referred to as PUC's, generally require utilities to pass tax costs onto their customers. This is done in one of two ways. The most common approach is to require the new customer to pay the cost of the tax. But this is not a simple dollar-for-dollar charge. In order for utility to be made whole, it must pay on the CIAC, plus a tax on the tax. The phenomenon is known as gross-up. Depending on the State, a gross-up can add as much as 70 percent to the customer's cost of the contributions. In other words, a contribution of water mains valued at $100,000 would cost a customer $170,000.  Alternatively, the PUC's may allow the utility to recover the tax cost from existing customers or over a period of time from the new ratepayers. Not only does this defeat the purpose of a contribution, it also means a rate increase. And with many water utilities seeking rate increases of as much as 25 percent in order to pay for Safe Drinking Water Act requirements, additional rate increases can lead to calls for condemnation.  Whichever method is chosen, utilities do not pay the tax, they pass it on. Passing the tax on has detrimental effects, not only on the utility's ability to bring in new business, but on the environment, and most significantly, on the price of new housing.  Any developer faced with a large gross-up will have to evaluate its effect on the bottom line. Depending on conditions in the local housing market, a developer will ultimately pass the cost of the CIAC and the gross-up on to the new home buyer. The National Association of Home Builders has estimated that the CIAC tax can increase the cost of new housing by as much as $2,000 a unit. This additional cost is enough to end the dream of home ownership for a young couple.  The CIAC tax also has some important environmental effects. New customers can avoid paying the CIAC tax by building their own independent water systems. This leads to a proliferation of systems that may not have the financial, technical, or managerial ability to comply with the rigorous requirements of the Safe Drinking Water Act. Such systems are referred to as nonviable. According to the EPA, in fiscal year 1990, more than 90 percent of the violations of the Safe Drinking Water Act were made by systems serving less than 3,300 individuals. By encouraging the proliferation of nonviable systems, the CIAC tax frustrates the environmental policy goal of consolidating these systems into already existing, professionally managed systems.  Mr. President, section 118(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, exempting CIAC from the gross income, should be restored. It is a tax on capital, not income. It is not a tax on utilities, it is a tax on their customers. The CIAC tax increases the price of new homes, leads to the development of environmentally unsound water and sewage facilities, and reduces the tax base for all levels of government.  Most important in my opinion, elimination of the CIAC tax will help home buyers, not by fueling real estate speculation, but by removing another barrier to the purchase of a new home. Anyone who has bought a house recently knows you don't just pay the price of the house. You pay closing costs, title costs, title insurance fees, attorney's fees, and points. And when you buy a house hooked up to privately owned utilities, you also pay the CIAC tax--as much as $2,000 per unit.  This legislation was most recently estimated to cost $106 million over 5 years. I have included a revenue offset in the bill as introduced that raises $140 million over the same period, thus netting $34 million for the Federal Government. The offset extends depreciation on new water utility plant from 20 to 25 years and switches from 150 percent declining balance to straight-line depreciation. This offset was suggested by the investor-owned water industry and is indivisible from the substance of the legislation which is the restoration of the exclusion of CIAC from gross income. The industry suggested it only for the purpose of repealing the CIAC tax, and that is its only intended use.  Mr. President, repeal of the tax on CIAC for water and wastewater utilities will have a noticeable effect on both housing prices and environmental policy. It is supported by the National Association of Water Companies, the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, and the National Association of Home Builders. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this important legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 448       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
