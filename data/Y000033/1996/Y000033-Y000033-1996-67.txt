Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  May again I remind that he who protests too loudly, what is wrong with the Congress, the house of the people, having a say? There is nothing wrong. I urge the people that are watching this debate to consider the people's involvement. There is nothing in this bill that repeals any existing heritage sites or biosphere sites. I am suggesting respectfully, all I am asking these people to understand, let the Congress play a role in making these designations.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California [Mr. Herger].
