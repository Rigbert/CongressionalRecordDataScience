If I am not mistaken, it has been 6 years that we have been trying to do this--maybe longer--and this important infrastructure legislation is an example of bipartisan cooperation.  Many people from time to time ask why we spend so much time arguing on the floor of the Senate. I hope they paid close attention to the proceedings of the last week, when Senator Boxer and Senator Inhofe, on a bipartisan basis, managed to pass a critically important bill for the United States of America. I salute them. It is an important bill for my State, the Midwest, and the Nation.                          ____________________
