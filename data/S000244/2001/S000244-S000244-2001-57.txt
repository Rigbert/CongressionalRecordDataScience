Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2047 and urge the House to adopt the measure. The purpose of this bill is to authorize the Patent and Trademark Office to retain all of the user fee revenue it collects in fiscal year 2002 for agency operations subject to appropriations. In addition, the PTO is to earmark a portion of this revenue to address problems relating to its computer systems and to develop a 5-year strategic plan to establish goals and methods by which the agency can enhance patent and trademark quality, while reducing application pendency.  The bill will allow us to move forward and to make the PTO a more responsive and efficient agency that will better serve the needs of inventors and trademark filers.  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
