Chairman, I rise to offer an amendment to the bill which makes a number of technical changes and substantive improvements to title I of the bill dealing with the sex offender registration and notification requirements and related issues. Let me briefly summarize some of the most important provisions.  First, the amendment includes a requirement that the Bureau of Prisons provide adequate treatment programs for sex offenders in all six of the regions and that they have adequate access to treatment in both residential and nonresidential programs.  Second, the amendment authorizes grants to States for prosecution of cases solved by DNA evidence. With the overwhelming passage of the Justice for All Act last Congress, this body recognized that DNA is a valuable tool for solving crimes. The amendment incorporates the proposal by the gentleman from California (Mr. Gallegly) which will further assist States in hiring more prosecutors and investigators for cases solved by DNA evidence.  Third, the amendment includes proposals contained in H.R. 3687, offered by the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Gutknecht), the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Delahunt), and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe), and specifically authorizes technical assistance grants to improve the quality of criminal investigation and prosecution of child abuse cases.  Fourth, the amendment expands on the pilot program for electronic monitoring programs for sex offenders. As technology develops, we need to use tracking technologies to monitor sex offenders' locations and movements so that the public can be protected and law enforcement can intervene before another tragic attack against a child occurs.  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment in the bill.
