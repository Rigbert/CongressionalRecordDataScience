 President, I rise today in support of H.R. 2646, as amended, the Veterans Health Care Facilities Capital Improvement Act of 2011. I urge our colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation, which would allow for new construction projects in five States and Puerto Rico and would extend several VA programs, including vital homeless programs.  Last year, Congress passed, and the President signed into law, Public Law 112-10, Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, and provided an advanced appropriation of fiscal year 2012 funding for veterans' health care. Enacting H.R. 2646, as amended, would avoid interruptions in VA programs and would allow VA to use the full amount of funding provided through Public Law 112-10.  VA has worked tirelessly to get veterans off the streets and into housing. Their efforts are commendable, but there is still work to be done. H.R. 2646, as amended, contains critical extensions to many of VA's programs to end homelessness among veterans. This bill would allow VA to continue to operate the drop-in resource centers that help connect homeless veterans to services; provide grants to transitional housing programs for the most vulnerable homeless veterans, such as the frail elderly, terminally ill, women with children, and seriously mentally ill; and continue its street outreach and emergency care services for homeless veterans. These programs are on the front line of VA's services for homeless veterans.  One of the best ways to end veteran homelessness is to prevent it from happening. This bill would support VA's homelessness prevention and rapid rehousing programs by extending the Supportive Services for Veteran Families Program, a critical resource for stopping homelessness before it begins. H.R. 2646, as amended, also extends the Homeless Veterans' Reintegration Program, which helps homeless veterans find and maintain employment. Extending these programs will decrease the number of veterans who may become homeless in these tough economic times.  VA has a long list of construction projects that have yet to be funded. H.R. 2646, as amended, would allow VA to make critical upgrades to its facilities and infrastructure to ensure that we can provide care to veterans in a safe environment. For instance, this bill would allow VA to begin a $51 million project to seismically strengthen the nursing tower and community living center at the VA Puget Sound Healthcare System in Seattle, WA. Built in 1985, this building does not meet the current seismic code for Washington State. Located in an area of high seismic activity, it is vital that this building be upgraded so that the VA Puget Sound Healthcare System can continue to deliver world-class healthcare to veterans in a safe environment.  We must allow VA to continue work on projects such as seismic corrections in San Juan, PR; construction of new Polytrauma and Blind Rehabilitation Centers in Palo Alto, CA; medical center improvements and cemetery expansion in St. Louis, MO; and additional parking facilities and nurse education opportunities to ongoing projects in Fayetteville, AR and Orlando, FL, respectively. Additionally, it would authorize VA to lease space for outpatient clinics in Columbus, GA; Fort Wayne, IN; Mobile, AL; Salem, OR; San Jose, CA; South Bend, IN; and Springfield, MO.  This bill helps us honor the legacy of heroic veterans by dedicating VA medical facilities in their names. With the endorsement of every member of the Texas congressional delegation, the West Texas VA Health Center in Big Spring, TX, would be renamed in honor of George H. O'Brien, a hometown hero. With similar support from the Colorado Congressional delegation, the Telehealth Clinic in Craig, CO, would be renamed in honor of MAJ William Edward Adams.  Our Nation's veterans have sacrificed much in their service to this country, we must make sure they receive the care and benefits they earned.                          ____________________
