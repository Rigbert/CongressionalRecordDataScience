 President, I really regret the objection and I rise today to really plead with my colleagues to lift the hold on this really simple, bipartisan resolution that simply encourages our children to stay away from gun violence. I thank my friend and colleague, Senator Kempthorne, who has been working with me to try to move this resolution.  In 2 days it will be October 8, the day this resolution calls upon the President to establish a Day of National Concern for Young People and Gun Violence. In 2 days, the Senate will have missed an opportunity to send a message to our kids that gun violence is the wrong way to solve problems.  Fortunately, groups like the National Parent-Teacher Association, Mothers Against Violence in America, the American Medical Association, and others are spreading the word without our help. They are encouraging young people all over this country to sign a pledge and promise they--will never take a gun to school; will never use a gun to settle a dispute; and will use their influence to prevent friends from using guns to settle disputes. That is what this resolution is about.  Mr. President, this is exactly the message the United States Senate should be sending to our children. We want them to make a personal commitment against violence. We want them to help convince their friends to do the same. We want them to join together to fight against youth violence. Just like we should be doing.  We must pass this resolution. Let me read to you a list of the Senators who have committed themselves to establishing this day of concern and helping steer kids away from violence: Senators Kempthorne, Lautenberg, Smith of Oregon, Kennedy, Baucus, Specter, Robb, Akaka, Sarbanes, Chafee, Lieberman, Faircloth, Jeffords, Gorton, Reid of Nevada, D'Amato, Daschle, Rockefeller, Kerrey of Nebraska, Lugar, Feingold, Bumpers, Abraham, Craig, Collins, Wellstone, Cochran, Grams, Graham of Florida, Durbin, Boxer, Hutchison, Levin, Glenn, Moseley-Braun, Biden, Moynihan, Feinstein, Dodd, Bingaman, Torricelli, Johnson, Breaux, Warner, Frist, Inouye, Landrieu, Burns, Kohl, Kerry of Massachusetts, Wyden, Conrad, Bumpers, Mikulski, McCain, Snowe, Nighthorse Campbell, and Bennett. There are 59 Senators who are cosponsors of this simple resolution to prevent gun violence amongst our youths.  We all are convinced the best way to prevent gun violence is by reaching out to individual children and helping them make the right decisions. This resolution gives parents, teachers, government leaders, service clubs, police departments, and others a special day to focus on the problems caused by young people and gun violence. October is National Crime Prevention Month--the perfect time to center our attention on the special needs of our kids and gun violence.  A Minnesota homemaker, Mary Lewis Grow, developed this idea for a Day of Concern for Young People and Gun Violence. This will be the third year the Senate has passed a resolution urging kids to take the pledge against gun violence. In 1997, 47,000 students in Washington State signed the pledge card, as did more than 200,000 children in New York City, and tens of thousands more across the country.  Just think of the lives we could have saved if all students had signed--and lived up to--such a pledge last year. Consider that in the months between today and the day we demonstrated our concern about youth violence last year, we have had an outbreak of school violence. Eleven students and two teachers have been killed and more than 40 students have been wounded in shootings by children. In addition, we have lost thousands of children in what has become the all-too-common violence of drive-by shootings, drug wars, and other crime and in self-inflicted and unintentional shootings.  Last year, Senator Kempthorne and I led the cosponsorship drive of this resolution after his 17-year-old neighbor was murdered by a 19-year-old in a random act of violence in Washington State. Ann Harris' parents vowed to transform their grief into an opportunity to help teach our young people to care about each other and to stop the violence. This month, they are suffering through the trial of her accused killer. We should support them.  Mr. President, we must, absolutely must pass this resolution. I urge whomever has a hold on this resolution urging young people to say no to gun violence to drop his or her hold and let us send a message from the United States Senate to every young person in America: Stop gun violence now.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
