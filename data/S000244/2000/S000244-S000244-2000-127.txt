Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, this amendment would authorize a $700,000 study by the National Research Council on IT accessibility by the disabled and elderly. I would note that there have been studies conducted by a number of different groups looking at similar issues, including the Federal Electronic and Information Technology Access AdvisoryCommittee, the University of Wisconsin Trace Research and Development Center, the California State University at Northridge Center on Disability, and the Worldwide Web Consortium Web Access Initiative have all taken or are taking a look at similar issues.  I had some misgivings about the amendment as it was originally drafted, but since the funding will now come out of the available funds and not as a separate authorization, I will not oppose this, and urge Members to adopt it.
