 President, today the city of Dallas will hold a memorial service in honor of the five police officers slain in the senseless shooting during last week's peaceful protest. The victims are individuals who, like law enforcement officials in each of our communities, willingly put their lives on the line every day to keep us safe. Their loss is a tragic reminder of the courage and selflessness they possessed, just as it is a reminder of the burdens their family bear on our behalf. Today we remember each of them.  I know I speak for the entire Senate in saying our hearts are with the families and friends of each of these victims, the others wounded, the entire law enforcement community, and the city of Dallas.  Our Nation experienced a great deal of suffering and heartbreak last week. We must come together now to overcome these tragedies and allow healing to prevail.                          ____________________
