President, Members of the Senate may have read in the papers a few weeks ago about the discovery of a Revolutionary War gunboat found in the waters of Lake Champlain, bordering my home State of Vermont. There, perfectly preserved in the cold, fresh, dark water, lying upright on the bottom, is a 54-foot gunboat, its mast still standing and its bow cannon in place.  This gunboat is one of eight led by Benedict Arnold against the British in the Battle of Valcour Island on October 11, 1776. Only four vessels survived the battle, but the British were forced to delay their invasion from Canada for an extra year, giving the Americans critical time to prepare defenses.  Mr. President, this historic find led the former curator of naval history at the Smithsonian's American History Museum, Mr. Philip Lundeberg, to say, ``This could prove to be the most significant maritime discovery in American history in the last half century.''  The exact location of the ship is a secret, and it will not be touched until maritime archeologists, working with the Navy and local authorities, develop a comprehensive management plan to preserve and protect this amazing discovery. The ship may be left as an underwater museum, or it may be feasible to raise and preserve it. We will not know until the management plan is completed.  In the bill before the Senate today, the Appropriations Committee funded a modest program called Legacy, which coordinates cultural resource management efforts among the four military services. I ask my friend from Alaska, will the Senator support my effort in conference with the other body to designate a small amount of Legacy funding to develop the management plan that will preserve and protect this important historical find?
