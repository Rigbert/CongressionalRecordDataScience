 President, I rise today to bring to the attention of my colleagues a fine Iowan and American. Tim Turner, formerly of Iowa, has been selected for his photographic skills to represent the United States in the First International Culinary Competition. This competition brings together professional culinary photographers from around the globe to bring to life the elements of wine and food in unique settings. The artists will be judged by professional chefs, members of the press, and the general public.  Mr. Turner began his interest in photography while at Heelen High School in Sioux City, IA, and pursued it further at the University of Iowa and the Brooks Institute of Photography. By combining his passion for cuisine with his keen eye for photography he has received major recognition for his work. His photographs have appeared in over 40 cookbooks and he has been nominated three times for the prestigious Beard Award and received a Beard Award for best food photography in a cookbook.  Commenting about his photograph selected for the competition, Turner stated:       The human touch is vital to the authenticity of the food we      eat, the wines we drink and the heirlooms we treasure. These      are the connections to the heart and soul of mankind. This      photograph, uses a patchwork (quilt) as a metaphor for the      connection between food and wine, all are united by      tradition, in methods, techniques, knowledge and cultural      influences, passed through the generations. The patchwork      (quilt), sewn for the occasion, was created from scraps of      old fabric, clothes and my photographs reproduced on fabric.      Set in a timeless space, the chair invites the viewer to      explore and enjoy.  The competition is being organized by the Beaujolais winemaking region of France and competitors from 12 countries including Denmark, Sweden, Japan, Germany, Belgium, Switzerland, Italy, Norway, Finland, Great Britain, and France are displaying their artistic photographs.  I want to encourage my colleagues to log on to the website at http://lauriers.beaujolais.com/en to learn more about the competition and to vote for the United States contestant Tim Turner. The winner will be decided on February 1, 2005. I ask that you please join me in supporting Mr. Turner.                          ____________________
