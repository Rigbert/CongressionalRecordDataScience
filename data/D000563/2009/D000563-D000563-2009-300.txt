I say to the Senator, there is a pending amendment here on your side of the aisle from Senator Murkowski on this issue, and I would hope that the Senator has approached her to incorporate his language. I do not know if the Senator approached Senator Mikulski. But at this point we think we have some effort being made at fairness on both sides, that there will be Democratic amendments and Republican amendments both offered--Mikulski and Murkowski and McCain and Bennet--and so I would object because I believe we have the basis for a fair agreement at this point.
