All the latest research with respect to these children is really dropped-dead material. Unless you get there early, as the Senator from Rhode Island is suggesting, you end up, with a lot of these poor kids, playing catchup ball for the next 10 years.  So when it is convenient, I would like to engage the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island in a few questions about some of the other areas where he has contributed on this bill that, frankly, I think ought to help bring the parties together and help us fashion a bipartisan proposal.  I just want the Senator from Rhode Island to know how much I appreciate him standing up for those kids who do not have political action committees and do not have clout and cannot speak for themselves. At an opportune time in the Senator's address, I would like to be able to ask the Senator to yield just to address a few other questions about some of the areas on which he has focused.
