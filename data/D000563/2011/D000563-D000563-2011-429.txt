Sister Campbell said:       Our sons and daughters are prophesying to us. They are      telling us of a way that our nation should go in order to be      whole, to be creative, to lead into the twenty-first century.      We, the older generation, need to listen and act. Congress      needs to enact the DREAM Act.  At the DREAM Act Sabbath announcement, we were joined by Gaby Pacheco. Gaby has become a great friend of mine. She is a wonderful young lady. She is one of the leaders of the DREAM Act students. Her parents brought her to America from Ecuador when she was 7 years old. She was the highest ranking Junior ROTC student in her high school. The Air Force tried to recruit Gaby. She was unable to enlist because she does not have legal status in the United States. She was brought here as a child. She is working on her bachelor's degree in special education and wants to teach autistic children.  I met her last year after she and three other DREAM Act students literally walked 1,500 miles from Miami, FL, to Washington, DC, to raise awareness of the DREAM Act. Along the way these four students were joined by hundreds of supporters who came out to welcome them. They called their trip the Trail of Dreams.  The goal of the DREAM Sabbath is to put a human face on the plight of the undocumented students, like Gaby, and educate America about the DREAM Act and, of course, the ultimate goal is to build up support to pass the DREAM Act. DREAM Act students need more than our prayers; they need our help. They need our help to pass the DREAM Act. Dreamers like Tapiwa and Dominique Nkata, Jose Magana, Ola Kaso, and Gaby Pacheco are Americans in their hearts. They have stood every day in the classrooms across America, pledging allegiance to our flag and singing the only National Anthem they know to the only country they know, a country that they love.  They are willing to serve in our military. They are willing to pursue an education to add to a better America. All they need is the permission slip of Congress to give them that chance. I ask my colleagues to support the DREAM Act. It is the right thing to do. It will make America stronger.                               Exhibit 1                   [From the Network, July 12, 2011]        Statement by Sister Simone Campbell, Executive Director       I have worried that the DREAM Act has been mis-named.      Calling something a DREAM indicates that it is not real, has      no substance, is far beyond reality. That has led me to      wonder if it is actually making getting the legislation      passed more difficult because everyone thinks dreams don't      really come true.       Then I met students who would qualify for an earned path to      citizenship if the bill passes. I found out that their dreams      are rooted in the daily reality of their lives. They work to      learn, support their families, encourage siblings and      friends. They strive for better lives for themselves, their      families and their communities. They work daily to make      dreams come true.       This brought me to the realization that perhaps it is just      in Washington where the American dream has become fantasy.      The American dream has been built on the imagination and toil      of immigrants. Our nation has prospered because of the      innovation and creativity of all of the people who have come     to create something new. In Washington it is tempting to      forget the vision in exchange for partisan wrangling. This is      wrong. We must step away from cynicism that second guesses      every action and embrace the founding spirit of our nation.       As a person of faith I hold to the prophet Joel echoed in      the Acts of the Apostles trusting that the day will come when      ``Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your young men will      see visions, your old men will dream dreams.'' Our sons and      daughters are prophesying to us. They are telling us of a way      that our nation should go in order to be whole, to be      creative, to lead into the twenty-first century. It is now      time for the ``old men'' (and women) of Congress to dream      their dream and take this first step toward comprehensive      immigration reform. We the older generation need to listen      and act. Congress needs to enact the DREAM Act this year.                                  ____   Statement of the Rev. Richard Graham, Bishop of the Metropolitan    Washington, DC Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America       As the bishop of the Metropolitan Washington, DC Synod of      the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, ELCA, I strongly      support the Development, Relief and Education for Alien      Minors, DREAM Act. The DREAM Act is critical legislation that      would provide lawful permanent residency to undocumented      youth who attend college or serve in the U.S. military for      two years. DREAM Act supporters include President Obama, a      number of former President George W. Bush administration      officials, and the ELCA Presiding Bishop, the Rev. Mark S.      Hanson.       Last year I joined Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service      and Lutheran leaders to urge Congress to pass the DREAM Act.      Although I was disappointed that the Senate failed to pass      the bill, I stand committed to working with congregations in      my synod to advance just and humane solutions for these      ambitious and talented young people.       The DREAM Act is envisioned to bear fruit for young people      who came to this country as children. They are Americans in      every way except that they are not U.S. citizens. The DREAM      Act would provide a path to U.S. citizenship for children who      arrived in the United States before the age of 16, graduate      high school or receive a GED, go to college or serve in the      military and demonstrate that they are of good moral      character. These young people should be allowed a path to      become U.S. citizens because they have already proven that      they are Americans and they should not be deported back to a      country they do not know.       This issue is important to Lutherans in the United States.      Lutherans and Lutheran congregations have strong immigrant      roots. Almost all Lutherans can remember back a generation or      two to when their grandparents or great grandparents      struggled as new immigrants in this country. It is this      immigrant tradition and our commitment to welcoming the      stranger, regardless of immigration status, that compels the      ELCA to support and call for the immediate passage of the      DREAM Act.                          ____________________
