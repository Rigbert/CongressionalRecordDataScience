Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  The collection and the consumption of gull eggs is an integral part of the culture of the Tlingit people of southeast Alaska. Eggs were gathered at rookeries long before Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve were ever established.  The provisions of this bill are in accord with the recommendations of a study mandated by Congress on the issue, and the bill is widely supported throughout the environmental and conservation communities, as well as the Alaska Native community. The harvesting of gull eggs would only have a minor impact on the gulls, but the cultural benefits that would be realized by the Native community would be great.  I applaud the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young) for his leadership on this issue, and I ask my colleagues to stand with him in support of this bill.  I yield back the balance of my time.
