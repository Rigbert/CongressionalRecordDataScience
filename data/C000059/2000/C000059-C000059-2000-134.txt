On April 1st, Mr. Richard Roth, will step down as the Chair of the Greater Riverside Chamber of Commerce--a day that also marks Chamber's 100 year anniversary of service to the community. My district has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly give their time and talents to promote the businesses, schools and community organizations. Mr. Roth has proved himself one of these individuals again and again.  Richard Roth has a long and commendable history of serving Riverside County.
