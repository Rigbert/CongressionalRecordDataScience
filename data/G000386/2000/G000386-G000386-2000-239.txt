 By previous consent, the vote on the Gregg amendment regarding teacher quality will occur at 2:15 p.m., immediately following the weekly party luncheons. It is hoped that a vote on the Lieberman amendment can be scheduled to immediately follow the vote on the Gregg amendment. Therefore, Senators can expect votes tomorrow afternoon and possibly into the evening.  For the information of all Senators, it is expected the Senate will begin consideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. 434, the African trade legislation, prior to tomorrow's adjournment.                          ____________________
