 The most important thing is, for now, we object.  We would think in terms of looking at the economy and not only ways to support people who are in need at a time when the economy might be in problems down the road, but also to consider as part of a package things that would help the economy grow and create jobs.  It is essential we think in terms of expanding the economy when we put together packages that are needed for economic relief and not just to helpthose who are unemployed. We look forward to working with the other side of the aisle in seeing what could we come up with in terms of a package that will help people in need but also help to grow the economy.  Since that is not part of this package, I object.
