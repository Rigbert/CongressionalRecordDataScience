Chairman, I want to state for the Record that Congressman Dennis Cardoza, the main author of this amendment, will be speaking as well as Congressman Jerry McNerney of California and Congressman Jim Costa of California.  I yield the remaining 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Cardoza) to use and then to share with our other two colleagues.  The CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Ohio must control the time.
