Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, I thank the two gentlemen who have been speaking previously. We have worked very hard on this legislation. Frankly, I am pleased with the efforts that have been put forth.  Mr. Chairman, I believe it is important to get these Pacific insular areas involved in conservation and management of the fisheries resources off of their coasts.  Foreign vessels have been reported to be fishing illegally in the 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zone off the coast of these insular areas and they are part of our great United States. Frankly, when the gentleman from Guam [Mr. Underwood] walked in a while ago, I asked the gentleman to vote with me, and forgot he had lost his vote; both of the gentlemen. This is one time that I would frankly like to have the gentlemen's votes.  Mr. Chairman, I again support this amendment as it has been proposed and compliment the two gentlemen.
