I yield to the gentleman from Texas.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me.  Mr. Speaker, the House will convene on Tuesday at 12:30 p.m. for morning hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business. We will consider several measures under suspension of the rules, and a final list of those bills will be sent to Members' offices by the end of this week. Any votes called on these measures will be rolled until 6:30 p.m.  On Wednesday, the House will convene at 10 a.m. for legislative business. We plan to consider S. 1920, which extends Chapter 12 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code until July 1, 2004. In addition, we hope to consider S. 610, which would provide some important management reforms at NASA.  Finally, it is my understanding that our colleagues in the Senate are likely to pass the omnibus appropriations bill, possibly as early as tomorrow. However, I would like to make all Members aware that if the Senate does not act, we may be forced to move a long-term continuing resolution next week, as the present continuing resolution we are operating on expires at the end of next week.  I thank the gentleman for yielding and would be happy to answer any questions he may have.
