Mr. Speaker, as Vice Chairman of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I rise today in support of H.J. Res. 34, a resolution recognizing the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. It is a credit to the VFW that as they celebrate their centennial this year, they continue to be such a strong, successful advocate and service provider for our nation's heroes.  In my own state of New Jersey, the role of the VFW cannot be overstated. Their willingness to speak out about the problems facing our veterans and bringing them to Congress' attention really helps the New Jersey Congressional delegation as it seeks to secure the funding needed for New Jersey's veterans. Having the insights, first hand knowledge, and research data of the VFW and its network of members is critical to our efforts as we prioritize federal programs in Congress and work to give America's veterans the benefits they earned.  Since their founding in 1921, the VFW, with a membership of 63,926 in my state alone, has successfully underscored the principles of love of country, sacrifice in the line of duty, and our collective responsibility as Americans to ensure that our veterans and their dependents are never forgotten.  Today, as we send our young men and women in uniform to Kosovo, Haiti, Korea, Bosnia, and the Persian Gulf, just to name a few places where the United States has sent our troops abroad, the VFW strives to ensure that they are fully supported while in the field, as well as when they return home.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues today to join with me in passing H.J. Res. 34, and I congratulate the VFW on their anniversary. If the next 100 years of service are as successful as the first 100 years, our future veterans will be in good hands.
