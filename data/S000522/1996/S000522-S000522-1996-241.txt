Mr. Speaker, in October 1994 the Prime Minister of Russia and the Prime Minister of Moldova signed an agreement according to which Russian military forces would leave Moldovan territory by October 1997. Last April, the Russian Duma approved a resolution opposing the 3-year withdrawal agreement.  The Russian Government has stated its intention to live up to the agreement but little progress has been made. At present about 4,000-4,500 Russian troops stationed in as many as eight garrisons in eastern Moldova, known as Transdniestria. These are the vestiges of the former Soviet 14th Army which once had troops stationed throughout Moldova and the Odessa Military Region in Ukraine. The Russian Army has essentially maintained its force strength in the region, and troops have even been sent to Moldova to replace those that have been demobilized. Mr. Speaker, Moldova is the only former Soviet Republic upon which Russian troops are still stationed without permission of the host government, and Moldovan officials have raised this issue at several international meetings.  Mr. Speaker, I would note that the administration has consistently supported the withdrawal of Russian forces from Moldova. During his meeting with Moldovan President Snegur last year, President Clinton made clear that the United States expects the 1994 agreement to be implemented on time.  With respect to the international community, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the United Nations have passed resolutions calling for the removal of the Russian military forces. As part of the recent vote of the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly that recommended Russian accession to the Council of Europe, an amendment was included that Russia should ratify the October 1994 agreement within 6 months.  In view of this situation, I--along with Mr. Wolf, Mr. Solomon, Mr. Hoyer, and Mr. Durbin--am introducing a resolution calling upon the Government of the Russian Federation to adhere to the provisions of the withdrawal agreement signed on October 21, 1994. The resolution further urges the Secretary of State to use every appropriate opportunity and means, including multilateral and bilateral diplomacy, to secure removal of Russian military forces from Moldova.  In addition, this resolution calls upon Moldova's neighbors to recognize its territorial integrity and notes the efforts of the OSCE and the Government of Ukraine to assist in resolving issues that have arisen in Transdniestria, including the withdrawal of the Russian forces.  Mr. Speaker, I would stress that this resolution does not ask the Russian Government to do anything to which it has not already agreed. It merely underscores the concern of Congress and the American people for the implementation of international law and for the easing of potential conflict in Europe.  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.                          ____________________
