Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me. I can only echo what the gentleman has said about Ron. Ron Lasch was my friend. As the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton) has said, when I first arrived here 28 years ago, he was one of the first people who greeted me.  I learned to enjoy, and not only enjoy but respect, his wisdom when it came to votes. He was one who could always say, this is the right thing for you, if you would like to see your way to vote that way. More than that, when I went through some trials and tribulations physically, he was one that watched out, with Joelle and Peggy, watched out for me and my health when I would get a little bit excited, and that happened quite often. He always was a great adviser and a good friend, and told me when I should in fact back down and go away for a while and come back when I had cooled off, and do what is correct.  He is not really gone, he is just retired. He will still be around, I am confident, and give us a little bit of advice whenever we will ask for it. He will always be part of my career in this great House of ours, this House of the people.  It is rare when we have an individual who is hired to work for a large body such as ourselves that stays stable and maintains the decorum and maintains the wisdom that is necessary to go forth with the job and to advise those that are elected.  We hired him, as we hire the Chaplain and other Members of this House who have served for us, but he became more than just a hired person, he became part of us. As the gentleman from Michigan has said, he is a person we will miss. I am sure there will be some who will replace him some day, but not too soon.  Ron, again, may I say, has been a great asset to this House. More thanthat, he has been to me an asset for my career.  Ron, congratulations on your career. We will miss you, as the gentleman from Michigan has said, but in our hearts you will always be with us.
