 President, after dozens of meetings and a year and a half of negotiation, the Quincy Library Group developed an alternative management plan for the Lassen National Forest, Plumas National Forest, and the Sierraville Ranger District of the Tahoe National Forest.  In the last 5 years, the group has tried to persuade the U.S. Forest Service to administratively implement the plan they developed. While the Forest Service was interested in the plan developed, they were unwilling to fully implement it. Negotiations and discussions began in Congress. This legislation is the result.                  the quincy library group legislation  Specifically, the legislation directs the Secretary of Agriculture to implement the Quincy Library Group's forest management proposal on designated lands in the Plumas, Lassen and Tahoe National Forests for five years as a demonstration of community-based consensus forest management. I would like to thank Senators Murkowski, Bumpers, and Craig, Representatives Herger and Miller, as well as the Clinton Administration, for the thoughts they contributed to the development of the final bill.  The legislation establishes significant new environmental protections in the Quincy Library Group project area. It protects hundreds of thousands of acres of environmentally sensitive lands, including all California spotted owl habitat, as well as roadless areas. Placing these areas off limits to logging and road construction protects many areas that currently are not protected, including areas identified as old-growth and sensitive watersheds in the Sierra Nevada Ecosystem Project report.  However, in the event that any sensitive old growth is not already included in the legislation's off base areas, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee provided report language when the legislation was reported last year, as I requested, directing the Forest Service to avoid conducting timber harvest activities or road construction in these late successful old-growth areas. The legislation also requires a program of riparian management, including wide protection zones and streamside restoration projects.  The bottom line is that the Quincy Library Group legislation will provide strong protections for the environment while preserving the job base in the Northern Sierra--not just in one single company, but across 35 area businesses, many of them small and family-owned.  The Quincy Library Group legislation is strongly supported by local environmentalists, labor unions, elected officials, the timber industry, and 27 California counties. The House approved the Quincy Library Group legislation by a vote of 429 to one last year. The Senate Energy Committee reported the legislation last October. The legislation has been the subject of Congressional hearings and the focus of nationwide public discussion.  I thank my colleagues for ensuring that this worthy pilot project has a chance.                             Exhibit No. 1               [From the Washington Post, Oct. 11, 1998]                    Grass-Roots Seeds of Compromise                (By Charles C. Mann and Mark L. Plummer)       Every month since 1993, about 30 environmentalists,      loggers, biologists, union representatives and local      government officials have met the library of Quincy--a timber      town in northern California that has been the site of a nasty      15-year battle over logging.       Out of these monthly meetings has emerged a plan to manage      2.4 million acres of the surrounding national forests.      Instead of leaving the forests' ecological fate solely to      Washington-based agencies and national interest groups, the      once-bitter adversaries have tried to forge a compromise      solution on the ground--a green version of Jeffersonian      democracy. When the House of Representatives, notorious for      its discord on environmental legislation, approved the plan      429-1 in July 1997, the Quincy Library Group became the      symbol for a promising new means of resolving America's      intractable environmental disputes.       The Quincy Library Group is one of scores of citizens'      associations that in the past decade have brought together      people who previously met only in court. Sometimes called      ``community-based conservation'' groups, they include the      Friends of the Cheat River, a West Virginia coalition working      to restore a waterway damaged by mining runoff; the Applegate      Partnership, which hopes to restore a watershed in      southwestern Oregon while keeping timber jobs alive, and      Envision Utah, which tries to foster consensus about how to      manage growth in and around Salt Lake City.       Like many similar organizations, the Quincy Library Group      was born of frustration. In the 1980s, Quincy-based      environmental advocates, led by local attorney Michael B.      Jackson, attempted with varying success to block more than a      dozen U.S. Forest Service timber sales in the surrounding      Plumas, Lassen and Tahoe national forests. The constant      battles tied the federal agency in knots and almost shut down      Sierra Pacific Industries, the biggest timber company there,      imperiling many jobs. The atmosphere was ``openly hostile,      with agitators on both sides,'' says Linda Blum, a local      activist who joined forces with Jackson in 1990 and aroused      so much opprobrium that Quincy radio hosts denounced her on      the air for taking food from the mouths of the town's      children.       Worn down and dismayed by the hostility in his community,      Jackson was ready to try something different. He got a chance      to do so late in 1992, when Bill Coates, a Plumas County      supervisor, invited the factions to talk to each other, face      to face. Coates suggested that the group work from forest-     management plans proposed by several local environmental      organizations in the mid-1980s. By early 1993, they were      meeting at the library and soon put together a new proposal.      (The Forest Service eventually had to drop out because the      Federal Advisory Committee Act, which places cumbersome      requirements on groups who meet with federal agencies.) Under      this proposal, timber companies could continue thinning and      selectively logging in up to 70,000 acres per year, about the      same area being logged in 1993 but drastically lower than the      1990 level. Riverbanks and roadless areas, almost half the      area covered by the plan, would be off-limits.       The Quincy group asked the Forest Service to incorporate      its proposal into the official plans for the three national      forests, but never got a definite answer. Convinced that the      agency was too dysfunctional to respond, in 1996 the group      took its plan to their congressman, Wally Herger, a      conservative Republican. Herger introduced the Quincy      proposal in the House, hoping to instruct the agency to heed      the wishes of local communities. It passed overwhelmingly--     perhaps the only time that Reps. Helen Chenoweth (R-Idaho), a      vehement property-rights advocate, and George Miller (D-     Calif.) one of the greenest legislators on Capitol Hill, have      agreed on an environmental law. Then the bill went to the      Senate--and slammed into resistance from big environmental      lobbies.       From the start, the Quincy group had kept in touch with the      Wilderness Society, the Natural Resources Defense Council and      the Sierra Club. The three organizations offered comments,      and the Quincy group incorporated some. Still, the national      groups continued to balk, instead submitting detailed      criteria necessary to ``merit'' their support. When the      Quincy plan became proposed legislation, the national groups      stepped up their attacks. The Quincy approach, said Sierra      Club legal director Debbie Sease, had a ``basic underlying      flaw'' using a cooperative, local decision-making process to      manage national assets. Jay Watson, regional director of the      Wilderness Society, said: ``Just because a group of local      people can come to agreement doesn't mean that it is good      public policy.'' And because such parochial efforts are      inevitably ill-informed and always risk domination by rich,      sophisticated industry representatives, the Audubon Society      warned, they are ``not necessarily equipped     to view the bigger picture.'' Considering this bigger      picture, it continued, ``is the job of Congress, and of      watchdog groups like the National Audubon Society.''       Many local groups regard national organizations as more      interested in protecting their turf than in achieving      solutions that advance conservation. ``It's interesting to me      that it has to be top-down,'' said Jack Shipley, a member of      the Applegate Partnership. ``It's a power issue, a control      issue.'' The big groups' insistence on veto power over local      decision-making ``sounds like the old rhetoric--either their      way or no way,'' Shipley says. ``No way'' may be the fate of      the Quincy bill. Pressured by environmental lobbies, Sen.      Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) placed a hold on it in the Senate.       Despite the group's setback, community-based conservation      efforts like Quincy provide a glimpse of the future. Under      the traditional approach to environmental management,      decisions have been delegated to impartial bureaucracies--the      Forest Service, for example, for national forests. Based on      the scientific evaluations of ecologists and economists, the      agencies then formulate the ``right'' policies, preventing      what James Madison called ``the mischief of faction.''       But today, according to Mark Sagoff of the University of      Maryland Institute for Philosophy and Public Policy, it is      the bureaucrats who are beset by factions; big business and      environmental lobbies. For these special-interest groups, he      argues, ``deliberating with others to resolve problems      undermines the group's mission, which is to press its purpose      or concern as far as it can in a zero-sum game with its      political adversaries.'' The system ``benefits the lawyers,      lobbyists and expert witnesses who serve in various causes as      mercenaries,'' he says, ``but it produces no policy worth a      damn.''       In contrast, community-based conservation depends on all      sides acknowledging the legitimacy of each other's values.      Participants are not guaranteed to get exactly what they      want; no one has the power to stand by and judge the      ``merit'' of the results. Although ecology and economics play      central roles, ecologists and economists have no special      place. Like everyone else, they must sit at the table as      citizens, striving to make their community and its      environment a better place to live.       In short, Quincy's efforts and those like it represent a      new type of environmentalism: republican environmentalism,      with a small ``r.'' This new approach cannot address global      problems like climate change. Nor should it be routinely      accepted if a local group decides on irrevocable changes in      areas of paramount national interest--filling in the Grand      Canyon, say. But even if some small town would be foolish      enough to decide to do something destructive, there's a whole      framework of national environment laws that would prevent it      from happening. And, despite the resistance of the national      organizations, the environmental movement should not reject      this new approach out of hand. Efforts to protect the      environment over the past 25 years have produced substantial      gains, but have lately degenerated into a morass of      litigation and lobbying. Community-based conservation has the      potential to change things on the ground, where it matters      most.
