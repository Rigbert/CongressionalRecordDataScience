Speaker, Henry James once said, ``it takes a great deal of history to produce a little literature.'' Today I rise in tribute to the extraordinary people of Rossford, Ohio, who have recorded the first hundred years of history of their community in a book entitled, ``As I Recall.''  Mr. Speaker, a community is made up of neighbors who care, whose spirit makes the community what it is. This book, four years in the making and written by more than twenty members of the community, tells the stories of these neighbors, their triumphs and tragedies. It is their history that made Rossford the place it is today. And, as we see how life has changed since then, it's also a comfort to know that some things just don't change in Rossford--it's still a community where neighbors help neighbors and where people try to live up to the legacies of those who came before them.  The authors of this labor of love include: Josephine Ignasiak; Milo Louis Bihn; Stanley Brown; Mary Lou Hohl Caligiuri; Virginia Craine; Arnold Frautschi; Estelle Heban; Virginia (Grod) Heban; Arlene Hustwick; Lucille H. Keeton; Lee Knorek; Frank Kralik; Frank Newsom; Eleanor Nye (Mary Kralik).  Also Valeria Ochenduszko; Gabriel Palka; Sister Janice Peer; Rosalie and Steve Peer; Sally Plicinski; Jim Richards; Maureen Richards; Ben Schultz; Stan Schultz; Judy Sikorski; Pat Sloan; Charlotte R. Starnes; Audrey Stolar; Dr. Don Thomas; the Tisdale Family; Ed Tucholski; Irene Verbosky; Kim Werner; and Marjorie Wilbarger.  For me this book is very special as our father and mother operated a family grocery in Rossford when my brother Steve and I were growing up. We were flattered to be asked to include our recollections of Rossford.  Mr. Speaker, may we congratulate Rossford reaching this milestone and be inspired by the people who gave so much of themselves so that our history would forever be preserved.                          ____________________
