 I ask the Senator from Texas a simple question, and a yes or no answer would suffice. We are talking about limiting the fees paid to attorneys who represent children who are trying to get into special education. Could the Senator from Texas tell me, is there a law in her home State of Texas limiting the fees paid to attorneys in her State who represent children in special education cases?
