Speaker, the U.S. Constitution establishes the fundamental rights we enjoy as Americans. It embodies what is good and right in America. The first amendment to our Constitution provides for the right to peacefully assemble, and it enshrines free speech as being a basic tenet upon which the democracy of our great Nation rests.  As history has taught us, the Constitution, which represents so much of what is good in our country, also protects those who promote evil. I am sad to say that the Ku Klux Klan [KKK], which embraces bigotry, hatred, and intolerance, will exercise its first amendment rights and rally in Portage, IN this Saturday, May 11. I join the overwhelming majority of Portage residents--and others in NorthwestIndiana--in condemning the KKK and everythIng for which it stands.  The Ku Klux Klan is reviled around the world for its association with terror and violence. Through violence and intimidation, the KKK has historically punished opposing persons or groups, traditionally persons of color and religious minorities. Since its inception, the KKK has engaged in despicable acts of violence and hate, characterized by lynchings in the rural South, cross burnings, and other forms of hate crime. There is no place in our diverse society for this divisiveness. We must do everything within our power to stop the KKK and other perpetrators of hate crime.  In repudiation of the KKK, a wide variety of people and organizations in Indiana's First Congressional District will convene a prodiversity counter-rally to show America that the KKK's attempt to spread hatred in our community will not prevail. This Saturday, while the KKK exercises its right to assemble, an immense group of civic, business, religious, and student leaders will gather at Woodland Park in Portage, IN, to emphasize their message of unity and brotherhood.  The prodiversity rally is the brainchild of Eric Mason and Michael Krueger, two Portage High School seniors. As a result of their commitment to embrace and commemorate ethnic, racial, and religious diversity, the prodiversity rally, has grown into an enormous celebration. Participants at the prodiversity rally will include: Portage Mayor Sammie Maletta; a keynote speech by Jack Parton, director of the United Steelworkers of America [USWA] district 7; and the Reverend David Kehert, Dean of the chapel at Valparaiso University.  Several other organizations have passed resolutions or offered support for the prodiversity rally and its laudable ideals. Jack Parton, director of the USWA, district 7, has urged all steelworkers to attend the rally, while USWA Local 1014, United Steel Group's Gary Works, and an association of retired steelworkers, have also expressed their support for the counterrally. Alice Bush, spokesperson for the Healthcare Workers of America, district 1199, stated that her organization and Whispering Pines Health Care Center in Valparaiso, IN, are donating medical supplies for a first-aid tent at Woodland Park. This fine labor group serves all of Northwest Indiana. In addition, the Calumet project, a Hammond--based coalition of religious, labor, and community groups covering all of Northwest Indiana, has offered its support at the prodiversity rally.  Meanwhile, 29 pastors representing all faiths and almost all Portage churches, have united under the Pastors United for Racial Equality [P.U.R.E.] banner. P.U.R.E. has approved a resolution stating that, even though the KKK often uses Christian symbolism, it unequivocally and wholeheartedly condemns the ideals of the KKK and those of any such proclaimers of hate in our society. In addition, there will be a candlelight vigil to counter the KKK rally, sponsored by the Valparaiso Ministerial Association. The ministerial association is encouraging church members and others to make pledges to charitable causes which benefit minority groups or combat racism and bigotry.  Businesses are rallying together to oppose the KKK rally. In an effort to keep residents away from the KKK rally and promote security, Portage city officials have asked that Portage businesses near the site band together and close on Saturday afternoon. In support of this plea, many businesses have agreed to close early.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to commend the founders of the prodiversity rally, Eric Mason and Michael Krueger, for having the wisdom to bring the community of Northwest Indiana together to promote peace and harmony. May the actions of these distinguished young men, the participants in the prodiversity rally, as well as all of the organizations and community leaders who have pulled together to condemn the white supremacists' message--and, instead, promote diversity--be emulated by other towns and cities. The prodiversity rally is a powerful example of how to overcome hatred and pull together to promote unity. I join these dignified members of Indiana's First Congressional District in their commitment to ethnic, racial, and religious diversity. These ideals are truly what continues to make America the greatest country in the world.                          ____________________
