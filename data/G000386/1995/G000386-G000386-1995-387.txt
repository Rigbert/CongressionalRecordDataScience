 President, my amendment just read expresses the sense of Congress that Federal agencies should issue regulations with costs that are in keeping with the Congressional Budget Office's estimated cost.  In addition, my amendment just read will require that the CBO submit a report 2 years after this bill by Senator Kempthorne, S. 1, goes into effect. That report should detail whether agency regulations are in line with the CBO's original estimates when the legislation is passed.  If I could engage in discussion with the Senator from Idaho, Mr. President, I would like to at this time also present another amendment that I would like to have before this body. It is my understanding that both of these amendments will be discussed after the midafternoon deadline.
