Speaker, I am pleased to join with Representatives Anna Eshoo, Lee Terry, David Wu, Xavier Becerra, and Jo Bonner in introducing the bipartisan Medicare Medical Nutrition Therapy Act of 2005. Under current law, Medicare provides coverage for medical nutrition therapy services provided by registered dietitians and nutrition professionals to Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes and renal diseases. Recognizing that many other beneficiaries with diseases and conditions such as cardiovascular disease and obesity could benefit from medical nutrition therapy services, the legislation we are introducing today gives the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the authority to use the National Coverage Determination Process to expand coverage for other disease and conditions for which these services would be both beneficial and cost-effective.  Providing Medicare coverage for medical nutrition therapy services is sound health care policy. It can prevent unnecessary pain and suffering and save millions of dollars in health care costs by lessening the risk of chronic disease, slowing disease progression, and reducing symptoms. In response to a request in the 1997 Balanced Budget Act, the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences studied the value of adding medical nutrition therapy coverage to the Medicare program and concluded that this coverage would ``improve the quality of care and is likely to be a valuable and efficient use of Medicare resources, because of the comparatively low treatment costs and ancillary benefits associated with nutrition therapy.''  I urge my colleagues who have not yet cosponsored this legislation to join us in this effort.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Page E626]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]   INTRODUCTION OF THE MEDICARE MEDICAL NUTRITION THERAPY ACT OF 2005                                 ______                                                             HON.
