Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding career of an educator in our community. A lifelong educator with the Toledo Public School system, Ben Williams will be feted at a retirement event that will also serve as a scholarship dinner in his honor on May 23, 1998 in Toledo.  A product of the Toledo Public Schools himself, Ben began his career in 1968 at Woodward High School, where he taught general science and coached freshman boys basketball. Ben truly discovered his passion as a teacher and coach at Toledo's Scott High School in 1969, where he remained until retirement. While at Scott, he taught health education, became Chair of the Physical Education Department, and coached the junior varsity and varsity boys basketball teams. During his seventeen years as head coach, his teams have won an amazing ten City Championships, and last year, the Scott Bulldogs won the Ohio State Championship. No doubt, the Bulldogs with this victory expressed their appreciation to him for his lifelong dedication to them. Eight of the teams under his leadership have ranked among the top ten Ohio AAA teams. His accomplishments earned Ben the designation of AAA Boys Basketball Coach of the Year.  Ben's success as a basketball coach has not been simply about fostering technical skills and teamwork on the basketball court. States a noted local sportscaster, ``While building the area's top basketball program at Scott, Ben has not let his players forget why they are in school. He not only insists on athletic achievement but academic efforts as well.'' Indeed, 90 percent of his players have gone on to college! Truly a mentor to his players, Ben puts his philosophy into action, explaining ``Most of our boys come from broken homes. I spend more time with them than the typical coach. I have a year-round relationship with them. We try to keep basketball in perspective. Academic achievement and personality improvement are the most important things.''  Ben also founded the City of Toledo Recreation Department's Annual Early Bird Basketball Clinic, serving over 600 children in each of the 8 years he directed the program. He has directed various recreation and youth offices in both Toledo and Erie, Pennsylvania. Finally, he worked with the University of Toledo's Summer Sports Program for 13 years, from 1970 to 1983.  Ben Williams is a graduate of Bowling Green State University, where he earned both his undergraduate and graduate degrees. He has also worked toward his doctorate at Gannon College in Pennsylvania, George Washington University, and Sir George William's University in Montreal. He holds a teaching award from Phi Beta Kappa, and has received many other awards for his exemplary teaching and service to our community.  In addition to an extraordinarily successful teaching and coaching career, Ben is happily married to Arielle. They are the proud and earnest parents of Robert, Kristie, and Leah.  Perhaps Ben Williams' proudest professional moment came when Scott High School last year renamed its field house in his honor. In accepting the tribute, Ben spoke of his State Championship team. ``This close unit has shown what discipline, hard work, and caring can do for all who wish to beat the odds.'' Indeed these stand as fitting words by which we all might live.                          ____________________
