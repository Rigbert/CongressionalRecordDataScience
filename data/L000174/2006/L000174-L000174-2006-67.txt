 For years, I and others urged the Pentagon to ensure that U.S. checkpoints were clearly marked and that soldiers at checkpoints in Iraq are trained to warn drivers in ways that avoid confusion, not simply with lights or by firing their guns into the air which a driver might not see or that could cause a driver to panic. For years, we were ignored, with horrific incident after horrific incident, whole families gunned down, or only young children left alive after their parents in the front seat were riddled with bullets.  Iraq is an extraordinarily dangerous place and attacks against our troops often happen without a moment's notice. Split second decisions are sometimes necessary. No one suggests that our troops should not be able to defend themselves or that they should be penalized for unavoidable mistakes. But Pentagon officials stubbornly refused to heed the most reasonable, constructive suggestions, always insisting that they were acting according to procedures.  Those procedures were woefully inadequate and they devalued innocent Iraqi lives. It is inexcusable, because it was so obvious and many casualties could have been avoided with the changes that field commanders have recently made. All it took was caring enough to do it.  The article also mentions that the Pentagon has finally been investigating and reporting on civilian casualties. It is not an exact science, since sometimes a person dressed like a civilian is actually an enemy combatant, but it is vitally important that we do our best to determine the cause of civilian casualties that result from our actions.  Section 1223 of H.R. 1815, the fiscal year 2006 Defense Authorization Act, requires a report on the Pentagon's procedures for recording civilian casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan. That report, a copy of which I only just received, is an embarrassment. It totals just two pages and it makes clear that the Pentagon does very little to determine the cause of civilian casualties or to keep a record of civilian victims.  No one expects our troops to be forensic investigators, but we do expect the Pentagon to take this issue seriously and to do its best to document and maintain a record of civilian casualties. By doing so we can make clear that we value innocent lives, we are better able to know when and how to assist the families of those injured or killed, and we can make changes to procedures to prevent such mistakes in the future.              [From the Wall Street Journal, June 6, 2006]    U.S. Curbs Iraqi Civilian Deaths In Checkpoint, Convoy Incidents                            (By Greg Jaffe)       Washington--The U.S. military has cut the number of Iraqi      civilians killed at U.S. checkpoints or shot by U.S. convoys      to about one a week today from about seven a week in July,      according to U.S. defense officials in Iraq.       The reduction in civilian casualties shows that months      before the killing of 24 Iraqis in the western Iraqi town of      Haditha came to light, the military was pushing to reduce the      number of Iraqi civilians killed or wounded at the hands of      U.S. forces. The drop since July, however, suggests that      hundreds of Iraqi civilians were killed at U.S. checkpoints      or on Iraqi highways during the first two years of the war.       The shooting of civilians in such instances has angered      Iraqi civilians and political leaders. It also likely has      helped fuel the insurgency. Last week, Iraqi Prime Minister      Nouri al-Maliki lashed out at U.S. forces for showing ``no      respect for citizens, smashing civilian cars and killing on a      suspicion or a hunch.'' Mr. Maliki's comments were driven in      part by the news that U.S. military investigators had opened      a pair of formal probes into the mid-November incident in      Haditha in which Marines allegedly killed two dozen unarmed      civilians, including several women and children without      provocation. Evidence indicates that the Marines tried to      blame the incident on a roadside bomb and an ambush from      insurgents, say lawmakers and U.S. officials familiar with      the probes.       In contrast with the Haditha incident, where the killings      are alleged to be intentional, checkpoint and convoy      shootings are almost always the result of mistakes in which      confused or disoriented Iraqi drivers don't respond to      initial warnings from U.S. forces to slow down or back off,      U.S. officials say. U.S. forces, worried about their own      security and that of their colleagues, must make split-second      decisions to fire warning shots or open fire.       Such shooting incidents--or escalation-of-force incidents,      as military officials call them--result in civilian      casualties in 12% of the cases. The numbers don't include      civilians killed in raids resulting from bad intelligence or      Iraqis killed in the crossfire of battles with insurgents.       Until July 2005, the U.S. military didn't track civilian      casualties in these incidents, senior military officials say.      In December, President Bush estimated that about 30,000 Iraqi      civilians had been killed since the war started. His      spokesman, however, said the estimate was based on media      reports and not a formal military count.       The military's failure to track such killings has drawn      criticism from human-rights experts. ``If you don't keep      track of the civilians you harm, you don't know how you are      doing,'' said Sarah Sewall, director of the Carr Center for-     Human Rights Policy at Harvard University. She praised the      military for paying more attention to the problem but      lamented that it took so long.       Since arriving in Iraq as the No.2 military official in      January, Lt. Gen. Peter Chiarelli has made reducing Iraqi      civilian casualties in escalation-of-force incidents a bigger      priority. Gen. Chiarelli has been critical of the U.S.      military for using force too quickly.       ``It is something he has been pushing since we got into      theater, and we have been making good progress,'' said a      military officer familiar with the general's efforts. Some of      the decrease has been the result of changes in tactics and      training. Military commanders have been ordered to ensure      that their checkpoints all use the same signs and setup to      minimize confusion.       U.S. soldiers have been given new equipment such as sirens      and green lasers that allow them to get Iraqi drivers'      attention without firing warning shots. Soldiers also have      been schooled in new ways of spotting suicide bombers.       In April, Gen. Chiarelli directed his subordinate      commanders to investigate all escalation-of-force incidents      that result in an Iraqi being seriously wounded or killed or      cause more than $10,000 in property damage. The results must      be sent to Gen. Chiarelli's Baghdad headquarters. Before his      order, such incidents weren't always investigated.       In recent months, senior military officials have focused      less on finding insurgents and     more on keeping soldiers in one place, where they provide      daily security for the population. ``They are getting into      small towns more and staying for a longer period of time.      That cuts down on mistakes,'' says Andrew Krepinevich,      executive director of the Center for Strategic and Budgetary      Assessments, a Washington defense think tank.                          ____________________[Pages S10650-S10652]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                 PREVENTING CIVILIAN CASUALTIES IN IRAQ
