Speaker, I thank the chairman for his leadership and also the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis) and the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. John) and others, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Dingell), for moving this legislation so quickly.  Michigan is known as a Great Lakes State. I look at the other Great Lakes States. I look at Minnesota, the State of 10,000 lakes. Michigan has more than 11,000 inland lakes. But we have had 343 cases of West Nile this year, and the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. John) remarked that there were 16 reported deaths because of West Nile in Michigan. Actually, since those statistics, within the last couple of weeks, we have actually gone up to 21 deaths. So we are second only to the State of Illinois, which took a pounding by the Wolverines this past weekend, 45 to 28.  But in all serious, Mr. Speaker, this is a grave problem that not only Michigan but Louisiana, all States across the Nation are facing. It is important that this legislation pass today, and then the next step is to make sure that we have adequate funding so that the CDC through the Labor-HHS appropriation bill in fact have right resources to make sure that not only can we help eradicate mosquitos wherever they may be across this country but we also find a cure for those who are impacted.  I again thank the gentlemen for their leadership on this issue.
