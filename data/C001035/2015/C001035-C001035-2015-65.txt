President, very shortly we are going to be adjourning for a very important briefing, but first I feel I should just briefly respond to my friend from New Jersey on a few of the points he raised. I recognize that he is not a member of the Appropriations Committee, and I doubt he was hanging on my every word when I described what was in the bill earlier today, but the fact is we have some very important truck safety provisions that are in the bill. For example, we require the Department to issue long-delayed regulations that deal with requiring speed governors that limit the speed at which trucks can travel. That rulemaking has been delayed an astonishing 22 times. We require the Department to proceed to issue those rules within 60 days of the enactment of this bill. That is a very important provision.  If my colleague is worried about truckdrivers exceeding the speed limit and causing an accident, he should be applauding this bill, which says to the Department, in no uncertain terms: Stop delaying. It is past time to issue this regulation.  Another very important safety provision that is in this bill has to do with requiring electronic logs. This is an important safety provision because it will prevent those few bad actors in the trucking industry from falsifying their paper logs. We will know for certain how long they were behind the wheel and on the road, and we will know whether they are complying with the hours of service provisions. Those are just two of the very important provisions my friend from New Jersey may not be aware of given that he does not serve on the committee and may not have heard my speech this morning.  The Senator from New Jersey also mentioned other issues, such as the insurance requirements. I want to make it very clear to my colleagues that our bill does not prohibit the Department from proceeding with a rulemaking that might increase the minimum insurance requirement, but what it says, in a very logical way, is it should assess the impact--the impact on the insurance market, the impact on the truckdrivers, and the impact on the insurance industry. The fact is that approximately only 1 percent of crashes that occur exceed what is now the minimum insurance requirement. I still think it is worth looking at because it has been many years since this issue has been reviewed. We don't block the rulemaking. We just make sure there is a report that assesses what the impact is before the Department imposes whatcould be a huge and unnecessary financial burden.  I did feel it was important to clarify those three points. There is much else I could say about this issue, but I recognize that undoubtedly the Presiding Officer and others are eager to get to the briefing.                          ____________________
