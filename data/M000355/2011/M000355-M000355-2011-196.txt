 Really, I have a great sense of relief that my friend is going to run again in 2014 and continue to make an extraordinary contribution to the Senate and to America.  When I first met Lamar he was at the White House. I had just come here as a legislative assistant to a newly elected Senator. He had already accomplished a lot. He had been elected Phi Beta Kappa at Vanderbilt and graduated from New York University Law School. He had clerked for a well-known circuit judge, been involved in Howard Baker's first campaign, had helped him set up his first office, and that was before I met him.  Since I have met him, as many of my colleagues are already aware, it is hard to think of anybody--it is hard to think of anybody--who has done more things well. He went home in 1970 and ran a successful campaign for, I think, the first Republican Governor of Tennessee elected, certainly, since the Civil War. He ran for Governor himself in a very bad year in 1974. It didn't work out too well. But one of the things we know about our colleague Lamar is that he is pretty persistent. So he tried it again in 1978. He was elected Governor, reelected Governor in 1982--a spectacular record.
