 President, today I offer private immigration relief legislation to provide lawful permanent residence status to Jose Alberto Martinez Moreno and Micaela Lopez Martinez and their daughter, Adilene Martinez; Mexican nationals now living in San Francisco, California.  This family embodies the true American success story and I believe they merit Congress' special consideration for such an extraordinary form of relief as a private bill.  Mr. Martinez came to the United States 20 years ago from Mexico. He started working as a busboy in restaurants in San Francisco. In 1990, he began working as a cook at Palio D'Asti, an award winning Italian restaurant in San Francisco.  According to the people who worked with him, he ``never made mistakes, never lost his temper, and never seemed to sweat.''  Over the past 20 years, Jose Martinez has worked his way through the ranks. Today, he is the sous chef at Palio, where he is respected by everyone in the restaurant, from dishwashers to cooks, busboys to waiters, bartenders to managers.  Mr. Martinez has unique skills: he is an excellent chef; he is bilingual; he is a leader in the workplace. He is described as ``an exemplary employee'' who is not only ``good at his job, but is also a great boss to his subordinates.''  He and his wife, Micaela, have made a home in San Francisco. Micaela has been working as a housekeeper. They have three daughters, two of whom are United States citizens. Their oldest child Adilene, 19, is undocumented. Adilene recently graduated from the Immaculate Conception Academy and hopes to attend college.  One of the most compelling reasons for allowing the family to remain in the United States is that they are eligible for a green card. Unfortunately, there is such a backlog for green cards right now that even though he has a work permit, owns a home in San Francisco, works two jobs, and has been in the United States for 20 years with a clean record, he and his family will be deported.  Mr. Martinez and his family have applied unsuccessfully for legal status several ways:  In 2000, Mr. and Mrs. Martinez filed for political asylum. Their case was denied and a subsequent application for a Cancellation of Removal was also denied because the immigration court judge could not find ``requisite hardship'' required for this relief.  Ironically, the immigration judge who reviewed their case found that Mr. Martinez's culinary ability was a negative factor, as it indicated that he could find a job in Mexico.  In 2001, his sister, who has legal status, petitioned for Mr. Martinez to get a green card. Unfortunately, because of the current green card backlog, Mr. Martinez has several years to wait before he is eligible for a green card.  Finally, Daniel Scherotter, the executive chef and owner of Palio D'Asti, has petitioned for legal status for Mr. Martinez based on Mr. Martinez's unique skills as a chef. Although Mr. Martinez's work petition was approved by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, there is a backlog on these visas, and Mr. Martinez is on a waiting list for a green card through this channel, as well.  Mr. and Mrs. Martinez have no other administrative options available to them at this point and if deported, they will face a 5 to 10 year ban from returning to the United States.  The Martinez family has become an important and valued part of their community. They are active members of their church, their children's school, and Comite de Padres Unido, a grassroots immigrant organization in California.  They volunteer extensively, advocating for safe new parks in the community for the children, volunteering at their children's school, and working on a voter registration campaign, even though they are unable to vote themselves.  In fact, I have received 46 letters of support from teachers, church members, and members of their community who attest to their honesty, responsibility, and long-standing commitment to their community. Their supporters include San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom; former Mayor Willie Brown; President of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, Aaron Peskin; and the Director of Immigration Policy at the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, Mark Silverman.  This family has truly embraced the American dream. I believe their continued presence in our country would do so much to enhance the values we hold dear. Enactment of the legislation I have introduced today will enable the Martinez family to continue to make significant contributions to their community as well as the United States.  I ask my colleagues to support this private bill.  I ask unanimous consent that my statement, the letters of community support, and the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1536       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. ADJUSTMENT OF STATUS.       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of      law, for the purposes of the Immigration and Nationality Act      (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.), Jose Alberto Martinez Moreno,      Micaela Lopez Martinez, and Adilene Martinez shall each be      deemed to have been lawfully admitted to, and remained in,      the United States, and shall be eligible for adjustment of      status to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent      residence under section 245 of the Immigration and      Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1255) upon filing an application      for such adjustment of status.       (b) Application and Payment of Fees.--Subsection (a) shall      apply only if the application for adjustment of status is      filed with appropriate fees not later than 2 years after the      date of the enactment of this Act.       (c) Reduction of Immigrant Visa Numbers.--Upon the granting      of permanent resident status to Jose Alberto Martinez Moreno,      Micaela Lopez Martinez, and Adilene Martinez, the Secretary      of State shall instruct the proper officer to reduce by 3,      during the current or subsequent fiscal year, the total      number of immigrant visas that are made available to natives      of the country of the birth of Jose Alberto Martinez Moreno,      Micaela Lopez Martinez, and Adilene Martinez under section      202(e) or 203(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8      U.S.C. 1152(e), 1153(a)), as applicable.                                              Office of the Mayor,                             City and County of San Francisco,                                                   April 20, 2007.     Hon. Diane Feinstein,     U.S. Senator,     San Francisco, CA.       Dear Senator Feinstein: I write to express my unequivocal      support for your efforts to assist Jose Alberto Martinez and      his family regarding immigration challenges that they      currently face.       As you know, Mr. Martinez is a key employee of the highly      regarded Palio d'Asti Restaurant here in San Francisco. His      current occupation as a Sous Chef at Palio d'Asti is part of      a career that spans 20 years in the San Francisco restaurant      industry. Mr. Martinez is a San Francisco homeowner with a      wife and three children. By all accounts he is a model      resident and contributing community member. He exemplifies      the hardworking immigrant communities that have made San      Francisco what it is over the last 150-plus years.       I understand that despite Mr. Martinez's sponsorship      through the PERM program, and his history as a law-abiding      taxpayer in our community, he and his wife face a deportation      order. I believe that this order not only threatens the      future of his family, but negatively impacts our local      restaurant industry and Mexican-American community. I      therefore thank you for your efforts to what you can to help      allow Mr. Martinez and his family to remain in San Francisco,      working hard to achieve the American dream while contributing      to our community.       Should you have any questions about this letter, please      contact my Director of Government Affairs, Wade Crowfoot at      415-554-6640.           Sincerely,                                                     Gavin Newsom.                                       ____                                            San Francisco, CA,                                                   Apri1 19, 2007.     Hon. Diane Feinstein,     U.S. Senator,     San Francisco, CA.       Dear Senator Feinstein: I write to you to voice my support      for Jose Alberto Martinez, Sous Chef of the well established      Palio d'Asti Restaurant. Like thousands of San Franciscans      and visitors to San Francisco, I have eaten food he has      prepared for the last 20 years, Jose has supported the top      Chefs, and fed hundreds of thousands of diners, in San      Francisco primarily at Stars and Palio d'Asti (though also at      the Orchard and Omni hotels) and has maintained a spotless      record. Jose runs the kitchen with an even-hand and touch of      class. Jose is also a San Francisco homeowner with his wife      and their three children.       Jose's boss, Daniel Scherotter, Palio's longtime chef and      Gianni Fassio, the former owner of Palio, have alerted me      that this pillar of the restaurant community is facing an      imminent deportation order.       Fassio and Scherotter worked with Jose through the PERM      Program to get him a work visa, proving that Jose was an      integral, irreplaceable part of their business. I would      maintain that Jose is exactly the kind of hardworking      immigrant that has always been the bedrock of San Francisco      and its restaurant community. Please, I urge you to do      anything in your power to help keep Jose and his family      together here in San Francisco. Please intervene on Jose's      behalf in order to let him stay in line for a green card and      not be deported.           Sincerely,     Willie L. Brown, Jr.                                  ____                                             Board of Supervisors,                             City and County of San Francisco,                                    San Francisco, April 18, 2007.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senator,     San Francisco, CA.       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am writing in support of Jose      Alberto Martinez, the longtime Sous Chef of Palio d'Asti      Restaurant, one of the largest and best known restaurants in      my district. Palio has been an exemplary restaurant, both      under previous owner Gianni Fassio, and under the chef who      eventually bought him out, Daniel Scheratter. Jose makes it      possible for Mr. Scherotter to represent his industry in his      position as Vice Plesident of the Golden Gate Restaurant      Association.       Mr. Scherotter has brought it to my attention that, despite      Fassio's and Scherotter's successful sponsorship for a work      permit under the PERM program, and despite a clean record as      a lawabiding taxpayer, home owner and family man, Mr.      Martinez and his wife are facing a deportation order. I      respectfully urge you to do anything possible to help Mr.      Martinez stay with his three children, contribute to the      economy and the restaurant industry, and continue to live the      American Dream,           Sincerely,                                                     Aaron Peskin,     President.                                  ____                                                   April 19, 2007.     Hon. Diane Feinstein,     U.S. Senator,     San Francisco, CA.       Dear Senator Feinstein: Jose Alberto Martinez has worked      for me at Palio d'Asti Restaurant as my Sous Chef for over      six years. He is my right hand in every way. He always comes      to work on time and ready to enjoy getting his job done well,      I need only teach him something once, and he gets it, never      making the same mistake twice. None of this comes as a      surprise, to me though, because I worked with him as a cook      here at Palio 13 years ago. When I needed a Sous Chef to run      the kitchen at night, I made one phone call, to Jose.       Jose started working as a cook at Palio in 1990, when it      opened. I came along as a cook climbing up the ladder after      working in Italy in the fall of 1994, and stayed for a year      and a ha1f. Jose and his brother Mauricio were the pillars of      dinner service. The nights I got to work with both of them      were lessons in how professional cooks cook. Jose never made      mistakes, never lost his temper, and never seemed to sweat or      really even move. I thought I knew everything and talked      about it, but I could never reach the pure, silent efficiency      of motion that Jose embodied. At night, the Sous Chef never      even had to come into the kitchen, because he had the dream      team in charge. About a year after I started, the owner,      Gianni Fassio, had bypass surgery, and decided to close      dinner service. Jose and I had to leave to move on and up,      elsewhere.       In the late summer of 1999, I was working at the Kimpton      Group as an Executive Chef and General Manager at Puccini and      Pinetti, when Mr. Fassio approached me about coming back to      Palio, this time as the Executive Chef. He was having      mangement problems, which translate into cost and quality      problems. The hardest part about running a restaurant or any      business for that matter, is finding good management. I had      to fire 3 sous chefs upon arrival for blatant incompetence,      dishonesty, sexual harassment, bad cooking, alcohol abuse and      any number of other sins.       I tried a couple of classically trained Ameican Sous Chefs      with extensive education and experience, but one thing after      another would pop up--alcoholism, lack of common sense,      inability to handle pressure or criticism, big egos,      inability to communicate with, train or maintain staff, and I      can go on. I thought about what I needed: a great cook, a      leader, someone who spoke English and Spanish, someone who      could learn and take constructive criticism, someone who      would represent what I wanted on the plate and in person when      I was elewhere, So I called Jose.       It took time, Jose was working for a very well respected      French Chef as a cook. I offered him more money and a      management title, but since dinner had closed on him before,      he didn't know if the restaurant would be around for long. He      didn't want to bite off more than he could chew, as he was      very comfortable slaving away cooking and had never been      truly responsible before. Jose is all about stability, which      has made my life a dream since he finally started.       I taught Jose how to order all of the meat, poultry, and      fish and produce every night, taking into account the      reservations, historical sales figures, catering, parties,      prices and seasonality. He maintains a tight ship with single      digit turnover on his shift. His staff worships him and his      food is flawless. His ordering is precise, and he has learned      to think the way I think. Jose dwells in the details and      makes sure that everything is done right. When he started, he      told me that no matter what, if he did something wrong, that      he wanted me to tell him rather than be upset. That being      said, the things I have ever needed to correct him on      cumulatively amount to a hill of beans. He cooks a station or      two at a time, manages the other employees, the inventory and      the ordering while still supporting a family, another job and      a sense of humor. He has made it possible for me to buy out      Gianni Fassio and start out in business for myse1f.       My goal is to make Jose into my chef, as I use this      restaurant as a mother ship to open other restaurants in the      city. He's helped me bring his brother Mauricio, the other      half of the dynamic duo back to Palio, and with them there, I      can feel comfortable growing our business. I need Jose and      this restaurant needs Jose. I want to take him to Italy so he      can see how it is over there, and so his vision is not just      mine. but also authentic in its own right. When he gets      enough money together to open his own restaurant, I will      invest in it without hesitation because sure things are hard      investments to come by and Jose Alberto Martinez is a sure      thing.       I am willing to do anything to keep Jose here and happy. He      is the best possible person to run my business at night, and      eventually, I believe, all day. He has worked hard and played      by the rules since he got here 20 years ago. He is a      homeowner in San Francisco and a saint, respected by everyone      in the restaurant, from dishwashers to cooks, busboys to      waiters, bartenders to managers. He is well on his way to      reaching the American dream, and I can't think of anyone who      deserves it more, I implore you to appreciate what this man      means to me and to Palio.       Please tell me any way that I can help Jose stay here in      San Francisco as a part of the Palio d'Asti family.     Daniel H. Scherotter,       Chef, Owner, Palio d'Asti and Palio Paninoteca,       Vice President, Golden Gate Restaurant Association.                                  ____                                                     San Francisco                                      Unified School District,                                San Francisco, CA, April 19, 2007.       Senator Diane Feinstein: I am writing this letter in      support of the family of Micaela and Jose Alberto Martinez      and their three daughters, Adelina, Jasmine and Karla      Martinez.       I've known Micaela and Jose Alberto Martinez and their      three sweet and well mannered daughters Ade1ina, Jasmine and      Karla Martinez who have been at different times in our child      development program for the past sixteen years. Each daughter      has been enrolled in my class. During this time, Micaela and      Jose Alberto have aided our program by volunteering in many      ways       They have translated for our Spanish speaking parents      during our Center parent meetings. Mr. and Mrs. Martinez have      donated gifts toward our center program fundraisers which      have helped to make them a great success, raising funds to      support class field trips around the Bay area and to purchase      additional materials and supplies for the classroom. They      have also helped to chaperone these field trips.       Micaela and Jose Alberto Martinez are outstanding parents      who are supportive to their family, their community and to      our educational system.       Please give all positive consideration to this deserving      family.

Re Jose Alberto Martinez Moreno.       Dear Senator Feinstein: As Director of the Irish      Immigration Pastoral Center in San Francisco, I am writing in      support of Jose and Micaela Martinez who reside in the Bay      Area. Jose and Micaela are both citizens of Mexico and have      made every attempt to regularize their status during their      time in the United States. He and his wife have made a life      for themselves here in the Bay Area and indeed, have given      birth to two of their children here.       Jose and Micaela have been part of the Irish community for      over ten years and are well known and respected within our      community. They are known as decent, hard working, dedicated      people--both to their employers and to their family. They      have given their three children every opportunity that they      themselves did not have. Both he and his wife are assets to      our community.       Mr. Martinez has indeed realized his own part of the      American Dream, working his way from dishwasher to Sous Chef      at the renowned Palio d'Asti restaurant in San Francisco.      Commitment, dedication and sheer hard work have enabled them      to buy their own home in San Francisco, a feat by anyone's      standards. They are the epitome of what it means to be      American.       If Jose and Micaela are forced to leave the United States,      yet another family will be torn apart. Their three children,      aged 10, 14 and 17, will remain in San Francisco as there is      nothing for them in Mexico--they have never even been to      Mexico. They will grow up without the love, guidance and      nurture of their parents--a dire loss to any young persons      life.       The Irish Immigration Pastoral Center, which provides      assistance to Irish immigrants in the Bay Area, would be      greatfull if You could look favorably on Mr. and Mrs.      Martinez in their request to remain in the United States.           Yours sincerely,                                                  Celine Kennelly,     Executive Director.                                  ____                                                   April 18, 2007.       To Whom It May Concern: I have known Jose Alberto Martinez      and his wife Micaela since 1991 when Jose and his brother      Maricio worked as cooks under my supervision at Palio d'Asti      Resturant in San Francisco, We worked together for      approximately three years.       Jose proved himself to be an extremely talented and      responsible cook, anchoring the kitchen with little or no      supervision. While working for us at Palio, he also held down      part time jobs at some of the Bay Area's other top      restaurants in order to learn more and move ahead. And      although we didn't interact socially, I know he was an active      leader active in his church and prioritized time with his      family.       Jose's hard work and commitment to his family, his      community and his job make him ideal candidate for U.S.      citizenship. Whether as an immigrant or a citizen, Jose      Martinez is an upstanding member of our community,       If you have any question regarding Jose Martinez, please      call me.           Sincerely,                                                      Craig Stall,      Proprietor, Delfina Restuarant.                                  ____                                       Kelly's Family Daycare,                                San Francisco, CA, April 18, 2007.     Re Michela and Jose Alberto Martinez.       Dear Sir/Madam: Michela Martinez has worked for my family      for many years as our housekeeper. I have come to know      Michela very well over the course of this time.       She is a very hardworking, diligent and considerate woman      who has a wonderful nature and fantastic work ethic. She has      always had a key to our home and we trust her with our      property and our children as well.       Jose Martinez has worked for my husband as a painting      subcontractor and is held in high esteem as well.       I have no reservations about giving this couple a reference      and wish them the best wishes and speedy resolution of their      immigration issues. Do not hesitate to contact me if you      require further assistance.           Yours Faithfully,     Kelly Forde.                                  ____                                          St. Philip's Church,                                San Francisco, CA, April 18, 2007.     Senator Diane Feinstein,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.     Re Micaela & Jose Martinez.       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am writing on behalf of Jose      Alberton Martinez Moreno and his wife, Micaela, in support of      their voluntary departure and impending order of deportation.      Jose and Micaela are members of St. Peter's parish and their      kindness to the less fortunate is well known in the Irish      community.       It was with great dismay that I heard of Jose and Micaela's      uncertain future in America. Jose and Micaela have lived in      San Francisco for almost twenty years and have raised their      three children here, two of whom are U.S. born. They are a      dedicated and loving couple and deserve the opportunity to      continue to give to the community that has welcomed them so      warmly. I know Micaela personally and I know that it would be      a very great and excessive burden for her to leave her young      family behind in California--there is nothing for them in      Mexico. As a priest, I see far too much hurt, when parents      are separated from their children.       My thoughts and prayers are with Jose and Micaela and their      family during this difficult time of uncertainty. I would ask      that you look favorably on their situation and be      compassionate to a family that wants to make America its      home.       Please do not force them to separate and cause the      destruction of this family.       With every best wish and kind regard, I remain.           Yours in Christ.
