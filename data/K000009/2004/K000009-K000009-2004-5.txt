Speaker, shortly our country will experience an extraordinarily important Presidential election, and this evening I wish to discuss another important Presidential election that is occurring very far from the United States this year as well. That is in the nation of Ukraine, one of the nations that was spun out of the collapse of the Soviet Union. And make note of the very close presidential race ongoing in that country which is struggling its way forward.  Recently in USA Today, there was a story that one of the leading candidates, Viktor Yushchenko, became ill and on September 6 was hospitalized in Austria. And the doctors there, a panel of nearly a dozen doctors, determined indeed that he had been poisoned.  Prosecutors in Ukraine said in a statement they were investigating charges of attempted murder. Attempted murder of a presidential candidate in a nation whose independence is only a little over 10 years old.  In an address to deputies in the parliament in that country this week, candidate Viktor Yushchenko appeared haggard, his face was red and swollen; it was partially paralyzed with one of his eyes constantly tearing up. And I wish to read this evening some of what he told his fellow deputies in that parliament in a emotional speech.  He said to take a good look at him to make sure that the same thing did not happen to any of them, because the problem he was bearing was not one of cuisine, not a problem of food, as some had tried to portray his plight. And he advised his colleagues, Do not be so quick to judge. I would like to ask every one of the 450 parliament members in the chamber, have you ever seen me drunk over the past 10 to 20 years? Raise your hands if you have. And no one did.  And then he pointed at all of the government-controlled media, Inter, UT1, and One Plus One, and asked them, Have you ever in your life seen me not in control of myself? Because there had been references on that television, government controlled, that his illness was caused by food poisoning or perhaps alcohol. But he said, What happened to me was not a problem of cuisine or a problem of diet, but rather as soon as you fall out of favor with the authorities of Ukraine and as soon as you start posing a tiny threat, and indeed he is tied in the polls with the current president of that country, they will throw you away like a piece of paper.  He said, Friends, we are talking about the Ukrainian political kitchen where assassinations are ordered. Remember, he said, former National Bank chairman Vadym Petrovych Hetman walking around alive in this chamber in 1998. Who killed him? President Kuchma said it was a question of honor for him, that the prosecutor-general will give an answer and tell us who the killer is. Time has passed, and there is no answer.  In 1991 right-wing leader and presidential candidate Vyacheslav Chornovil was in that chamber alive. We pretend we do not know who killed him with a Kamaz lorry. But in 2000 as well, campaigning journalist Heorhiy Gongadze was sitting in the balcony, as our press sits here in this Congress, writing political reports. Well, who cut his head off? We do not seem to know, Viktor Yushchenko said.  Although one prosecutor said once that the killer has already been found and that his surname begins with the letter K, but he was not brave enough to give us a few more letters.  Two and a half years ago, opposition parliamentarian Oleh Oleksenko was sitting in the chamber. Who poisoned him? Four weeks ago Alik Aslanov was sitting among us in that chamber. But with his last borrowed seven and a half hryvnyas, the last loan in his life, he bought a liter of petrol and burned himself. Who killed him? The alcoholic head of the district administration who represents the United Democrat Party or the arrogant head of the collective farm? Who killed him?  Do not ask who is next. Every one of us will be next. And if you ask how this fate spared me, I will say, wrong dose, wrong time and my angels awake. That is what helped me return back to the living.  Let us draw a couple of lessons here. Lesson number one, I would really like us to receive an answer. Who did it and who is the killer? But you know very well who the killer is. The government is the killer. And never will this prosecutor-general give an answer to who killed Gongadze, who killed Hetman, and who tried to kill many others.  Let us draw a political lesson and appeal to you, my dear people's deputies. Show a little heroism today for Ukraine's sake and you will see Ukraine democratic and its people free and prosperous. Do not forget this lesson or this lesson will get you.  These very compelling words are placed here, the citadel of freedom, by Viktor Yushchenko, presidential candidate in Ukraine, who is fighting, not just for his life but for the future of freedom in his nation.  The article referred to is as follows:                    [From USA Today, Sept. 22, 2004]                Ukraine Candidate Poisoning Investigated       Kiev, Ukraine.--Ukrainian prosecutors opened a criminal      investigation into the alleged poisoning of a leading      candidate in a crucial presidential election scheduled for      next month, officials said.       The candidate, Viktor Yushchenko, became sick more than two      weeks ago, and his campaign charged that he was poisoned by      political opponents. The allegations have roiled the already      heated race to replace outgoing President Leonid Kuchma.       Yushchenko, a leading opposition figure who is running      neck-in-neck with the ruling party's candidate, became ill      Sept. 6 and was hospitalized in Austria. After he was      discharged Saturday, doctors in Vienna said it was possible      he had been poisoned but they could not confirm it.       Prosecutors said in a statement that they were      investigating charges of ``attempted murder of a statesman or      a public figure.'' They offered few details and did not      indicate if authorities had substantiated the poisoning      charges or identified suspects.       Prosecutor General Henadiy Vasiliev later told reporters      ``not to make hasty conclusions'' and to wait for the results      of the examination. He said authorities hadn't ruled out      anything in their investigation and that his office had      contacted Austrian authorities.       Ukrainian lawmakers voted overwhelmingly Tuesday to set up      a commission to investigate the incident.       Neither outgoing Kuchma nor Viktor Yanukovych, Yuchchenko's      main opponent and Kuchma's hand-picked choice in the Oct. 31      presidential race, have commented publicly on the      allegations.       However, a number of Kuchma's allies have charged that      Yushchenko had merely eaten bad sushi.       In his address to deputies on Tuesday, Yushchenko accused      Kuchma's administration of ``being capable of brewing      political assassinations.'' He appeared haggard, with his      face red, swollen, partially paralyzed and with one eye      constantly tearing up.       Voters in this ex-Soviet republic of 48 million have become      increasingly disenchanted with Kuchma's decade in power. His      administration had been marred by a series of scandals,      rampant corruption and dozens of suspicious deaths of      political opponents and opposition journalists.       Meanwhile, Ukrainian Defense Minister Yevhen Marchuk      stepped down Wednesday, citing in part the June explosion at      a major ordnance depot that rained rockets, shells and      shrapnel over a wide area, the Interfax news agency reported.       Speaking on condition of anonymity, a spokesman for the      Defense Ministry confirmed Marchuk ``has asked the President      to be relieved from duties,'' but he gave no other details.       Marchuk's resignation came after he had defended himself in      parliament against allegations he illegally provided soldiers      and helicopters to help fight fires in Turkey.       Marchuk's resignation was seen as another sign of upheaval      in the government ahead of the Oct. 31 vote.                                  ____       [From the Ukrainian Radio First Programme, Sept. 21, 2004]          Viktor Yushchenko Says the Government Is the Killer       Kiev.--Ukrainian opposition leader and presidential race      favourite Viktor Yushchenko has lashed out at the      authorities, accusing them of trying to poison him. In an      emotional speech delivered in parliament after two weeks of      treatment abroad, Yushchenko said he barely survived and      compared his alleged poisoning to the killings of several      Ukrainian politicians and journalists in recent years.       He said President Kuchma's order to investigate the      poisoning was disingenuous, and hinted that the president      himself could have been behind the murder of opposition      journalist Heorhiy Gongadze. He brushed aside suggestions      that his illness was caused by ordinary food poisoning and      urged fellow MPs to stand up to the government so as not to      become next in the list of public figures who have died a      suspicious death.       The following is the text of Yushchenko's speech broadcast      live by Ukrainian radio on 21 September; subheadings inserted      editorially.       Mr. speaker, fellow people's deputies! I am happy to be in      this chamber today. I won't take much time, but let me make      some statements that concern each and every one of you. For      the past two weeks, a number of Ukrainian politicians and      journalists have been debating about what one should eat, or      drink, in order to live in this country and not die.       Because my dignity is concerned in a number of cases, and      my morality--I am part of this story--I ask you for a few      minutes of your attention. It may not be entirely appropriate      to say some of these things, because I will be speaking about      myself, but I will say those things to establish the facts.                           NOT FOOD POISONING       Look at my face. Note my articulation. [Yushchenko appeared      to speak with some difficulty. Part of his face was swollen      and immobile during his recent public appearances.] This is      one hundredth of the problems that I've had. Take a good      look, to make sure that the same thing doesn't happen to you.      Because this is not the problem of cuisine, not a problem of      food, as some try to portray it.       Don't be quick to judge! I would like to ask every one of      the 450 parliament members in this chamber. Have you ever      seen me drunk over the past 10-20 years? Raise your hands if      you have!       I am asking to the journalists of Inter [privately owned      pro-government TV channel] and the so-called national channel      UT1. And One Plus One [another privately owned pro-government      TV channel]. And to other channels. Have you ever in your      life seen me not in control of myself? If there were such      cases, show them on television today. But there weren't.      [Apparently referring to recent reports on the three TV      channels speculating that Yushchenko's illness could have      been caused by food or alcohol poisoning.]       And that is why, I would like to say to everyone: I am no      gourmet! I don't fancy eastern cuisine or western cuisine. I      eat the same borsch, potatoes and pork fat as all of you, the      47 million people of Ukraine! And what happened to me was not      a problem of cuisine or a problem of diet!                     SAME FATE IN STORE FOR OTHERS       It's a pity that Oleksandr Oleksandrovych [Moroz] is not in      this chamber. I would like to say to him, Oleksandr      Oleksandrovych, you can eat port fat and potatoes all you      want. But mark my word: as soon as you become a real opponent      of this regime, and I stress, a real one, as soon as you      stop dancing to Medvedchuk's fiddle [applause], potato      diet will not save you! Calm down! It pains me to say      this. [Referring to Moroz's reported statement that      Yushchenko would have been fine had he stuck to simple      food.] [Shouts of ``Shame!'' in the chamber]       Friends! I'd like to continue. Esteemed [pro-presidential      coalition coordinator] Stepan Bohdanovych Havrysh, you are      going through a rough political patch. Because something you      have given up your reputation for is falling apart, the so-     called pro-presidential majority is falling apart.       I would like to say that as soon as you fall out of favour      with the authorities, as soon as you start posing a tiny      threat, they will throw you away like a piece of paper. And      your fish diet won't save you!       I would like to tell the guys in the presidential      administration, who advise that one should drink 100 grams of      vodka after every piece of pork fat. Guys, it doesn't matter      that you are in that camp. Such are the principles and      morality of that camp that they can discard you just like      they have discarded [former economics minister and deputy      chief of presidential administration Valeriy] Khoroshkovskyy,      [President Kuchma's once-close ally Oleksandr] Volkov and      dozens of others. And 100 grams with every piece of pork fat      won't help.                             attacks kuchma       Friends, this is not a problem of cuisine as such. We are      talking about Ukrainian political kitchen, where      assassinations are ordered! This is what we are talking      about. Remember [former National Bank chairman] Vadym      Petrovych Hetman walking around alive in this chamber in      1998. Who killed him? President Kuchma said it was a question      of honour for him, that the prosecutor-general will give an      answer and tell us who the killer is. Time has passed, but      there is no answer.       In 1999 [right-wing leader and presidential candidate]      Vyacheslav Chornovil was here alive. We pretend we don't know      who killed him with a Kamaz lorry. In 2000 [campaigning      journalist] Heorhiy Gongadze was sitting on the balcony over      there and writing political reports. Who cut his head off?      Well we don't seem to know, although one prosecutor said once      that the killer has already been found, and that his surname      begins with the letter K. He wasn't brave enough to give us a      few more letters.       Two and a half years ago [opposition MP] Oleh Oleksenko was      sitting in this chamber. Who poisoned him? Four weeks ago      Alik Aslanov was still among us. But with his last borrowed      seven and a half hryvnyas, the last loan in his life, he      bought a litre of petrol and burned himself. Who killed him?      The alcoholic head of the district administration, who      represents the United Social Democratic Party? Or the      arrogant head of the collective farm? Who killed him?                      ``government is the killer''       Don't ask who is next. Every one of us will be the next.      And if you ask how this fate spared me, I'll say: wrong dose,      wrong time and my angels awake. That is what helped me return      back to the living!       Let us draw a couple of lessons here. Lesson number one. I      would really like us to receive an answer, who did it and who      is the killer. But you know very well who the killer is. The      government is the killer! And never will this prosecutor-     general give an answer to who killed Gongadze, who killed      Hetman, who tried to kill many others.       So I was very surprised that President Kuchma ordered to      launch a criminal investigation of my poisoning. I don't      believe this order! I don't believe this prosecutor-general!      Why, Mr. Kuchma, are you asking the question if you have no      intention of answering it?       Let us draw a political lessons from here. The lesson is      that Leonid Makarovych Kravchuk suggests that someone should      kneel before the Ukrainian people. [Kravchuk said dozens of      MPs who quit the pro-government coalition earlier this month      should kneel before the people of Ukraine.] So who should      kneel, Mr. Kravchuk? And for how long should they stand on      their knees, so that every one of the 47 million forgave      them?       But I have another proposal. An appeal to you, my dear      people's deputies! Show a little heroism today for Ukraine's      sake, and you will see Ukraine democratic, with its people      free and prosperous! Don't forget this lesson or this lesson      will get you. [Applause in the chamber]                          ____________________
