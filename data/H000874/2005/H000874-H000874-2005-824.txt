Speaker, I want to thank the Chairman (Mr. Hyde) and the Ranking Member (Mr. Lantos) for bringing this important legislation to the Floor today.  As the former Chairman and Ranking Democrat on the Helsinki Commission, I was honored to advocate for the basic human rights of dissidents in the former Soviet Union, including in Ukraine, and know well their commitment to freedom and democracy.  And today, as this legislation recognizes, the people of Ukraine have achieved their long sought goal and under the leadership of their new President, Viktor Yushchenko, and today are moving forward with a spirit of optimism and hope.  Over the last several months, the people of Ukraine have weathered nothing short of political crisis.
