Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce the Community Solvency Act of 1995. This bill represents the final product of a year's worth of negotiation and compromise between county and local governments, the waste industry, and the financial community. This legislation, which passed the House in the final hours of the 103d Congress enables communities in financial trouble to continue to treat and dispose of municipal solid waste in an efficient and cost effective manner, while, at the same time, protecting public health and safety and high environmental standards.  While the House was able to take decisive action passing this exact text last year, Senate action was unfortunately obstructed. For this reason, we now revisit this issue and must move swiftly on this bill beginning today.  As my colleagues will recall, local governing bodies nationwide suffered a tremendous blow last May when the Supreme Court ruled in C&A Carbone v Town of Clarkstown, New York that waste flow control authority violates the dormant commerce clause of the Constitution. As Justice Sandra Day O'Connor reminded us in her concurring opinion, Congress has implied that States and localities have this authority, but has never said so explicity.  Communities nationwide have accumulated an outstanding debt of more than $10 billion assuming their ability to use flow control authority, only to have the Court take it away with the Carbone decision. But technologically advanced facilities require more money than many communities can afford. To meet their waste management responsibilities while protecting the environment and public health and safety, communities have turned to bond financing.  These communities have accepted the responsibility of constructing, maintaining, and often operating transfer stations, landfills, waste-to-energy facilities, composting stations, and other solid waste treatment sites. In many cases, these communities have even designed integrated solid waste management plans to meet the full solid waste needs of their residents. We should not punish them for their initiative.  Furthermore, this $10 billion in debt jeopardizes far more than the communities' ability to meet solid waste management responsibilities. In fact, it jeopardizes many of their overall community bond ratings. At least two prominent credit rating agencies--Moody's Investors Service and Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Co.--have already begun the combined reassessment of more than 100 communities' credit standings as a direct result of the Court's decision. Duff & Phelps announced that, ``In its review of this issue, Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Co. found that Congress' inability to take action is triggering greater uncertainty in the solid waste sector and, in the long run, may weaken credit quality of solid waste facilities.''  The debate continues, but the stakes are even higher now. The ultimate consequences of our inability to act decisively will be Orange County-like bankruptcies, higher municipal taxes, and outraged constituents nationwide. It is clearly up to Congress to address and remedy this situation. The Community Solvency Act is precisely the flow control language which the House passed on October 7, 1994. This language was supported by a wide coalition including private sector waste management companies; local government organizations, such as the National Association of Counties, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, and the League of Cities; recycling interests; and Wall Street representatives.  Congress must move a legislative remedy to Carbone swiftly through the committee structure and the floor schedule to ensure financial security to struggling communities in each of our States. I urge my colleagues to take an [[Page E32]] active interest in this important issue by cosponsoring this common sense measure--the Community Solvency Act of 1995.                          ____________________
