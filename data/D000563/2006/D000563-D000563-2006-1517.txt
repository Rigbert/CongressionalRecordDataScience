Can we go to a wildlife refuge in Alaska? The honest answer is, all the oil in that wildlife refuge would not provide the energy this country needs for more than 6 months over a 20-year period. It is not an answer. It is not a solution. We control less than 3 percent of the oil reserves in this world. Yet we consume 25 percent of the oil resources. There is no way we can drill ourselves to a point of self-sufficiency.  We need leadership. We need innovative, sustainable, renewable sources of energy. We need better fuel-economy in our cars and trucks. America should be moving forward as some other countries are with a new vision on energy. Instead, we are faced with these crippling bills to heat our homes, and at the gas station to fuel our vehicles.  Today, we need to vote to support the motion for cloture, bring the LIHEAP bill up, provide a helping hand to the most vulnerable Americans, and then sit down and get down to business about an energy policy that really works for our future.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
