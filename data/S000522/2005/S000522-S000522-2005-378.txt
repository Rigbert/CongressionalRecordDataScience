Mr. Chairman, for the last two decades, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), has shockingly defended the coercive Chinese population control program. By refusing to give American tax dollars to the UNFPA, the United States stands solidly with the victims and against the oppressors. We must continue to do so as long as UNFPA insists on supporting the Chinese program.  Today, Representative Maloney offered an amendment to H.R. 1268, the ``Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense, the Global War on Terror, and Tsunami Relief'', and she described the amendment as something that would give $3 million to UNFPA. Even though she explained it as a UNFPA Amendment, I want to clarify that the language of the amendment could in no way be construed to support or give funding to UNFPA. In fact, the amendment does not even mention UNFPA.
