  Mr. DeFAZIO. Henry ``Hank'' Paulson, former CEO of Goldman Sachs, has a plan: Borrow $700 billion in the name of the American taxpayers, shovel it into the vaults at Goldman Sachs and other investment banks and places on Wall Street, and hopefully it will trickle down and somehow solve the underlying housing problem.  We spent all week trying to figure out a way to protect the American taxpayers with his faulty plan. There really is no way to do that, except for one: Make Wall Street pay to bail out itself.  From 1914 until 1966, there was a tiny fee assessed on every transaction on Wall Street. In fact, the Congress, over the objections of Wall Street, doubled it in 1935 at the height of the Great Depression. It had no impact on Wall Street. It could raise the money Wall Street needs to heal itself.  Let's remember all that rhetoric about bootstraps and all that. Let Wall Street pull itself up by its own bootstraps, and assess a minuscule fee on every stock transaction. It is done in London; it can be done in the U.S. Wall Street can pay for its own bailout. Call now.                          ____________________
