Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Lobiondo amendment.  The Coast Guard's Deepwater Program will result in a nearly complete recapitalization of the Coast Guard's fleet of vessels, aircraft, and supporting systems.  The Coast Guard's legacy assets are failing at an alarming rate, jeopardizing the success of Coast Guard missions and the lives of Coast Guardsmen.  We must bring the new assets that will be procured through the Deepwater Program online as quickly as possible.  The current bill will not only fail to accelerate the rate at which these assets become available, but it dramatically slows down the delivery of these critical assets.  Following the events of 9/11, the Coast Guard has taken on significant responsibilities to protect maritime homeland security in addition to carrying out its important traditional missions of search and rescue, illegal drug and migrant interdiction, oil spill response and prevention, and fisheries law enforcement.  We must provide the resources necessary to allow the men and women of the Coast Guard to successfully carry out these missions.  The Deepwater Program will provide these assets and I applaud the chairman of the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation for his amendment to provide funding to procure the assets needed by the Coast Guard.  I thank the chairman.
