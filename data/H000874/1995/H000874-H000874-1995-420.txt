I appreciate him allowing me to intervene at this time.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in very strong support of the gentleman's amendment. I have been to Kosova and Pristina, the capital. I have talked to the Serbian leadership in Kosova. They have no appreciation for human rights and no appreciation of the individuals there who have a right to practice their own religion, pursue their own culture, use their language of choice, and to enjoy the human rights which are guaranteed by the Helsinki final act.  I congratulate the gentleman from New York for this amendment, which is critical. Frankly, the Milosevic regime is a regime which has been assessed to be a criminal regime by our former Deputy Secretary of State, Larry Eagleburger. I think he was correct.  Kosova is a specific example of where the Milosevic government in Belgrade tramples upon the rights that they are pledged to protect under the Helsinki final act. We ought not to consider lifting sanctions. We ought not to consider making the Milosevic regime's life one whit better without the human rights situation in Kosova very, very substantially improving.
