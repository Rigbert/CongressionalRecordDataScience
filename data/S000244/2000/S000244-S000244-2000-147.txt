Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a faithful and dedicated public servant, the distinguished senior Senator from New York, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. Senator Moynihan has served the people of New York in the United States Senate for nearly a quarter century. However, his long list of achievements in public service began over 50 years ago.  In those 50 plus years, Senator Moynihan has been both soldier and ambassador, author and teacher, and legislator and diplomat. Very few Americans serve their country and their fellow citizens with the range of knowledge and experience Senator Moynihan has demonstrated. We in Congress are privileged to call him our colleague.  Among Senator Moynihan's most important roles has been that of advocate for peace in Northern Ireland. Drawing on his extensive foreign policy experience as both ambassador to India and United States Representative to the United Nations, Senator Moynihan called for a peaceful resolution of tensions in Northern Ireland and helped guide the negotiations that have today resulted in decreased bloodshed, decreased violence, and greater understanding there.  Senator Moynihan has also earned the distinction of being the only American in history to serve in the Executive Branch in four successive administrations, both Republican and Democrat. He has dedicated his service not to partisanship, but to people; not to party, but to peace. The people of New York recognize him for fighting tirelessly for their rights, including better education and better healthcare. His colleagues recognize him for fighting for his principles.  I join my colleagues in thanking Senator Moynihan for his valuable service. We will not soon forget the example he set.                          ____________________
