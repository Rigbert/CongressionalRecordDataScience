Kennedy] for joining us with a very forceful and articulate statement on this issue, particularly as it relates to construction workers. We will continue this debate, not only on the floor, but also in the committees and subcommittees. I thank you for joining in this special order.  The last speaker joining us this evening comes from the State of Minnesota. Congressman Jim Oberstar is one of the most articulate spokesmen on behalf of working men and women. The time I have served in Congress, he has risen many times to their defense and is recognized as somebody in this body who has a very intimate and personal knowledge of not only the men and women he represents who work for a living, but those across the country.  I yield to my colleague from Minnesota [Mr. Oberstar].
