Res. 402       Whereas Representative Henry John Hyde of Illinois was born      in Chicago, Cook County, Illinois, on April 18, 1924;       Whereas Henry Hyde excelled as a student both at Georgetown      University, at which he helped take the Hoyas basketball team      to the National Collegiate Athletic Association semifinals in      1943 and from which he graduated with a bachelor of science      degree in 1947, and at Loyola University Chicago School of      Law, from which he graduated in 1949;       Whereas Henry Hyde served his country for his entire adult      life, as an officer of the United States Navy from 1944 to      1946, where he served in combat in the Philippines during      World War II, in the United States Navy Reserve from 1946 to      1968, from which he retired at the rank of Commander, as a      member of the Illinois House of Representatives from 1967 to      1974 and Majority Leader of that body from 1971 to 1972, as a      delegate to the Illinois Republican State Conventions from      1958 to 1974, and as a Republican Member of the United States      House of Representatives for 16 Congresses, over 3 decades      from January 3, 1975, to January 3, 2007;       Whereas Henry Hyde served as the Ranking Member on the      Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of      Representatives from 1985 to 1991, in the 99th through 101st      Congresses, and as chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary      of the House of Representatives from the 104th through 106th      Congresses and the Committee on International Relations from      the 107th through 109th Congresses;       Whereas, in his capacity as a United States Representative,      Henry Hyde tirelessly served as a champion for children, both      born and unborn, and relentlessly defended the rule of law;       Whereas Henry Hyde demonstrated his commitment to the rule      of law during his tenure in the House of Representatives,      once stating, ``The rule of law is no pious aspiration from a      civics textbook. The rule of law is what stands between us      and the arbitrary exercise of power by the state. The rule of      law is the safeguard of our liberties. The rule of law is      what allows us to live our freedom in ways that honor the      freedom of others while strengthening the common good. . . If      across the river in Arlington Cemetery there are American      heroes who died in defense of the rule of law, can we give      less than the full measure of our devotion to that great      cause?'';       Whereas Henry Hyde was a key player in some of the highest      level debates concerning the response to the terrorist      attacks on our Nation on September 11, 2001;       Whereas Henry Hyde received the Presidential Medal of      Freedom, the Nation's highest civilian honor, on November 5,      2007, at a ceremony at which President George W. Bush      explained about Representative Hyde, ``He used his persuasive      powers for noble causes. He stood for a strong and purposeful      America--confident in freedom's advance, and firm in      freedom's defense. He stood for limited, accountable      government, and the equality of every person before the law.      He was a gallant champion of the weak and forgotten, and a      fearless defender of life in all its seasons.'';       Whereas Henry Hyde's greatest legacy is as the author,      during his freshman term in the House of Representatives, of      an amendment to the 1976 Departments of Labor and Health,      Education, and Welfare Appropriations Act--commonly referred      to as the Hyde Amendment--that prohibits Federal dollars from      being used to pay for the abortion of unborn babies, which      conservative figures estimate has saved at least 1,000,000      lives;       Whereas Henry Hyde lived by the belief that we will all be      judged by our Creator in the end for our actions here on      Earth, which he once explained on the floor of the House of      Representatives by saying, ``Our moment in history is marked      by a mortal conflict between a culture of life and a culture      of death. God put us in the world to do noble things, to love      and to cherish our fellow human beings, not to destroy them.      Today we must choose sides.'';       Whereas Henry Hyde selflessly battled for the causes that      formed the core of his beliefs until the end of his life, and      was greatly respected by his friends and adversaries alike      for his dedication and will remain a role model for advocates      of those causes by virtue of his conviction, passion, wisdom,      and character; and       Whereas Henry Hyde was preceded in death by his first wife,      Jeanne, and his son Hank, and is survived by his second wife,      Judy, his sons Robert and Anthony and daughter Laura, 3      stepchildren, Susan, Mitch, and Stephen, 7 grandchildren, and      7 step-grandchildren: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That the Senate--       (1) notes with deep sorrow the death of Henry John Hyde on      November 29, 2007, in Chicago;       (2) extends its heartfelt sympathy to the family of Henry      Hyde;       (3) recognizes the life of service and the outstanding      contributions of Henry Hyde; and       (4) directs the Secretary of the Senate to transmit a copy      of this resolution to the family of Henry Hyde.
