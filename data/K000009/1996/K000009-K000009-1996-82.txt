Speaker, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, which today is one of the largest nonprofit health agencies in the United States, originated 50 years ago with an idea and a small three-line classified advertisement that appeared in the May 1, 1945 edition of the New York Times. The printed appeal for help was placed by Sylvia Lawry, the founder, whose late brother suffered from MS. In her ad, Miss Lawry asked that anyone who might know of a cure for MS contact her.  Thus was born the organization which today serves a membership of 430,000 through 140 chapters and branches. It is the only organization supporting both national and international research into the cause and cure of multiple sclerosis and a full range of services in areas of health, knowledge, and independence.  In my district, 2,200 people with MS are served by the Northwest Ohio Chapter alone. The chapter is able to raise funds that directly benefit local programs and allows for educational workshops, equipment loan services, aquatics programs, and so much more!  The Nation is very proud of the work of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society and the contributions it has made to biomedical research. Since its founding, the society has invested more than $175 million in scientific grants.  As a result, we are much closer today then ever before to understanding what causes multiple sclerosis and how to treat it. Someday soon we may possibly learn to prevent and cure it. Enormous strides have been taking place in the neurosciences recently, giving rise to a real hope that this may happen soon.  Sylvia Lawry continues to be active in the affairs of both the national and international MS societies. Her dedication, and the work of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society are an inspiration for all.                          ____________________
