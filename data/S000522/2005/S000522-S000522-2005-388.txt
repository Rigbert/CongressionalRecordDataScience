Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.  We have no further requests for time, and I just want to conclude and again say to my friends on the other side of the aisle, to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Delahunt), the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos), as well as to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hyde), the chairman of our distinguished Committee on International Relations, to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Shays) and, of course, to our majority leader for his leadership on this in ensuring that this very important piece of legislation not only gets expedited treatment but will be passed early and closed enough to the tsunami in order to address some of the problems that were exposed as a result of it.  Children need protection. Women need protection. This bill advances that ball. It is an important and very noble task, and I am glad we have bipartisan consensus on this kind of humanitarian and human rights legislation.
