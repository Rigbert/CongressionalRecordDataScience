Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Unfortunately, today I rise in opposition to S. 612. At one point, I wholeheartedly supported this bill.  There should be nothing partisan about infrastructure. Building and rebuilding infrastructure for transportation of goods and people, for shipping, for rail, for other aspects, and clean water--all that should be nonpartisan. It is in the best interests of the United States of America to make us more competitive and more efficient. This bill reflected the best of that tradition when it came out of the committee.  Unfortunately, a number of things have happened since. First, when we came to the floor, the leadership stripped out a provision which was adopted unanimously in committee to make the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund into a trust fund--spending the tax that is collected for harbor maintenance on--shocking in Washington, D.C.--harbor maintenance.  Right now, the Budget Committee diverts that money every year somewhere else--imaginary deficit reduction or some other program--and we underspend, through the appropriations process, that money. So the Americans are paying a tax. Every good you buy that is imported you pay a little bit more for it. You are paying that tax, and Congress is diverting the money while our harbors shoal in and our jetties crumble, and we can't compete in the world market.  The committee had adopted a provision to turn that into a real trust fund and spend the money on harbor maintenance. That was stripped out because of objections by the Budget Committee that wants to divert the money and the Appropriations Committee that wants to divert the money. That just shouldn't be.  I want to thank the chairman for promising to continue to work on that issue, which came out of committee, when we do the Water Resources Development bill again next year. Hopefully, the Trump administration will take a different position on this. There is $9 billion sitting there waiting to be spent tomorrow of taxes that have already been collected to maintain our harbors that Congress doesn't want to spend, despite the shoaling in and the jetties' deteriorating conditions. So, hopefully, the new administration will take a different position in the budget on that.  Secondly, just this week, a 100-page provision which did not come from our committee, which relates to a hugely controversial water diversion and settlement of disputes in California pitting members of the California delegation on both sides of the aisle against one another, doesn't only just affect California, because Sacramento salmon swim north, and the last time we had a bad drought they shut down all the fishing on the southern Oregon coast because of endangered Sacramento salmon. Our salmon were doing fine. So if they start diverting more water from the delta, from the Sacramento, it is likely that our fisheries will be shut down in Oregon because of this misplaced provision which has not had any congressional review of any sort in any committee in this House.                              {time}  1100  Finally, gratuitously, as part of that gigantic project in California, they are undermining Buy America and Davis-Bacon provisions. I hope this isn't a harbinger of things to come, that despite the President who wants a stronger Buy America, that the Republican House is going to want to undermine Buy America and start buying Chinese and Russian steel for our projects and doing away with prevailing wages paying a good living wage to people who work in construction jobs. It is very unfortunate that was inserted in this bill.  But there are many meritorious provisions in the bill set aside for dredging of small harbors and many, many individual projects and authorizations in the bill. Had these other three things not happened, I would have enthusiastically supported it, but, unfortunately, I will have to oppose the bill.  I reserve the balance of my time.  I rise in reluctant opposition to S. 612.  Mr. Speaker, at one time, this bill had great promise. At one time, this bill represented the bipartisan traditions of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. When the Committee unanimously reported this bill to the House, I was proud to support the Water Resources Development Act of 2016.  However, since that time, the House Republican Leadership has unilaterally stripped key Democratic priorities and air-dropped-in controversial Republican provisions making it impossible for me to support the bill today. At every step of the legislative process, House Republican Leaders have morphed what was once the product of months of hard work by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure into something that I, as the Ranking Democrat on the Committee, can no longer support--despite the fact that some good policy provisions remain in this bill.  That being said, I thank the Chairman of the Committee, Mr. Shuster, for following through on his promise to pass a Water Resources Development Act this Congress.  In May, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure unanimously approved WRDA. That bipartisan bill took a bold step to ensure that Congress would begin to draw down the enormous surplus in the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF). This position, one that the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure has fought for, on a bipartisan basis, for decades, would have made the $9 billion surplus of the HMTF immediately available to the Secretary of the Army to dredge our Nation's harbors.  Unfortunately, this provision was stripped from the bill by the House Republican Leadership before Floor consideration, and was not included in the House-passed WRDA. This important provision would have unlocked the HMTF to ensure that revenues collected from shippers are used to dredge our Nation's harbors, and are not diverted to cover other debts of the U.S. Treasury.  Despite this, I want to thank Chairman Shuster for his commitment to work with me in the next Congress to unlock the HMTF once and for all. Without this provision, the balance in the Trust Fund will double in the next decade to more than $17 billion and continue to grow year after year, despite the tremendous needs of our Nation's ports and harbors. I am confident that, in the 115th Congress, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure can achieve full use of the HMTF, and strengthen and maintain our ports, harbors and waterways, and our Nation's economic competitiveness. I thank Chairman Shuster for his promise to work with me to achieve full use of the HMTF in the next Congress.  Again, while I will oppose final passage of this bill, I do want to highlight several promising provisions in the bill. Emblematic of prior water resources legislation, S. 612 authorizes all pending Corps of Engineers' project authorizations--valued at more than $10 billion. It also authorizes 32 new feasibility studies and additional project modifications to existing Corps' projects--the first such provisions enacted since 2007.  The bill also includes several provisions to improve the overall efficiency and transparency of the Corps in carrying out its construction and regulatory missions while preserving existing Federal environmental protections.  For example, S. 612 includes a provision that requires the Corps to coordinate the regulatory review of project modifications (so-called section 408 reviews) with the expectation that these coordinated reviews will help expedite the decision-making process.  S. 612 also directs the Secretary to expeditiously complete a report to Congress on any materials, articles, or supplies manufactured outside the United States that are currently used in Corps projects. This report will be critical to increased oversight by this Committee of the use of foreign-manufactured goods in Corps projects.  S. 612 also includes provisions to preserve and enhance the participation of Indian tribes in our water-related infrastructure, as well as honor commitments made by the U.S. government to the tribes. First, the bill includes a provision that authorizes the Corps to provide immediate housing assistance to the Indian tribes displaced as a result of the construction of the Bonneville Dam, as well as to further study those Indian tribes displaced from the construction of the John Day Dam. Both of these provisions are intended to ensure that the Federal Government lives up to the commitments made to the tribes for construction of these two projects generations ago.  In addition, S. 612 includes a provision that directs the Corps to undertake a comprehensive study of the existing tribal consultation process for the construction of any water resources development project, or any other project that may require the Corps' approval or the issuance of a Corps permit. As recent events have shown, it is past time for the Corps to revisit its existing tribal consultation processes to ensure that the Corps undertakes meaningful consultation with Indian tribes for projects that may have an impact on tribal cultural or natural resources. I look forward to working with the Corps to ensure that this study and report are completed within the year.  I am also pleased that S. 612 provides the framework for the Federal Government to finally meet its commitment to help the families affected by lead-contaminated water in Flint, Michigan. While the funding for these projects will ultimately be included in the appropriations bill that funds the government into next year, I support the inclusion of additional Drinking Water State Revolving Fund resources for communities experiencing public health threats associated with lead-water contamination, and urge the Administration to release these funds to the State of Michigan and to the City of Flint as quickly as possible.  The bill also benefits my home state of Oregon.  First, and foremost, the bill makes permanent the existing set-aside of harbor maintenance funding for small commercial harbors. These small commercial harbors are the lifeblood of local and regional economies; yet, for decades, Federal dredging needs at these harbors went unmet. S. 612 makes permanent the existing 10 percent set-aside of annual Federal maintenance dredging funds for these types of harbors, and ensures that this 10 percent is the minimum (not the maximum) amount allocated to small commercial harbors from both baseline funding and priority funds.  The bill also provides for the first-ever survey of the condition of existing breakwaters and jetties protecting Federal harbors. In the Northwest, these critical structures are crumbling, failing to provide necessary protection for shippers and fishermen alike, and increasing the long-term costs of maintaining our ports and harbors. This survey will provide Congress with critical information on the condition of breakwaters and levees so that we may start the process of repairing or replacing these structures in the near future.  I am pleased that S. 612 also authorizes a new Columbia River Basin Restoration Program at the Environmental Protection Agency to help reduce toxic contamination and clean up contaminated sites in the Columbia River Basin.  However, Mr. Speaker, there are also provisions in this bill that I cannot support.  For example, when the Water Resources Development Act of 2016 was considered in the House in September, I sponsored an amendment to ensure that scarce Federal funds are not used for the construction of non-economically-justified projects, or projects for the construction of ballfields and splash parks. Unfortunately, at the insistence of the Republican majority, the authorization of the Central City; Texas project remains in this final bill, without the protections for taxpayers that I sought in my amendment. Should this project continue, I will continue to press the Committee and the Corps to oversee this project to ensure that taxpayer dollars are not wasted on frivolous and non-economically-justified projects, regardless of where they are constructed.  In addition, I did not support the inclusion in this bill of those provisions which side with one State over another in regional water issues, such as those involving the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint watersheds in the States of Georgia, Florida, and Alabama.  I do not support the inclusion of any of the provisions that purport to grant a private citizen with some undefined property right to publically-owned or managed property. These provisions, such as section 1148 (Cumberland River, Kentucky), section 1185 (Table Rock Lake, Arkansas and Missouri), and section 5003 (Tennessee Valley Authority jurisdictional waters), follow a concerning trend that seeks to provide some enforceable interest in public lands and resources for which no right currently exists, or no agreement with or payment to the government is made. Congress should conduct proper oversight of these and any future proposals to grant such a property right to ensure that public resources are properly held in trust for the good of the Nation, and not the benefit of private individuals or interests.  In addition, I oppose efforts by the Republican Leadership to undermine worker protections and Buy America requirements for programs and projects authorized by this bill. If enacted, these provisions will undermine the principle of prevailing wage protections for construction jobs, and open the door to using American taxpayer dollars to pass off goods made with Russian and Chinese steel as ``Made-in-America'' .  Finally, and most egregiously, I am opposed to the inclusion of the last-minute, nearly 100-page California water poison pill that was developed behind closed doors and with no apparent public debate. It deeply divides the existing California Congressional delegation, regardless of party, and picks winners and losers in a region-against-region and industry-against-industry fight for water in California. This provision was dropped on our lap on Monday. It jeopardizes not only our bill, but also Oregon's fishing industry and thousands of jobs that depend on sustainable fisheries. I cannot support a bill that will jeopardize thousands of jobs and our economic engine on the Oregon coast.  Again, I want to thank Chairman Shuster for his work on this bill. I am disappointed that the good work of our Committee has been sullied by the whims of House Republican Leaders, and hope that, in the next Congress, we can restore the strong and lasting commitments made between the majority and minority members of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.  For these reasons, I oppose S. 612.
