President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3096       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Providing Resources to End      the Vaping Epidemic Now for Teenagers Act of 2020'' or the      ``PREVENT Act of 2020''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds the following:       (1) High school e-cigarette use increased by 135 percent      between 2017 and 2019.       (2) Middle school e-cigarette use increased by      approximately 218 percent between 2017 and 2019.       (3) Results from the National Youth Tobacco Survey of the      Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (in this section      referred to as ``CDC'') and the Food and Drug Administration      (in this section referred to as ``FDA'') published in      December 2019 show that 27.5 percent of high school students      and 10.5 percent of middle school students reported using an      e-cigarette in the previous 30 days, up from 20.8 percent and      4.9 percent, respectively, in 2018.       (4) In 2019, more than one-third (34.2 percent) of high      school e-cigarette users reported using e-cigarettes products      frequently, on 20 to 30 days in the past month.       (5) The CDC, the FDA, the Department of Health and Human      Services, the Surgeon General, and various State and local      health authorities have determined the skyrocketing e-     cigarette use amongst American youth to be an ``epidemic''.       (6) According to the CDC, the use of nicotine among      adolescents can be detrimental to memory making, learning,      and behavior, and e-cigarette use has been linked to lung      conditions and mysterious illness.       (7) According to data from the FDA's Population Assessment      of Tobacco and Health Study, youth e-cigarette use is      associated with more than four times the odds of trying      cigarettes and nearly three times the odds of current      cigarette use.       (8) The CDC and FDA continue to reiterate that the use of      any tobacco product, including e-cigarettes, is unsafe for      young people.     SEC. 3.
