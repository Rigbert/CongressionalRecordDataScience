 I fully understood from the beginning that it was the desire of the Senator from Arizona to press for an up-or-down vote at the end of this debate. No one has been more aggressive than he has. Had it not been for the Senator from Arizona, we would not have been on this issue at all, at this point, which would have been my preference given the fact we have an energy crisis in the country, we have a stock market that is in trouble, and I, frankly, am somewhat stunned that we have spent 2 weeks on this issue.  Having said that, we have been on this issue because of the tenacity of the Senator from Arizona.
