 President, I am pleased to support this legislation. Included within this appropriations bill is historic legislation, produced on a bipartisan basis in the Foreign Relations Committee, regarding the institutional structure of, and funding for, American foreign policy. This important legislation to reorganize the foreign policy agencies of the U.S. Government and authorize the payment of U.S. arrearages to the United Nations is similar to a bill approved by the Senate last June by a vote of 90-5. Unfortunately, the bill which the Senate overwhelmingly approved has been bogged down in conference with the other body over an issue which has no relevance to this bill.  I am therefore grateful to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Stevens and Senator Byrd, for agreeing to include provisions of our legislation in this bill.  I can assure my colleagues that the decision to include the authorization bill in an appropriations bill was not taken lightly. The Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Helms, and I sought to do so after careful consultation with the Senate leadership. But because two major elements of this bill are so critical to American foreign policy, the Chairman and I believed that we could not afford to delay this bill until next year. I hope my colleagues will agree.  Specifically, the bill addresses two important issues which were the focus of much heated debate in the last Congress. First, the bill provides for the payment of U.S. back dues to the United Nations, contingent on specific reforms by that body. Second, the bill establishes a framework for the reorganization of the U.S. foreign policy agencies which is consistent with the plan announced by the President last April.  Importantly, the bill also contains sufficient funds to restore our diplomatic readiness, which has been severely hampered in recent years by deep reductions in the foreign affairs budget. The funding levels in the bill largely mirror the Fiscal 1998 budget request submitted by the Clinton administration. The wide support in this Congress for providing increased funding for foreign affairs is an important achievement, and reverses a troubling trend of the past few years.  Although the cold war has ended, the need for American leadership in world affairs has not. Our diplomats often represent the front line of our national defense; with the downsizing of the U.S. military presence overseas, the maintenance of a robust and effective diplomatic capability has become all the more important. Despite the reduction in our military presence abroad, the increased importance of ``diplomatic readiness'' to our Nation's security has not been reflected in the Federal budget.  The increase in foreign affairs funding contained in this bill could not have come too soon. According to a report prepared at my request by the Congressional Research Service earlier this year, foreign policy spending is now at its lowest level in 20 years. Stated in fiscal 1998 dollars, the budget in fiscal 1997 was $18.77 billion, which is 25 percent below the annual average of $25 billion over the past two decades, and 30 percent below the level of 10 years ago, near the end of the Reagan administration. In fiscal 1997, such funding was just 1.1 percent of the Federal budget--the lowest level in the past 20 years and about one-third below the historical average.  I should remind my colleagues that the bill is truly a bipartisan product. It began with negotiations involving the Foreign Relations Committee and the Clinton administration early in the year. The Senate subsequently passed that bill overwhelmingly in June, by a vote of 90-5. Since that time, several changes have been made as a result of the conference deliberations with our House counterparts and negotiations with the Clinton administration. These were also undertaken in a spirit of bipartisanship. Because of these changes, I am confident that the bill will be acceptable to the President.  Enactment of this bill will mark another important milestone in reestablishing a bipartisan consensus on foreign policy. Like our predecessors five decades ago, we stand at an important moment in history.  After the Second World War, a bipartisan and farsighted group of senators, led by Chairmen of the Foreign Relations Committee such as Thomas Connally and Arthur Vandenberg, worked with the Truman administration to construct a post-war order. The institutions created at that time--the United Nations, the World Bank, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization--are still with us today, but the task of modernizing these institutions to make them relevant to our times is just beginning.  For example, the Clinton administration and the Senate are cooperating onthe first significant expansion of NATO--an expansion to the east which will encompass three former adversaries in Central Europe. The Foreign Relations Committee, under the leadership of Chairman Helms, has initiated a series of hearings on the proposed enlargement of NATO, setting the stage for what I hope will be successful amendment to the Washington Treaty next spring. Similarly, this legislation now before us calls for significant reforms of the United Nations, an important instrument in American foreign policy which has become crippled both by growing U.S. arrearages and an unwillingness within that body to reform. Enactment of this legislation will be an important step forward in resolving both those problems.  Just as we are trying to revise and reenergize international institutions, we must reorganize our own foreign policy institutions. Two years ago, the Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee put forward a far-reaching plan to consolidate our major foreign affairs agencies--the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA), the United States Information Agency (USIA), and the Agency for International Development--within the Department of State. In the context of an election cycle, it was perhaps inevitable that the Congress and the President would not come to agreement on it.  But continued stalemate was not inevitable. With the onset of a new presidential term and the appointment of a new Secretary of State, a window of opportunity to revisit the issue was opened. The Chairman, to his credit, took advantage of this window by urging the new Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, to take a second look at the reorganization issue. And, to her credit, the Secretary did so; the result was the reorganization plan announced by the President in April. Under the proposal, two agencies--ACDA and USIA--will be merged into the State Department. The Agency for International Development will remain an independent agency, but it will be placed under the direct authority of the Secretary of State.  The legislation now before the Senate closely reflects the President's proposal. The Arms Control and Disarmament Agency will be merged into the State Department no later than October 1, 1998, and the U.S. Information Agency will be merged no later than October 1, 1999. As with the President's plan, the Agency for International Development will remain a separate agency, but it will be placed under the direct authority of the Secretary of State. And, consistent with the President's proposal to seek improved coordination between the regional bureaus in State and AID, the Secretary of State will have the authority to provide overall coordination of assistance policy.  The bill puts flesh on the bones of the President's plan with regard to international broadcasting. The President's plan was virtually silent on this question, stating only that the ``distinctiveness and editorial integrity of the Voice of America and the broadcasting agencies would be preserved.'' This bill upholds and protects that principle by maintaining the existing government structure established by Congress in 1994 in consolidating all U.S. government-sponsored broadcasting--the Voice of America, Radio and TV Marti, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia, and Worldnet TV--under the supervision of one oversight board known as the Broadcasting Board of Governors. Importantly, however, the Board and the broadcasters below them will not be merged into the State Department, where their journalistic integrity would be greatly at risk.  With regard to the United Nations provision, the bill provides $926 million in arrearage payments to the Union Nations over a period of 3 years contingent upon the U.N. achieving specific reforms. This will allow us to pay all U.S. arrears to the U.N. regular budget, all arrears to the peacekeeping budget, nearly all arrears to the U.N. specialized agencies, and all arrears to other international organizations.  It is difficult to exaggerate the significance of this achievement. We are finally in a position to lay to rest the perennial dispute over our unpaid dues that has severely complicated relations between the United Nations and the United States. This bill would give our diplomats the leverage they need to push through meaningful reforms that promise to make the U.N. a more capable institution.  Two important changes were made to the legislation that cleared the Senate last June. First, the bill now allows the crediting of $107 million owed to the U.S. by the U.N. against our arrears. Second, it gives the administration added flexibility by allowing the Secretary of State to waive two conditions. The waiver will not apply to the reduction of assessment rates or the establishment of inspectors-general in the specialized agencies. But report language will make a clear commitment that Congress would, if necessary, consider on an expedited basis a waiver on the condition for a 20 percent assessment rate for the U.N. regular budget.  Of course, not everyone is happy with the agreements the Chairman, Senator Helms, and I worked out. Some would have preferred to see no conditions at all attached to the payment of our debts. Others are unhappy that the United States is paying any arrears whatsoever.  I think it is fair to say that the Chairman and I approached this issue from two very different points of view. I make no excuses for my support of the United Nations. I believe that the U.N. is an indispensable arrow in our foreign policy quiver. The Chairman, I think it is fair to say, has been skeptical of the role of the United Nations.  But despite our differing outlooks, over the course of nearly 8 months of negotiation, dialogue, and old-fashioned bargaining, we each gave something and got something to return. The Chairman got several important conditions attached to the payment of arrears. Among other items, these include important managerial reforms, assurances that U.S. sovereignty will be protected, and a lowering of our assessment rate from 25 percent to 20 percent of the U.N. regular budget.  For me, it is important that this bill sends a strong signal of bipartisan support for putting our relationship with the United Nations back on track. Restoring our relationship with the United Nations is not a favor to anyone else--it is in our interest.  The United Nations allows us to leverage our resources with other countries in the pursuit of common interests, be it eradicating disease, mitigating hunger, caring for refugees, or addressing common environmental problems. And as the unfolding crisis with Iraq demonstrates, the United Nations can be a useful instrument in our diplomacy. The United States has played a leading role in the United Nations since its founding, and I believe that this legislation will secure that leadership.  While the purists on either side may not be happy with the agreement before us, I believe that we have produced a responsible piece of legislation that warrants the support of our colleagues.  In sum, the bill before the Senate, the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act, is a significant achievement. I want to pay tribute to the Chairman for his continued good faith and cooperation throughout this process. I want to thank the President, the National Security Adviser, and the Secretary of State, for their support and assistance during the negotiations. I also want to thank our colleagues in the other body, particularly the ranking member of the International Relations Committee, Lee Hamilton, who played an important role in pushing for changes to make this proposal more acceptable to the administration.  I believe we have produced a good compromise that a large majority will be able to support. I urge its adoption.             Amendments to the Prison Litigation Reform Act
