Mr. Speaker, I was here in 1984, when the Mexico City policy was crafted, and let me remind Members that the Mexico City policy was a minimalist policy, a bottom line, a very modest policy. Countries were excluded, because in countries around the world, we only have one government. Nongovernmental organizations, there are a multitude of them. There are Planned Parenthoods, there is the Pathfinder Fund,there is a large number of nongovernmental organizations.  We wanted to stop funding the abortion industry. Because what happens, they become an extension of our foreign policy and they use perhaps some of their own money, but money is fungible, as was stated so clearly. Our money frees up their money to crusade to bring down the right to life laws in these countries.  So I would have preferred countries were included, but they are not. We compromised that back in 1984.
