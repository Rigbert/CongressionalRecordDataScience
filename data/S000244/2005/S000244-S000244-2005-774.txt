Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, every Member of this body is aware of the scope of the tragedy and destruction that Hurricane Katrina inflicted on the gulf coast region, and Congress has already taken several steps to bring relief to the affected States and their people. In addition to the thousands of private residences and businesses destroyed or rendered uninhabitable by the hurricane and subsequent floods, many entities of the Federal Government located in that region may not be able to operate for a time period that remains uncertain.  The creation and maintenance of a court system that allows citizens to adjudicate disputes is a fundamental responsibility of government. The purpose of H.R. 3650 is to authorize Federal courts to conduct business outside of their statutorily defined geographic domains during times of emergency. It is critical that Congress enact the legislation expeditiously so that the affected courts in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama may continue to function in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.  The text of H.R. 3650 is substantially similar to section 15 of H.R. 1751, the Secure Access to Justice and Court Restoration Act of 2005, which the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security reported to the full Committee on the Judiciary on June 30.  Mr. Speaker, the need for this legislation became tragically apparent following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and the impact of these disasters on court operations, particularly in New York City. In emergency conditions, a Federal court facility in an adjoining district or circuit might more readily and safely be available to court personnel, litigants, jurors, and the public than a facility at the place of holding court within the district. This is especially true in major metropolitan areas such as New York, Washington, D.C., Dallas, and Kansas City, where the metropolitan area includes parts of more than one judicial district.  This legislation is also needed to address natural disasters. The recent impact of Hurricane Katrina on the Federal courts in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama has increased the urgency of congressional action. Where court operations cannot be transferred to other divisions within the affected judicial district due to widespread flooding and destruction, judges must be empowered to shift court proceedings temporarily into a neighboring judicial district.  The advent of electronic court record systems will facilitate the implementation of this authority by providing judges, court staff, and attorneys with remote access to case documents. The bill authorizes circuit, district, and bankruptcy courts that conduct special sessions outside of their respective geographic boundaries upon a finding that because of emergency conditions, no locations within the boundaries of those courts are reasonably available where such special sessions could be held.  The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, or AO, is required to notify the House and Senate Committees on the Judiciary, as well as the Marshals Service when a court issues an order to conduct an emergency session. The AO must also follow up no later than 180 days after such an order expires by submitting a brief report to both committees summarizing why the order was issued, its duration, its impact on litigants, and its cost to the judiciary.  The bill specifies that criminal trials may not be conducted outside the State in which a crime has been committed unless a defendant otherwise consents. This is consistent with the provisions of article III of the Constitution and the sixth amendment. With this one exception, a Federal court is empowered to conduct all business in a special session outside a district that it might otherwise conduct during a regular session.  Given these constitutional constraints, however, jurors in criminaltrials may only be summoned from ``any part of the district in which the crime has been committed,'' unless a defendant agrees to be tried by jurors from the district in which the court is holding a special session.  Finally, United States magistrate judges are currently subject to certain territorial limitations on their powers imposed by the Federal Magistrates Act. The bill clarifies that magistrate judges can also participate in the emergency extraterritorial sessions of the district courts.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation to return a measure of continuity to the victims of Hurricane Katrina and the Federal Court system that serves them.  Mr. Speaker, I submit for the Record a letter from the Justice Department in support of this legislation.         Department of Justice, Office of Legislative Affairs,            Office of the Assistant Attorney General                                Washington, DC, September 7, 2005.     Hon. F. James Sensenbrenner,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to express the views of the      Department on H.R. 3650, ``The Federal Emergency Special      Sessions Act of 2005.'' We support swift enactment of this      legislation.       This bill is drawn from other legislation currently being      considered in the Congress that will permit Federal courts to      conduct business in other locations in the event of an      emergency situation. The need for this bill has been clearly      demonstrated by the recent catastrophe caused by Hurricane      Katrina, which has already caused extreme disruption to the      courts. Passing this bill on an emergency basis will permit      the Federal Courts to return to the Nation's critical      business more quickly and more easily.       The Department already has commented on similar provisions      in prior legislation and some of our prior comments have been      addressed in this bill. In future legislation, we will      continue to seek refinement of the law in this area,      particularly as it relates to the critical need for      consultation and coordination between the Judiciary and the      Marshals Service in the event of any serious emergency.       Thank you for the opportunity to express our views. The      Office of Management and Budget has advised us that from the      perspective of the Administration's program, there is no      objection to submission of this letter.           Sincerely,                                             William E. Moschella,                                       Assistant Attorney General.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
