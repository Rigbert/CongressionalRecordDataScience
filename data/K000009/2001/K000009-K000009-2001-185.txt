Chairman, I thank the chairman and the ranking member, and I submit for the Record the material I referred to earlier.              Letter Report from General Accounting Office                                                 February 4, 1994.     Hon. Marcy Kaptur,     House of Representatives.       Dear Ms. Kaptur: The United States has one of the highest      mobility rates of all developed countries; annually, about      one-fifth of all Americans move. Elementary school children      who move frequently face disruption to their lives, including      their schooling. And, sadly, these children are often not      helped to adjust to the disruption of a new school--new      children, teachers, and principal--and to make sense of the      variations in curriculum between the old school and the new.      The success of children who change schools frequently may      therefore be jeopardized. In addition, as the schools pay      greater attention to high academic standards, advocated by      national and state leaders, these children may face increased      difficulty in achieving success.       In response to these concerns, you asked us to obtain      information on children who change schools frequently: (1)      their number and characteristics, (2) their success in school      relative to children who have never changed schools, (3) the      help that federal educational programs, such as Migrant      Education and Chapter 1, provide, and (4) the help that      improved student record systems could provide.                                       ____  Elementary School Children: Many Change Schools Frequently, Harming                             Their Education       One-sixth of the nation's third graders--more than half a      million children--have attended at least three different      schools since starting first grade. Unless policymakers focus      more on the needs of the children who are changing schools      frequently--often poor, inner city, and with limited English      skills--these children may continue to do poorly in math and      reading and risk having to repeat grades. Local school      districts typically provide little additional assistance to      these children. The Education Department could help by      developing strategies to provide all eligible children,      including those who have switched schools frequently, access      to federally funded Migrant Education and Chapter 1 services.      Timely and comparable record systems are one way to help      mobile children receive services. For example, a child's      school records often take up to 6 weeks to arrive in a new      school, and student records often differ from states and      districts.                            results in brief       One in six of the nation's children who are third-graders--     over a half million--have changed schools frequently,      attending at least three different schools since the      beginning of first grade. Unless policymakers focus greater      attention on the needs of children who have changed schools      frequently--often low-income, inner city, migrant, and      limited English proficient (LEP)--these children may continue      to be low achieving in math and reading, as well as to repeat      a grade. Local school districts generally provide little      additional help to assist mobile children.       The Department of Education can play a role in helping      mobile children to receive appropriate educational services      in a timely manner. Specifically, the Department can develop      strategies so that all eligible children, including those who      have changed schools frequently, will have access to      federally funded Migrant Education and Chapter 1 services.      Children who have changed schools frequently are not as      likely to receive services provided by the federal Migrant      Education and Chapter 1 programs as children who have never      changed schools.       Timely and comparable record systems could be one way to      help mobile children receive services. A child's records      often take 2 to 6 weeks to arrive in a new school, according      to data collected by the California State Department of      Education and others. Moreover, student records often are not      comparable across states and districts. The federal Migrant      Student Record Transfer System (MSRTS), established to      transfer information from a migrant child's former school      district to a new school district, also does not provide      timely and complete information. However, other systems, such      as one currently being piloted in a few states, may in the      future provide comparable and more timely transfer of student      records for all children, including migrants.                              conclusions       Children who change schools frequently face many challenges      to their success in school. Such change can cause disruption      and add to the other challenges--low-income, limited English      proficiency, and migrant status--that make learning and      achievement difficult for them. Nevertheless, many of the      children who change schools frequently may be less likely to      receive Migrant Education and Chapter 1 programs services      than other children meeting program eligibility standards. low-income, inner city, migrant, and lep children are more likely to                     have changed schools frequently       Children who are from low-income families or attend inner      city schools are more likely than others to have changed      schools frequently. Overall, about 17 percent of all third-     graders--more than a half million--have changed schools      frequently, attending three or more schools since first      grade. Of third-graders from low-income families--that is,      with incomes below $10,000--30 percent have changed schools      frequently, compared with about 10 percent from families with      incomes of $25,000 and above. About 25 percent of third-     graders in inner city schools have changed schools      frequently, compared with about 15 percent of third-graders      in rural or suburban schools.       An inner city child, compared with one in a suburban or      rural school, may be more likely to change schools      frequently, in part, because he or she is more likely to come      from a low-income family. Another factor that could      contribute to an inner city child changing schools is that      such a child may move only a short distance, yet move into a      new school attendance area; however, a child in a larger,      less densely populated school attendance area--for example,      in a suburban or rural school district--may move several      miles and still attend the same school.       Migrant and LEP children also are much more likely than      others to have changed schools frequently: about 40 percent      of migrant children have changed schools frequently, compared      with about 17 percent of all children. Among LEP children,      about 34 percent have changed schools frequently.children who have changed schools frequently are more likely to be low                     achievers and to repeat a grade       Of the nation's third-graders who have changed schools      frequently, 41 percent are low achievers, that is, below      grade level, in reading, compared with 26 percent of third-     graders who have never changed schools. Results are similar      for math--33 percent of children who have changed schools      frequently are below grade level, compared with 17 percent of      those who have never changed schools. In grouping the      children who have changed schools frequently into four income      categories, we found that within each category, these      children are more likely to be below grade level in reading      and math than those who have never changed schools. Children      who have moved often were also more likely to have behavioral      problems, according to a recent study.       Overall, third-graders who have changed schools frequently      are two-and-a-half times as likely to repeat a grade as      third-graders who have never changed schools (20 versus 8      percent). For all income groups, children who have changed      schools frequently are more likely to repeat a grade than      children who have never changed schools.       Children who have changed schools frequently, compared with      children who have never changed schools, are more than twice      as likely to have nutrition and health or hygiene problems,      according to teachers.       When children changed schools four or more times, both a      Department of Education and a Denver Public Schools study      found, they were more likely to drop out of school. Children      who changed schools four or more time by eighth grade were at      least four times more likely to drop out than those who      remained in the same school; this is true even after taking      into account the socio-economic status of a child's family,      according to the Department study. Children who transferred      within the district five or more times dropped out of school      at similarly high rates, regardless of reading achievement      scores, the Denver study found.       Except for migrant children, little is currently done to      help children whose frequent school changes affect the      continuity of their schooling. It may be difficult for      teachers to focus on the needs of these children,      particularly those who enter after school has started, rather      than on maintaining continuity for the rest of the class.      When children enter classrooms after the beginning of the      year, teachers may prejudge them unfavorably. Teachers in      schools with high proportions of children who change schools      after the beginning of the year indicated that these school      changes disrupt classroom instruction, and teachers must      spend additional time on noninstructional tasks. Teachers may      therefore not have the time to identify gaps in such a      child's knowledge; moreover, these gaps may grow as the child      is left on his or her own to make sense of the new curriculum      and its relation to the one at the previous school. Children      who changed schools often, except for migrant children, did      not receive specialized educational services, researchers      have noted. migrant children who have changed schools frequently are less likely  than those not changing schools to receive migrant education program                                 services       Of migrant third-graders who have attended three or more      schools since first grade, 21 percent receive migrant      services, compared with 54 percent of migrants who have not      changed schools at all. These results are surprising since      the Migrant Education Act is intended to address, to a large      degree, the problems mobility creates for migrant children.      Migrant children who have changed schools frequently are less      likely to attend schools with migrant education programs than      those who have never changed schools.CHAPTER 1 PARTICIPATION RATES LOWER FOR LOW-ACHIEVING CHILDREN WHO HAVE   CHANGED SCHOOLS FREQUENTLY THAN FOR LOW-ACHIEVING CHILDREN WHO HAVE                          NEVER CHANGED SCHOOLS       Low-achieving children who have changed schools frequently      are less likely to receive Chapter 1 services than low-     achieving children who have never changed schools. Of third-     graders who have never changed schools and read below grade      level, 25 percent receive Chapter 1 reading services. In      contrast, 20 percent of third-graders who have changed      schools frequently and read below grade level receive these      services. In grades kindergarten through 6, approximately      90,000 additional low-achieving children who have changed      schools frequently could receive Chapter 1 reading services      if the program provided these services at the same rates to      these children as to low-achieving children who have never      changed schools.  LACK OF CHAPTER 1 DATA TO EXPLAIN THE LOWER CHAPTER 1 PARTICIPATION          RATES OF CHILDREN WHO HAVE CHANGED SCHOOLS FREQUENTLY       The Department of Education has little information on      children who change schools frequently and their      participation in the Chapter 1 program, as well as the      effects that children moving frequently from school to school      have had on Chapter 1 services. Therefore, we were unable to      explain why low-achieving children who have changed schools      frequently may be less likely to be served by Chapter 1 than      low-achieving children who have never changed schools. A 1992      Department of Education policy instructs districts to reserve      adequate funds so that migrant children who are eligible for      Chapter 1 services--even if they arrive late in the school      year--will receive them. But nonmigrant children who change      schools frequently and are also eligible for Chapter 1      services are omitted in this policy.       We found that about 17 percent of third-graders have      changed schools frequently, that is, have attended three or      more schools since the beginning of first grade. About one-     quarter, or 24 percent, of third-graders have attended two      schools; the remaining 59 percent of third-graders have      remained in the same school since first grade. INNER CITY AND LOW-INCOME CHILDREN MUCH MORE LIKELY TO CHANGE SCHOOLS                                FREQUENTLY       Inner city children are much more likely to change schools      frequently, on average, than those in rural or suburban areas      or in small cities or towns. One-fourth of third-graders in      inner city schools have changed schools frequently, that is,      have attended three or more schools since first grade. In      comparison, only about one-seventh of children from rural or      suburban areas or from small cities or towns have changed      schools frequently.       Children from low-income families are more likely to change      schools frequently than those from higher income families.      Among children in families with annual incomes below $10,000,      30 percent have changed schools frequently, compared with 8      percent of children in families with incomes of $50,000 or      more. Overall, the percentage of children who change schools      frequently decreases as income increases.NATIVE AMERICAN, BLACK, HISPANIC, MIGRANT, AND LEP CHILDREN MORE LIKELY                       TO CHANGE SCHOOLS FREQUENTLY       Native American, black, and Hispanic children are more      likely to change schools frequently than Asian or white      children. However, these differences are less related to race      or ethnicity than to differences in income and, consequently,      homeownership versus renter status: renters tend to move much      more frequently than homeowners. When we examined 1990      Current Population Survey data reported by the Bureau of the      Census, race or ethnic differences in mobility largely      disappeared after considering homeownership versus renter      status.       Migrant and limited English proficient (LEP) children are      much more likely to change schools frequently than all      children. About 40 percent of migrant children and 34 percent      of LEP children change schools frequently, in comparison with      17 percent of all children. In addition, compared with 59      percent of all children, a smaller percentage of migrant and      LEP children have never changed schools--28 and 38 percent,      respectively.       Teachers reported that children who change schools      frequently, compared with those who have never changed      schools, are much more likely to have problems related to      nutrition or health and hygiene. Among children who change      schools frequently, 10 percent are reported to have nutrition      problems, compared with about 3 percent of children who have      never changed schools. Similarly, teachers report that 20      percent of children who change schools frequently have health      and hygiene problems, compared with 8 percent of children who      have never changed schools.       For all children, those who have changed schools frequently      are more than twice as likely to repeat a grade as those who      have never changed schools. Among children who change schools      frequently, about 20 percent repeat a grade; in contrast,      among children who have never changed schools, about 8      percent repeat a grade.       Children who change schools frequently are less likely to      receive educational support from federal programs than those      who have never changed schools. For example, migrant children      who change schools frequently are less likely to receive      migrant education services than those who have never changed      schools. In addition, low-achieving children who change      schools frequently are less likely to get Chapter 1 services      than those low-achieving children who have never changed      schools; this is true for children achieving below grade      level in math as well as reading.                                  ____             [From the CATALYST, Cleveland, Mar./Apr. 2001]               Mobile Students Score Lower on State Test                           (By Sandra Clark)       Cleveland 4th-graders who changed schools one or more times      during the school year scored lower than their stable      classmates on all five sections of the Ohio Proficiency Test,      according to a CATALYST analysis of test scores from 1997 to      1999.       On average, mobile students scored 5.12 points below their      more stable counterparts. The largest spread between the two      was in math and science. The smallest gap was in reading.       The analysis of test scores of 16,278 students, 1,914 of      whom changed schools at least once during the school year,      was conducted for CATALYST by Joshua G. Bagaka's, assistant      professor of educational research and statistics at Cleveland      State University.       ``Across all five parts of the Ohio 4th- and 6th-grade      proficiency test, mobile students consistently received lower      scores than their stable counterparts,'' Bagaka's says.       ``I don't think we need to down play the role of mobility      here,'' Bagaka's says. ``Schools should find ways of giving      mobile kids special attention because they are at risk of      failing.''       Bagaka's analysis also showed that the test scores of      mobile students suffered regardless of the students' family      income or whether they live with one or both parents.       The analysis also shows: The achievement gap between stable      and mobile students by income is often widest for mobile      students who pay full price for lunch and smallest for      students on free lunch. In many areas, poor mobile students      do better than well-off mobile students. (See chart page 5.)       Similar conclusions can be drawn when comparing students      from single-parent and two-parent homes. Mobile students from      single-parent homes often do just as well as mobile students      from two-parent homes. (See chart page 5.)       Mobility refers to students who change schools one or more      times during an academic year. Students change schools      frequently due to school choice, family moves, poverty,      hopelessness, changes in child custody and other problems.       Cleveland's mobility rate has fallen from 19.5 percent in      1998 and 1999 to 15.8 percent in 1999 due in part to the end      of desegregation, says Peter A. Robertson, Cleveland      Municipal School District's executive director of Research,      Evaluation and Assessment.       Individually, however, high-poverty elementary schools such      as Willow, East Clark, Bolton and George Washington Carver      reported rates nearing 30 percent during the period.       Based on student demographics and test scores from 1997      through 1999, the analysis indicated an achievement gap that      varied little even as the test changed in difficulty during      the period.       The highest achievement gaps in math and science were 7.5      points and 9.2 points, respectively. The average gap in      reading was 3.5 points. Reading is something children can      learn at home, says Russell W. Rumberger, education professor      at University of California, Santa Barbara. Families rely on      schools to teach math and science, which is why the      achievement gap in those subjects is largest, Rumberger says.       CATALYST'S findings come as no surprise to Robertson. The      district has not targeted mobile students for any special      help, Robertson says. However, he adds that districtwide      initiatives such as establishing standards and periodically      assessing students' strengths and weaknesses should help      them. (See story page 9.)       ``Beyond that,'' Robertson says, ``we are trying to make      sure they have access to good teaching and what we need to do      for all kids.''       Cleveland findings reflect studies done elsewhere that      linked student mobility to lower achievement.       For example, the Minneapolis Public Schools, the Family      Housing Fund and other groups studied mobile students in the      city. The year-long study, called the Kids Mobility Project,      found that students who moved three or more times earned      reading scores that were half that of students who stayed      put.       David Kerbow, a University of Chicago researcher who has      studied mobility in Chicago Public Schools, says constant      movement slows the learning pace for not only mobile students      but also their stable classmates. An analysis of math in      highly mobile classrooms shows teachers frequently stop and      start to integrate new students with varying achievement      levels into the class, Kerbow says. Introduction of new      material slows as the teacher begins keeping lessons basic.      And, over time, students in highly mobile schools get      instruction that is about a year behind that of students in      more stable schools, Kerbow reports.                                  ____                        Miles Park Finds Answers                           (By Sandra Clark)       A tour of Miles Park Elementary School offers a snapshot of      mobility--its causes, its impact and even a way to minimize      its harm.       Any staff member can guide the tour. They all have stories.       Clerk Ella Kirtley can explain what a task it is to keep      pace with the rapid student turnover. Librarian Jeanne Irvin      says she spends countless hours and dollars retrieving books      from students who leave. Second-grade teacher Jane E. Rodgers      can demonstrate how she tries to teach an ever-changing      class.       The Cleveland Municipal School District, like most in the      country, has no official policy for mitigating the impact of      mobility. The district has been pushing schools to improve      proficiency test scores without taking mobility and its drag      on achievement into account, Miles Park Principal William J.      Bauer says. So the school struck out on its own, making the      needs of mobile students a schoolwide focus.       ``The area superintendent says `You did good [with      proficiencies] last year. How much are you going to improve      this year?' '' Bauer says. ``There's a new student, there's a      new student, there's a new student with grades lower than an      LD [Learning Disabled] student. You're a teacher and you're      responsible for increasing scores every year.''       The staff is fluent in mobility because enrollment shifts      dramatically here. The school's 1999 mobility rate, the most      recent available, of 14.7 percent is below the district      average for elementary schools, about 16 percent.       Yet, staff sees a constant churning of students in and out      of the school. To date, the school's enrollment shifted from      530 students, to 510 and then 571 for a total change of 81.      That means about four whole classrooms full of kids have come      and gone this school year. The impact the movement has on      learning at the school is huge, Bauer says.       Mobility's influence on behavior and achievement becomes      clear one day when     Kenneth returns from speech lessons to Rodgers' 2nd-grade      class. The tenor of the class shifts. A slight rumble of      discord replaces the chatter of children constructing a      picture graph.       Kenneth, not his real name, is the most recent of eight new      students in Rodgers' class this school year. Kenneth rarely      follows school rules and is functioning below grade level,      Rodgers says. His classmates know this and give him grief.      Little shoves are sent his way, to which he responds by      glaring at the tallest kid in class.       He stands out, Rodgers says. Kenneth is the only student      not wearing the school's blue and white uniform.       ``My students are starting to write paragraphs, and he      can't write a sentence,'' Rodgers says. ``I don't have time      to work with him.       ``I move quicker,'' Rodgers says. ``I'm a 25-year teacher.      He had a first-year teacher.''       Students like Kenneth are in danger of failing. A 1994      General Accounting Office report on mobility said 3rd-graders      who have changed schools frequently are 2\1/2\ times as      likely to repeat a grade as 3rd-graders who have never      changed schools.       A CATALYST analysis of mobility in Cleveland schools also      showed a link between mobility and retention.       The analysis also showed average proficiency test scores of      mobile students are about 5 points below scores of stable      students.       Janice Smallwood's 4th-grade class at Miles Park has 24      students. Seven are new. When Smallwood tested reading and      math levels, students scored between 4.66 and 1.68. Six of      the mobile students are at the bottom of the list, scoring      below those labeled Learning Disabled. Tianna scored 3.84,      the highest of all new students, to rank 11th in the      class.                              bad behavior       Behavior is high on the list of areas affected by mobility.      The GAO report said that children who move frequently are 77      percent more likely to have four or more behavioral problems      than those with no or infrequent moves.       This constant movement, loss of friends and the effort it      takes to make new ones can be ``a social nightmare,'' says      Ted Feinberg, assistant executive director of the National      Association of School Psychologists.       Some mobile students are content to quietly scope out the      class before inserting themselves into the mix. Some use      humor to cope, Feinberg explains. The antics of a 4th-grader      who had attended about five schools constantly pulled the      class off task, says Miles Park teacher Teresa Goetz. She      telephoned the boy's previous school to get his history and      found that he had jumped on one child's out-stretched leg,      breaking it. In November, the boy transferred to another      school.       A move from family to foster care sent a Cleveland student      to Hawthorne Elementary School in Lorain. This boy was so      desperate to make friends, he stole money from a teacher's      purse and passed it out to fellow students, Hawthorne      Principal Loretta Jones says.       ``What we see are kids who are depressed because they don't      have a social network,'' Feinberg says. ``Kids feel awkward      and uncomfortable. They try to prove themselves through      strength and coolness.''                               no records       In addition to behavioral and academic problems, mobile      students frustrate administrators because the children seldom      arrive with records, grades and immunization forms.       Clerk Ella Kirtley spends half her day enrolling new      students, withdrawing them and searching for records from      their old schools.       Kirtley is retired but Bauer has convinced her to stay on      because he doesn't think he can find another clerk who can      keep up.       What's scary to Kirtley is how difficult it is to get vital      information on students and now quickly that information      changes.       Addresses change, telephone numbers change and pagers are      cut off so frequently that ``You can't be up to date with      emergency cards,'' Principal Bauer says. Sick children have      been sent back to class because the school could not find an      emergency contact Kirtley says.                        testing mobile students       Neither Cleveland schools nor the Ohio Department of      Education have official strategies to mitigate the impact of      mobility. Academic standards are surfacing as a way to be      sure all kids are exposed to the same information and tests      even though they change schools. (See story page 9.) The      state department also plans to create a system of exchanging      student records using Education Management Information      Systems. The system should be completed in two years, says      department spokeswoman Dorothea Howe.       But for the most part, teachers and principals individually      hammer out solutions. Some start by finding out the student's      performance level so they can be placed in the appropriate      class. This is an informal process at most schools.       For example, at Willow Elementary School, Tannesha      Saunders' 4th-grade teacher casually quizzed her when she      joined the class in October.       ``I think she wanted to see what I knew,'' says Tannesha,      who attended four schools in three years. ``She'd teach some      stuff then she'd ask some people some questions. Then she'd      ask me a question and I answered it.''       Tannesha says the teacher also gave her a buddy,      ``Brittany, to help me with my work and show me around like      where the lunchroom was.''       Testing for placement of new students is serious business      at Miles Park. New students are given the Star Test for      reading and Computer Curriculum Corp. math, says Miles Park's      Assistant Principal Kelley A. Dudley. Both tests assign a      grade equivalent based on the student's score and prescribe      what students should study to close any achievement gaps,      Dudley says.       Star Test scores correspond with grade-appropriate books in      Accelerated Reader. Computer Curriculum aligns math with      grade levels and allows students to work on problems during      math lab and after school. Students work independently or get      tutoring from retired professionals who volunteer.       Paris, a new student in Smallwood's 4th-grade class, moved      up a grade level to 3.6, Dudley says. ``He's still behind,      but look where he came from,'' she says.                                  ____                           Managing Mobility                           (By Sandra Clark)                the causes: poverty and family break-ups       Miles Park Principal William J. Bauer and other heads of      Cleveland elementary schools that experience mobility can      only guess why students frequently transfer in and out of      their schools.       In most cases, the district does not keep records on why      students are withdrawn from school.       School leaders point to income and family instability as      primary culprits. Loss of income often means families must      move from their houses or apartments. Changes in child      custody or guardianship also can cause movement. Some      children transfer schools after being placed in foster care.       Then there's homelessness. For example, Kentucky and Case      elementary schools serve students in nearby homeless and      battered women's shelters.       Families living at the Zelma George Homeless Shelter attend      Miles Park, A.B. Hart Middle and South High School. Families      can stay only 14 days unless they receive an extension from      the shelter, shelter officials say. (See story page 12.)       Welfare reform also plays an increasingly important role in      homelessness and school instability. Mobility for families      recently cut from welfare is four times higher than that of      other families, reports Claudia Coulton, social welfare      professor at Case's Mandel School of Applied Social Sciences.      About 42 percent of Cuyahoga County families leaving welfare      moved within six-months of leaving cash assistance, compared      to the national average of 8 percent of families not on      welfare moving during the period, Coulton says.       That's not entirely bad news. Many parents now have jobs      and can afford to move to better neighborhoods, says Rasool      Jackson, Cleveland school's director of Student      Administrative Services.       Bauer disagrees, saying welfare reform portends more      instability. Bauer says he believes more Miles Park students      are losing their homes and moving in with family members      since welfare reform took hold.       Another major cause of movement is discomfort with the      school. For example, results of a survey of students in      Chicago Public Schools showed one reason students transferred      was school-related, not that the family changed homes, says      David Kerbow, education researcher at the University of      Chicago. When conflict with school staff or students      occurred, parents chose to leave rather than solve the      problem, Kerbow explains.       Margaret V. Alberty was so uncomfortable with teachers      handling of her special-needs 4th-grader that she changed      schools six times before settling on Willow Elementary      School.       Alberty is guardian of 10-year-old Damien Lightfoot, who      has Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.       Alberty says many teachers are unprepared to teach a child      with his condition and do not know how to handle Damien when      he's upset. He's been grabbed and jerked about by teachers,      Alberty says. ``They aggravate you so much you have to take      them out of the school.''       It's not unusual for parents like Alberty to change schools      because they disagree with a school's academic practices or      front-office manners. ``A rude clerk can really damage your      school,'' says Doug Clay, a former district researcher now      with the Urban School Collaborative at Cleveland State      University.       Finally, Peter A. Robertson, Cleveland Municipal School's      executive director of Research, Evaluation and Assessment,      says a number of Cleveland students transfer to escape poor      grades or a special education diagnosis.       Districts and communities across the country are using a      variety of strategies to lessen the negative effects of      mobility or to limit mobility itself. Some schools have      created programs to welcome students and place them in the      most suitable classroom. Others go outside the school walls      to address housing issues. Here is a list of tactics      principals, districts and states have used to manage      mobility.                          Placing new students       When Jo Ann Isken, principal of Moffett Elementary School      in Los Angeles County, learned about a kindergartner who was      having trouble learning to read, she did a little checking.      She found he had attended three different schools, with      lengthy absences in     between. His lessons had been in English, some in Spanish.       Because of frequent movement among students, Isken set up      welcoming procedures for new students. When the new student      and parent or guardian arrive, they are asked about the      child's school and medical history. ``Immediately, we had an      academic, health and family history and we knew what the      support needs would be.''       Students are tested and assigned to classes based on      achievement levels. Then, measures such as one-to-one      tutoring are prescribed, Isken says.       When students leave, they are given transfer forms with      immunization data, enrollment dates and names and telephone      numbers or contact people at the school. ``Our children      (leave) with more information than we got when they came,''      Isken says.                            Record exchange       A program designed to serve the children of migrant workers      has provided a way to help ensure that student records follow      them. New Generation System is a student-record exchange      program established in 1995. It is operated by a consortium      of 11 states, including Ohio and Texas. Health, academic and      demographic information is available to consortium members      via the Internet, says Patricia Meyertholen, programs      director for the Texas Migrant Information Program.       To protect student privacy, the site is encrypted and      requires a password: Only consortium members have access,      Meyertholen says.       New Generation System maintains data on about 200,000 of an      estimated 784,000 migrant children nationwide, Meyerholen      says.                            Low-cost housing       Minneapolis Public Schools attacked mobility at one of its      root causes--a lack of low-cost housing.       ``It's the 1 percent vacancy rate that wreaks such havoc on      family stability,'' says Elizabeth E. Hinz, policy and      planning director. ``Housing isn't here, period. Or the      housing that's available people can't afford.''       The district joined with groups such as the Family Housing      Fund and launched the Kids Mobility Project. The research      project explored the effect of constant residential moves      on student achievement. It produced a report in 1998 that      linked inadequate housing to student mobility, poor      attendance and lower reading scores, says Shawna      Tobechukwu, spokeswoman for the Family Housing Fund.       Tobechukwu says results were used to lobby the state      legislature to increase the budget for low-cost housing.      Lawmakers responded to the data and raised the budget by      about $96 million in the last two years, says Angie Bernhard,      research and policy director at Family Housing Fund. ``The      report was a big part of the information we used to make our      case,'' Bernhard says. ``It was very persuasive to      legislators on both sides of the aisle.''                            Extra resources       In 1994, Montgomery County Public Schools in Maryland began      allocating extra staff to schools based on mobility rates,      poverty rates and the number of students speaking limited      English, says Susan F. Marks, the district's executive      assistant for School Performance. Lean budgets meant the      district, headquartered in Rockville, Md., simply sent an      extra teacher or two to high-mobility schools.       Last year, the county revamped the program. For one, it      took mobility and language out of the equation and focused on      reducing class size at high-mobility schools, says Frank H.      Stetson, Community Superintendent for the school system.       In an area where international professionals come and go      regularly, mobility and language are not the best indicators      of need, Stetson says. Poverty is. And poorer schools tend to      have the ``churn'' that chills attendance and achievement,      Stetson adds.       ``If we used mobility we'd be sending resources to schools      that didn't need them,'' Stetson says.       To add resources, the system ranked schools by poverty.      Then it gave funds for such items as all-day kindergarten,      extra staff to achieve a 15-1 teacher-student ratio and      programs like Reading Recovery in the primary grades, Mark      says. It also plans to add 41 positions to reduce class size      at high-poverty high schools, Marks says.                             Transportation       A coalition of community organizations has taken steps to      reduce school mobility among children in Baltimore County,      Md., by providing bus service so that students who move can      remain in the same school.       The area has neighborhoods containing hundreds of      apartments in low-rise buildings where families constantly      move in and out. A move from one apartment to another 10      minutes away could send children to a different school,      says Julie J. Gaynor, a Baltimore county teacher and      chairwoman of the Stay Put committee.       The Stay Put program was founded in 1992 to cut school      mobility. It is a non-profit project of the education      committee of the Essex-Middle River-White Marsh Chamber of      Commerce.       The group runs several programs such as shuttle buses      supplied by the district to transport children who move back      to their old school.       Families often move because landlords offer free rent for      one month. Stay Put encourages landlords to put the freebie      at the end of the lease, increasing the likelihood that kids      will finish a school year in one place. At the group's      urging, landlords also have donated an apartment which serves      as a community center where students who live in the complex      can receive after-school tutoring and adults can prepare for      the General Education Development Certificate (GED).       Gaynor says a new focus is on opening a conflict mediation      center so families can resolve differences rather than move      away.       Funding for the community center's staff comes from various      sources, including school district grants, Gaynor says.                             Accountability       The California accountability system addresses a common      complaint of schools that suffer high mobility: They say they      shouldn't be held accountable for the performance of students      who entered their schools months, weeks or even days before      the high-stakes tests are given.       The California Department of Education figures mobility      into its accountability system. Districts are required to      report mobility. The state uses the rate to decide which      scores will or will not be used in the system.       ``If you're not in the district a year, your scores don't      count for rewards and interventions for schools,'' says      Patrick J. McCabe, in the department's Office of Policy and      Evaluation.       California schools report two types of mobility, students      who have not been in a district a full year and students who      have not been in a school a full year. Schools do not report      ``churn,'' the frequent in-and-out movement of students,      McCabe says. And scores of students who change schools within      the same district are not exempt from the accountability      system, McCabe says.       Districts failing to meet targets are given three years and      extra money to improve. If no improvement occurs, penalties      such as removing the principal, staff or closing the school      kick in.       Successful districts receive $70 for every child, McCabe      says.
