President, in April, President Clinton with former Presidents Bush and Ford convened a Summit on Service in Philadelphia. They and other national leaders called upon young people to serve their communities and urged them to spread the spirit of service throughout the country.  The Corporation for National Service [CNS] is among those advancing this spirit. Its mission, as my colleagues are well aware, is to help the country meet its educational, environmental, and public safety needs through service projects conducted and led by young people. The young people who participate in the AmeriCorps Program assist needy individuals, families, and their communities, while building their own self-esteem and earning grants to help them meet the financial costs of higher education.  Since its inception, the Corporation for National Service has taken steps to address the charges of its critics by making necessary changes. Today, CNS fulfills its mandates successfully, efficiently, and cost effectively. In fact, a University of Minnesota study shows that AmeriCorps Programs in that State return $3.90 in benefits for every dollar spent. Studies in Washington State reveal a similar return on investment.  When the Senate considers the reauthorization of the Corporation for National Service, I hope we will continue to foster the spirit of service that was celebrated in Philadelphia. To open the discussion, I ask my colleagues to take the time to read an article entitled ``The Value of Service,'' which appeared in the June edition of Government Executive magazine. This article offers, I believe, a balanced view of CNS's first 4 years. Mr. President, I ask that it be printed in the Record. The article follows:                          The Value of Service                            (By Annys Shin)       These should be heady days for the Corporation for National      Service, the 4-year-old agency that oversees AmeriCorps,      President Clinton's pet program to give students financial      aid in exchange for a year of community service.       In February, Clinton announced in his State of the Union      address that he would use thousands of AmeriCorps volunteers      to mobilize an army of reading tutors for grade-school      children. In March, CNS chief executive Harris Wofford got a      favorable reception on Capitol Hill when he testified before      the House and Senate on his agency's budget request. A month      later, he stood with President Clinton and former President      Bush at a summit meeting on national service in Philadelphia.       All this just a year after AmeriCorps' budget was zeroed      out by the House (only to be restored later in negotiations      with the Senate) and Congress failed to bring CNS'      reauthorization up in committee.       Still, CNS is still fighting to prove that its programs are      worth the $600 million a year taxpayers spend on them.       President Clinton's proposed tutoring effort, known as the      America Reads Initiative, has further raised the stakes for      AmeriCorps and CNS. The Clinton administration has requested      $1 billion over the next five years to cover the costs of the      program and an additional 50,000 AmeriCorps Challenge      Scholarships. Any funding increase or new service initiative      can't go forward unless CNS is reauthorized by September,      according to a CNS spokesman.       Since CNS is the Clinton administration's most significant      expansion of the federal bureaucracy, its leaders have been      meticulous since 1993 about measuring the results of their      programs to show that they work. Other federal operations      will soon follow suit, as the Government Performance and      Results Act of 1993 takes full effect, forcing agencies to      develop outcomes-based approaches to running their programs.       However, few agencies are likely to face the relentless      criticism that CNS has from its Republican opponents, who see      the agency and its programs as little more than a political      boondoggle. So far, reams of positive data have not been      enough to get CNS out of the partisan cross hairs.                         AmeriCorps Under Siege       At the center of all the controversy is AmeriCorps, CNS'      flagship program. The agency administers two other service      programs, Learn and Serve and the Senior Corps, but neither      have received the scrutiny AmeriCorps has.       CNS jointly administers AmeriCorps with 48 state      commissions, which vary in size. CNS gives half of AmeriCorps      grant funding to the state commissions, which then issue sub-     grants to projects. CNS directly funds projects with the rest      of the money.       AmeriCorps members are involved in a variety of activities,      including assisting crime victims, immunizing children,      restoring national parks, developing community-based health      care programs and setting up credit unions in low-income      communities. In return for a year's service, they get living      allowances of $7,600 a year, which can be supplemented by the      member's employer. They also receive an education award of      $4,725 to put toward paying off student loans or to finance      higher education or vocational training. Members can receive      living allowances and education grants for up to two terms of      service.       Last year, the $215 million that AmeriCorps distributed in      the form of grants to states and direct funding of projects      went to 450 programs that operate at more than 1,000 sites      nationwide and employ 24,000 AmeriCorps members.       None of AmeriCorps' critics have disputed the value of      building housing for low-income families or teaching children      to read. But some members of Congress question whether the      program's benefits are worth its cost to taxpayers.       At many federal agencies, the cost-benefit calculation is      far from simple. The Government Performance and Results Act      is supposed to help by forcing agencies to come up with      strategic plans and to measure the results of their programs.      ``The Results Act is a major culture change for most      agencies,'' says Jerome F. Climer, president of the      Congressional Institute, a think tank that studies      governmental reforms.       But at CNS, which was created the same year GPRA became      law, no such culture change is necessary. ``There was a      decision made early on in the program that AmeriCorps had to      be judged on the basis of what it actually accomplished, on      services delivered,'' says Steven Waldman, assistant managing      editor at U.S. News and World Report, who wrote The Bill      (Viking, 1995), a book about Clinton's effort to start a      national service program, and later served as Wofford's      senior policy adviser. ``It was not sufficient to have      anecdotal evidence that it was good for the AmeriCorps      members. We had to have proof that it was good for the      communities it was serving.''                           Costs and Benefits       But measuring community impact has proved to be easier said      than done. Older service programs such as the Peace Corps      have tended to focus more on participant benefits, in part      because the impact on participants is easier to gauge than      the effect on communities, says JoAnn Jastrzab of the Boston      research firm Abt Associates, who has studied some of      AmeriCorps' efforts.       Last July, Jastrzab and her colleagues released the      findings of a 14-month study of the country's eight largest      and most-established youth conservation corps, which get      about a third of their funding through AmeriCorps. The study      was funded by CNS.       Jastrzab followed participants in one Washington state      project who went out into fields armed with toothbrushes to      talk to migrant farm laborers about oral hygiene and to try      to persuade them to visit a local health clinic on a regular      basis. Other volunteers served as translators in the clinic.      These services may have raised the number of workers who      receive preventive care, and the eventual cost-savings of      such preventive care to taxpayers could be measured, Jastrzab      concluded, but documenting it could be costly and would      require a separate study.       Nevertheless, after comparing operating costs to the value      of service provided and the gain in participant earnings in      the 15 months following service, Jastrzab and her colleagues      estimated that each hour of service youth corps members      performed resulted in $1.04 more in benefits than it cost to      employ them.       Evaluators have come up with similar cost-benefit ratios      for other AmeriCorps programs. Researchers from the Northwest      Regional Educational Laboratory found that every federal      dollar invested in two Washington state AmeriCorps projects      yielded a return up to $2.40 in benefits. University of      Minnesota researchers found benefits up to $3.90 for each      federal dollar put into several Minnesota AmeriCorps      projects. CNS officials say such figures show taxpayers are      getting bang for the bucks AmeriCorps spends.       CNS officials have also compiled lists of AmeriCorps      project accomplishments. The San Mateo, Calif.-based research      firm Aguirre International studied the program's first year      of service and put together a list of beneficiaries, which      included 10,000 children who were escorted to school through      safe corridors, more than 1,000 teen-agers who received      counseling about drug and alcohol abuse, more than 700      families who were able to move into new or refurbished homes,      apartment units or shelters, and more than 1,200 people with      AIDS who received services.                            Tracking Results       But whether this laundry list of good deeds translates into      long-term impact is another story. AmeriCorps participants,      says Lance Potter, director of evaluation at CNS, ``are      people who are out there to solve the problem of homelessness      or to teach every child to read. They don't have goals that      you can reach in a year.''       However, social scientists say that the long-term effect of      service programs can be     measured through studies that track, for example, literacy      rates in areas where AmeriCorps members serve as reading      tutors. Such studies are being designed, Potter says. In      September, research firm Aguirre International is slated to      issue a report on the long-term impact of AmeriCorps'      programs.       Tracking the benefits of service work on the people who      join AmeriCorps is also a challenge. As with gauging a      project's community impact, economists and social scientists      have yet to slap a price tag on boosting participants' self-     esteem, raising their job aspirations, or increasing the      likelihood that they will volunteer in the future.       Adding another wrinkle to measuring benefits to      participants is AmeriCorps members' demographics. Programs      such as the Youth Corps recruit mostly among disadvantaged      youth. When comparing kids who participate in Youth Corps to      a group of their peers who didn't, gains in educational      attainment or work experience show up clearly. But in      evaluating AmeriCorps members, who are recruited regardless      of socio-economic status and tend to be older, more educated      and better off than Youth Corps members, the benefits to      participants are sometimes less dramatic.       An Abt Associates study of Youth Corps programs found they      did little to boost the incomes or job opportunities of white      male participants when compared to white males who didn't      perform a year of service. Black and Hispanic participants,      on the other hand, made more money and got better jobs than      their non-service counterparts.       The findings reflect a better job market for white males,      says Jastrzab, not a detrimental effect of service. But      without detailed explanation, the finding gave the appearance      of failure.       ``When the findings come around to showing different      impacts on young people by race, then CNS wants to distance      itself from that,'' says Andy Moore, a spokesman for the      National Association of Service Conservation Corps. ``This      study was publicized in spite of CNS, not because of it.''       When there really is bad news about a AmeriCorps-backed      project, it doesn't necessarily mean the project loses its      funding. But projects that show no interest in completing      evaluations at all probably will be cut off, according to      Potter.       After its first year, CNS defunded only 50 AmeriCorps      grantees, and only 20 in its second year. ``We don't want to      be in the business of punishing programs for finding out that      they have shortcomings,'' Potter says. ``If we do that, we      send the message that we don't provide an incentive for them      to look hard at their program and find ways to improve it.''       In order for an outcome-based approach to work ``there must      be consequences,'' argues the Congressional Institute's      Climer. ``Poorly performing programs must be repaired.''      There also have to be rewards for improvements, he says.       AmeriCorps' critics have kept CNS officials keenly aware of      what will happen if the agency doesn't meet their      expectations. This spring, AmeriCorps' congressional critics      were disappointed by what they saw as the agency's lack of      improvement in management practices and cost control, and      renewed threats to kill the program if it doesn't make      significant strides over the next year.       Such threats carry greater urgency in the current climate      of deficit reduction.       ``One of the greatest difficulties that we have is that      [AmeriCorps'] funds compete directly with dollars for federal      housing programs, veterans benefits, the space program,      natural disaster relief and more than a dozen other federal      agencies,'' says David Lestrang, an aide to Rep. Jerry Lewis,      R-Calif, chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee      that has jurisdiction over the CNS budget. ``It all comes      down to a matter of priority. I know this is a priority for      the administration but they have to weigh it against other      priorities. For Congress, the jury is still out on      AmeriCorps.''       ``If you focused entirely on the cost, you could justify      killing any program if you never looked at the benefits,''      counters Waldman.                               Dual Goals       The question of whether CNS' programs are cost-effective      depends largely on how you define its goals.       In the National and Community Service Trust Act of 1993,      the agency's mission is defined as helping ``the nation meet      its unmet human, education, environmental and public safety      needs.'' But President Clinton also sold AmeriCorps as a way      for young people to earn money for college.       Senator Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, a vocal AmeriCorps      critic, doesn't dispute the benefits of its programs. But he      questions whether it is an efficient way to help kids get to      college.       Grassley ``has no problem with the work AmeriCorps      volunteers are doing-it's valuable work,'' says Jill Kozeny,      one of his aides. ``He has a problem with the huge burly cost      structure.''       Grassley has commissioned several General Accounting Office      studies of CNS operations. Two years ago, a GAO study he      ordered concluded that the agency was expending about $17,000      in resources on each AmeriCorps participant. Adding state,      local and private support for the program, GAO pegged average      resources per participant at $26,654. Grassley said this      figure was way too high. He also blasted CNS for giving      grants to other federal agencies and not garnering more      private support for projects.       CNS officials say it's unfair to include other federal,      state, local government, and private contributions when      estimating program costs. But last year CNS chief executive      Harris Wofford said he would implement a plan to require      grantees with above average per-participant costs to lower      them by 10 percent in the next grant cycle. Wofford also      agreed to end funding to other federal agencies, which had      totaled $12 million a year for programs such as WritersCorps,      a tutoring program underwritten by the National Endowment for      the Arts. And he said he would raise requirements for      matching private funds from 25 percent to 33 percent of a      grantee's budgets. Grassley then helped save AmeriCorps      funding for another year.       In March of this year, Grassley and others found more      fodder for discontent in another GAO report on the role of      state commissions in administering AmeriCorps. The report      included costs, attrition rates, and rates of educational      award usage among several AmeriCorps projects. One project,      the Casa Verde Builders Program in Texas, had an attrition      rate of more than 50 percent and cost $2.5 million, half of      which came directly from CNS. Grassley's office estimated      costs for the program at close to $100,000 per participant.       ``We have to look at whether this program is the most cost-     effective way to help people go to college,'' Grassley said      on NBC Nightly News shortly after the report came out.       Wofford protests that AmeriCorps is not simply a      scholarship program, but a national service one as well.       That is exactly what bothers some of AmeriCorps' critics,      who say that the federal government shouldn't be in business      of promoting service. Rep. George Radanovich, R-Calif.,      abhors the idea that AmeriCorps members are in essence ``paid      to volunteer,'' according to one of his aides, Fred Greer.      ``The aim is worthy,'' Greer says. ``But why does it have to      be a public program from the start?"       AmeriCorps supporters counter that federal investment is a      vital catalyst to boosting community service and a necessary      incentive for overworked citizens to volunteer.       Still, even the most ardent AmeriCorps supporters are      starting to concede that the non-government sectors have a      bigger role to play in national service. At the April summit      on service in Philadelphia, Clinton proposed the creation of      50,000 new AmeriCorps Challenge grants that would allow      AmeriCorps to add 33,000 members over five years. The new      grants would only cover the education award; private and      nonprofit organizations would pick up the tab for other      program costs and living expenses.       ``We're extremely open-minded to ideas from all parts of      the political spectrum on how to make national service      work,'' Waldman said in an interview before he left the      agency. ``Outside of Washington, AmeriCorps is much more a      nonpartisan issue.''       Congressional opposition puts CNS officials in a bind,      because they're forced to be accountable for the      effectiveness of projects that they don't directly run, half      of which they don't even choose to fund. ``Congress set it up      this way and if they believe in it they ought to take it      seriously,'' Waldman said. ``It puts us in a ridiculous      position: Congress wants us to not have any control but hold      us accountable.''                          ____________________
