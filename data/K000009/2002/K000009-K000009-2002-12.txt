Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I would like the record to show that I am assuming this responsibility for the next 30 minutes only in that the rules do not allow the gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. Abercrombie) to remain on the floor for more than 1 hour. He is present in the Chamber and right here at my side. We will continue paying tribute to our beloved friend, Congresswoman Patsy Mink, and send our sympathies to her precious family.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lofgren).
