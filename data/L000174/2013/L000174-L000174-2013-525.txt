                              Exhibit 1                   [WCAX--Vermont, January 28, 2013]               U.S. Marshals making an impact in Vermont                         (By Jennifer Reading)       Burlington, VT.--Five faces represent Vermont's most      wanted. Two have been caught, but the remaining three      fugitives are prime targets for the U.S. Marshals Service.       ``It's a real good area to attack to make our communities      safer here in Vermont,'' said David Demag, who was appointed      by President Obama to head the U.S. Marshals Service's      Vermont Division.       Three months ago he created the Vermont Violent Offender      Task Force. The operation expanded the Marshals' mission to      include tracking down violent and habitual sex offenders.      Statistically--these criminals pose a greater risk to the      public. ``The ones who are out of compliance top that list      and are more likely to re-offend,'' Demag said.       Demag said dedicating a full time team to taking down non-     compliant sex offenders--on top of its regular fugitive      finding mission--meant adding a state trooper and a UVM      police officer to the task force. But he said the plan is      working. Since October they've arrested 39 federal and 40      state fugitives. In 2012 fugitive arrests for state offenses      jumped by 70 percent. ``This is not a place where fugitives      or sex offenders can come and hide,'' said Chief Deputy U.S.      Marshal Bill Gerke.       That's the message the task force sent to three high      profile out-of-state fugitives on the run in Vermont. The      Marshals found Philip Barr hiding out in Hardwick. He was      wanted for a Florida murder. Robert Mulkern was arrested in      Windsor for a Maryland sex assault and 149 counts of child      pornography. And Clifford Moore was nabbed on his way to the      airport, fleeing murder, sex assault and terrorism charges.      Although the task force gives priority to federal fugitives      identified as the ``worst-of-the-worst,'' they'll also adopt      state and local cases if there's a violent component to the      crime. The Marshals have the tools, expertise and time that      their state counterparts lack. ``We are here as a resource      for them,'' Demag said.       Two weeks ago they helped local authorities locate Shane      Phillips, a Johnson man wanted for more than a decade for      various violent crimes. He was hiding behind a false wall in      his family's home. ``The spirit and the actual cooperation      has never been better than it is presently,'' Gerke said. The      life-long Deputy Marshal said interagency cooperation is the      key to slowing down the state's ongoing violent crime and      preventing out-of-state organized crime from getting a      foothold in Vermont. ``Vermont will not harbor that type of      activity,'' he added.       The task force is funded by the federal government. Assets      seized from the criminals are then reinvested in state and      local law enforcement--paying overtime if they help with      compliance checks--as well as outfitting them with critical      safety equipment and vehicles.                          ____________________
