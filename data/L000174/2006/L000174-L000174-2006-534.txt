President, today the Senate turns its attention again to comprehensive immigration reform. I hope we can finish the job the Judiciary Committee started in March and the Senate began considering in April. We need to fix the broken immigration system with tough reforms that secure our borders and with reforms that will bring millions of undocumented immigrants out of the shadows.  I commend the majority and minority leaders for continuing to search for a procedural agreement, even though Republicans blocked action on a comprehensive solution by filibustering before the April recess. Democrats supported the bill that was reported by the Judiciary Committee, and we were willing to support the Hagel-Martinez compromise. In fact, Democrats voted twice in two days for comprehensive reform, but the Republican leadership refused to follow the commitments it made when the cameras were on, and folded its tent by declining to support cloture even on the motion of the Republican leader.  I hope that when the President speaks to the Nation this evening, he will strongly encourage his party to support a comprehensive bill in the Senate.
