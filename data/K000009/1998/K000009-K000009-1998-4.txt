Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I rise in support of this conference report on H.R. 4101, which is the 1999 appropriations bill for Agriculture and Related Agencies.  Mr. Speaker, I want to say how pleased we are today also that our fine and distinguished colleague, the gentleman from the State of Texas (Mr. Henry Gonzalez), is here for this debate, and how very much we enjoy working with him on every single issue that comes before the Nation.                              {time}  1445  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend our chairman, the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Skeen), and as well as all the members of our subcommittee, and the committee staff, Tim, Sally, and Bobby, for their outstanding leadership in helping us put this bill together.  Without question, it keeps our Nation at the leading edge for food, fiber, fuel, and forest production as well as research, trade, and food safety. Really a full plate. Our bill contains this year $55.88 billion in total budget authority for the fiscal year 1999, where the clock has already begun running, of which $13.65 billion is for discretionary programs, with the vast majority, $42.2 billion, for mandatory programs.  Over two-thirds of this bill's spending, in fact, is dedicated to mandatory programs, largely the nutrition programs, like the school lunch and the school breakfast programs and the food stamp program, which comprise nearly 70 percent of all the funding incorporated in this measure.  Now, this is a balanced bill that attempts to address the needs of farmers, food and drug safety, rural community development, consumers, and those in our population most nutritionally at risk. The chairman has fashioned a bill with our committee that is the best possible bill within the allocation that we were all dealt.  I have to say, I appreciate the bipartisanship and sensitivity of the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Skeen) to balancing the burden of these tight funding levels between various constituencies served by our bill, Members who may represent Bronx, New York, all the way to the southern third of New Mexico and Arizona. So we have a very diverse committee and a very diverse Congress.  I would be remiss if I did not point out that there remains a veto threat on this bill because of the level provided for disaster assistance in agriculture. I would hope that there would be another opportunity for this Congress to perhaps incorporate additional disaster assistance in an omnibus supplemental appropriations bill.  Funding levels are also still well below the administration's request for several of our most critically important programs in this bill. For example, in the area of food safety; the Women, Infants, and Children's feeding program; our conservation program, so important to today and tomorrow; youth tobacco prevention; all of the rural water and sewer needs that each of us knows so well from our respective States, and certainly The Emergency Feeding and Assistance Program known as TEFAP.  Without an additional allocation of resources, we continue to betray our commitment to American farmers and to all consumers who benefit from the bounty that our farmers produce.  I am going to reference a few of the major points in the bill right now, beginning with disaster assistance.  Mr. Speaker, there is a real crisis facing most American farmers in rural communities today, and many have been unduly affected by the drought and other extreme and unusual weather conditions. Some are suffering the impact of repeated crop disease year after year, and others have been impacted by very low farm prices, falling farm prices, and increasing inability to obtain credit at prices that really work on the balance sheet.  While the rest of the country may be experiencing economic recovery, thousands and thousands of farm and ranch families, certainly so many of our dairy farmers that the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey), our ranking member, has so eloquently represented in these debates, and the communities that depend on them have been left behind. The gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Johnson) just talked about that a bit earlier during the debate on the rule.  I am pleased that we were able to provide over $4 billion in emergency assistance to farmers in this conference report, but I remain concerned that this level of funding still remains insufficient to deal with the magnitude of the real farm crisis facing this country. We must keep in mind that this bill will provide only a 1-year fix and that prices are projected to be low again next year.  In fact, at a meeting earlier today, one of our Ohio members told me he had taken his third cutting on hay and alfalfa. That is terrific, except it means that prices are going to continue to go down. Farmers need a long-term safety net and we may need to look to other options for assistance in the future.  Let me move on to the area of food safety. Each year over 9,000 Americans die, that is 9,000, die in this country and another 33 million become ill from food-borne pathogens. Currently less than two-tenths of 1 percent, less than 1 percent of imported produce is being inspected for pathogen contamination.  This bill provides a $51 million increase for the President's Food Safety Initiative, and we thank the administration for that initiative, with $20 million targeted to import inspection through our Food and Drug Administration. This will go a long way toward bolstering our Nation's food safety inspection and research efforts to assure that our food and produce are of higher quality.  I regret, however, that the conferees were unable to adopt country-of-origin labeling for produce and meat, specifically beef and lamb, which we feel is so important for our people to know where their food is coming from. Consumers have a right to know where the food that they eat originates from.  Let me move on, finally, to the area of derivatives and say I remain concerned about a provision in the bill that places a moratorium on the ability of the Commodity Futures Trading Corporation to regulate over-the-counter derivatives.  We have all seen in the recent headlines the default and bailout of the company called Long-Term Capital Management, which in essence was a hedge fund. They play in the area of risk with no assets. Many of the Members in this Chamber may already know about this situation. An emergency financial rescue of over $3.5 billion was hurriedly put together by the Federal Reserve and several New York banks on behalf of a very few large financial institutions and wealthy individuals.  In effect, the largest banks in this country, who lent organizations money to invest in these hedge funds, are at risk because their fundamental deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which means the taxpayers of this country, because our Nation guarantees bank deposits up to $100,000. That creates the risk pool for insurance, and they are going to be faced with drawing on it very heavily if they are not able to make whole the people who play in those markets.  This federally backed rescue involved Long-Term Capital Management from Connecticut, which was not even regulated by the Federal Government. Yet the package put together was a Federal package. In essence, the taxpayers of America are becoming the insurance company of last resort for a handful of very high risk takers, institutions and individuals that are involved in the highest stakes game and are completely over-leveraged in the international markets.  Mr. Speaker, where are we, where is this Congress and where is our government when it comes to helping out all of the people of this land, including our farmers who are strung out, many of them, to their very last acre?  I find it ironic that this conference report includes nearly $4 billion in emergency assistance for America's farmers, barely much more than is being provided to some of America's wealthiest individuals and largest institutions connected to long-term capital management. It is an interesting ratio to think about.  Drought and floods and deteriorating world markets are ravaging America's farm sector. Our dairy farmers arebeing wiped out one after another, and regularly we see on television incidents and acts of God beyond the control of those who are making a living, a hard and difficult living, off the land. Thousands and thousands of farmers and farm families and ranchers are looking to us for this much needed assistance.  Those who speculate on financial trends, those who take major risks and never get their hands dirty, based on which direction currency and commodity prices will go, are taken care of in an instant. One could say that they are bailed out in less than a New York minute by the New York Fed's intervention.  In closing, I want to express my appreciation to the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Skeen) again for putting together the best bill that we could under the circumstances.  Let me just reiterate my continuing concern that we have not been able to provide in this bill country-of-origin labeling on meat, especially beef and lamb. Also, our hope to provide some certainty in the market, for mandatory price reporting in the livestock area, which would be such a simple thing for us to do, it was not included in this legislation. Those are shortcomings in this bill that we hope to overcome in future years.  Overall, it is a good bill. It is worthy of the Members' support.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
