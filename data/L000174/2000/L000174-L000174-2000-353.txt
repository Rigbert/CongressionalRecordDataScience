President, I do not want to conclude this debate without, again, acknowledging the commitment to crime victims of the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from California. I know that they are sincere in their support for crime victims. I compliment them as well for the manner in which they have conducted themselves throughout this debate and throughout the Judiciary Committee's work on this matter. I view them not as opponents but as allies in our mutual efforts to assist crime victims.  I also want to acknowledge the extraordinary efforts of the senior Senator from West Virginia and the thoughtful guidance of the Democratic Leader. Senators Dorgan, Durbin, Schumer, Dodd, Moynihan, Feingold, Murray, Thompson, Wellstone, Levin, and Bingaman each contributed greatly to the debate.  I thank Senators from both sides of the aisle--Senators who supported preserving the Constitution and those who supported the proposed constitutional amendment. I commend the Senate for doing its duty and upholding the Constitution and Bill of Rights.  I would also like to thank Rachel King and her colleagues at the ACLU; Sue Osthoff, Director of the National Clearinghouse for the Defense of Battered Women; John Albert, Public Policy Director of Victims Services; Donna Edwards, Director of the National Network to End Domestic Violence; Renny Cushing, Director of Murder Victims' Families for Reconciliation; Arwen Bird; Scott Wallace; Beth Wilkinson; Emmet Welch; and Professor Lynne Henderson. As always, I thank my staff, as well as the hard-working staff of our distinguished Democratic Leader.  Finally, my special thanks to Professor Robert Mosteller of the Duke Law School, who has given so generously of his time, over many years, to many of us on the Judiciary Committee and in the Senate. Professor Mosteller is a leading scholar in this field, and his expertise and counsel have been invaluable.
