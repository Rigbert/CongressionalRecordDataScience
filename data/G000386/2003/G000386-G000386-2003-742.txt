  Mr. McCAIN. I have the same concerns as articulated by the chairman of the Subcommittee on Aviation of the Commerce Committee, Senator Lott. I know he and I would both be willing to look into this situation.  We are in great sympathy for the entire airline industry. United Airlines is in bankruptcy. They have similar problems.  As far as this giving any leeway is concerned, it says right here:       . . . funding rules [for certain plans] shall apply for any      plan year beginning after December 31, 2002, in the case of a      defined benefit plan. . . .  Then it goes on to describe USAir.  Then later on it says:       . . . the minimum funding requirements under this paragraph      shall be the requirements. . . .  This is clearly a mandate. There is no flexibility in this. We all know what ``shalls'' mean in appropriations bills.  I am in sympathy for the entire airline industry. That is why the first hearing we had in the Commerce Committee was on the status of the airline industry. CEOs of these industries came before us. They are in bad shape. They are in very bad shape. They are hemorrhaging hundreds of millions of dollars every year.  USAir is in bankruptcy. United is in bankruptcy. Others border on bankruptcy. This needs to be viewed in the context of the entire airline industry. As much sympathy as I have for USAir, I don't think we can do something such as this at this particular time on an omnibus appropriations bill.  I want to commit to the Senator from Pennsylvania, I appreciate his dedication to the people of Pittsburgh and to the people who are employed by USAir, and I look forward to working with him.
