 President, if you like your health plan, you can keep it. It is a nice sound bite, isn't it? It is also not true. My constituents have learned that the very hard way.  A constituent from Perry, IA, wrote:       My husband and I are farmers. For nine years now we have      bought our own policy. We recently received our letter that      our plan was going away and effective Jan 1, 2014 it will be      updated to comply with the mandates of ObamaCare.       We did not get to keep our current policy. We did not get      to keep our lower rates. I now have to pay for coverage that      I do not want or will never use.       We are the small business owner that is trying to live the      American dream. I do not believe in large government that      wants to run my life.  This failed promise is hitting home but, more importantly, when the President promises something and doesn't keep that promise, it goes way beyond a promise to hurt an individual. It goes to the lack of credibility of all government. What we need to be doing in this country is building up credibility of government to strengthen our institutions of government.  I yield the floor.
