President, I move to reconsider the vote.  Mr. McCONNELL. I move to lay that motion on the table.  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.  Mr. McCONNELL. If I may give a status report on behalf of Senator Leahy and myself.  We have disposed of 24 amendments. There are two that have been laid aside that will be dealt with later. Senator Leahy and I are aware of only 12 left, of which 3 may need rollcalls. One of the three has a time agreement, and that is, of course, the amendment of the Senator from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan, which I believe is triggered under a previous unanimous-consent agreement at this point.
