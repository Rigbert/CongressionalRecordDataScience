President, I rise today to honor a constituent, Terrence M. McDermott, executive vice president and chief executive officer of the National Association of Realtors, and congratulate him on his retirement.  Born and raised on the West Side of Chicago, Mr. McDermott attended Loyola University in Chicago and the National College of Education in Evanston, IL.  Before serving as CEO for the National Association of Realtors, Mr. McDermott gained nearly 30 years of experience in publishing and media. He also served as the executive vice president and chief executive officer of the American Institute of Architects and on the board of the American Architectural Foundation.  In addition to his many professional accomplishments, Mr. McDermott possesses a lifelong love of politics instilled by his family. Politics were routinely discussed around the dinner table, and Mr. McDermott worked as a volunteer on Senator Paul Douglas's last campaign before he could even vote.  Mr. McDermott is also an avid hunter and fisherman and plans to spend his retirement expanding his extensive decoy collection. Mr. McDermott and his wife Sue Ann recently celebrated their 39th anniversary and have two children, Matthew and Patricia.  I congratulate Mr. McDermott on his many accomplishments throughout his long and successful career, and I wish him many more years of happiness and accomplishment in retirement.                          ____________________[Page S10289]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                     HONORING TERRENCE M.
