Speaker, I rise today to bring to the attention of my colleagues a situation that threatens to upset the Middle East peace process. Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat has reportedly invited leaders from throughout the world to participate in a weekend conference, supposedly to discuss ways to move the peace process forward.  While Mr. Arafat has invited diplomats from the United States, Japan, Egypt, Jordan, and Europe to participate in this conference, conspicuously absent is an invitation to the country of Israel.  How can a meeting supposedly designed to discuss ways to facilitate peace in the Middle East not include Israel? Obviously, it cannot. Any serious attempt to move the peace process forward should--and must--include Israel.  It does not take a scholar of Middle Eastern history or politics to know that Israel is integral to the region's future, as well as the success of the peace process itself. Excluding Israel from this proposed conference can only be seen as an attempt to fracture the world community's support for Israel and marginalize Israel's role in the peace process.  The United States must not let itself be manipulated in this way. I applaud President Clinton's efforts to bring peace to the Middle East, but we are at a very delicate point in the process, and we must be extremely careful about how we proceed. A primary tenet of the Oslo Accords is that peace negotiations should take place between Israel and Palestinian authorities. Allowing Mr. Arafat to make an end-run around Israel by excluding it from this meeting violates the principles of the Oslo Accords and poses a serious threat to the peace process.  Mr. Speaker, Yasir Arafat's call for a Middle Eastern peace conference is empty without the direct and meaningful participation of Israel. If the United States allows this conference to go forward in its current form, we will be doing irreparable harm to the peace process. Therefore, I urge you and my other colleagues to join me in calling on Yasir Arafat to include Israel in this weekend's meeting or to withdraw United States participation in this one-sided and counterproductive conference.                          ____________________
