 President, I rise today to introduce the ``Class Action Fairness Act of 2001.'' I am pleased to be joined by Senators Kohl, Hatch, Carper, Thurmond, Chafee and Specter. The Class Action Fairness Act of 2001 will help curb class action lawsuit abuses and protect consumers who find themselves as potential members of class action lawsuits. At the same time, the bill will preserve class action lawsuits as an important tool that brings representation to the unrepresented.  In the last Congress, Senator Kohl and I introduced S. 353, the ``Class Action Fairness Act of 1999.'' We worked diligently and in good faith to address concerns expressed by members of the Judiciary Committee, as well as others interested in this issue. The Judiciary Committee marked up and favorably voted out a Hatch/Grassley/Kohl amendment in the nature of a substitute. Unfortunately, S. 353 was not considered by the full Senate in the 106th Congress because of the press of other legislative business.  Today, we are introducing the bill that the Senate Judiciary Committee agreed to in the last Congress, with minor modifications. We have also included a few more provisions that will better protect class members. I am hopeful that in this Congress, the Senate will consider this bill promptly and enact the much needed changes to the current system.  Presently, the class action system is awash with problems. More and more class action lawsuits are being filed to the benefit of attorneys, where attorneys agree to settlements that give them huge fees while their clients get little of value or nothing. A 1999 Rand Report on class actions found that state courts often give most of the money in a settlement to the lawyers, not the class members they supposedly represent. The Judiciary Committee held hearings where we heard about settlement after settlement where class members got coupons or nothing, but the lawyers got millions of dollars in attorneys' fees. We heard about class members being awarded restrictive coupons for airline tickets, as well as class members who received a lawyers' bill that was higher than the compensation for their injury. But the lawyers got all the money in fees.  Is this fair? I thought the lawyers were supposed to represent their clients, not themselves. I am not saying that attorneys should not be paid for their work, but it seems to me that lawyers have found class actions to be an easy way for them to make money.  The Judiciary Committee also heard that lawyers game the class action rules to keep class actions in certain State courts, particularly courts that are quick to certify a class without adequately considering the interests of all class members or courts that aren't careful in evaluating whether the proposed class meets the required class criteria. Those State courts are also more likely to rubber-stamp settlement proposals without scrutinizing them for fairness. For example, we learned that in some cases members of a class that lived closer to the courthouse in which the settlement was filed got a larger recovery than others. We also learned about settlements where a bounty was paid to class representatives which was disproportionately larger than that provided to absent class members.  It's easy for lawyers to forum-shop and keep these cases in State court, for example, attorneys name irrelevant parties to their class action suits in an effort to destroy diversity. Attorneys make inaccurate statements about the jurisdictional amount to keep the defendant from transferring the case to Federal court, but then retract them one year later when removal is barred. In addition, similar class actions are filed in many State courts and cannot be consolidated, increasing the chances for collusive settlements or situations where there is a ``race to settlement'' by the attorneys. This also creates significant inefficiencies and waste of court resources.  A much more troublesome effect of this problem is the fact that State courts are making decisions for the entire country. The 1999 Rand Study and a more recent study by the Manhattan Institute found that most of the increase in class action lawsuits is occurring in State courts. With this happening, basically State courts are dictating national policy. Class actions are usually the cases that involve the most people, the most money, and the most interstate commerce issues. But it is clear that these cases really belong in Federal court. And there is a constitutional basis for this. Article 3, section 2 of the Constitution states that controversies between citizens of different States should be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal courts. However, the present Federal jurisdiction statutes were originally enacted over a century ago, so they do not take the modern day class action into account and basically exclude them from the Federal court system.  Consequently, the current system produces aberrant results as to what can or cannot proceed in Federal court. For example, right now, a slip and fall case worth $75,001 involving two residents from different States can be heard in Federal court. But a nationwide class action that involves millions of citizens residing in all 50 States, that seeks billions of dollars in damages, implicates the laws of every State, and involves interstate commerce issues, is mainly confined to the State courts. Why should a State county court with an elected judge decide these cases, but not a Federal judge?  By only allowing State courts to hear nationwide class actions, State courts can dictate national policy or improperly impose their State's laws on the citizens of other States. Let me illustrate this serious problem with the State Farm case. In a large class action case brought against State Farm on the issue of auto insurers' use of ``aftermarket'' auto parts in automobile repairs, an Illinois court applied Illinois auto insurance law to the other 49 States. Several State attorneys general intervened in the case and expressed their opposition to the court's application of Illinois law to their citizens. The National Association of State Insurance Commissioners and Public Citizen also expressed concern over the outcome of this case. The reason for this opposition was because State laws and policy on the use of aftermarket parts varies widely State by State, yet the Illinois State court imposed its auto insurance laws on the other States. The ability of a State court to have such a monumental impact on the laws of other States, by basically overturning national policy and the laws or regulations of the other 50 States is more than troubling.  So, there are compelling reasons for us to take remedial steps regarding the class action system. The Class Action Fairness Act of 2001 takes a good first step at addressing some of the problems we have identified. To address the problem of class members not knowingwhat is going on in a class action or settlement, or not being clear as to what their rights are, the Class Action Fairness Act of 2001 has a provision that notice to class members needs to contain an explanation of their rights and other matters concerning settlement terms, including attorneys' fees, in a plain and easy to understand language.  To address the problem where class members get nothing and attorneys get millions, the Class Action Fairness Act of 2001 provides that notification of any proposed settlements must be given to the State attorneys general or the primary regulatory or licensing agency of any State whose citizens are involved. This is so that the State attorney general or responsible agency can intervene in the case to ensure that settlements are fair. To address the problem of special bounties that unfairly impact the absent members of a class, the bill contains a new provision that would prohibit the payment of bounties to class representatives that are disproportionately larger than that provided to absent class members. To address the problem of discrimination between class members based on geographic location, the bill contains a new provision that prohibits courts from approving settlements that award some class members a larger recovery than others based on geography.  To start responding to the issue of outrageous attorneys fees, the Class Action Fairness Act of 2001 asks the Judicial Conference to report back to Congress in a year after studying attorneys' fees in class actions and how judges can do a better job in making sure that class action settlements are fair. The bill also includes new provisions that protect class members against net losses and require the courts to make specific findings as to the fairness of coupon and other non-cash class action settlements.  To respond to the problem where plaintiff lawyers game the system to improperly keep class action cases in State court, or where similar class action suits are being filed in different State courts, or where State courts are imposing their laws on citizens of other States and formulating national policy, the Class Action Fairness Act of 2001 loosens diversity and removal requirements so that class action cases with national ramifications can be heard in Federal courts and similar class actions can be consolidated. The bill is crafted so that it will not harm federalism or deprive State courts of their ability to adjudicate cases for their own citizens. That is because there is a constitutional basis for class actions to proceed in Federal court. Clearly, the Federal courts are a better forum for these kinds of cases that are of nationwide importance.  In conclusion, there is substantial evidence that class action abuse is going on and we should do something about it. I think that the Class Action Fairness Act of 2001 is a good, balanced bill that addresses some of the problems that we've identified. Moreover, there has been a lot of compromise to address concerns about the bill. We have also improved the bill by adding additional consumer protections. So, the Class Action Fairness Act of 2001 will preserve the class action process, but put a stop to the more egregious abuses in the system.  In addition, I'd like to thank my friend Senator Kohl, who has worked so closely with me over the years in bringing the issue of class action abuse to the forefront. We both share a deep concern over protecting the rights of consumers, while making sure that the due process rights of all litigants are preserved. I'd also like to thank Senator Hatch, who worked with us to move this bill forward in the Judiciary Committee last year, and worked on improvements to the bill.  I urge all my colleagues to join Senators Kohl, Hatch, Carper, Thurmond, Chafee and Specter in supporting this important piece of legislation.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1712       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; REFERENCE; TABLE OF CONTENTS.       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Class      Action Fairness Act of 2001''.       (b) Reference.--Whenever in this Act reference is made to      an amendment to, or repeal of, a section or other provision,      the reference shall be considered to be made to a section or      other provision of title 28, United States Code.       (c) Table of Contents.--The table of contents for this Act      is as follows: Sec. 1. Short title; reference; table of contents. Sec. 2. Findings and purposes. Sec. 3. Consumer class action bill of rights and improved procedures               for interstate class actions. Sec. 4. Federal district court jurisdiction for interstate class               actions. Sec. 5. Removal of interstate class actions to Federal district court. Sec. 6. Report on class action settlements. Sec. 7. Effective date.      SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:       (1) Class action lawsuits are an important and valuable      part of the legal system when they permit the fair and      efficient resolution of legitimate claims of numerous parties      by allowing the claims to be aggregated into a single action      against a defendant that has allegedly caused harm.       (2) Over the past decade, there have been abuses of the      class action device that have--       (A) harmed class members with legitimate claims and      defendants that have acted responsibly; and       (B) undermined public respect for our judicial system.       (3) Class members often receive little or no benefit from      class actions, and are sometimes harmed, such as where--       (A) counsel are awarded large fees, while leaving class      members with coupons or other awards of little or no value;       (B) unjustified awards are made to certain plaintiffs at      the expense of other class members; and       (C) confusing notices are published that prevent class      members from being able to fully understand and effectively      exercise their rights.       (4) Abuses in class actions undermine the national judicial      system and the concept of diversity jurisdiction as intended      by the framers of the United States Constitution, in that      State and local courts are--       (A) keeping cases of national importance out of Federal      court;       (B) sometimes acting in ways that demonstrate bias against      out-of-State defendants; and       (C) making judgments that impose their view of the law on      other States and bind the rights of the residents of those      States.       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--       (1) assure fair and prompt recoveries for class members      with legitimate claims;       (2) restore the intent of the framers of the United States      Constitution by providing for Federal court consideration of      interstate cases of national importance under diversity      jurisdiction; and       (3) benefit society by encouraging innovation and lowering      consumer prices.
