 President, I rise today to honor Dr. Emmett O. Templeton of Birmingham, Alabama who recently received the American College of Radiology's (ACR) Gold Medal. Dr. Templeton currently chairs the department of radiology at Montclair Baptist Medical Center in Birmingham and continues to faithfully serve the community.  Dr. Templeton is an extraordinary individual who, as Chairman of the board of Chancellors of the American College of Radiology, made a lasting impression on Members of Congress by his straight-talking style. He served his specialty, radiology, and the nation's public policy in health by dealing with problems head-on and working to find solutions. Dr. Templeton has been an asset to all of us in Congress and is deserving of the ACR Gold Medal which recognizes his marvelous achievements.  In addition, I have included the remarks made in the ACR Bulletin about Dr. Templeton and why he has been awarded the Gold Medal.                       Emmett O. Templeton, M.D.       At 53, Emmett ``Neal'' Templeton, M.D., is one of the      youngest recipients of the ACR Gold Medal. A unique and      talented radiologist, Dr. Templeton is perhaps best known for      his outstanding contributions and dedicated service to the      college. Never one to toot his own horn, Dr. Templeton's      unassuming manner, excellent intermediary talents and astute      guidance have earned him the widespread respect of his peers.      He has played a significant role in the advancement and      success of the ACR and has been an inspiration to many of his      colleagues in the southeast.       An ACR Fellow, Dr. Templeton became actively involved with      the ACR fewer than 15 years ago, yet has served on more than      20 commissions and committees and participated for several      years on many of them. The wide range of committees he has      assisted is a reflection of his avid interest in all aspects      of radiology, including accurate coding, practice matters and      relationships with clinics and hospitals.       ``Neal is an unusually bright and charismatic individual,      which is immediately evident to those he meets. It is the      reason he has so frequently been chosen for leadership,''      says Milton Gallant, M.D., director of radiology at The      General Hospital Center at Passaic in New Jersey.      ``Leadership opportunities, coupled with unusual      statesmanship and hard work, have resulted in his endeavors      being uniformly successful.''       Dr. Templeton has selflessly shared his time and counsel in      ACR leadership roles, beginning as vice chair for the      Commission on Radiologic Practice, The Commission on      Economics, the Committee on State and Economic Legislation of      the Commission on Economics, the Committee on Coding and      Nomenclature and the Commission on Government Relations have      all benefitted from his direction as chair. From 1992 to      1994, he served as vice chair of the Board of Chancellors.      The following two years he served as chairman of the board      while also serving as chairman of the Commission on      Government Relations. In 1996 he was elected ACR president.       Bibb Allen Jr., M.D., one of Templeton's partners at      Birmingham Radiological Group, saw firsthand the sacrifices      Templeton willingly made during his tenure on the Board of      Chancellors. ``Neal spent the vast majority of his personal      time away from the hospital conducting the business of the      college,'' Allen says. ``All radiologists have benefitted      from Neal's leadership and skill.''       Dr. Templeton is also a member of the Radiology Residency      Review Committee, the AMA Practice Expense Advisory      Committee, AMA-CPT Editorial Panel, the Government Relations      Oversight Committee and the Practice Expense Advisory      Committee panel.       His effective management style has made him an accomplished      mediator. He is well known for his concern and support for      technologists, office managers and office staff, recognizing      the importance of their role in the practice of radiology.      According to Barbara E. Chick, M.D., past councilor,      chancellor and vice president of the ACR, ``His availability      to meet with anyone, at any time, to help problem-solve was a      great asset to the field of radiology when the ``turf''      battles were so common.'' Chick adds, ``I believe his keen      insight has been beneficial to many practices in their      marketing and reimbursement activities.''       Templeton has a unique knowledge of radiologic practice and      economic matters. He has been appointed to the boards of HMO      and PPO organizations as a result of the model hospital and      imaging center practices he has demonstrated in his own      practice. One of the highlights of his career was his      stewardship of diagnostic imaging centers as an alternative      to private office or hospital practice. He was an early      expert in this concept during a time when the recognition of      radiologists as ``physicians'' was not unequivocal.       Currently chair of the department of radiology at Montclair      Baptist Medical Center, Birmingham, Ala., Templeton earned      his medical degree from the University of Alabama in 1973 and      completed his internship and residency at the University of      Alabama's hospitals and clinics. Even after achieving the      highest positions in the ACR, he continues to serve the      college and radiology ``in the trenches.''       Michael A. Sullivan, M.D., associate chairman of the      department of diagnostic radiology at Ochsner Clinic in New      Orleans, sums up Templeton's character nicely: ``Neal is a      wonderful individual who is forthright, honest and hard-     working. He exemplifies the term `involved radiologist.'      ''                          ____________________
