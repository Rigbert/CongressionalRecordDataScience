I think the Senator has asked a good question but not the right question. When we fail to appropriate money for an authorized program, we are saying there is a higher priority. We are saying that authorized program may not be as valid or as valuable today as when it was enacted, and we make the choice. The Senator referred to this, and I know he didn't mean to demean the process in saying that I am ``playing the game.'' I don't think I am ``playing the game'' when I do the best I can to help the 12\1/2\ million people I represent. If the Senator ran into a problem--and occasionally Oklahoma has a challenge--I will be there to help him, too. That is the nature of it. We try to represent our States and also do what is good for the Nation.  Secondly, if authorization is broken, as the Senator from Oklahoma says, the obvious answer is, either don't appropriate money for it, or when the appropriations bill comes to the floor, strike it and move the money to another program. You have the right to do that as a Senator. But the fact that the options or choices are out there doesn't mean that every one of them is going to be honored and appropriated.
