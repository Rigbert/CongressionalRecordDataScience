Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Lemon Henry Moses, Jr., a distinguished community leader in Maryland's Fifth District who passed away on December 10, 2014. He was 94 years old.  Lemon Moses made history as the first African-American to serve as Chairman of the Charles County Liquor Board. All of us who knew Lemon saw how deeply devoted he was to his family, his community, and his country. He gave so much of himself to all three, and he will be fondly remembered by the many whose lives he touched across Charles County and Maryland.  After growing up in Savannah, Georgia, Lemon moved to Pittsburgh in his youth and was a singer and tap dancer in a local Vaudeville troupe called the `Kandy Kids,' where he befriended Gene Kelly before he became famous. Attending Howard University in Washington, DC, Lemon studied mechanical engineering, and when World War II broke out, he joined the U.S. Navy and served his country as a sailor in the Pacific Theater of Operations. When the war ended, he began a career with the U.S. Postal Service that lasted forty-four years, where he served in a number of leadership positions.  Lemon became involved in the Civil Rights Movement in 1947, when he worked to integrate his local school district while serving as president of a parent-teacher association. In the Postal Service, he held the role of Eastern Region Vice President for the Postal Service Supervisors and made equal rights a focus of his work there. President Lyndon Johnson later appointed Lemon as an Equal Employment Opportunity Specialist to handle discrimination complaints in Congress. In 1974, he moved to Waldorf, in Charles County, where he became very active in the County's chapter of the NAACP. In addition to a trailblazing service on the Charles County Liquor Board, Lemon also spent five years on the board of directors for what is now the University of Maryland Charles Regional Medical Center and was active in Chapter 3885 of the AARP.  Lemon was a devoted husband, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather. He is survived by his wife of seventy-three years, Elaine Moses, as well as his daughter Yvonne Beatrice Buford and her husband Walter; and his son Mike Moses and his wife Delores. In addition to them, four grandchildren, and eight great-grandchildren, Lemon is survived by a community to which he had devoted so much of his time and energy both before and during his retirement. He was an active member of St. Peter's Catholic Church in Waldorf, where family and friends bade farewell in a moving funeral mass on December 18, 2014.  I join in expressing my condolences to Elaine and to the entire Moses family, and Ithank them for sharing Lemon with all of us for the many years in which he did so much good for the people and communities of Charles County and for our country. As I remarked at his funeral, Lemon Moses was no lemon--he was a peach, a pear, and an apple, and all of our lives were made sweeter because of his.                          ____________________
