The Congressional Budget Office didn't talk about relitigating past votes here in the Senate. They said specifically the deficit was significantly lower than earlier projected, and, on the basis of what I have cited, economic experts of both political parties are saying it is time to look to the long-term challenges, particularly Medicare and taxes. I came today to say that a budget conference would provide that kind of window: the opportunity to look particularly at long-term health care challenges such as chronic care and Medicare.  I see my colleague from the Senate Finance Committee, who knows we have been talking about tax reform, Democrats and Republicans; again, a bipartisan opportunity we could achieve through a conference. I proposed that today, based on the new evidence from yesterday. Regrettably, we can't go to conference because it seems the leader on the other side will only go to conference if we can relitigate the stuff that happened in the Senate which he lost.  I hope colleagues will look at that new Congressional Budget Office report. I hope they will look at the jobs picture, the housing starts, all of which seem to be improving in the short term. I hope they will pay more attention to what economic experts of both political parties are saying, which is we ought to be looking to our long-term challenges--particularly in health care and taxes--with the budget conference between the House and the Senate providing an opportunity to look at that 10-year window. We could do exactly what economic experts of both political parties are talking about. I think it is unfortunate we have not been given that opportunity today and I hope we will be given it in the days ahead.  With that, I yield the floor.
