Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume, just so the body is very clear that we are voting on whether or not to permit abortion on demand in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program.  The Committee on Appropriations wisely included language that would preclude the use of funds under the Federal Employees Health Benefits plan for that, and just to remind Members that just under three-fourths of all of the funding that goes into that health plan comes from the taxpayers, and roughly a quarter of that comes from the premium payers, which, again, is us as well. For that reason, this is a publicly funded abortion scheme.  Just to follow up to what my friend from Maryland said a moment ago, it really is up to the Congress to set it. This is not a collective bargaining issue, and it is up to the Congress to establish the parameters of what this program will look like. That is in the statute. There is nothing out of the ordinary with regards to what we are doing here today.  Let me also remind Members that this pro-life rider was in effect from 1984 to 1993, and it has also been in effect for the last two years.  It has already passed in the other body, and my hope is it will continue so we have no complicity in the killing of unborn children.  I urge a no vote on the amendment Lowey-Hoyer-Morella amendment.
