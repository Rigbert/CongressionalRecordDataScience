Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. Keating for his amendment. This is long overdue. Collecting those fees and using them for observer coverage is something that should be done.  If I go back to his first amendment, I want to mechanize it and use technology to make sure the fishermen have an opportunity to, I believe, report better.  This is a good amendment. I will be voting for it, and I yield back the balance of my time.
