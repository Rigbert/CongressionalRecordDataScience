President, I could ask for unanimous consent to lock in the order, but I think I can just make a suggestion with the few Senators we have here. I am sure more will come. Senator Bond has a time conflict and would like to be recognized for 10 minutes. Senator Feinstein has been waiting, as has Senator Wyden. And then Senator Collins will come to the floor very quickly, one of the coauthors of the Intelligence Reform Act. If we can have an understanding that that would be the order, I think that would be appropriate.  Also, I ask unanimous consent that the time consumed by any quorum calls be charged equally to both sides.
