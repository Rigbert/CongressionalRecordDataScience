 President, I rise today truly alarmed about the administration's fiscal irresponsibility. In the past 5 years, the President's policies have turned record surpluses into record deficits. Just a few weeks ago, the Department of Treasury announced that this year's budget deficit is the third largest in history at $319 billion.  But, that is not where the bad story ends.  By sleight of hand, the administration continues to use other resources to finance debt, including foreign lenders and Social Security.
