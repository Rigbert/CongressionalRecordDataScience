' But apparently, no one told that to the young men and women of the St. Mary's College sailing team, who won two out of the three legs of the NCAA sailing ``triple crown'' in 2007.  The Lady Seahawks swept the national title in convincing fashion--besting the next closest competitor by 44 points--and leading sailor and Olympic hopeful, Adrienne Patterson, was named female sailor of the year. In the team race, St. Mary's prevailed in a much closer battle, beating a very strong Yale team by a score of 12 to 11. And while the Seahawk sailors fell just short of their goal of winning all three major sailing championships in one year by taking the coed national title as well, they still managed to finish sixth in that leg of the competition and cement their place among the elite sailing teams throughout all of the NCAA.  St. Mary's College had won 10 national titles entering the 2007 season--and its performance in this year's NCAA championships is proof positive its legacy of greatness is not only intact, but growing stronger with each passing year.  Madam Speaker, I rise today to offer my heartfelt congratulations to the 2007 St. Mary's College Seahawks, their fans, their friends and their families. And I wish them all continued success in whatever life holds in store.                          ____________________
