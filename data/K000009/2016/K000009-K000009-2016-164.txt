Speaker, I rise today to recognize the commissioning of the USS John P. Murtha, the new naval vessel named in honor of the late Congressman Jack Murtha, who will fondly be remembered as a decorated combat Marine, statesman, and dear friend to colleagues on both sides of the aisle.  On Saturday, October 8, 2016 in Philadelphia, PA, the Navy's 10th San Antonio-class amphibious transport dock, named the USS John P. Murtha (LPD 26), was commissioned by his beloved widow Mrs. Joyce Murtha and daughter Ms. Donna Murtha.  During his 58 years of service to our nation, 38 in the U.S. Marine Corps and 35 as a Member of U.S. Congress from Johnstown, PA, Rep. Murtha was an indefatigable champion for the Armed Services, rising in 1989 to chair the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. His detailed knowledge of the U.S. military, deep friendships across the various services, respect from his Congressional colleagues on both sides of the aisle, and wry sense of humor drew people to him and made him a highly effective lawmaker. Jack was a father of three children, the first Vietnam War combat veteran elected to Congress, recipient of the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award, and staunch representative of his people. His own wartime experience as a battalion staff officer in Vietnam, where he was awarded the Bronze Star, two Purple Hearts, and the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry, gave him deep insight into the political and military complexities of modern warfare.  An author, From Vietnam to 9/11: On the Front Lines of National Security with a New Epilogue on the Iraq War, he wrote: The Congress--the people's branch of government--has an obligation to make an independent assessment of key foreign policy issues. The way we go about collecting, analyzing, and using intelligence information is one of the most important determinants of our success or failure in world events. Unfortunately, it is a lesson we have had to learn too often, at a heavy price in American blood and treasure. What is certain, is that intelligence must always be used as a tool of statecraft, not as a political tool.  As this ship performs its missions on behalf of the American people, I have full confidence Jack Murtha's patriotic and strong spirit--Semper Fidelis--will be guiding the vessel if it encounters troubled waters as it navigates toward fair winds and following seas.  I include in the Record the remarks of Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi given at the commissioning of the USS John P. Murtha.      PELOSI REMARKS AT USS JOHN P. MURTHA COMMISSIONING CEREMONY       Philadelphia.--House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi      delivered remarks today, October 8, 2016, at the commission      ceremony of the USS John P. Murtha. Below are the Leader's      remarks:       ``Good morning. Thank you very much, Admiral William Moran      for your kind introduction but more importantly, for your      great leadership. As one that grew up in Baltimore, Maryland,      I have a great loyalty to the Naval Academy, so I appreciate      your comments about the Navy--but I had four brothers who      served in the Army so . . .       [Laughter and applause]       ``It is an honor to be with you today, with Secretary      Valdez--please give our regards to Secretary Mabus--to Major      General Christopher Owens--it is a proud day for all of us to      come together for the Navy and the Marine Corps, for the      Commissioning of the USS John P. Murtha.       ``Chairman Murtha--as you have heard--was a legislator of      unsurpassed talents, a soldier of extraordinary courage and a      public servant to the end. Mr. Brady--my colleague,      Congressman Brady is correct: we will never see his light      again.       ``I thank the Murtha family for the opportunity to make      this address today. I appreciate this opportunity to bring      the greetings and congratulations from Jack Murtha's many      friends in the Congress of the United States, on both sides      of the aisle, on both sides in the Capitol and all the way      down Pennsylvania Avenue.       ``I am glad to be with my colleagues--present and former--     the Undersecretary of the Army Patrick Murphy--as he      mentioned, the first Iraq veteran to serve in the Congress--     Congressman Bob Brady, in whose district we are and great      friend of Jack Murtha's, Congressman Keith Rothfus, he      represents the district that Jack represented in Congress,      and as well as Mark Critz, who followed in Jack's footsteps,      and Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky, who is here as well--who      represented Philadelphia in Congress. It is also an honor to      be here with Lieutenant Governor Michael Stack--recognizing      the important role that Pennsylvania and Philadelphia play in      our national security.       ``It is appropriate for us to be here in Pennsylvania to      honor Jack Murtha--a state he loved and was proud to      represent and to serve. In the House Chamber--Congressman Bob      Brady mentioned the `Pennsylvania Corner'--Jack took great      pride that in the House of Representatives, the `Pennsylvania      Corner' was the most bipartisan corner in the Chamber. In the      Chamber, everyone gravitated toward Jack Murtha--Democrats      and Republicans alike.       ``To Brian Cuccias--Brian and the Ingalls shipbuilders,      thank you for the skill, hard work and patriotism of all the      men and women of labor who built this fine ship that enters      service today. And many of you were in Mississippi when Donna      christened the ship. It is wonderful to see so many of you      here today. Thank you. Thank you for making today possible.       [Applause]       ``Commanding Officer, Captain Kevin J. Parker, it was a      privilege to be with you last year in Mississippi at the      Murtha's christening when you were the prospective commander,      and now at this time-honored commissioning ceremony to become      the Commanding Officer--that is when Donna gives the signal.      When Donna gives the signal--we're all waiting for her.       ``And to the sailors and the Marines--the men and women who      will crew this ship over the oceans and perhaps ride it into      battle, take it to humanitarian assistance--to you,     and your families--thank you for honoring our country, all of      us with your bravery and service.       [Applause]       ``It is a joy to be with the family members, as my      colleagues and others have said, Jack's daughter, our ship      sponsor, Donna, his sons John and Pat, grandchildren, nephews      and nieces and others.       ``I send the congratulations and thanks of my colleagues in      Congress to Joyce--Joyce, the love of Jack's life. She and      Jack were both so proud of having this ship named in his      honor but Admiral Joyce was very proud to comment that the      ship that she christened, the USS Bonhomme Richard, was a      bigger ship. Not a competition, though.       ``Service runs deep in Jack Murtha's family from his      brothers, Kit and Jim, to his nephews Brian and Bob--all      proud Marines--and his grandson, Lieutenant Jack Murtha in      the Air Force, and to Jack's wife, Captain Amanda Murtha.       ``Today, as you commission, as we all commission, the USS      John P. Murtha, I want to tell you a little bit about the man      your ship is named for--his legacy of strength, effectiveness      and fidelity. As was mentioned by my colleague, as a child,      John's grandmother told him: `You are put on this earth to      make a difference.' And that's exactly what he did. John P.      Murtha dedicated his entire life to the service of our      nation.       ``Jack Murtha was a fiercely proud Marine, who volunteered      for combat in Vietnam--earning two Purple Hearts and a Bronze      Star. In the end, Congressman Murtha would leave the Corps      with 37 years of service to his name. How proud he was of      that.       ``In the Congress, Chairman Murtha was a formidable      legislator and a towering leader. To watch Jack Murtha      legislate was to observe a master at work. But more      indicative of his character was to watch him communicate,      with our troops in theater, at the Pentagon, and in their      hospital rooms.       ``His experiences in the battlefield of Vietnam was what      fueled his boundless dedication to our men and women in      uniform--with that connection to those warriors he frequently      visited in Washington, across the country and around the      world.       ``A few of us had the privilege of traveling in bipartisan      delegations with Jack--and this one in particular to Kuwait,      a few weeks before the initiation of hostilities into Iraq--     we observed the level of detail with which Jack conversed      with the soldiers, whether it was the comfort of the seats in      their Humvees--how much they could endure as they did their      jobs--responding to their needs, providing body and vehicle      armor and reliable radios--you name it. Again, not just the      big picture, but down to the personal comfort and safety of      our troops.       ``In those moments, Jack bonded with them, sharing his own      personal military experiences, and caring for them really as      a father--as Secretary Murtha said, he treated them as      family. And they returned his respect.       ``We often saw this when he would take groups of us--as Bob      mentioned--take groups of us on regular visits to our wounded      warriors in the hospitals. One day as we were going into one      of the rooms and the nurse came and said, `Hold up. Hold up      for a while.' We wanted to be very respectful and sensitive      to the privacy of the soldiers. But when we walked in to the      room, we saw a young, injured soldier standing at attention      by his bed and saluting Jack Murtha wearing a Pittsburgh      Steelers jersey right after they had won the Super Bowl.       [Applause]       ``That was football but it was very personal with Jack.       ``It is important to note that Jack defined our nation's      strength, not only in our military might--as important as our      military is and the priority that it is--but also our      strength is measured by Jack in the health and well being of      the American people.       ``Chairman Murtha fought for the armed forces--whether it      was for what they needed, for our troops, facilities--but he      also fought to advance scientific research to seek treatments      and cures for breast cancer, prostate cancer, diabetes, and      HIV/AIDS--the list goes on and on. Today, at Walter Reed, the      John P. Murtha Cancer Center carries forward his commitment      to the health of our entire community.       ``John Murtha made a difference--for our national defense,      for our nation's health, for the men and women who wear our      nation's uniform.       ``Commander Parker, as this fine ship comes alive with her      outstanding crew, the strength of the USS John P. Murtha will      embody our nation's promise to stand with you and your crew--     through the storm and the calm, both as you defend democracy      abroad, and when you come home safely. And when our men and      women in uniform come home, Jack wanted them to feel safe as      well.       ``In the military, he always told us: on the battlefield,      we leave no soldier behind. And when they come home, we leave      no veteran behind. So I join all of those saluting our      veterans who are here today. That was a priority for Jack      Murtha.       [Applause]       `` `Semper Fi' was the watchword of Jack Murtha's life. And      always faithful he was: to his principles, to his promises,      to his family and to the nation he loved.       ``As we place the Murtha into active service, we also renew      our pledge to also always be faithful to you--the sailors and      Marines who will board her today, and to every crew who      follows.       ``Like John P. Murtha, each of you has stepped forward and      answered the call to `make a difference'--for our country,      and for the world. Be proud of the legacy that has been      passed down to you, be proud of your ship's namesake and      motto, and be proud of the values you share.       ``May God bless the USS John P. Murtha.       ``May God bless the brave men and women who will serve      aboard it--and the privilege of serving as the first crew for      one of these great ships, who will be transported within it--     and the families who wait for their safe return. You are      family to all of us. You will always be in our prayers.       ``May God bless you and may God bless the United States of      America.''                          ____________________
