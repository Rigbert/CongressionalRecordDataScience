 President, soon we will be voting on a district court nominee. I rise in opposition to the nomination of Jennifer Dorsey. That is for the U.S. district judgeship for the District of Nevada. Before I outline the basis for my opposition, I wish to inform my fellow Senators and the American public regarding facts on judicial nominations.  We continue to hear from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle about how we are obstructing nominees or treating this President differently. Those complaints are without foundation. I will quantify my answer to prove my point. There is no crisis in the manner in which we are confirming nominees. This is all part of a larger strategy to justify breaking the rules of the Senate to change the rules of the Senate.  The fact is that after today the Senate will have confirmed 199 lower court nominees. We have defeated two. That is 199 to 2. Who can complain about that record? The success rate happens to be 99 percent for the nominees sent by President Obama, considered on the floor of the Senate.  We have been doing it at a very fast pace as well. During the last Congress we confirmed more judges than any Congress since the 103rd Congress. That Congress sat from 1993 through 1994. This year we have already confirmed more judges than were confirmed in the entire first year of President Bush's second term.  So far this year we have confirmed 27 judges. If confirmed today, Ms. Dorsey will be the 28th confirmation this year. Let's compare this with a similar stage, which would be President Bush's second term, when only 10 judicial nominees had been confirmed. So we are now at a 28-to-10 comparison, with President Obama clearly ahead of where President Bush was. But somehow we are hearing complaints.  As I said, we have already confirmed more nominees this year, 28, than we did during the entirety of the year 2005, the first year of President Bush's second term, when 21 lower court judges were confirmed. After today only three article III judges remain on the Senate's Executive Calendar; two district nominees and one circuit nominee.  Yet we hear the same old story. Somehow our friends on the other side of the aisle, the Senate majority, the Senate Democrats, cite this as evidence of obstructionism. Compare that to June 2004, when 30 judicial nominations were on the calendar, 10 circuit, 20 district.  I do not recall any Senate Democrat complaining about how many nominations were piling up on the calendar, nor do I remember protests from my colleagues on the other side that judicial nominees were moving too slowly.  Some of those nominees had been reported out of committee more than 1 year earlier and most were pending for months. Some of them never did get an up-or-down vote. The bottom line is that the Senate is processing the President's nominees exceptionally fairly. I do not know why that message cannot get through. It is an excuse to abuse the rules of the Senate to change the rules of the Senate.  President Obama certainly is being treated more fairly in the beginning of his second term than Senate Democrats treated President Bush in the first year of his last term in office. It is not clear to me how allowing more votes so far this year than President Bush got in an entire year amounts to ``unprecedented delays and obstruction.'' Yet that is the complaint we hear over and over and over again from the other side.  I wanted to set the record straight. It is a sad commentary that I have to spend so much time when figures speak for themselves. But I will set the record straight again before we vote on the nomination of Ms. Dorsey.  I have concerns with this particular nominee. I think all Members are aware of the press accounts of campaign contributions which were made at the time this nomination was under consideration. We have not received a full explanation of what happened. Nevertheless, I am concerned about the appearances of these contributions and how such actions might undermine the public confidence that our citizenry must have in the judicial branch of our government.  I also have concerns about Ms. Dorsey's qualifications to be a Federal judge. She has no criminal law experience. She has participated in only six trials, one as a sole counsel, one as first chair, and four as second chair. I am concerned that her lack of experience will be a problem when she gets to the bench.  It is not surprising to me that the American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary gave her a partial ``not qualified'' rating. I am also concerned with her understanding of the proper role of a judge.  While in law school, she wrote a note that praised the Justices who wrote Roe v. Wade. She praised them for the willingness to ``forge ahead to create a just outcome without regard to the usual decisional restraints.'' Then, she said, ``The majority made the just decision and then forced history and stare decisis to fit that decision.''  Ms. Dorsey praised judges who made their decision--and I want to use her words--``without regard to the usual decisional restraints.'' Those words are not the kind of words judges should be using. That is not the kind of judges we want, those who are activist judges who impose their own policy preferences rather than in following enacted law or precedent.  What do we want? We want judges who will be restrained by precedent and by the laws Congress passes. Although Ms. Dorsey said she no longer supports what she once wrote, I am unconvinced she will be able to lay her policy preferences aside when they conflict with what the law dictates she ought to do.  For all the reasons I mentioned above, I cannot support the nominee. I have two news articles that describe the campaign contribution issue I discussed earlier. I ask unanimous consent that those articles be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:            [From the Las Vegas Review-Journal, May 3, 2013]   Donations to Reid-connected PACs Legal, but Don't Seem Quite Right                         (By Jane Ann Morrison)       U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid didn't break laws      when he asked Las Vegas attorney Will Kemp to donate to the      Senate Majority PAC to help elect Democrats in the 2012      cycle.       The senator, a lawyer himself, knew Kemp and Robert Eglet      had won a huge verdict of $182 million from Teva      Pharmaceutical Industries in a case in which large vials of      Propofol were partially blamed for a hepatitis outbreak.       Kemp wasn't new to donating to Reid. He had been a donor to      Friends for Harry Reid in the past 2010 cycle and had given      $4,800. According to opensecrets.org, Kemp's largest donation      in the past three years was for $8,500 to the Democratic      Party of Nevada. And while he leaned Democratic, he also gave      to some Republicans.       However, ethical questions abound about whether Reid's      latest judicial nominee, Jennifer Dorsey, a partner in Jones,      Kemp and Coulthard, could have seen--or hoped to see--her      chances for an appointment enhanced by a series of      contributions from Kemp and his partner, J. Randall Jones.       It's the time line and the size of the amounts that are      creating that sewage smell.       Despite that, Reid said Friday he believed she would be      confirmed by the U.S. Senate.       Check out what happened when:       October 2011: Kemp wins his big Teva case, not his first      big payday as a longtime trial attorney.       Jan. 9, 2012: Kemp donates $8,500 to the Democratic Party      of Nevada, generally considered the party designed to elect      Reid first and foremost and other Democrats as an      afterthought.       Sometime in January or February 2012, according to Kemp's      statements to political analyst Jon Ralston, Reid asks Kemp      and his partners to donate to the Senate Majority PAC. It's      unclear whether his donation to the party fell before or      after Reid's request. Kemp didn't return a call Friday to      clarify the time line.       March 31, 2012: Dorsey donates $2,500 to Friends for Harry      Reid. Sometime that month she expressed her interest in a      federal judgeship. The same day, Kemp contributes $2,500 to      the Friends of Harry Reid.       April 30, 2012: Reid returns her money but keeps Kemp's.       May 1, 2012: The day after Dorsey's money is returned, Kemp      donates $100,000 to the Senate Majority PAC, and law partner      Jones donates $5,000 to the Democratic Party of Nevada.       May 14, 2012: Two weeks later, Jones donates $50,000 to the      Senate Majority PAC.       June 12, 2012: Reid recommends Dorsey to the White House.       Aug. 23, 2012: Jones donates $8,000 to the Democratic Party      of Nevada.       Sept. 19, 2012: She is nominated by President Barack Obama.       Oct. 23, 2012: Jones makes a $10,000 contribution to the      Democratic Party of Nevada.       At a meeting at the Las Vegas Review-Journal on Friday, I      asked Reid to address the perception that the donations were      made for a purpose.       He answered, ``It's too bad that her being a member of that      law firm is causing some problems for her.'' He noted he had      known Kemp for decades. ``He's one of the finest trial      lawyers in the country, and that's not just hyperbole, that's      true.''       Reid went on to condemn the Citizens United decision in      January 2010, which allows unlimited corporate and labor      money in campaigns as independent expenditures. Reid called      it one of the four or five worst decisions in the history of      the U.S. Supreme Court.       Reid said he abides by the rules and does not control the      Senate Majority PAC. He asked Kemp to donate, but PAC      officials dealt with the lawyer after that.       By my tally, based on the Open Secrets website, in 2012,      Kemp and Jones between them gave $150,000 to the Senate      Majority PAC and $28,500 to the Democratic Party of Nevada,      and Kemp gave an extra $2,500 to Friends of Reid, for a total      of $181,000.       In previous years, Kemp and Jones had given but not at that      level.       In 2010, Kemp gave Reid $4,800; Jones gave him $11,700.      Kind of a big jump from $16,500 to Friends for Reid in one      cycle to $181,000 to Reid, the Majority PAC and the      Democratic Party in the 2012 cycle.       That's a lot of Democratic lovin'. Especially for two      lawyers who also pony up for Republicans.       Reid mentioned the nearly $150 million that Las Vegas Sands      Corp. boss Sheldon Adelson had given to elect Republicans in      2012 and how a Rhode Island man made a federal judgeship      though he and his wife donated $700,000 to Democrats since      1993.       While $150,000 sounds like a lot to me, Reid said it's all      relative because the Senate Majority PAC raised more than $60      million.       Reid must be conflicted. He competes successfully at      raising money, whether it's for his own campaign, the party      or various PACs. Yet he says, ``I think this whole campaign      finance thing has gotten way out of hand.''       Later he mused, ``It may not corrupt people, but it is      corrupting.''       Dorsey, 42, said she doesn't talk to reporters. But if she      knew her partners were donating all this money at the time      she was seeking a judgeship (and how could she not know), she      should have stopped it. But then she did donate $2,500 after      asking for the job. Maybe she thought it was expected. Or      maybe the judicial candidate's judgment about perception      isn't so keen.       When her partners had never donated in such large sums      before, it smacks of old-style payola. It may be legal, but      it's not right.       However, I suspect the canny Reid is correct, Dorsey will      get confirmed. Senators of both parties won't want to see      their own donations restricted as they themselves race for      the almighty dollar.                                  ____              [From www.reviewjournal.com, Apr. 26, 2013] Judicial Nominee's Law Firm Gives $150,000 to PAC Linked to Harry Reid            (By Steve Tetreault, Stephens Washington Bureau)       Washington.--As U.S. Sen. Harry Reid was considering Las      Vegas attorney Jennifer Dorsey for a federal judgeship in      May, two senior partners at her law firm made $150,000 in      contributions to a political action committee associated with      the Nevada senator, records show.       While apparently legal, the donations were called      ``problematic'' by a legal expert, who said they could be      perceived as attempting to buy a judicial appointment as      Dorsey's confirmation is pending before the Senate.       Dorsey also made a personal contribution of $2,500 to      Reid's campaign committee in March 2012, shortly after they      initially spoke about her interest in becoming a federal      judge, according to Senate records. Reid returned that      contribution a month later, as he proceeded to check out her      credentials and experience as a litigator.       In June, Reid agreed to recommend Dorsey to the White House      for a post on the U.S. District Court, and she was nominated      by President Barack Obama in September.       Reid in a statement said Dorsey's ``academic background and      courtroom experience speak for themselves. She has great      respect from her peers and colleagues in Nevada and I am      confident she will serve the bench with distinction.''       As Dorsey was being vetted by Reid, senior partners at her      firm, Kemp, Jones & Coulthard, made contributions to Senate      Majority PAC, a super PAC created by former Reid strategists      to elect Democrats to the U.S. Senate. Reid, the Senate      majority leader, and other leading Democrats traveled      extensively last year to raise money for the PAC, which is      co-chaired by a former Reid chief of staff.       Founding partner Will Kemp made a $100,000 contribution on      May 1, 2012, according to campaign finance records. Founding      partner J. Randall Jones made a $50,000 contribution on May      14, 2012.       Reid declined comment on the firm's contributions to the      political action committee. His spokeswoman, Kristen Orthman,      emphasized that Dorsey's personal contribution to Reid's      campaign was returned as the senator weighed her possible      nomination and wanted to avoid an appearance of conflict.       Dorsey did not respond to requests for comment Thursday and      Friday. A secretary at her office said the attorney usually      does not comment to reporters.       Neither Kemp nor Jones responded to calls or to email      queries made through their secretaries on Friday.       Lawyers making contributions to politicians and their      causes is commonplace. Nor is it unusual for lawyers to want      to see friends and legal partners ascend to the prestigious      federal bench.       It's when the two appear to mix that problems can arise,      legal experts said.       ``This feels problematic to me,'' said Charles Geyh, John      F. Kimberling professor of law who teaches and writes on      ethics at the University of Indiana Maurer School of Law.      ``There's no denying a perception problem here. Politically      it seems like a dangerous thing to undertake.''       Carl Tobias, the Williams Professor of Law at the      University of Richmond, cautioned against jumping to      conclusions.       ``I can't draw a cause-and-effect relationship'' between      the partners' donations and Dorsey's nomination, said Tobias,      a former professor at the Boyd School of Law at the      University of Nevada, Las Vegas. ``I think people could ask      whether it appears that they were trying to promote one of      their partners. You'd like to have the answers to those      questions.''       Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nev., declined to comment on Friday. In      recent weeks he has declined comment on Dorsey's nomination,      saying he prefers to let the confirmation process move      forward before saying how he would vote.       This week Heller declined an invitation to appear at      Dorsey's confirmation hearing. Although Dorsey was nominated      in September, only last month did Heller return the customary      ``blue slip'' to the Senate Judiciary Committee, signalling      that he did not object to a confirmation hearing.       Heller and Reid clashed earlier over Clark County District      Judge Elissa Cadish, whom Reid had nominated to a federal      judgeship but whom Heller had blocked over a gun rights      dispute. Heller allowed Dorsey's nomination to proceed a few      weeks after Cadish withdrew her nomination, leading to      speculation that he and Reid had struck a deal.       Dorsey, who turned 42 on Friday, appeared Wednesday before      the Senate Judiciary Committee for her confirmation hearing.      The Las Vegas native obtained degrees from UNLV     and Pepperdine University School of Law. She became a partner      at Kemp, Jones and Coulthard in 2004, where she has      specialized in complex civil litigation.       Dorsey answered questions about her experience and her      approach to the law posed by Sens. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii,      Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, and Mike Lee, R-Utah. The senators      seemed satisfied with her performance, said Tobias, who      watched a webcast of the session.       Dorsey was introduced to the committee by Reid, who called      her a ``fine woman who will be a great addition to the bench      in Nevada. She has really a sterling reputation among her      peers.''       Reid said Dorsey's nomination was in line with his desire      to place more women on the federal bench. If confirmed,      Dorsey would join District Judges Miranda Du and Gloria      Navarro as Reid-backed Nevada federal court appointees.       In 1998, Reid backed attorney Johnnie Rawlinson for a      District Court judgeship in Nevada, and two years later      promoted her confirmation to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of      Appeals.       Dorsey has received a mixed rating from the American Bar      Association's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary, a      15-member panel that rates federal judge nominees on      integrity, professional competence and judicial temperament,      and on a scale of ``well qualified,'' ``qualified'' and ``not      qualified.''       In Dorsey's case, the ABA said a ``substantial majority''      (10-13 members) rated her ``qualified'' while a minority      rated her ``not qualified.''       Reid declined this week to comment on the rating, which      matched ratings for Du and Navarro when they were under      Senate consideration. He had made no secret of his disdain      for the ratings, which he said rely too heavily on prior      judicial service as opposed to ``real world'' qualifications.       In 2010, Reid said the examiners should ``get a new life      and start looking at people for how they are qualified and      not whether they have judicial experience.''
