President, today the Senate has an opportunity to act in a bipartisan manner to end a filibuster against an outstanding nominee to the D.C. Circuit. Caitlin Halligan is an exceptional attorney with the kind of impeccable credentials in both public service and private practice that make her unquestionably qualified to serve on the D.C. Circuit. No one can seriously question her legal ability, her judgment, her character, her integrity, her ethics or her temperament. Those who seek to misrepresent her as a partisan or ideological crusader are wrong and unfair.  Some have mischaracterized her record and distorted her views on executive authority and terrorism. Here is what she said about the 2004 New YorkCity Bar report that some are using to inflame the debate:       I was, frankly, taken aback by [this Report], for a couple      of reasons. First of all, the Supreme Court has clearly said      that indefinite detention is authorized by the AUMF statute.      And so the notion that the President lacks that authority, I      think, is clearly incorrect. I was also a little bit taken      aback by the tone of the report. I think that the issues of      indefinite detention and any issues in the national security      realm are very serious ones, and I think that approaching      those issues as respectfully as possible is the most      productive way to proceed. But the bottom line is that the      report does not represent my work. It does not reflect my      views.  I hope Senators who intend to make this a basis for filibustering this outstanding nominee are listening and understand. Again, she testified: ``[T]he bottom line is that the report does not represent my work. It does not reflect my views.'' This is no basis for opposing the nominee, let alone filibustering her consideration. The report does not represent her views; she flat out rejected them as a statement of law.  During her hearing she testified that she only became aware of the 2004 New York Bar report in 2010 while preparing for her confirmation hearing. She even provided minutes from the City Bar Committee's meetings to show that she was not present and not part of the subcommittee that drafted the report. She rejected the views in the report, saying that it was ``clearly incorrect.'' So while she was one of 37 members of a larger Committee, she was not a member of the subcommittee that drafted the report. She did not participate in the drafting. To filibuster her nomination because of a report she did not write, has not endorsed and has, in fact, rejected, would be a great injustice to this outstanding woman.  New York City's Police Commissioner Ray Kelly wrote in strong support of Caitlin Halligan again this week, saying:       I want to reiterate [my] support, and to stress my      confidence in her commitment to the vigorous prosecution of      our ongoing fight against the threat of terrorism here in New      York City.       Any suggestion that Ms. Halligan would thwart efforts to      protect our nation, and our city, against terrorist threats      is absurd. For over three years, Ms. Halligan has served as      Counsel to the New York County District Attorney. During that      time, she has worked extensively on key anti-terrorism cases,      including most recently the successful prosecution of Ahmed      Ferhani, who pled guilty to very serious charges under New      York State's anti-terrorism statute for a 2011 plot to blow      up Manhattan synagogues and churches.  I ask unanimous consent that the full letter be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my statement. This is not someone soft on terrorism. She has helped bring terrorists to justice. Police Commissioner Kelly is not endorsing someone soft on terrorism. Cyrus Vance, Jr., the New York County District Attorney, is not endorsing someone soft on terrorism.  This is a woman and mother who lives in downtown New York. She was literally blocks away from the twin towers on September 11, 2001. She saw and experienced the devastation of the 9/11 terrorist attack on New York.  By any traditional standard, Caitlin Halligan is the kind of superbly qualified nominee who should be considered and confirmed by the Senate. The Republican leadership's filibuster of this nomination threatens to set a new standard that could not be met by anyone. That is wrong, it is unjustified, and it is dangerous.  It takes only a handful of sensible Senate Republicans to do the right thing. This is not a time to victimize Caitlin Halligan for some sort of political payback or to appeal to narrow special interests. I ask those Republican Senators who care about the judiciary and fairness to come forward, end this filibuster, and ratchet down the partisanship that threatens this institution, our courts and the country.  A Republican Senator, who was a member of the ``Gang of 14'' in 2005, described his view of what comprises the ``extraordinary circumstances'' justifying a filibuster. He said: ``Ideological attacks are not an extraordinary circumstance.' To me, it would have to be a character problem, an ethics problem, so allegations about the qualifications of a person, not an ideological bent.'' Caitlin Halligan has no ``character problem,'' no ``ethics problem,'' and there is no justification for this filibuster. I trust that Senator will apply the standard he articulated and vote to end this filibuster.  Another Republican Senator said just last year in voting to end a filibuster against another circuit court nominee:       [W]hen I became a Senator, Democrats were blocking an up-     or-down vote on President Bush's judicial nominees. I said      then that I would not do that and did not like doing that. I      have held to that in almost every case since then. I believe      nominees for circuit judges, in all but extraordinary cases,      and district judges in every case ought to have an up-or-down      vote by the Senate.       If that Senator remains true to his principles, he will      vote to end this filibuster.  Republican Senators who signed that 2005 memorandum of understanding continue to serve here in the Senate. If they follow the standard set in that agreement, they will vote to end this filibuster. They demonstrated what they thought that agreement entailed when they proceeded to invoke cloture on a number of controversial nominations of President Bush to the D.C. Circuit. If that agreement and standard had any meaning, they should all be voting to end this filibuster.  I urge all those who have said that filibusters of judicial nominations are unconstitutional to end this filibuster. I urge those who said they would never support a filibuster of a judicial nomination to end this filibuster. I urge those who said that they would only filibuster in ``extraordinary circumstances'' to end this filibuster. I urge all those who care about the judiciary, the administration of justice, the Senate and the American people to come forward and end this filibuster.  I yield the floor.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                             City of New York,                                      New York, NY, March 5, 2013.     Hon. Charles E. Schumer,     Hart Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Kirsten Gillibrand,     Russell Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Schumer and Senator Gillibrand: In May 2011, I      wrote to the Senate Judiciary Committee in strong support of      Caitlin Halligan's nomination to the United States Court of      Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. I want to      reiterate that support, and to stress my confidence in her      commitment to the vigorous prosecution of our ongoing fight      against the threat of terrorism here in New York City.       Any suggestion that Ms. Halligan would thwart efforts to      protect our nation, and our city, against terrorist threats      is absurd. For over three years, Ms. Halligan has served as      Counsel to the New York County District Attorney. During that      time, she has worked extensively on key anti-terrorism cases,      including most recently the successful prosecution of Ahmed      Ferhani, who pled guilty to very serious charges under New      York State's anti-terrorism statute for a 2011 plot to blow      up Manhattan synagogues and churches.       As I informed the Senate in 2011, I strongly recommend Ms.      Halligan for the position to which she has been nominated.           Sincerely,                                                 Raymond W. Kelly,                                              Police Commissioner.
