Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 210) supporting the goals of World Intellectual Property Day, and recognizing the importance of intellectual property in the United States and worldwide.  The Clerk read as follows:                              H. Res. 210       Whereas intellectual property is the backbone of our      Nation's economic competitiveness and the only sector where      the United States has a trade surplus with every nation in      the world;       Whereas all nations can use the intellectual property      system to achieve economic growth and cultural development;       Whereas intellectual property plays an important role in an      increasingly broad range of areas, ranging from the Internet      to health care to nearly all aspects of science and      technology and literature and the arts, and understanding the      role of intellectual property in these areas--many of them      still emerging--often requires significant new research and      study;       Whereas World Intellectual Property Day provides an      opportunity to reflect on how intellectual property touches      all aspects of our lives: how copyright helps bring music to      our ears and art, films, and literature before our eyes, how      industrial design helps shape our world, how trademarks      provide reliable signs of quality, and how patenting helps      promote ingenious inventions that make life easier, faster,      safer--and sometimes completely changes our way of living;       Whereas World Intellectual Property Day is an opportunity      to encourage young people everywhere to recognize the      creator, the problem-solver, and the artist within      themselves, because the classrooms of today will produce the      entrepreneurs, the scientists, the designers, and the artists      of tomorrow;       Whereas the over-arching objectives for World Intellectual      Property Day 2005 are to reach out to young people about the      importance of intellectual property, to increase      understanding of how protecting intellectual property rights      helps foster creativity and innovation, and to raise      awareness of the importance in daily life of patents,      copyrights, trademarks, and designs;       Whereas April 26, 1970, was the date on which the      Convention establishing the World Intellectual Property      Organization entered into force;       Whereas in 2000, member states of the World Intellectual      Property Organization established World Intellectual Property      Day to celebrate the contribution made by innovators and      artists to the development and growth of societies across the      globe and to highlight the importance and practical use of      intellectual property in our daily lives; and       Whereas April 26, 2005, has been designated as World      Intellectual Property Day as a time to celebrate the      importance of intellectual property to the United States and      world economy: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That the House of Representatives--       (1) supports the goals of World Intellectual Property Day      to promote, inform, and teach the importance of intellectual      property as a tool for economic, social, and cultural      development;       (2) congratulates the World Intellectual Property      Organization for building awareness of the value of      intellectual property and developing the necessary      infrastructure to help citizens take full advantage of their      own creativity;       (3) applauds the ongoing contributions of human creativity      and intellectual property to growth and innovation and for      the key role they play in promoting and ensuring a brighter      and stronger future for the Nation; and       (4) recognizes that intellectual property continues to face      serious, new challenges, which affect prospects for future      growth of the United States economy.
