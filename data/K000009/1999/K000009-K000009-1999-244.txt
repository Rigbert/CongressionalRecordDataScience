Speaker, I am here today because our American family farmers are suffering. While the general economy is strong, the U.S. agricultural economy continues to experience significant declines in agriculture commodity prices that began over a year ago. The price declines experienced by wheat and cattle producers over the last couple of years have expanded now to all of the feed grains, oil seed, cotton, pork and now the dairy sectors at record all-time lows. Farm income is expected to fall from $53 billion in 1996 to $43 billion next year, nearly a 20 percent decline.  Mr. Speaker, last week I met with a number of farmers just from Ohio. One left me with a letter that I would like to read tonight. It says:       Dear Ms. Kaptur: The purpose of my Washington, D.C. trip is      twofold. Not only am I here today representing Ottawa County,      but as a wife and partner of an Ottawa County farmer. I am      very concerned about the plight of America's farmers. I can      remember as a youngster back in the late 1940s all the      farmers, eight full-time farmers within just 2 miles of here      who lived on our road in northwest Ohio. They had dairy cows,      hogs and chickens. At the present time within that same two      miles there is only one full-time farmer. Since our numbers      are dwindling and the American farmer only makes up 1.8      percent of our population, the American farmer is fast      becoming an endangered species.       I want to know what is going to happen to the American      farmer, and does Washington and our Nation really care? With      the way our grain prices are falling and our costs are      increasing, how is a present-day farmer going to continue and      also encourage new generations to enter the farming      profession? The prices are lower now than during the 1940s.       With the combination of low prices and the loss of      productive agricultural ground to urban sprawl, most farming      operations will cease to exist. Where is our Nation going to      obtain its food? If the United States relies in greater and      greater measure on foreign countries to supply its food      needs, their food checkoff day will surpass the February 9      date.       Since U.S. consumers have never gone hungry, they have no      concept if they lose the American farmer, their safe food      supply could diminish or be completely cut off. How long can      the average American farmer afford to spend $168,000 for just      one piece of equipment?       With the statistics that I am enclosing the American farmer      will not be able to stay in business. Therefore agriculture      will not be one of America's major industries. We are      fighting for our livelihood and need yours and Congress'      help.       Does anybody care? Does anybody even know?           Regards,                                                              Dee.  She also left me with a breakdown of their family farming operation, which I will place in the Record, but basically what it shows is their total production cost last year was $375,000, including what they had to pay for running their land, the cost of producing corn, the cost of producing soybeans and wheat, however their total income was only $317,430, leaving them with a negative income last year of $57,570.  The question to be addressed is how today's or tomorrow's farmer is going to continue to produce food for a Nation in the world if he or she cannot purchase needed equipment and meet the costs of doing business. How many other Americans have to purchase equipment like combines which retail at $211,000 minus dealer discounts equaling about $168,000 less trade-ins on equipment. So that leaves them with about $111,000 to finance for 10 years at 8.75 percent interest for an annual payment of $17,204.                              {time}  1630  How will they continue to make that payment when their negative income prohibits them from showing any profit?  There is an increasing concentration throughout agriculture today. This concentration is severely distorting the market signals that farmers use to know what to produce, when to produce and how to make a profit. This concentration is hurting the marketplace and free competition. These market conditions are deeply hurting our family farms and threatening the economic stability of real communities across our country.  Dee asks, what can we do? First I say Congress, this Congress and this executive branch, must recognize the faces of rural America and understand the crisis out there. We must increase market transparency on prices and we should revisit freedom to farm and provide these farmers who provide our food with the safety net against these kinds of international market manipulations.                          ____________________
