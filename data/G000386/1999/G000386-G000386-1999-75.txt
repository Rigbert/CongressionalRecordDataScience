 No business will be transacted on Friday.  On Tuesday, the Senate will convene and begin processing the appropriations items and various conference reports received from the House.  On Wednesday morning, the Senate will conduct a rollcall vote in relation to the agricultural amendment by Senator Wellstone. Additional votes can be anticipated in an effort to complete the first session of the 106th Congress. Therefore, Senators should adjust their schedules for the possibility of votes throughout the day and into the evening on Wednesday.  I appreciate the patience and cooperation of our colleagues as we attempt to complete the appropriations process and end the first session of the 106th Congress.
