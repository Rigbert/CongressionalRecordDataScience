 President, I rise today to congratulate the Big Basin Redwoods State Park of Santa Cruz County in California on their 100th anniversary.  Established in 1902, Big Basin Redwoods State Park is California's oldest State park. Big Basin Redwoods is the birthplace of the original coastal redwood conservation movement. Today the results of the conservation movement can be seen in the 18,000-plus acres of California redwood forest.  The park has the largest continuous stand of Ancient Coast Redwoods south of San Francisco. Additionally, Big Basin Redwoods State Park is considered by many to be the birthplace of both the park and environmental movement in California.  At the turn of the 20th century, the remaining redwood forests were disappearing at rate that threatened massive destruction of the ancient trees. The only redwood forests left in America ranged from Oregon to Big Sur. Concerned citizens and organizations such as the Sempervirens Club, persuaded then-Governor Henry T. Gage to sign legislation that would set aside land for a redwood park.  Today, the ensuing generations of those environmentally concerned citizens are celebrating the 100th anniversary of the preservation of the California redwood lands. The perseverance and dedication to protecting primeval forest places that the founders of the Big Basin Redwoods State Park exemplified are recognized and celebrated today. Without such dedication to the environmental movement hundreds of forests across the country would have been destroyed.  The Big Basin Redwoods State Park contains both cultural and historical sites of national importance, wildlife habitats, natural ecological preserves, and recreational opportunities for the public. The Big Basin Redwoods State Park is a unique and uncommon place of historical and primeval environmental importance. Therefore, special recognition is deserved on September 13, 2002, the 100th anniversary of its founding.                          ____________________
