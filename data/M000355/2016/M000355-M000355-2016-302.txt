 President, I would like to say a few words about a member of my staff who will soon be leaving. Becky Fleeson, our director of administration, is the embodiment of a servant leader. She is tenacious, she is dedicated, she is loyal, and she cares.  Becky is exactly the type of person you want batting for your team. For nearly a decade, I have been fortunate to have her on mine. Becky is more interested in getting the job done than in taking credit for it. She doesn't back down easily. She can be tough too. That is part of her job description, but if you want to know the truth, Becky is actually a bit of a softie.  She is also a bit of a prankster. Becky is usually someone you would trust with sensitive tasks without a second thought, but on April Fools' Day you can't trust her for a second. Take this year, for example, when Becky tried to convince us she was pregnant. Turned out she actually was and didn't know it at the time. Seems the Guy upstairs has a sense of humor as well.  Well, Becky would tell you her life has never been the same since she and her husband George welcomed little Winnie into their lives. Now they are preparing to welcome Baby Fleeson No. 2 in just a few months.  It has really been something to watch Becky mature over the years, from a fresh-faced college grad to a seasoned professional, honorary Kentuckian, and dedicated wife and mother. When confronted with hardship along the way, Becky has fought through with grace and with strength--and the support of her fellow McTeamers.  I know Becky loves her colleagues, I know Becky loves the Senate, but most of all, I know Becky loves her family. So when Becky told me she was ready to dedicate herself full time to raising her kids, I couldn't have been happier for her. We will all miss her good humor, her work ethic, and her integrity. And later this afternoon, we will look forward to celebrating her.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
