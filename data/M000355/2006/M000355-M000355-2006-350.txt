 President, today, as you just announced, we have a period of morning business. Senators may wish to come to the floor to continue debate on the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security bill. I remind everyone we will have a vote on Monday on the motion to invoke cloture on the energy bill. That is Monday afternoon. Senators should anticipate the vote will occur around 5:30. Again, that is Monday afternoon.
