Madam Speaker, I am pleased to introduce today the Wildlife Without Borders Authorization Act.  The Wildlife Without Borders Program was created administratively by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 1983. The mission of this program is to develop wildlife management and conservation efforts to maintain global species diversity.  While the Congress has already created Multinational Species Conservation Funds to assist highly imperiled African and Asian elephants, Rhinoceros and Tigers, Great Apes and Marine Turtles, this program has provided a funding lifeline to a number of additional endangered species that are not currently eligible for funding, are not considered a megafauna or a flagship species and frankly lack the public attention necessary to generate private financial assistance.  The first conservation grants issued under this program were awarded to the Wildlife Without Borders Program for Latin America and the Caribbean Initiative. Since that time, additional grants have been allocated for projects in Mexico, India, China and the Russian Federation. In fact, in the past two decades, the International Affairs Office within the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has approved 583 conservation projects at a cost of $13 million in taxpayer money. These funds have been matched by $43.7 million in private non-federal money which is a remarkable 3 to 1 matching ratio.  Among the conservation projects that have been approved are funds for the Winged Ambassadors Program to stop the killing of Swainsons' hawks, a project to restore and conserve the forest habitat for monarch butterflies, jaguar conservation in the Yucatan region, the restoration of the California condor in Baja California, Mexico and the purchase of essential equipment for law enforcement personnel to protect imperiled Far Eastern leopards, Amur tigers and snow leopards.  A fundamental goal of this program has been to build conservation capacity and establish ecosystem management regimes by allocating a small amount of U.S. taxpayer money. It is no exaggeration to state that these are the only funds available to assist these highly endangered international species and without this investment these species may become extinct in the wild. In addition, this program has complemented the activities of the Multinational Species Conservation Funds.  By establishing a Congressional authorization for the Wildlife Without Borders Program we will send a positive message to the international community that the United States is committed to its international wildlife treaty obligations and we recognize the long-term importance of this program by enacting it into law.  I urge my colleagues to support this important conservation legislation and want to thank my distinguished colleague from New Jersey, Congressman Jim Saxton for joining with me in this effort.                          ____________________
