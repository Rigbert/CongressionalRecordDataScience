Speaker, Ms. Patricia Stonesifer will make a wonderful addition to the Smithsonian Institution's Board of Regents. Ms. Stonesifer has distinguished herself in numerous philanthropic, business, and public activities during her career, and I urge every Member to support her appointment.  Ms. Stonesifer now serves as the co-chair and president of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. At the Gates Foundation, she focuses on global health and education issues, reflecting her personal commitment to improving living conditions for peoples everywhere.  Ms. Stonesifer also serves on the boards of the Vaccine Fund, established 2 years ago to combat preventable disease in the world's poorest countries, and that of the African Comprehensive HIV/AIDS Partnership, an organization working to fight the spread of AIDS in Botswana. She has served as a member of the American Delegation to the United Nations General Assembly's special session on AIDS.  In her business career, Ms. Stonesifer has both served as a senior vice president at Microsoft, and operated her own consulting firm, so she knows business large and small. She serves on the boards of two publicly held corporations, the King County (Wash.) YWCA, and the Seattle Foundation.  Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt that Patricia Stonesifer will bring the right mix of philanthropic and business experience to the Smithsonian Institution. I urge the House to support her appointment.
