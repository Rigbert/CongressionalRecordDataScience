Speaker, I thank my beloved colleague the gentleman from New York (Mr. Rangel), the distinguished ranking member of the Committee on Ways and Means, for yielding me the time, and I rise in strong opposition.  This is not a bill. It is a raid. First, it is a $260 billion raid on Social Security and Medicare. Yes, tax cuts for the super rich gut the lock box, and it holds the unemployed hostage for tax cuts to the Fortune 500 that are not even required to invest the dollars in America; $1.4 billion more to IBM; $671 million to GE that has not created a manufacturing job in this country in over a decade.  With American troops at war, sacrificing themselves, five of the top corporate tax evaders walk away with over $100 million, and they are in the energy business like discredited Enron that has both hands out. By golly, their CEO, Ken Lay, he is laughing all the way to the bank with the $200 million he took out of the deal, and in fact, he should pay at the 38 percent tax rate. I would not mind if we taxed him at the 50 percent rate to pay for all the unemployed people he put out of work.  Let me just say, we ought to think what Bill Natcher, our colleague, used to tell us, think about it America. Vote no on this Republican trickle down raid on the public Treasury.
