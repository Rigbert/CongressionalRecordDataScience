Mr. Speaker, you have just seen the House uphold the President's veto, and may I say that the minority side again has shut down the parks, the refuges, the monuments. It is the President who has not acted appropriately.  This is a body of two Houses and conferences, and we reached the right decision. We sent the bill to the President. He alone has shut down the parks. He alone has shut down the monuments. He alone is causing the pain, and it is time for the American public to say, Mr. President, sign the bills that Congress sends to you.  For those of you on the minority side, you are no longer in the majority, you are in the minority. So let us tell the truth. Let us have the President sign these bills. We will send them to him.  Mr. President, let us put the people back to work. It is your fault; it will continue to be your fault. Let us think about this country instead of the election in 1996.                          ____________________
