I rise today to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the founding of Machias, ME, a remarkable town on the Downeast Coast that exemplifies the determination, resiliency, and courage of our Nation. It was there, in 1775, just 12 years after the village was established, that the first naval battle of the American Revolution was fought and won.  The word ``Machias'' translates from the language of the Passamaquoddy Indians as ``bad little falls.'' The rushing water where the Machias River plunges to the sea and the vast stands of virgin pine drew the first settlers in 1763, who built a successful sawmill and a thriving community.  In early June of 1775, word reached Machias of the Battles at Lexington and Concord in April, the first military engagements of the American Revolution. When two British cargo ships, escorted by the warship Margaretta, arrived at Machiasport to take on a shipment of lumber to build barracks for British troops under siege in Boston, they were met by patriots eager to join the fight for freedom.  On June 12, with the town under threat of bombardment if it did not cooperate with the lumber shipment, a militia of 30 men under the command of CPT Jeremiah O'Brien stormed the Margaretta. Armed with muskets, pitchforks, and axes, the militia captured the warship and sailed it triumphantly into harbor. The battle known as the ``Lexington of the Seas'' was a stunning American victory.  Among the heroes of that battle was a young woman named Hannah Weston. As the plans to seize the Margaretta were taking shape, this 17-year-old wife of militiaman Josiah Weston went house to house throughout the sparsely settled region collecting gunpowder and shot, and lugging the heavy load through the wilderness to the front lines. Today, the Hannah Weston Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution keeps her memory alive.  The Passamaquoddy gave Machias more than a name. By 1777, the town had become a center of revolutionary activity and the British sent an invasion fleet to crush the rebellion. Some 40 or 50 Passamaquoddy, led by Chief Joseph Neeala, joined the militia and the invaders were turned back.  Just outside of Machias stands Fort O'Brien, one of just a few forts to have been active in the American Revolution, the War of 1812, and the Civil War. On the road to that historic site, on the banks of a small stream, there is a plaque that wonderfully describes the spirit of this community.  It was at that place in June of 1775, when the Margaretta's cannons threatened Machias, that the townspeople met in open air to choose between a humiliating peace and a likely hopeless war. The words on the plaque tell the story: ``After some hours of fruitless discussion, Benjamin Foster, a man of action rather than words, leaped across this brook and called all those to follow him who would, whatever the risk, stand by their countrymen and their country's cause. Almost to a man the assembly followed and, without further formality, the settlement was committed to the Revolution.''  Today, that settlement is a thriving community. Machias is the shiretown of Washington County and, as the home of the University of Maine at Machias, it is a center for education and the arts in the region. Located in the heart of the blueberry industry, Machias hosts the Maine Wild Blueberry Festival, one of our State's great summer events. Beautifully restored Burnham Tavern, where the valiant militiamen met to plan their attack on the Margaretta, is a National Historic Site, so designated for its significance in America's independence.  In his marvelous history of the town published in 1904, George W. Drisko, a descendant of one of the heroes of the Revolution wrote this: ``The pioneers of Machias believed in destiny. They had faith in vitality. In their rough homes were courageous souls who believed they had a future.'' Those beliefs and that faith helped America achieve the freedom we cherish today, and all Americans congratulate the people of Machias on their 250th anniversary.                          ____________________
