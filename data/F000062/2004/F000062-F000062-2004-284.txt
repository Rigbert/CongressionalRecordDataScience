 Those elements of the relief package are crucial to the recovery of agricultural producers in my state. Some of the disaster programs administered by the Department of Agriculture do not provide relief for losses due to arson. However, it is clear to me that the wildfires in California were a natural disaster. Those losses would not have been incurred, if not the drought conditions in high Santa Ana wind conditions. Additionally, as many of the losses were of high value specialty crops, an increased payment cap is needed for adequate recovery effort.  I would ask that the majority leader work with me to ensure that the administration address the intent of my omitted language, so that USDA can administer the relief as intended and the effected producers can recover their losses.
