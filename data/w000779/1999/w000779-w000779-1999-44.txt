President, I think the distinguished Senator has made a very eloquent statement on this matter of hate crimes. As we have seen so often on these issues of justice for gay folks, and when we are talking about issues relating to race, the issue always is brought out that in some way we are advocating ``special rights,'' or ``preferences,'' or something of this nature. I think what the Senator from Massachusetts is asking for--and perhaps he can speak to this--is simply to make it clear the U.S. Congress is going to draw a line in the sand against violence borne out of bigotry and prejudice.  We are not talking about special rights. We are not talking about preferences for one group because of their sexual orientation or race; we are talking about Americans' right to be free from violence borne out of prejudice and hatred. Is that what the Senator from Massachusetts is talking about?
