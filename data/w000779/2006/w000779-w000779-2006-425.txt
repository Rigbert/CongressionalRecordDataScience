President, I join with the other Senators in expressing my sadness tonight as to Senator Dan Inouye's loss. I think all of us see Senator Inouye as the gold standard of caring. He has always cared about his constituents. He has always cared about his colleagues. But, most of all, he has cared about his family, and he threw himself with every ounce of his energy and strength into caring for his spouse who has passed today.  It is important for the Senate to note that in addition to his caring, what Senator Inouye is best known for is his quiet sense of dignity. This is a place where it can get loud and clamorous at times, and what Dan Inouye has always done is to try to always take the quiet path, to lower the decibel level, to try to get Senators to keep a perspective. That is why he always put his family first.  There are many fine people in the Senate, but when we think about our colleague Dan Inouye tonight and all he did for his spouse in those last few months, there is no better person, no better colleague, no better friend all of us could have than Dan Inouye. I just wanted to, along with my colleagues, let him know he is in my thoughts and prayers tonight.
