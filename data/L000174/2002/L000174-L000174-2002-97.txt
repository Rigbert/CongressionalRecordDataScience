President, I pay tribute to a colleague of ours whose career of public service may never be matched again in the history of our country. My friend Strom Thurmond sits on the other side of the aisle of the Senate Chamber, but I consider him a friend with whom I have worked closely, and I will miss him.  I remember when I was first sworn into the Senate in January of 1975. Because of a tied vote in the State of New Hampshire that election year, it was a matter that did not get resolved until we actually went back and did the election over in the middle of the year. I was the most junior Member of a 99-Member Senate. We did not have the Hart Building at the time. We had the Russell Building and the Dirksen Building, and a couple of us very junior Members were in basement offices. Senator Garn of Utah, Senator Laxalt of Nevada, and I were down in the dungeons. When we were sworn in, I had a small reception down there. I invited Members of the Senate to come, not thinking that anybody would actually show up. There were far more noteworthy people being sworn in that day, some to begin subsequent terms, others newly elected.  I remember standing there with my mother and father, and one of the very first people to come through that door was Strom Thurmond, walking arm in arm with John Stennis of Mississippi. I remember Strom welcoming me to the Senate and telling my mother and father I seemed like a nice young man, and that I might actually have a career ahead of me.  I note that has been the routine of Strom Thurmond, to welcome new Senators from either party. He has done it with hundreds of Senators. This one remembers it well.  We often worked in the field of antitrust laws. We worked together on the National Cooperative Production amendments of 1993, the very first high-technology bill signed by President Clinton, and to improve the protections against anticompetitive conduct in the Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act.  Senator Thurmond has been a legislator. I must admit, when Senator Thurmond and I have worked together, it has raised some eyebrows, and when we have introduced legislation together, some have remarked that either it is brilliant legislation or one of us has not gotten around to reading it. But there are so many issues that we did join together. Of course, there have been occasions when he and I have sat on opposite sides of an issue, but even though there were issues about which we felt deeply, Senator Thurmond always conducted himself with the utmost integrity. He has always told the Senate how he felt. He has done so with the people of South Carolina first and foremost in his mind.  I recall him inviting me down to talk to the Strom Thurmond Institute at Clemson. He wanted to put on a debate on economic matters. He had an impartial moderator from the Heritage Foundation. When I walked in, I saw half the Republican party of South Carolina and the Heritage Foundation. I knew I was to be the sacrificial lamb, and I was loving every minute of it. When they stated how much time would be allotted, he stated he should have twice as much time as I because I spoke twice as fast as he did.  We had a very good meeting. I am sure I did not change his mind, or most of the minds of the audience, on a couple of issues. We walked out of there arm in arm, laughing, having a good time. I remember a couple of days later Strom coming on the floor and slapping me on the back and saying, I want to thank the king of Vermont, as he said, for going down with him.  One of the strangest meetings during that time was when we were in the Senate dining room and I introducedhim to Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead. It was a meeting of cultures, very different cultures.  I share with Senator Thurmond the distinction of being from a State that has provided the Senate Judiciary Committee with three chairmen over the history of the committee. South Carolina and the State of Vermont have each had three different people who have shared the Senate Judiciary Committee. With that in mind, I have always asked what I call the Strom Thurmond question at judicial hearings. He has always reminded nominees that the people and lawyers who appear before them, whatever their position in the case, whether rich or poor, white or black, man or woman, whatever their religious or political affiliation, deserve respect and fairness. He has reminded everyone of that.  I will miss my friend Strom. He has been named President pro tempore emeritus for a very good reason.  I have learned much from the senior Senator from South Carolina. Let me share one additional aspect of Senator Thurmond's legacy to the Senate as he completes this term and retires from office. In addition to all his longevity records and legislative achievements and buildings named for him, there is something else about him I will always remember.  When we hold hearings for Federal judges--and we have held a number this year--I am always careful to carry on a tradition that Senator Thurmond started. Senator Thurmond always reminded nominees for high office that it is essential to treat others with courtesy and respect. He always reminded nominees that the people and lawyers who appeared before them, whatever their position in the case, whether rich or poor, white or black, man or woman, whatever their religious or political affiliation, they are each and every one deserving of respect and fairness.  Senator Thurmond was right to remind judges--and even Senators--of that simple rule. It is another contribution he has made to all of us that will continue to serve us well. As I said earlier, I will miss Strom Thurmond. He has been named President-Pro-Tempore Emeritus for good reason.                          ____________________
