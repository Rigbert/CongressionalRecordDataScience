 President, we are working with the Republicans at this time to come up with a list of remaining amendments this afternoon so we can make progress. We hope to be able to move forward shortly on a number of amendments that will be pending that we have agreed on.  While we are doing that, the Senator from Illinois would like to speak as in morning business. How much time does the Senator need?
