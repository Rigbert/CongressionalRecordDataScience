President, so Members will know, this amendment adds $1.3 billion in emergency funding for National Guard equipment to the supplemental portion of the fiscal year 2006 Defense appropriations bill. The funding is set aside for the National Guard to buy much needed items for homeland security and natural disaster response.  Hurricane Katrina exposed glaring deficiencies in the equipment available for the National Guard to respond to such disasters. After Hurricane Katrina, we had barely sufficient levels of trucks, tractors, communication, and miscellaneous equipment that is necessary to respond to the overwhelming scale of this storm. If we have another hurricane or, God forbid, a large-scale terrorist attack, our National Guard is not going to have the basic level of resources to do the job right.  As we know, in every one of our 50 States, we have seen in our career times where the National Guard was called upon to help. The National Guard Chief, LTG Steven Blum, recently noted that the Guard has only about 35 percent of what is officially required to respond to hurricanes, natural disasters, or possible terrorist attacks at home.  Yesterday, in an appearance in the House of Representatives, General Blum noted that Guard members responded to this disaster with insufficient and outdated communications. General Blum noted we are going to need at least--a staggering amount--$7 billion to procure the communications, trucks, medical supplies, and machinery necessary to respond to future disasters.  We knew, even before that hearing, that without any doubt there is an immediate need for at least $1.3 billion. We have to procure essential equipment such as a family of medium tractor vehicles, new SINCGARS radios, night-vision goggles, and other equipment.  I ask unanimous consent that a recent report from the National Guard on these critical needs be printed in the Record.                           Executive Summary       National Guard units that deployed to combat since      September 11th have been the best trained and equipped force      in American History. $4.3 billion has been invested to      provide those units with the very best, state-of-the-art      equipment available in the world today.       This is an unprecedented demonstration of the DoD      commitment to ensure that no soldier or aiman, regardless of      component (Active, Guard, or Reserve), goes to war ill-     equipped or untrained. With the help of the US Congress, this      was accomplished over a two-year period. It is a reality for      National Guard overseas combat deployments.       Now, the senior leadership of the DoD is extending the same      level of commitment to the National Guard, the nation's first      military responders in time of domestic need.       The DoD has a comprehensive reset plan that recognizes the      National Guard's critical role in Homeland Defense and      support to Homeland Security operations. This will take time      and resources. I am confident that a real sense of urgency      exists to make this a reality for America.       Communications equipment, tactical vehicles and trucks and      engineer equipment are the National Guard's highest equipment      priorities.                                         H. Steven Blum, LTG, USA,                                     Chief, National Guard Bureau.
