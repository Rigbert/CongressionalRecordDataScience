 President, I rise to introduce the Protecting Lands Against Narcotics Trafficking or PLANT Act of 2013 with my colleague and friend, Senator Orrin Hatch.  This bill, which is similar to House legislation introduced by Representative Jared Huffman, will help curb the severe environmental damage caused by illegal marijuana grows. I thank my friend and fellow Californian, Representative Huffman, for his leadership on this issue.  Across our Nation, but especially in California, drug traffickers cultivate marijuana with zero regard for the environmental destruction it causes. Motivated solely by profits, these criminals illegally divert streams, poison wildlife, pollute watersheds and destroy the natural heritage that we have worked so hard to protect.  Recognizing the destructive ecological impact of illegal marijuana cultivation, this legislation directs the United States Sentencing Commission to review and amend Federal sentencing guidelines to account for the environmental crimes drug traffickers commit on public and trespassed lands.  Specifically, the bill instructs the Sentencing Commission to put in place sentencing guidelines that increase penalties for individuals who engage in any of the following activities while cultivating illegal drugs on Federal lands or while trespassing on another person's property:  Use of poisons or hazardous chemicals, such as pesticides and rodenticides; the diversion, redirection, obstruction, draining or impoundment of local aquifers, rivers or bodies of water; or significant removal of vegetation or clear cutting of timber.  In addition to environmental concerns, this legislation addresses the safety of our public lands. It directs the Sentencing Commission to provide guidelines increasing penalties on drug traffickers who use or possess a firearm while producing illegal drugs on federal or trespassed lands.  Last year alone, over 900,000 marijuana plants were eradicated at 471 sites on National Forest Lands. Sadly, this represents only a fraction of the total marijuana illegally grown in our National Parks, Forests and other public lands. In California, Operation Pristine, a recent effort to combat the environmental damage caused by illegal marijuana production, resulted in the removal of over 8,700 tons of trash including pesticides, batteries, fertilizers and propane tanks from environmentally sensitive lands.  Drug traffickers often use illegal pesticides smuggled in from Mexico, such as carbofuran, which contaminate California's water resources. They also use pesticides and rodenticides in an illegal manner, often on protected lands. These poisons are having a devastating impact on California's wildlife, including the Pacific Fisher, a member of the Weasel family being considered for listing as an endangered species.  Taxpayers are also being hit hard by the millions of dollars needed to clean up the environmental damage caused by illegal marijuana grows. Estimates put the cost of reclaiming land damaged by illicit marijuana growth at approximately $15,000 per acre. As you might expect, drug traffickers are not setting aside funds for this work, and the cost is passed on to the American people.  Illicit marijuana cultivation also damages the economy and hurts legitimate businesses. Timber companies, farmers and ranchers have had their operations disrupted by criminals growing marijuana illegally. Marijuana growers on agricultural lands, particularly in the Central Valley, divert thousands of gallons of scarce water from legitimate agriculture. In 2013 alone, California has identified over 1,800 grow sites in the Central Valley, including 406 in Tulare County and 537 in Fresno as of November.  As Chairman of the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control and also as a Senator who has worked to safeguard our country's natural resources, I believe that we cannot allow drug traffickers to destroy our public lands, pollute our waters and kill our wildlife with impunity. It is time that sentencing guidelines take into account the environmental damage that drug traffickers all too often cause. This legislation, directing the Sentencing Commission to review and amend its guidelines, will do just that.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1889       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
