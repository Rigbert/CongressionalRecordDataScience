President, in honor of the hard work and generosity of all those involved in the Wreaths Across America project, U.S. Senators Olympia J. Snowe and I have submitted a resolution in the Senate that would designate Saturday, December 11, as ``Wreaths Across America Day.''  On Saturday, December 11, a convoy of Mainers will arrive at Arlington National Cemetery to honor our Nation's fallen heroes. At each of the thousands of gravesites at our country's most hallowed resting place, citizens from Maine will lay Maine-made balsam wreaths at each gravesite that identifies one of our Nation's fallen veterans. Joining them will be the Patriot Guard Riders, an organization made up of men and women who have volunteered a portion of their lives to consecrating the sacrifice of the service men and women who gave their all for our country. Together, they will continue their tradition of escorting and driving tractor-trailers filled with donated wreaths on the journey from Harrington, ME, to Arlington National Cemetery. This is the 19th consecutive year that Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, has made this generous donation. And once again, more than 100,000 wreaths will be placed in more than 400 locations, including Arlington National Cemetery and at veterans cemeteries in America and abroad.  The holiday season is one that many Americans enjoy by spending time in the comfort and company of their family and close friends. Many families who have lost loved ones serving their country will not share the same comfort and joy during this holiday season. The men and women behind the Wreaths Across America project work hard to honor these families and their lost love ones. Our resolution is a modest way for the U.S. Senate to honor these men and women, as well as the veterans and families who sacrifice so much in order to make it possible for us to celebrate this holiday season in freedom.
