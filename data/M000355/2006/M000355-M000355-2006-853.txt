 President, I have one further observation on the measure which we just passed.  I again congratulate the Senator from Massachusetts and Chairman Enzi for this important piece of legislation. This has been a tough few years in coal country--in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and in Kentucky. As everyone knows, we just lost five miners last weekend. This legislation couldn't be more timely.  Again, I congratulate those on both sides of the aisle who made an important contribution to move this legislation out of the Senate and over to the House.                          ____________________[Pages S5045-S5050]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]        MINE IMPROVEMENT AND NEW EMERGENCY RESPONSE ACT OF 2006  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this is an important coal mine safety bill which has been cleared on both sides of the aisle.  I commend Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi for their extraordinary effort in putting this measure together on a broad bipartisan basis. As I indicated, it has been cleared on both sides of the aisle. It is time to pass this measure and hope that the House will act in short order.
