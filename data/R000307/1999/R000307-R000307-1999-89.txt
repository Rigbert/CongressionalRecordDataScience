President, in those remarks, Chuck Krulak talked about character and individual responsibility as it applies to today's America and all of the obligations and challenges that we face today. Character; character--as usual, General Charles C. Krulak simply told the truth. We will be a better nation if we but heed his advice.  Semper Fidelis Commandant Krulak and thank you.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
