 President, this has been an interesting colloquy, but the parliamentary situation we are in is that unless the majority leader gives his consent, no amendments on my side will be allowed. That is an unacceptable way to go forward on a 1,600-page bill that we pass every 5 years. We will continue to talk. We all know therewill be a farm bill. The only issue is when and how, and that is something we will have to negotiate here in the Senate, as we always do.  I yield the floor.
