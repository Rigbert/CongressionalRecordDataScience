 We passed, as the gentleman knows, the tax credit for investment in equipment, or the depreciation allowance. We passed that today. That was a $287 billion cost.  I would call to the gentleman's attention, as I have with Mr. Cantor, that we are still concerned on this side of the aisle--and I know the gentleman knows this--that the unemployment insurance bill that lapsed in December of 2013 has still not been funded. There are some 3 million people who have fallen off that.  As part of your new responsibilities, you will be focused on scheduling legislation, and I would urge the majority leader to consider very seriously bringing that unemployment bill to the floor for a vote.  We believe that it does have the votes on this House floor. That is 3 million--and it is growing by thousands per month--who have run out of unemployment insurance, which is slowing our economy, but it is also, from their perspective, giving them no support to support themselves and to help support their families.  So I would urge the gentleman to look again at the unemployment insurance status originally proposed to be done retroactively. Even if we look prospectively, we would hope the majority leader would look at moving forward on the House floor.  I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY of California. I thank the gentleman for yielding, I thank him for his input. As I said earlier, in next week's schedule I do not anticipate that coming up, but as we look towards the rest of July, I will keep all Members posted.
