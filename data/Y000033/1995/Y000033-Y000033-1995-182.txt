I would have no problem with some assurance there. I would like to point out, these laws dealing with this subject really are legislation and not appropriations. The gentlewoman is on the authorizing committee. That might have been the place to have addressed this issue.  But we began this bill in late July, early August. Here it is now September. This amendment was just filed. So we would like a little time to make sure exactly what the effect would be.
