Speaker, I rise tonight to salute a Washington correspondent, Dave McConnell, who is a good friend of mine and who this month is marking his 45th anniversary with WTOP radio.  Since 1965, Dave has been a Washington radio institution; and since 1981, he has been reporting full time from Capitol Hill. I dare say that every one of us in this Chamber has had an opportunity to talk to our friend, David McConnell. He has reported with the insight and impartiality that typified journalism at its best.  In that time, Dave's career has been repeatedly recognized by his colleagues. His honors include, among others, the A.I.R. Lifetime Achievement Award, Maryland and Virginia AP Broadcast Journalism Reporting Awards, and induction in the Society of Professional Journalists Hall of Fame. Decades of listeners have turned to Dave for inside knowledge on how their Congress works.  Along with many other Members of Congress, I am glad to call Dave a friend. We share our home State of Maryland and an abiding love of the institution of the House of Representatives. And I trust that that love will inspire Dave's works here for many years to come. As he has often said, and I quote, ``As long as I have a seat covering the greatest show on Earth and can witness history being made, I'm going to keep reporting.''  Dave, we hope you do. You do it well. God bless you and congratulations.                          ____________________
