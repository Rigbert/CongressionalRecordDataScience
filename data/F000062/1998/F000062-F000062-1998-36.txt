 President, I will vote to table this amendment to S. 1301, the Bankruptcy Reform bill, which expresses the sense of the Congress ``that the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee should promptly reduce the Federal Funds rate.'' My vote to table this amendment should not be construed as opposition to lower interest rates. Rather, I do not believe it is the duty of this body, nor do I believe that it is appropriate for this body, to tell the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee what to do.
