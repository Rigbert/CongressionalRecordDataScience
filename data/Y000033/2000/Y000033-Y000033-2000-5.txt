Mr. Speaker, there is that possibility. I think it would be a terrible disservice to the country.  I would like to remind the gentleman and people that might be listening that this area is a very small area that has a tremendous abundance of oil, probably 39 billion barrels of oil, that can be accessible to the people in the lower 48 so we would not have to buy thatmillion barrels a day from Saddam Hussein.  So if the President was to do that, it would be a terrible travesty; it would be wrong for the people and wrong for Alaska. But, most of all, it would be wrong for the people that are buying oil from abroad.
