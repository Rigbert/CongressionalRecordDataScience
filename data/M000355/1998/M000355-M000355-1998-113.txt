 President, the Senator from Arizona offered his amendment yesterday afternoon at 4 o'clock. We are trying to make progress on the bill.  I understand there is one person who desires to speak on the other side.  In fairness to everyone, with the concurrence of the Senator from Arizona, if we can't bring this to conclusion, I am going to make a motion to table the McCain amendment at 3 o'clock so that we can get an expression of opinion on the amendment of the distinguished Senator from Arizona.  In the meantime, Mr. President, I think we have some amendments that have been cleared on both sides which I will shortly send to the desk: a Brownback amendment on Iran; DeWine amendment on alternative crop development; three Craig amendments; a Reed-Reid amendment on scholarships; and a DeWine amendment on Haiti.             Amendments Numbered 3528 through 3534 En Bloc  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I send the amendments to the desk, and ask that they be considered en bloc.
