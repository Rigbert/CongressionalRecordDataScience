Throughout his career, Marty served Illinois' children and families, first at the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services, then The Youth Campus, and finally Kids Hope United. After 30 years of success in the nonprofit social services, Mr. Sinnott is ready for a change of pace.  Marty Sinnott is a native Chicagoan. He earned his undergraduate and graduate degrees from the University of Chicago. His first job after college was with the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services. There, he started as a social worker and over the course of ten years rose to become administrator of resource development and utilization.  After Marty left DCFS, he continued his work on behalf of needy Illinois children as president and CEO of The Youth Campus, a child welfare agency in Chicago. During his tenure at The Youth Campus, he increased the organization's revenues from $1 million to $13 million. And more importantly, he led the organization's growth so it was serving six times as many kids.  Since 1999, Marty has been with Kids Hope United, a Chicago-based private nonprofit child and family services agency. As chairman and CEO, Mr. Sinnott led a multistate expansion that tripled revenues and, again, increased the number of children and families the agency reached. Kids Hope United now has a 900-person staff, an annual operating budget of $55 million, and a scope of services that reaches families in Illinois, Missouri, Wisconsin, and Florida.  I commend Marty Sinnott for his decades of service to the children and families of Illinois. Congratulations go out to him and his family on his retirement from Kids Hope United. We wish you many years of continued success.                          ____________________
