Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I would just like to remind my colleagues that my bill, as it is being debated tonight, does not affect existing Ramsar sites. It does not affect those sites. We are still in the convention. All I am doing is try to restate again the constitutional role of this Congress to designate areas that have been picked by the Ramsar Convention in the future, prospective. That is all it does.  I would like to suggest one thing. It was mentioned about King Cove and the road that was supposed to go to Cold Bay in Alaska, and the so-called World Wildlife Fund says the bill would violate the obligation of the United States under the Ramsar Convention.  What does that mean? It means that the Ramsar Convention being defended by my good friend, the gentleman from Minnesota [Mr. Vento] is now willing to put the lives of my Alaskan constituents in jeopardy every day because they do not want 7 miles of road built through a so-called Eisenbeck refuge area that has 200 miles of roads in it, and every use in the world, but they use the Ramsar Convention as an excuse.  I want to suggest that we ought to do one thing, put this back into the control of the Congress in the future for Ramsar Convention sites. It does not hurt the existing sites.
