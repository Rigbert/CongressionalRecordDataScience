President, no one has any intention or desire to permit terrorists into this country. It is setting up a straw man to say something would let the Taliban in here. This amendment is not about the Taliban, incidentally. Our government supported them very strongly through ourCIA and others, as the press has reported, during the Soviet Union days. But this amendment is not about terrorists. It is about genuine refugees who have been victims of the very brutality that is now preventing them from receiving asylum in this country.  I will give a practical example. We trained and supported the Vietnamese Montagnards. We trained and equipped them. We asked them to fight with us. Now we deny them asylum because they risked their lives to do what we asked them to do. The Burmese, who are fighting a brutal regime, our government supports them. Many are refugees. But even though they have not been designated a foreign terrorist organization and our government supports them, they are inadmissible. There are cases of women and children threatened with torture and death and forced to provide food, shelter or become the sex slaves of members of terrorist groups. Our law bars them from asylum.  We are giving them discretion. I cannot believe that President Bush or Secretary Rice is going to misuse this discretion to allow in terrorists.
