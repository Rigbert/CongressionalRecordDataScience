Speaker, the subject of my Special Order, as we have seen, is the very dangerous tax bill that this House passed and that the Senate is now considering. In fact, of course, the Senate bill is worse than the House bill, if one can imagine that.  On November 16, the Republican majority in this House passed a bill to raise taxes on 36 million middle class households and place our country another $1.7 trillion in debt.  Now, you will hear $1.5 trillion and you will hear $1.7 trillion.  What is the difference?  The difference is about $200 billion that we will pay in interest to others to effect this tax cut. So not only is it going to be the $1.5 trillion immediately impacted by the tax cut itself, it will be the $200 billion additional that we will have to pay to borrow the money to give the tax cut and, as I am going to point out, give that tax cut essentially, for the most part, to the wealthiest enterprises in America.  227 Republicans voted to do that to their constituents. Every single Democratic representative who was present, joined by 13 Republicans, did what, in my opinion, many of their colleagues wanted to do, but for political reasons, not policy reasons, chose not to do.  They did so, Mr. Speaker, following impassioned remarks by Majority Leader McCarthy and by Speaker Ryan. Both addressed this House and the American people and claimed to be pushing these tax bills in order to help the working people of our country, a worthy objective, an important objective.  Perhaps one could justify this extraordinary escalation of the national debt, probably the largest increase in the national debt of any single bill that has been passed. They cited struggling families and the need to provide a leg up to those in our middle class. Those, of course, are very resonant messages, very important messages. Frankly, we ought to be talking about how we create jobs, not debt. They are being employed to sell a tax plan that would do exactly the opposite of what they say.  In his speech on the floor, Speaker Ryan lamented: ``Seventy-eight percent of our workers in this country today are living paycheck to paycheck. . . . Instead of thinking about getting ahead, families are struggling just to get by.''  He is right about that and he is right to be concerned about that. What he is wrong in is his response.  Those living paycheck to paycheck will be the ones hurt the most by this tax scam. Let me repeat that. The Speaker talks about those living paycheck to paycheck. That concern is an absolute legitimate concern for every one of us in this House and every Member of the Senate.  Unfortunately, he has offered a bill, however, that will hurt the very ones he says that he wants to protect. They will see their taxes go up over the next decade. In that same period, as middle class families are struggling to get by, they will watch the wealthiest get farther and farther ahead.  This is not about class warfare. This is about a judgment of who needs help, who needs lifting up.  He talked about the people who need lifting up. The problem is that he didn't lift them up. They will watch the wealthy be lifted up, and they are very high right now. God bless them.  Why, I ask, would the Republican tax plan take $1.7 trillion away from our children and grandchildren and give 62 percent of it to the top 1 percent?  Mr. Speaker, the people get it. The people think this bill is not going to help them. That is what polls show, and they are right.  Under the Republicans' plan, it is wealthy individuals like Donald Trump who win, and regular working Americans and our middle class who are trying to get ahead who lose.  House Republican leaders cajoled their members. Cajoled is a very polite word. They pressured and they scared their members. They said: If you don't pass this bill, you are going to lose the election not because the people are for it, but because, as one Member said from New York, their donors demanded it.  They urged their members to vote for a flawed bill many of them did not want and that none of them believed would become law. They did that so they could hand the reins to the Senate to send back a version no one had yet read or contemplated. They put their House majority on the hook to accept whatever the Senate would pass word for word. We will see whether they do that.  That Senate bill that is now being considered would deeply harm middle class families, particularly those in congressional districts across the country where more taxpayers choose to deduct their State and local taxes, like my State and other States.  Dozens of House Republicans from such districts voted enthusiastically to move the process along. In other words, they voted against their taxpayers and for their party--party above people--to move it along by supporting the House tax bill with the promise that it would be improved in the Senate.  These members would be asked to make further concessions against the interests of their constituents to vote for the Senate bill, were it to come to this floor, because it is worse for their constituents, not better.  That is not how Congress is supposed to work, Mr. Speaker. That is not regular order.  The American taxpayers and American businesses seeking to grow in our economy have been asking Congress to enact tax reform that is bipartisan and permanent.  You heard Mr. Larson talking about the 1986 bill. It was a bill that was worked out between President Reagan; Speaker Tip O'Neill; Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, a Member from the Democratic Party from Illinois; and the gentleman from Oregon, the chairman of the Finance Committee, a Republican.  The Republican bills in the House and the Senate can be called neither bipartisan nor permanent.  So what can we call them?  In his floor remarks before the vote on their House bill, Speaker Ryan called it: ``The single biggest thing we can do to grow the economy, to restore opportunity, and to help middle-income families that are struggling.''  That is not true, Mr. Speaker. However, it is the single biggest thing we can do to put our children and grandchildren further into debt. I have heard so many of my Republican colleagues stand on this floor and say that we cannot spend this money because our children will have to pay the bill, and they are right.                              {time}  1945  We have a pay-for problem, Mr. Speaker. We ought to be paying for what we buy. Here, we are not paying, we are borrowing $1.5 trillion, as I said earlier, to give to some of our wealthiest citizens; for that is what their plan would do, raise taxes on the middle class today, and on our children andgrandchildren tomorrow, to pay for the wealthiest few to get tax cuts that they don't need and that won't grow our economy.  Let me stress, I think everybody in this room, everybody in the country, would like to be wealthy. This is not talking about penalizing the wealthy. It is simply to say: God bless you. You have done well, but we need to make sure that others do well as well.  The University of Chicago's Booth School of Business released a survey, Mr. Speaker, on November 21, just a few days ago, in which 42 expert economists were asked whether the Republican tax bill would produce the higher economic growth promised by its authors; 42 of the most prominent economists. Only one--only one--said that it would do so and, ironically, later admitted he had misread the question.  None of the 42, not one, agreed that the tax cuts for the very wealthy included in the Republican bill would eventually pay for themselves; and that is why we say, it is one of the greatest debt-creating pieces of legislation that any of us have considered.  Former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, who presided over the basis for 4 years of balanced budgets, so he has some real credibility on how to bring balance to our fiscal posture in America--he served at the time of historic budget surpluses. He pointed out this fallacy in his op-ed in The Washington Post on November 15. He said this: ``The tax cuts,'' he wrote, ``will not increase growth and, given their fiscal effects, would likely have a significant and increasing negative impact.''  He went on to make several compelling arguments about the dangers of the Republican tax proposals. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a copy of his op-ed piece.                  [From the Washington Post, Nov. 15]          Op-Ed: The Republican Tax Plan's Five Worst Dangers                          (By Robert E. Rubin)       The deficit-funded tax cuts advancing through Congress are      a fiscal tragedy for which our country will pay a huge price      over time. While the details of the tax plan remain in flux,      its fundamental contours will not change. Nor will its $1.5      trillion of deficit funding, the amount stipulated in the      recently passed budget resolution.       Perhaps it's hopeless to expect those in Congress who have      long bemoaned deficits and the debt to oppose the plan. If,      however, as a matter of conscience or renewed reflection they      decide to take heed, here are the fiscal dangers posed by the      plan.       To start, the tax cuts will not increase growth and, given      their fiscal effects, would likely have a significant and      increasingly negative impact. The nonpartisan Tax Policy      Center's latest report estimated that, over 10 years, the      average increase in our growth rate would be roughly zero,      counting the crowding out of private investment by increasing      deficits but not counting other adverse effects of worsening      our fiscal outlook. The Penn Wharton Budget Model, using the      same approach, estimates virtually no increase in long-term      growth. Goldman Sachs projects an increase of 0.1 percent to      0.2 percent in the first couple of years and an average      increase over 10 years of just 0.05 percent per year, not      counting any of the adverse fiscal effects.       These estimates reflect three underlying views held by      mainstream economists. First, individual tax cuts will not      materially induce people to work more. Second, corporate tax      cuts will likely have limited effect on investment or      decisions about where to locate business activity, given the      many other variables at play. Third, deficit-funded tax cuts      will have little short-term effect on growth, except perhaps      for some temporary overheating, because we are at roughly      full employment.       With no additional revenue from increased growth to offset      the tax cuts' cost, the publicly held debt of the federal      government would increase by $1.5 trillion. An additional      danger is that the actual deficit impact would be increased      by abandoning the Congressional Budget Office's nonpartisan      evaluation that has been used for decades by both parties in      favor of partisan calculations by those pushing the tax cuts.       Adding $1.5 trillion or more to the federal debt would make      an already bad situation worse. A useful measure of our      fiscal position is the ratio of publicly held government debt      to economic output or gross domestic product, called the      debt/GDP ratio. In 2000, the debt/GDP ratio was 32 percent.      The ratio is now 77 percent. Looking forward, the CBO      projects the debt/GDP ratio to be 91 percent in 2027 and 150      percent in 2047. After $1.5 trillion of deficit-funded tax      cuts, those future ratios have been estimated to increase to      roughly 97 percent in 2027 and 160 percent in 2047. These      estimates likely substantially understate the worsening of      our fiscal trajectory. That's because they do not account for      the increasingly adverse effect on growth of the difficult-     to-quantify effects of fiscal deterioration.       Exacerbating our already unsustainable fiscal trajectory      with these tax cuts would threaten growth in five respects.      These are highly likely to be substantial and to increase      over time.       First, business confidence would likely be negatively      affected by creating uncertainty about future policy and      heightening concern about our political system's ability to      meet our economic policy challenges.       Second, our country's resilience to deal with inevitable      future economic and geopolitical emergencies, including the      effects of climate change, would continue to decline.       Third, funds available for public investment, national      security and defense spending--a professed concern of many      tax-cut proponents--would continue to decline as debt rises,      because of rising interest costs and the increased risk of      borrowing to fund government activities.       Fourth, Treasury bond interest rates would be highly likely      to increase over time because of increased demand for the      supply of savings and increased concern about future      imbalances. That, in turn, would raise private-sector      interest rates, which could also increase due to widening      spreads vs. Treasuries, further reflecting increased concern      about future conditions. And even a limited increase in the      debt/GDP ratio could focus attention on our fiscal      trajectory's long-ignored risks and trigger outsize increases      in Treasury and private-sector interest rates. The ability to      borrow in our own currency, and to print it through the      Federal Reserve, may diminish these risks for a while, as      might capital inflows from abroad. But these mitigating      factors have their limits; at some point, unsound fiscal      conditions almost surely would undermine our currency and      debt markets.       Finally, at some unpredictable point, fiscal conditions--     and these market dynamics--would likely be seen as      sufficiently serious to cause severe market and economic      destabilization.       We have an imperative need to address our unsustainable      longer-term fiscal trajectory with sound economic policies.      Few elected officials want to face this fact, but, at the      very least, they should not make matters worse. We can only      hope that responsible elected officials will prevent this      irresponsible tax plan from being adopted.
