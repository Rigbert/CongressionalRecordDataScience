President, today marks the 51st anniversary of what has come to be known as Bloody Sunday. On March 7, 1965, John Lewis and Reverend Hosea Williams led 600 brave civil rights activists in a march over the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, AL. These courageous men, women, and children gathered to draw attention to the systematic disenfranchisement of African Americans in Alabama and throughout much of the Deep South. They marched in pursuit of the most fundamental right, the right preservative of all others--the right to vote.  What they received that day, however, were brutal beatings from police batons as State troopers turned them back and chased them down. More than 50 of the demonstrators were injured. John Lewis was beaten unconscious and nearly killed.  Ten days later, Federal district court Judge Frank M. Johnson, Jr., granted protection to the activists, ruling that they were permitted to march from Selma to the State capitol in Montgomery. In the historic order he issued, Judge Johnson wrote: ``The law is clear that the right to petition one's government for the redress of grievances may be exercised in large groups. Indeed, where, as here, minorities have been harassed, coerced and intimidated, group association may be the only realistic way of exercising such rights. . . . These rights may be exercised by marching, even along public highways.''  Days later, the march proceeded with a crowd of approximately 3,200 marchers--which swelled to 25,000 by the time they reached the capitol. Within months, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act into law--guaranteeing that the right to vote would not be restricted through clever schemes, like poll taxes and literacy tests, devised to keep African Americans from voting.  Last month, the foot soldiers of the 1965 voting rights marches were recognized with a Congressional Gold Medal. John Lewis, who since 1987 has been Congressman John Lewis, along with Reverend Frederick D. Reese, accepted the medal on behalf of the foot soldiers. At the ceremony, Congressman Lewis said: ``It was their determined marching feet that led to the passage of the Voting Rights Act. . . . They were just ordinary people with an extraordinary vision, to build a true democracy in America.''  In 2005, I was proud to join Congressman Lewis on a trip to Selma for a ceremonial walk across the Edmund Pettus Bridge to mark the 40th anniversary of Bloody Sunday. As we marched in recognition of that extraordinary vision to build a true democracy, we celebrated the marchers' achievement--a bill that has often been called the most significant civil rights law ever passed by Congress. Little did we know that, 8 years later, in 2013, the Supreme Court would strike down a major provision of that landmark legislation.  In Shelby County v. Holder, on a 5-4 vote, a divided Supreme Court struck down the provision of the Voting Rights Act that required certain jurisdictions to preclear any changes to their voting laws with the Department of Justice. This decision effectively gutted the Voting Rights Act. Since the decision, States like Texas, North Carolina, Alabama, and Mississippi have put in place restrictive State voting laws--which all too often have a disproportionate impact on lower-income and minority voters.  In order to truly honor the foot soldiers of Bloody Sunday and repair the damage done by Shelby County, Congress must restore the Voting Rights Act by passing the bipartisan Voting Rights Advancement Act. This bill, which Senator Leahy, Senator Coons, and I introduced last year, would ensure that the Federal Government is once again able to fully protect the fundamental right to vote.  I wish that, 51 years after Bloody Sunday, America had reached a point where the protections of the Voting Rights Act were no longer necessary. But we have not, and the Voting Rights Act is still very much needed today.  In 2006, Congress reauthorized the Voting Rights Act with an overwhelming bipartisan vote in both the House and the Senate. It is time to once again come together on a bipartisan basis and recognize the ongoing challenges that minority voters all too frequently face. Congress must take action to repair the Voting Rights Act and ensure the legacy of those who marched 51 years ago.                            ____________________
