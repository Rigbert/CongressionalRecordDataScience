 President, what we are going to witness for the next 3 hours is the kind of thing that gives the public such a low impression of Congress. Looking at the new Gallup poll that just came out, the President has a 37-percent approval rating--certainly not anything to applaud if you are a Republican. But the Democratic Congress has a 22-percent approval rating, 15 percent below the President. Why is that? I think it is because the American public thought they sent us here to legislate. Obviously, in a body such as the Senate, in order to legislate you have to do things on a bipartisan basis. We are very different from the House of Representatives. We are actually beginning to make progress on the farm bill, although I must say we have only had one vote this entire week. It is Wednesday morning, and we have had one vote.
