President, I rise today to honor the great people of Goreville, IL, during their centennial celebration. Although Goreville was not officially incorporated until 1900, it has been a busy settlement since before the Civil War. A post office was established as early as 1886, after the Gore family migrated from Georgia to settle on the land they had purchased from the government in 1854. When the Civil War broke out, General John A. Logan visited the community to recruit volunteers for his 31st Illinois Volunteer Infantry, which rendezvoused at Camp Dunlap in Jacksonville, IL, before moving on to Fort Defiance in Cairo, IL.  When the Chicago and Eastern Illinois railroad went through Johnson County in 1889, the village moved its businesses down the road. This flexibility proved beneficial to Goreville as the small village prospered.  In April 1900, the village was incorporated, and was formally recognized by the State of Illinois in a small ceremony on July 5, 1900. While Goreville's population has never been extremely large, it has gradually grown to 900 people. Goreville is nestled next to Ferne Clyffe State Park. In 1923, the State Park was declared ``the most beautiful spot in Illinois.''  The week of May 7-13 has been designated as the Goreville Centennial Celebration. As the people of Goreville hold a series of events to celebrate the 100th birthday of the village, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the centennial celebration of Goreville, IL.                          ____________________
