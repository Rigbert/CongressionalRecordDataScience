 President, I have a number of important topics to discuss this morning, but first and foremost, I want to personally thank everyone in this building who gave so much of their own time and energy to facilitate the rituals that filled this Capitol for the last several days.  From the moment that news of President Bush's passing was made public, intricate plans were set in motion in both the House and Senate to arrange a public tribute worthy of a national treasure and a rare patriot like George Bush. Needless to say, the entire congressional family should be proud of the result.  As our 41st President lay in state earlier this week, the Bush family, world leaders, and tens of thousands of Americans were welcomed to the Capitol to pay their respects. I know my colleagues will join me in thanking thegreat many people who helped make such a beautiful remembrance possible: to the staff of the Architect of the Capitol, all the offices under the Sergeant at Arms, the Secretary of the Senate and her team, and the Press Gallery; to the volunteers from my own staff and from other congressional offices who freely gave their time; to the staff of the Capitol Visitor Center who ensured that tens of thousands of people could share this experience; to the men and women of the Capitol Police who watch over us all; to the U.S. military, the envy of the world. Special thanks to Stef Muchow, my director of operations, who played such a tireless role in conducting this orchestra, going back through the entire weekend leading up to Monday, and to so many others who worked through the weekend and around the clock to help the legislative branch coordinate a dignified sendoff befitting this remarkable man whom we honor. I thank you, and the Nation thanks you.                          ____________________
