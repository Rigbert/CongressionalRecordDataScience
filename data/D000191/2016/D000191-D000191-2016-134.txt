Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  It would be interesting if the gentleman invited the EPA to come out and look at that farmer's land. I think they would find that he is exempt and he isn't down to 18 acres. There are misunderstandings.  And, also, the gentleman did say something about the courts have already ruled. The courts haven't ruled. That is the problem. It is going to be 2 years before they get to the merits on this rule. And so they essentially have stayed the new rule from going into effect. So we don't have ditch exemptions.  It would be interesting to contrast the existing Bush rules--which will be in place for at least another 2 years--to the new rules and have someone come out and consult with that farmer and say: Actually, you are kind of screwed here because of the Bush rules. But if we had these new rules, we could just tell you to go ahead and farm on those 100 acres. On previously converted cropland, ditches are exempt. You have the agricultural exemptions. But sorry, you are stuck with something written in the Bush era.  That is the effect of Congress not acting. And I would agree with the gentleman. The fact is we should act and we could act. The gentleman has jurisdiction over the committee which could reauthorize the Clean Water Act.  It has not been reauthorized since 1987, which is why we are squabbling over administration interpretation of the Bush administration--I hate to have to be talking about George Bush--and the Obama administration as opposed to Congress having at some point done its job to reauthorize and clarify the Clean Water Act in those intervening 28 years.  I am not aware of any plans. The chairman has told me the agenda for the coming year, but rewriting the Clean Water Act and debating the merits and demerits of certain protections is not on that agenda, to the best of my knowledge.  So the effects of what the courts have done is to stick us with the Bush-era rules for 2 more years, and the effect of what we are doing here would actually stick us with the Bush-era rules indefinitely. Pick your poison.  The bottom line is we are doing a disservice to the country by not getting these commonsense exemptions in place as soon as possible.  I have a number of letters from groups too numerous to reference that I will include in the Record. Being co-chair of the House Craft Brewers Caucus, there is a very strong representation by the craft brewing industry because of their concerns about the need for clean water to make good beer.                                              American Sustainable                                             Business Council,                                 Washington, DC, January 11, 2016.       Dear Representative: On behalf of the 250,000 businesses,      and more than 325,000 entrepreneurs, executives, managers and      investors we represent, the American Sustainable Business      Council (ASBC) urges you to vote against the Congressional      Review Act (S.J. Res. 22) overturning the EPA's Clean Water      Rule.       Clean water is good for business, and companies like the      ones we represent know it. They need it for their operations      and for the overall health of their communities. Repealing      this rule would not protect economic growth; it would put it      at risk.       The EPA's rule comes out of a broad desire among all      stakeholders, following the Supreme Court's rulings in 2001      and 2006, to clarify what the EPA's jurisdiction is under the      Clean Water Act. This ruling is based on sound science, and      does not expand the agency's power under the Clean Water Act,      only clarifying of what bodies of water it protects.       Of greatest concern to us, however, is the argument that      this rule will jeopardize economic growth. From our      experience, the real risk to our economy comes when clean      water protections no longer exist, and businesses lose      control over a crucial input in food and beverage production,      tourism, manufacturing, and any number of industries.       The EPA's rule gives the business community more confidence      that clean water sources, including streams and rivers, are      protected, and removes uncertainty surrounding the agency's      authority to protect our waterways. This is good for the      economy, and vital for businesses that rely on clean water      for their success.       The business community was given ample opportunity to share      its concerns and inform the EPA of the rule's potential      impact during the months-long comment period--as evidenced by      the more than 1 million comments submitted during that time--     and the EPA had abundant time to take any concerns into      account and use them to improve the rule.       Clean water remains a necessity for so many American      industries, from agriculture to manufacturing to tourism to      food and drink production. And it's what businesses across      the political spectrum want--national, scientific polling      from the American Sustainable Business Council found 80% of      small business owners favored rules protecting upstream      headwaters, as the EPA's rule would do, and 71% said that      clean water protections are necessary to ensure economic      growth.       Congress needs to let this rule stand, not create more      uncertainty for American businesses. We urge you to vote      against Congressional Review Act (S.J. Res. 22). American      businesses are relying on you to keep this     rule intact and ensure they can rely on this most crucial      resource.           Sincerely,                                                   Richard Eidlin,     Vice President of Policy and Campaigns.                                  ____                                                 January 11, 2016.     Re Hunters and anglers strongly oppose S.J. Res. 22          invalidating the final Clean Water Rule       Dear Representative: The undersigned sportsmen and      conservation organizations strongly oppose Senate Joint      Resolution 22, which the House of Representatives may vote on      this week and would invalidate the final Clean Water Rule.      This important rule clarifies Clean Water Act jurisdiction in      a manner that is both legally and scientifically sound.       This joint resolution is an extraordinary and radical      action to overturn a fundamental, once-in-a-generation final      rule that is critical to the effective implementation of the      1972 Clean Water Act, and that was adopted following an      exhaustive public rulemaking process. The resolution would      overturn a rule that finally resolves longstanding confusion      and debate, promotes clarity and efficiency for regulatory      programs promoting river health, and preserves longstanding      protections for farmers, ranchers, and foresters.       By using the Congressional Review Act, this joint      resolution not only wipes out the final Clean Water Rule but      also prohibits any substantially similar rule in the future.      It locks in the current state of jurisdictional confusion and      offers no constructive path forward for regulatory clarity or      clean water. America's hunters and anglers cannot afford to      have Congress undermine effective Clean Water Act safeguards,      leaving communities and valuable fish and wildlife habitat at      risk indefinitely.       This joint resolution dismisses the voices of the millions      of Americans, including businesses that depend on clean      water, who support the new rule and are eager to reap its      benefits. The agencies engaged in a very transparent and      thorough multi-year rulemaking process that included over 400      stakeholder meetings and an extended public comment period      that produced over one million comments. Nearly 900,000      members of the public commented in support of the Clean Water      Rule. A recent poll found that 83 percent of sportsmen and      women think the Clean Water Act should apply to smaller      streams and wetlands, as the new rule directs.       The Clean Water Rule clearly restores longstanding      protections for millions of wetlands and headwater streams      that contribute to the drinking water of 1 in 3 Americans,      protect communities from flooding, and provide essential fish      and wildlife habitat that supports a robust outdoor      recreation economy. The sport fishing industry alone accounts      for 828,000 jobs, nearly $50 billion annually in retail      sales, and an economic impact of about $115 billion every      year that relies on access to clean water. The Clean Water      Rule will translate directly to an improved bottom line for      America's outdoor industry.       Opponents claiming the rule goes too far and protects water      too much have filed a barrage of nearly identical legal      challenges in numerous district and appellate courts across      the country. On October 9, 2015, the 6th Circuit Court of      Appeals temporarily stayed the Clean Water Rule nationwide.      The Clean Water Rule and those who oppose it will have their      day in court.       Meanwhile, we want Congress to know that despite these      legal challenges, conservationists across the nation are      steadfast in our support for the Clean Water Rule. After      nearly 15 years of Clean Water Act confusion, further delay      is unacceptable to the millions of hunters and anglers eager      to have their local waters fully protected again. We are      confident that, when the dust settles in the courts, the      Clean Water Rule will withstand challenges saying it protects      our water too much.       The Clean Water Act has always been about restoring and      maintaining the chemical, physical, and biological integrity      of the Nation's waters. It is bedrock support for America's      more than 40 million hunters and anglers and for the 117      million Americans whose drinking water depends on healthy      headwater streams.       We thank all of the members of Congress who stand with      America's sportsmen and women to block attempts to derail the      rule, and ask you to reject S.J. Res. 22 and any other      legislative action against the rule that may follow this      year.           Sincerely,       American Fisheries Society, American Fly Fishing Trade      Association, Backcountry Hunters and Anglers, International      Federation of Fly Fishers, Izaak Walton League of America,      National Wildlife Federation, Theodore Roosevelt Conservation      Partnership, Trout Unlimited.                                  ____                                League of Conservation Voters,                                 Washington, DC, January 12, 2016.     Re Oppose extreme attack on clean water, S.J. Res. 22     U.S. House of Representatives,     Washington, DC.       Dear Representative: The League of Conservation Voters      (LCV) works to turn environmental values into national      priorities. Each year, LCV publishes the National      Environmental Scorecard, which details the voting records of      members of Congress on environmental legislation. The      Scorecard is distributed to LCV members, concerned voters      nationwide, and the media.       LCV urges you to vote NO on S.J. Res. 22, the Congressional      Review Act ``Resolution of Disapproval'' of the Clean Water      Rule. This radical legislative measure would threaten      critical clean water safeguards for the waterways that      millions of Americans depend on for drinking water by      permanently blocking the Environmental Protection Agency's      and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' final Clean Water Rule.       Since two confusing Supreme Court decisions over a decade      ago, millions of acres of wetlands and thousands of miles of      streams that contribute to the drinking water of one in three      Americans have been left vulnerable to toxic dumping and      destruction. After an extensive and thorough process, the      final Clean Water Rule provides clarity and certainty on the      waters covered under the Clean Water Act. These waterways      serve as habitat for wildlife, guard against flooding, filter      pollution, and help provide the clean water that our      families, communities, and economy depend on. The Clean Water      Rule enjoys wide support from businesses, conservationists,      sportsmen, farmers, state and local leaders, and the public,      including the over 800,000 people who weighed in during the      comment period and 80% of voters from all sides of the      political aisle.       S.J. Res. 22 is an extreme dirty water resolution that      would not only stop the Clean Water Rule, but would prohibit      the agencies from developing any ``substantially similar''      measure in the future. This vague and harmful language could      prevent the agencies from ever issuing rules that establish      protections for the waters covered by the Clean Water Rule,      leaving our streams, wetlands, lakes, and rivers vulnerable      to pollution for generations to come.       We urge you to REJECT S.J. Res 22 a dangerous bill that      would block the Clean Water Rule and jeopardize the waterways      our children and grandchildren drink, swim, and play in. We      will strongly consider including votes on this bill in the      2016 Scorecard. If you need more information, please call my      office at (202) 785-8683 and ask to speak with a member of      our government relations team.           Sincerely,                                                   Gene Karpinski,     President.                                  ____                                               Healing Our Waters-                                        Great Lakes Coalition,                                                 January 11, 2016.       Dear Representative: On behalf of the Healing Our Waters-     Great Lakes Coalition, I ask you to vote against S.J. Res.      22.       The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Army Corps      have spent years talking to the public, including state and      local governments, about providing clarity to which water      bodies will be covered by federal law. After being asked to      propose a rule by stakeholders from all sides, the EPA and      Army Corps did so after receiving nearly one million comments      regarding what they proposed. Many of these comments      suggested substantive changes on how to define what a water      of the United States is. The EPA and Army Corps incorporated      many of the suggestions in the rule finalized last year.       S.J. Res. 22 stops these clean water protections from going      into force. More radically, it prohibits the EPA and Army      Corps from proposing anything that would be substantially the      same as what has already been developed after years of      deliberation.       For years the Clean Water Act protected all wetlands and      tributaries in and around the Great Lakes. However, Supreme      Court decisions in 2001 (SWANCC) and 2006 (Rapanos) left many      of these wetlands, small streams, and lakes at increased risk      of being polluted and destroyed. This lack of protection in      particular left intermittent and headwater streams vulnerable      to pollution and adjacent wetlands open to be filled and      destroyed. Half of the streams in Great Lakes states do not      flow all year, putting them, and adjacent wetlands, at risk      of increased pollution and destruction. Over 117 million      Americans get their drinking water from surface waters,      including nearly 37 million people in Minnesota, Wisconsin,      Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New      York. More importantly, 83 percent of the population in Great      Lakes states are dependent on public drinking water systems      that rely in intermittent, ephemeral, and headwater streams.       Protecting and restoring wetlands and streams is critical      to the restoration and protection of the Great Lakes.      According to a review of more than a thousand publications      from peer-reviewed scientific literature conducted by an EPA      Science Advisory Board, streams, tributaries (e.g.,      headwater, intermittent, ephemeral), and wetlands are      connected to downstream waters. The science overwhelmingly      concludes that upstream waters in tributaries (intermittent,      ephemeral, etc.) exert strong influence on the physical,      biological, and chemical integrity of downstream waters.      Common sense also tells us this is true. Pollution in a      tributary is carried downriver into bigger and bigger      waterways. Upstream waters also feed water to Great Lakes      rivers and streams.       We need clean water protections now for our Great Lakes.      Wetlands and tributaries provide vital habitat to wildlife,      waterfowl, and fish; reduce flooding; provide clean water for      hunting, fishing, swimming, and paddling; and serve as the      source of drinking water for millions of Americans. Healthy      waters around the Great Lakes also fuel tourism and other      industries that sustain jobs because of clean Great Lakes      water. The     Clean Water Rule is an important part of our Great Lakes      restoration efforts.       Please vote against S.J. Res. 22. For more information      about our Coalition's position, please contact Chad Lord.

Our breweries cannot operate without a reliable, clean      water supply. We strongly support the Clean Water Act, one of      our nation's bedrock environmental laws, as well as the Clean      Water Rule, which provides important clarity regarding which      waterbodies are covered by the Act.       That is why we urge you to oppose Senate Joint Resolution      22, that would prohibit the Environmental Protection Agency      (EPA) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers from doing ``a new      rule that is substantially the same'' as the Clean Water      Rule. That could be read to prohibit EPA and the Army Corps      from issuing any rule that establishes protections for waters      that the Clean Water Rule protects, like lakes, streams, and      wetlands.       Our breweries--and the communities in which we operate--     need a strong Clean Water Act, as well as the clarity      provided by the Clean Water Rule.       For more information, please see www.nrdc.org/brewers or      call Karen Hobbs, Senior Policy Analyst, Natural Resources      Defense Council.                                  ____                                                 January 12, 2016.       Representative: The undersigned organizations, and our      millions of members and supporters, oppose the Dirty Water      Resolution (S.J. Res. 22). The ``Resolution of Disapproval''      under the Congressional Review Act attacks the Clean Water      Rule, the Obama administration's landmark initiative to      restore safeguards against pollution and destruction for      lakes, streams, wetlands and other water bodies.       The Clean Water Rule restores important safeguards that      once existed for a variety of water bodies. Those safeguards      were eroded after a pair of Supreme Court decisions and by      policies the Bush administration adopted, which left many      water bodies inadequately protected or lacking the pollution      control requirements of the Clean Water Act. The rule      restores prior protections for many critical wetlands, which      curb flooding, filter pollution, and provide habitat for a      wide variety of wildlife, including endangered species and      wildfowl and fish prized by hunters and anglers.       The Dirty Water Resolution is an extreme action that seeks      to kill the Clean Water Rule using the Congressional Review      Act, which goes far beyond stopping a disapproved      administrative action. The Congressional Review Act says that      an agency may not adopt ``a new rule that is substantially      the same'' as the disapproved rule, and the breadth of that      requirement is very unclear.       In the context of the Clean Water Rule, it could be read to      prohibit EPA and the Army Corps from issuing any rule that      establishes protections for waters that the Clean Water Rule      covers, like lakes, streams, and wetlands. The Dirty Water      Resolution radically undermines the agencies' ability to      clarify the jurisdiction of the Clean Water Act--despite      urging from industry associations, conservation groups,      members of Congress, state and local leaders, and Supreme      Court justices for such a clarification.       By pursuing this anti-clean water resolution, pro-polluter      members of the House of Representatives are seeking to kill a      commonsense and modest rule containing scientifically-sound      and legally-valid protections for the nation's waters,      including critical drinking water supplies.       Restored clean water protections enjoy broad support. In      polling for the American Sustainable Business Council, eighty      percent of small business owners--including 91% of Democrats,      73% of Independents and 78% of Republicans--said they      supported the then-proposed Clean Water Rule. A strong      majority, 71%, also said that clean water protections are      necessary to ensure economic growth; only six percent said      they were bad for growth. Similarly, a bipartisan research      team polled hunters and anglers nationwide and discovered      that 83% surveyed thought that the Environmental Protection      Agency should apply the rules and standards of the Clean      Water Act to smaller, headwater streams and wetlands. Support      for this policy was strong across the political spectrum,      with 77% of Republicans, 79% of Independents and 97% of      Democrats in favor.       We ask that you oppose the Dirty Water Resolution (S.J.      Res. 22) because it will undermine protections for our      drinking water supplies, flood buffers, and fish and wildlife      habitat. This attack on clean water is not only a waste of      the House's time but also an excessive and dangerous act that      jeopardizes clean water for generations to come.

Hon. Paul Ryan,     Speaker of the House, U.S. Capitol, Washington, DC.     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,     Democratic Leader, House of Representatives,     U.S. Capitol, Washington, DC.       Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi: The undersigned public      health organizations urge you to oppose a piece of harmful      legislation: S.J. Res. 22, a Congressional Review Act      resolution to block the Clean Water Rule proposed by the U.S.      Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and U.S. Army Corps of      Engineers. This resolution is a sweeping attack on the Clean      Water Act that could not only impair the Clean Water Rule,      but also our ability to protect clean water in the future.      The public health community recognizes that clean water and      healthy populations are inextricably linked and that polluted      water can expose Americans to harmful contaminants in      numerous ways. The public depends on water not only for basic      survival, but for recreation, bathing, cleaning and cooking.      The EPA and Army Corps should be allowed to implement a rule      that will improve water quality and protect the health of      America's families and children.       The Clean Water Act was designed to keep pollution,      including carcinogens, nutrient runoff, sewage and oil, out      of the nation's water. The EPA and Army Corp's rule seeks to      clarify the protection of streams and wetlands under the      Clean Water Act, including streams that provide some portion      of water to drinking water systems that serve nearly 117      million people. The rule, which is based on peer reviewed      science, clarifies which waters are protected and which are      not, allowing EPA and the Army Corps to best protect water      quality and public health. Unfortunately, this bill would      block their efforts and prevent them from implementing the      law and ensuring the protection of water quality for millions      of Americans.       Clean water is one of our greatest necessities and a      cornerstone of public health. EPA and the Army Corps should      be allowed to better protect public health from water      pollution through this important science-based rule.           Sincerely,       American Public Health Association, Physicians for Social      Responsibility, Trust for America's Health.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
