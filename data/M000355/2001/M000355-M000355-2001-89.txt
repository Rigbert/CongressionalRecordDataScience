 President, I rise today in support of language which was included in the manager's amendment to S. 1007. I am pleased that Senators Byrd and Stevens have agree to accept my language which will extend compensation to Department of Energy employees and DoE contractor employees who suffered kidney cancer due to exposure to radiation while working at a DoE defense nuclear facility or nuclear weapons testing site.  Last year, Congress passed the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act as part of the FY 2001 Department of Defense Authorization bill. This measure provides $150,000 lump sum payments as well as payments for medical coverage to Department of Energy Workers who were made ill as a result of exposure to radiation. Unfortunately, when the final version of the bill was drafted the list of covered diseases mistakenly did not include kidney cancer. This was unintentional, and the amendment I have offered will correct this oversight.  The EEOICPA is well on its way toward implementation. Just last week, the Department of Labor opened a resource center in Paducah, KY which will assist workers and their families who were made sick from exposure to radiation while working at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant. As many have pointed out, the employees who worked at these facilities producing the technology which helped America win the Cold War deserve a grateful Nation's support and appreciation. This must include compensation for those workers and their families who may have contracted cancer as a result of their employment.  Again, I thank the managers for their agreement on this important issues of fairness.
