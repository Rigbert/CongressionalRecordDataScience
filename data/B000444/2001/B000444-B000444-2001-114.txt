 President, on July 12, the Committee on Foreign Relations reported S. 1021, a bill to re-authorize the Tropical Forest Conservation Act of 1998 through fiscal year 2004. At the time the bill was reported, the cost estimate from the Congressional Budget Office was not available.  I ask unanimous consent that the CBO estimate be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:        CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE COST ESTIMATE, JULY 16, 2001S. 1021: A Bill To Reauthorize the Tropical Forest Conservation Act of                      1998 Through Fiscal Year 2004 [As reported by the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations on July 12,                                  2001]                                SUMMARY       S. 1021 would extend the Tropical Forest Conservation Act      for three years through 2004 and would authorize the      appropriation of $225 million for the cost of implementing      the act over that period. Assuming the appropriation of the      authorized amounts, CBO estimates that implementing the bill      would cost $221 million over the 2002-2006 period. Because S.      1021 would not affect direct spending or receipts, pay-as-     you-go procedures would not apply.       The Tropical Forest Conservation Act authorizes the      Secretary of State to negotiate agreements with eligible      countries to create local funds administered by local boards      with the authority to make grants to preserve, maintain, and      restore tropical forests. The local funds receive a stream of      payments generated by modifying the terms of outstanding      development assistance or food-aid debt owed to the United      States. The debt modifications include authority to reduce      and to restructure debt, to swap the debt, or to sell the      debt back to an eligible country in ways that will generate      income for the local funds. The amounts authorized by S. 1021      would be used to cover the cost, as defined by the Federal      Credit Reform Act, of modifying the debt.       S. 1021 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector      mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act      (UMRA) and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or      tribal governments.                ESTIMATED COST TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT       The estimated budgetary impact of S. 1021 is shown in the      following table. The costs of     this legislation fall within budget function 150      (international affairs).------------------------------------------------------------------------                                By fiscal year, in millions of dollars--                               -----------------------------------------                                 2001   2002   2003   2004   2005   2006------------------------------------------------------------------------                    SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION Spending Under Current Law for Debt Reduction of Developing Countries with Tropical Forests:    Budget Authority\1\.......     13      0      0      0      0      0    Estimated Outlays.........      6     13      0      0      0      0Proposed Changes:    Authorization Level.......      0     50     75    100      0      0    Estimated Outlays.........      0     13     36     69     64     39Spending Under S. 1021 for Debt Reduction of Developing Countries with Tropical Forests:    Authorization Level\1\....     13     50     75    100      0      0    Estimated Outlays.........      6     26     36     69     64     39------------------------------------------------------------------------\1\ The 2001 level is the amount appropriated for that year for the cost  of implementing the Tropical Forest Conservation Act of 1998.                           BASIS OF ESTIMATE       CBO assumes that the authorized amounts would be      appropriated by the start of each fiscal year and that      outlays would follow historical spending patterns.       Pay-As-You-Go Considerations: None.              INTERGOVERNMENTAL AND PRIVATE-SECTOR IMPACT       S. 1021 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector      mandates as defined in UMRA and would not affect the budgets      of state, local, or tribal governments.                         PREVIOUS CBO ESTIMATE       On June 21, 2001, CBO prepared an estimate for H.R. 2131, a      bill to reauthorize the Tropical Forest Conservation Act of      1998 through fiscal year 2004, and for other purposes, as      ordered reported by the House Committee on International      Relations. The amounts authorized and the estimated cost of      implementing that bill and S. 1021 are the same.       Estimate Prepared By: Federal Costs: Joseph C. Whitehill      (226-2840); Impact on State, Local, and Tribal Governments:      Elyse Goldman (225-3220); and Impact on the Private Sector:      Lauren Marks (226-2940).       Estimate Approved By: Robert A. Sunshine, Assistant      Director for Budget Analysis.                          ____________________
