President, I wish to mark a sad occasion: the recent death of one of Oregon's most respected Members of Congress, Wendell Wyatt, who represented the First District of Oregon from 1965 to 1975. He died peacefully on January 28th at the age of 91 in Portland, OR.  With good humor and little interest in partisanship, Wendell Wyatt's congressional career began with his service on the House Interior Committee. He is best known, however, for his work on the House Interior Appropriations Subcommittee where his working relationship with its chair, distinguished Washingtonian Julia Butler Hansen, was a model of effective teamwork across party lines and--in this case--across the Columbia River that separated their congressional districts.  The same was true of his relationship with Democratic Congresswoman Edith Green, who represented Oregon's Third Congressional District, which includes most of Portland and is the district I was privileged to represent in the House before coming to the Senate. In fact, my Portland office is housed in the Edith Green-Wendell Wyatt Federal Building. Congressman Wyatt and Congresswoman Green--known simply in Oregon as Edith and Wendell--worked tirelessly together on many worthwhile civic projects that improved their city and their adjoining congressional districts. Their good work helped lay the foundation for the Portland we are proud of today.  Wendell Wyatt was an advocate for the Federal workforce in Oregon, Government workers he regarded as good civil servants dedicated to serving the public interest. He also loved the individual service element of his work in Congress. Today, most offices call this ``casework,'' but to Wendell Wyatt it gave him the chance to help an individual constituent with his or her problem when the Federal Government was unresponsive or trying to put a square peg in a round hole. He never disrespected any Government official who was implementing something that had an adverse impact on one of his constituents, but he pressed the case strongly and effectively.  As a young Member of the House, I remember other House members and longtime staffers talking about Wendell with great affection and admiration, someone who worked hard, got results, and always with good humor and without partisanship.  His colleagues during that era in Congress included Gerald Ford, Melvin Laird, George H.W. Bush, and other like-minded House Republican moderates. Like them, he epitomized the saying that ``You could disagree without being disagreeable.'' In Oregon, he was part of a generation of elected officials whose goals were service, not partisanship, including Mark Hatfield and Tom McCall.  When he retired from Congress in 1974, Wendell Wyatt returned to Oregon to become a partner in what is now the State's second largest law firm, Schwabe Williamson & Wyatt, where he is remembered as someone who rolled up his sleeves to help his clients, to close the deal, and to help add economic activity that created jobs for Oregonians.  The commitment to public service runs strong in Wendell Wyatt's family. His son, Bill, was a member of the Oregon Legislature as a young man, later the chief of staff to an Oregon Governor, and is now the very effective executive director of the Port of Portland. Bill Wyatt is a longtime friend of mine and of others in the economic and political leadership of our State, and we all know that the Wyatt bloodline for service to our State has passed from father to son.  I join his family, colleagues in his law firm, and his many good friends in mourning his death. I join the good citizens of the First Congressional District of Oregon, who salute his effective voice for them in Congress. And I stand with so many people throughout Oregon whose lives are better because of Wendell Wyatt's commitment to service in Congress.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of my remarks a few articles about Congressman Wyatt be printed in the Record. First, is the announcement of his death that appeared in the Portland City Club Bulletin, followed by the notice of Wyatt's death that appeared in the Oregonian newspaper and the warm editorial about Wendell. I ask that there next be printed the article in his hometown newspaper, the Daily Astorian, in which local residents reflect on his service to their community. The final document that I request be printed in the Record is the editorial in the Daily Astorian paying tribute to the dignity with which Wendell Wyatt served his district, our State and the Congress.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         [From the Portland City Club Bulletin, Feb. 13, 2009]                  City Club Remembers Wendell J. Wyatt       Former City Club member Wendell J. Wyatt passed away on      Wednesday, January 28 at the age of 91. Wyatt graduated from      the University of Oregon School of Law. He served as an FBI      agent and a Marine Corps pilot before being elected to      Congress where he served a distinguished, decade-long career.      After retiring from office, Wyatt became a partner in the law      firm Schwabe, Williamson & Wyatt.       Wyatt was a Club member for almost twenty years. He made      notable speaking appearances at City Club with the late      Congresswoman Edith Green, and the Federal Building on Third      Street is dedicated jointly in their names. Wyatt's law firm      is a City Club sponsor and his family members continue to      play a significant role in the Club.       Wyatt's contributions to the community will be celebrated      at 1 p.m. Saturday, Feb. 21, 2008 in St. Anne's Chapel at      Marylhurst University.                                  ____                  [From the Oregonian, Jan. 29, 2009]                Ex-congressman Wendell Wyatt Dies at 91                            (By Joan Harvey)       Wendell Wyatt, who represented Oregon's 1st Congressional      District for 10 years, died Wednesday in his Portland home.      He was 91.       Wyatt was a popular and respected Republican lawmaker who      was known as an adroit deal-maker.       As a member of the House Committee on the Interior and      later the powerful House Appropriations Committee, he      finessed through Congress bills that permanently affected      Oregon, including bills that established the Tualatin      Reclamation Project (Scoggins Dam) in Washington County, the      Columbia River 40-foot shipping channel from Astoria to      Portland, and Lincoln City's Cascade Head Scenic Area, as      well as a bill authorizing the $4 million purchase of      ranchlands along the Snake River for public recreation.       He stayed active in Republican politics after retiring from      Congress. He became a partner in the law firm of Schwabe      Williamson & Wyatt, and was a commissioner for the Port of      Portland and a lobbyist. He became inactive as an attorney in      2001 but continued consulting for the firm.       In 1975, he pleaded guilty to a technical violation of      federal campaign laws, admitting that as chairman of the      Oregon Committee to Re-Elect the President, he failed to      report a donation to President Richard Nixon's campaign. The      Oregonian defended him in an editorial:       ``He has had a long and honorable career both in private      and public life, including 10 years in Congress; and he has      gained the reputation of being not only an exceptionally      effective public servant, but one who is scrupulously honest      in all of his dealings. He has had both the respect and warm      friendship of colleagues in both parties. No one who knows      him well believes he intentionally violated the law.''       Wyatt was born June 15, 1917, in Eugene and moved to      Portland as a teenager. He was editor of the Jefferson High      School newspaper and went to the University of Oregon. He      dropped out and joined The Oregonian as a copy aide. After a      year, he applied to the University of Oregon Law School and      was admitted without an undergraduate degree.       Wayne Morse was one of his professors, and Wyatt often      recalled four-hour evening sessions led by the man who would      become the legendary ``Tiger of the Senate.'' Later, the two      became political adversaries.       After obtaining his law degree, he was an FBI agent and      then served as a Marine Corps pilot in the Pacific during      World War II.       He moved to Astoria after the war and joined the law firm      of Albin Norblad, a former Oregon governor and father of U.S.      Rep. Walter Norblad; after Walter Norblad died in 1964, Wyatt      was elected to fill his vacancy. He was re-elected four      times, retiring in 1975, the same year colleague and friend      Edith Green, a Democratic congresswoman for 20 years, stepped      down. The federal building in downtown Portland is named for      Green and Wyatt.       Wyatt married Anne Elizabeth Buchanan in the mid-1940s;      they divorced. He married Faye Hill in 1962. She predeceased      him. He is survived by daughters, Ann Wyatt and Jane Wyatt;      stepdaughter, Sandi Kinsley; son, Wendell ``Bill'' Jr.,      executive director of the Port of Portland; stepson, Larry D.      Hill; four grandchildren; and one great-grandchild.       A memorial service will be at 1 p.m. Saturday, Feb. 21,      2009, in St. Anne's Chapel at Marylhurst University. The      family suggests remembrances to the Clatsop County Historical      Society. Arrangements are by Finley's Sunset Hills Mortuary.                                  ____             Wendell Wyatt: Success Through Personal Values                   (By The Oregonian Editorial Board)       Back when Rep. Wendell Wyatt, R-Ore., was in Congress, from      1965 to 1975, you didn't hear the word bipartisan much,      because at many levels of American politics, it was a way of      life, thus taken for granted.       Wyatt died this week at age 91 after a life in politics,      law and community leadership. He should be remembered as      someone who     put the problems of his individual constituents at the      forefront of his service in the U.S. House of      Representatives.       His congressional office was geared toward listening to      constituent problems, then bending every effort to solve      them--whether the issue was of great national or regional      import or simply a mishandled Social Security benefit. Wyatt      himself often got personally engaged in the most challenging      and vexing details of constituent service.       It would not have been useful for Wyatt or his constituents      for him to adopt a highly partisan stance when he was in      Congress.       He was elected to the House in the small GOP freshman class      of 1964, the year that Democratic President Lyndon B. Johnson      laid a historic electoral whipping on Sen. Barry Goldwater,      R-Ariz., the great hope of the right wing of the Republican      party.       It was clear that Wyatt was never going to be part of the      majority, and he never was. Thus he had to develop the skills      necessary to adequately represent all of the people of      Oregon's 1st Congressional District.       ``This was more effective than sitting in the back benches      and throwing spitballs all day long,'' said his son Bill      Wyatt. Instead, the elder Wyatt developed good working      relationships with powerful Democrats such as Wayne Aspinall,      D-Colo., chairman of the House Interior Committee and Tom      Foley, who also entered Congress in 1964 and, much later,      became Speaker of the House for a short time.       As a congressman, Wyatt was pro-choice, pro-gun-control and      the driving force behind efforts to bring commerce to Oregon      via the Columbia River. His social views would not sit well      in the modern Republican Party, at least the official part of      it. They didn't sit that well with the party's establishment      back then either, but it still was possible to disagree and      be independent-minded and still remain in good standing      within the party. Today? It's not as clear. But Wyatt's views      then are positions that many Republicans hold privately--or      even not-so-privately--today, even if the right's hold on      party leadership is much stronger.       For Wyatt, though, service was a far bigger motivator than      political ideology. In his last campaign, Wyatt even went      retail with his orientation toward constituents. His campaign      slogan was: ``Wendell Wyatt, your door-to-door Congressman.''       His son Bill, of course, has been prominent in Oregon      political and economic circles for years, serving as chief of      staff for Gov. John Kitzhaber and now as executive director      of the Port of Portland. Bill Wyatt also tried elective      politics early in his career, as a Democratic candidate for      the Oregon Legislature. Worried about whether he would      somehow step on his father's political toes, the younger      Wyatt brought the matter up. ``He told me, `What makes you      happy makes me happy. You don't have to protect me from what      you think is the right thing to do.','' Bill Wyatt said. ``He      was able to separate what was most important to him and keep      it there.''       That was the key to what made Wendell Wyatt successful in      life--public and private.                                  ____                [From the Daily Astorian, Feb. 9, 2009]       North Coast Mourns Former Oregon Congressman Wendell Wyatt                           (By Patrick Webb)       Former Astoria Congressman Wendell Wyatt died Wednesday. He      was 91.       Wyatt, a Republican, served the 1st Congressional District      from 1964 until retiring in 1975.       Tributes to him focused on his honesty and his ability to      get the job done.       Denny Thompson of Astoria, who served as honorary Finnish      Consul for 35 years, worked closely with Wyatt and praised      his ability to reach across the aisle.       ``My union friends were all Democrats, but they were      working for Wendell Wyatt. They all respected him and he      respected everyone in return,'' said Thompson, whose wife,      Frankye, was Wyatt's campaign chairwoman for Clatsop County.       ``He did everything the proper way--he was completely      honest, and he did as much for Clatsop County as anyone.''       Wyatt was a well-respected Republican leader who worked      especially effectively with Democrat Congresswoman Edith      Green. The federal building in Portland was later named for      them.       Born in Eugene in 1917, Wyatt moved with his family to      Portland. He graduated from Jefferson High School, where he      had been editor of the high school newspaper, in 1935. He      worked briefly as a copy aide for The Oregonian newspaper,      earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Oregon in      1941 then worked briefly as an FBI agent.       When World War II broke out in the Pacific, he enlisted in      the U.S. Marine Air Corps and served as a pilot from 1942      until 1946.       Afterward, he moved to Astoria and worked for the law firm      of Albin Norblad, the former Oregon governor and father of      U.S. Rep. Walter Norblad.       Tom Brownhill, of Eugene, was district attorney in Clatsop      County from 1952 to 1960 and regularly faced Wyatt in the      courtroom. ``I had a lot of cases against him,'' said      Brownhill, whose daughter Paula, continues the family's legal      tradition as a circuit court judge. ``As a lawyer, when he      got into a case, he was all-in.''       Wyatt hired longtime legal secretary Doris Hughes from      another firm in the 1950s--by offering her a raise from $160      to $200 a month. Hughes remembered Wyatt today as a      ``wonderful person.''       ``He gave the best dictation of anyone I know,'' she      recalled. ``He was so smooth. The words just flowed out.''       Wyatt was chairman of the Oregon State Republican Central      Committee from 1955 until 1957. During that time, George C.      Fulton, of Astoria, another contemporary, worked closely with      him while serving as Clatsop County GOP chairman.       Fulton, also an attorney, described Wyatt as a hard worker.      ``He was a good lawyer. He worked hard and he played hard.''       When Walter Norblad died in 1965, Wyatt was elected to his      congressional seat and served five terms, retiring in 1974.       Ted Bugas, a Bumblebee Seafood executive and supporter of      Salmon For All, knew Wyatt because both had worked for the      FBI and their Astoria offices were in the Post Office and      across the street.       He recalled one incident as if yesterday.       ``One morning we woke up and thought `There's someone in      the house! The wife and I were still in bed. In came      Wendell--into our room--and said, `I might go to Congress.      What do you think of that?' ''       Bugas worked with Wyatt on fisheries issues, often      traveling to Washington, D.C., often for lobbying efforts.      His daughter, Christine, served as an intern in Wyatt's      Congressional office.       ``He was a great personality,'' said Bugas, who splits his      time in retirement between Astoria and California. ``He was      very pleasant.''       He worked on bills that established the Tualatin      Reclamation Project in Washington County and the 40-foot      shipping channel in the Columbia River from Astoria to      Portland.       He was also credited with bills that created Lincoln City's      Cascade Head Scenic Area, as well as a bill authorizing the      $4 million purchase of ranchlands along the Snake River for      public recreation.       U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley said, ``Wendell Wyatt truly made his      mark on Oregon. Everyone who has appreciated Cascade Head      owes Congressman Wyatt a debt of gratitude for establishing      this scenic area and those who visit public lands along the      Snake River can thank Wendell Wyatt for opening the region to      recreation.''       The Daily Astorian Publisher Steve Forrester covered      Wyatt's political activities in 1974 while substituting for      Washington columnist A. Robert Smith.       ``Wyatt said to me that he earned `the equivalent of a      master's degree' every time he took on a new issue. He was      the kind of Republican we no longer see--a solid, pragmatic      middle-of-the-road guy,'' Forrester said.       ``He was close to President Richard Nixon, and he was      unfortunately tarred with that brush when he admitted to his      involvement with Nixon's fund-raising--an embarrassing moment      in an otherwise unblemished political career.''       In 1975, Wyatt admitted a technical violation of campaign      laws for failing to report an Oregon GOP donation to Nixon.       He stayed active in Republican politics after retiring from      Congress and became a partner in the law firm of Schwabe      Williamson and Wyatt until his retirement.       He became inactive as an attorney in 2001, but continued      consulting for the firm. He also served as a commissioner for      the Port of Portland and a lobbyist.       Wyatt was married twice. He divorced his first wife, Anne      Elizabeth Buchanan. He married Faye Hill in 1962. She died      last year. He had two daughters, Ann and Jane, and a son,      Wendell ``Bill'' Wyatt Jr., who is executive director of the      Port of Portland and a former chief of staff for Gov. John      Kitzhaber, plus step son and stepdaughter, four grandchildren      and one great grandchild.       A memorial service will be held 1 p.m. Feb. 21 at St.      Anne's Chapel at Marylhurst University near Lake Oswego.      Contributions may go to the Clatsop County Historical      Society.                                  ____                [From the Daily Astorian, Feb. 2, 2009]                   Wendell Wyatt Served With Dignity       Wendell Wyatt, who died last week, was one of those old-     school, gentlemanly fellows who served his country and his      community without the need for a brass band playing in the      background.       A Republican, he served the 1st Congressional District,      which includes Astoria and the North Coast, from 1965 until      retiring in 1975.       An Oregonian through and through, he moved to Astoria to      practice law after serving as a U.S. Marine Air Corps pilot      in World War II. His buddies around the courthouse smile when      they remember he practiced law with what they describe as      ``considerable tenacity.''       When Congressman Walter Norblad died in office, Wyatt took      over.       In the decade that followed, he served with dignity and      pragmatism. Often politicians wax eloquent about bipartisan      efforts but don't really mean it. Wyatt talked the talk, and      walked the walk, working especially closely with Democrat      Congresswoman Edith Green, to get the job done.       On fisheries issues, he worked to ensure the interests of      the Columbia River came first.       Oregon U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley summed it up best: ``Wendell      Wyatt truly made his mark on Oregon.''                          ____________________
