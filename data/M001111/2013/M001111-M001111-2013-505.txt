 President, we do have a vote that needs to occur but a final word here. I would just say that we want to get a budget passed, and I know the minority wants us to pass a budget. We have been told that time and time again. We can't pass a budget if we are filibustered by amendments for the rest of the night.  So I would urge all our colleagues to have this vote, and let's have some discussions and see if we can come to a final conclusion.  With that, I ask for the yeas and nays.
