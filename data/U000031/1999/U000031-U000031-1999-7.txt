Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds. I just want to thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. LaFalce). He has been a leader in this effort, helping to line up cosponsors in our effort to repeal this on our bill, more than 114, I believe, at this point. We certainly have appreciated his work on that side of the aisle and with our friends on this issue. We thank him for that time.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Metcalf).
