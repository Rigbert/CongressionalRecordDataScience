 President, it is my pleasure to honor Henry Mancini, a fine composer, conductor, and arranger. Mr. Mancini was one of the most versatile musical talents and one of America's most celebrated musicians of the twentieth century. He lent his talents to many films and television series, the themes and melodies of which are recognizable to listeners the world over, even if they are unfamiliar with the name of the composer.  April 16 would have been Henry Mancini's 80th birthday. Even though Mr. Mancini passed away in 1994 after a long battle with cancer, his contribution to music and the arts has not been forgotten.  The United States Postal Service will unveil the Henry Mancini commemorative stamp next week. The unveiling ceremony on April 13 will take place at the Music Center Plaza in Los Angeles and will be hosted by our distinguished former colleague, John Glenn, a longtime friend of Mancini. Senator Glenn, it might be added, took a recording of Mancini's timeless classic, ``Moon River,'' on his return to space in October 1998.  In his lifetime, Henry Mancini's masterful talents were recognized with 72 Grammy Award nominations and 20 Grammy wins, eighteen Academy Award nominations and four Oscar wins, and a Golden Globe.  While awards are a notable measure of talent, the scope of Mr. Mancini's work is more impressive than the nominations he received for that work. During the 1950s, Mr. Mancini had a hand in the scores of over 100 films produced by Universal-International Studios. It was also at Universal that Mr. Mancini met Blake Edwards, and together they worked on 26 films over 30 years. These collaborations produced some of Mancini's most popular and award-winning compositions, including the ``Peter Gunn'' television series, ``Breakfast at Tiffany's,'' ``The Pink Panther'' films, and ``Victor/Victoria.''  In all, over 500 of Mr. Mancini's works were published. Mr. Mancini recorded over 90 albums with styles from jazz to classical, including eight albums certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America. As an in-demand concert performer, he logged over 600 symphony performances, and conducted such symphony orchestras as the London Symphony Orchestra, the Israel Philharmonic, the Los Angeles Philharmonic, and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.  Andy Williams said at Mancini's 70th birthday celebration: ``The wonders of Henry Mancini will be heard in every corner of the world right up to the minute this planet cools and shrinks to the size of an eighth note.'' But it is more than the music he composed that will be Henry Mancini's legacy.  In honor of Mancini's dedication to educating young musicians, the Henry Mancini Institute was founded in Los Angeles in 1997 by his longtime friend and fellow composer, Jack Elliott. The Henry Mancini Institute's mission is to nurture the future of music by providing comprehensive professional training and multilevel outreach programs that make a direct impact in people's lives. Mr. Mancini himself established scholarships and fellowships at the Nation's top music schools. Many of tomorrow's composers, conductors, and arrangers have benefited from Mancini programs at New York's Julliard School of Music his alma mater, and in Los Angeles at USC and UCLA.  I would also like to recognize the Mancini family, who has gracefully embraced Henry's legacy and allowed for future generations of musicians to celebrate his accomplishments and contributions. My good friend Ginny Mancini, whom he married in 1947, has relentlessly worked to bring about the creation of this stamp, as have their children: Christopher, Monica, and Felice.  Honoring Henry Mancini with this commemorative stamp will serve as a lasting tribute, just as his music is a lasting gift to the world.                          ____________________
