President, if there is no further business today, I now ask unanimous consent that the Senate stand adjourned under the provisions of S. Res. 220, as a mark of further respect to the memory of our late colleague, Senator Craig Thomas.  There being no objection, the Senate, at 8:53 p.m., adjourned until Wednesday, June 6, 2007, at 9:30 a.m.                          ____________________
