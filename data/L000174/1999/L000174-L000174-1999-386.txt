President, we have several Senators on the floor seeking recognition. The Senator from Minnesota, of course, had the floor. We are going to take a look at his amendment, which would not be in order for a vote right now. I listened to very much of what he had to say.  I am wondering if we could have an agreement that the Senator from New Jersey be recognized, the Senator from Oregon be recognized, and the Senator from Illinois be recognized next in that order.
