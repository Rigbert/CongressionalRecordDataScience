  Mr. DeFAZIO. Madam Speaker, sequestration. You know, it's inside-the-Beltway talk. What does it mean? It means stupid, across-the-board budget cuts.  Take a program of tremendous public import--whether it's a defense program, public safety program, student financial aid--and cut it 10 percent. Take a turkey, something we don't need anymore, something stupid, obsolete--registering kids for a draft that doesn't exist and will never exist--cut it 10 percent.  So instead of doing targeted cuts and getting rid of programs that we don't need anymore, that don't work anymore, and looking at reasonable revenues, we're going to cut everything 10 percent. It's going to have a real impact.  I was told yesterday by the Office of Management and Budget the first measurable impact is in my district, a 10 percent sequestration of payments to counties in my State from the Interior Department, which means in Douglas County, Oregon, the last 10 road deputies are gone. In another county, which is down to one road deputy, the last road deputy is gone. We're talking about counties the size of States here with no rural law enforcement. That's because of the stupid sequestration.                          ____________________
