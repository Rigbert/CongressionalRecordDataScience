My colleague has certainly made laudatory claims about his bill, but we don't have any evidence of them. In fact, the comment made by my colleague highlights my concern. What we have seen thus far for middle-class families after 2027 is that upward of half of them would pay more in taxes.  I think, rather than continue this, I will just ask my colleague to see if his side can produce an actual document--even a summary--of what this new bill is actually going to mean for middle-class families who are concerned, based on the earlier versions, about seeing their taxes go up, particularly after 2027.  I have one question for my colleague from Maryland because he has been talking about the State and local deduction, which is enormously important to folks in my State and in my colleague's as well.  My question is, when the first income tax was enacted in 1861, it was to finance the cost of the Civil War. It included only one deduction at that time for State and local taxes, and that was really composed to respect the States' ability to make their own fiscal decisions. It was the first deduction more than a century ago. So does that seem like a special interest tax break compared to this list of more than 30 breaks that we have managed to excavate from various corners of K Street?
