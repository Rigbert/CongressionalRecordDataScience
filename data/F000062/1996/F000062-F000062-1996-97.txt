 President, I rise today in support of my amendment to make $4 million from the Army's Research, Development, Test and Evaluation available to acquire a real-time,demonstrated, automatic cargo tracking and control system. This cargo tracking and control system is designed to assure that the smooth flow of cargo and to reduce the occurrence of misplaced cargo at Army ports. This demonstrated cargo tracking mechanism makes it possible for the manager of a port, rail yard, or other cargo distribution area to know where each container is and to move those containers without risk of being lost.  The Army has already witnessed massive unreported but costly loss of cargo location in storage following Vietnam and Desert Storm. The Army made previous attempts to purchase this tracking system but was unable to do so due to funding constraints. It is my understanding that the Army Material Command would like to use $4 million from Army Research, Development, Technology, and Evaluation budget line PE0603804A.  I am pleased that this amendment is acceptable and I thank the managers of the bill.
