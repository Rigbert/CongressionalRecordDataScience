Speaker, with the death of Louis Goldstein on July 3, Maryland, as well as the entire country, lost a great patriot, dutiful public servant, and loving individual.  Louis Lazarus Goldstein died at the age of 85, having spent all of his adult life in the service of his fellow citizens. He was in some ways a simple, unassuming man, and in other ways, an extremely complicated one. He loved people, his family, history, the United States marines, the state of Maryland, the Democratic Party, and America. He served all of them in turn, and served them with enthusiasm and faithfulness.  Louis was larger than life when he lived, and he will become even larger in a his death. The Louis stories that are legend now will geometrically multiply in years to come. Hopefully, however, we will not lose the reality along the way: his genuine, heartfelt prayer that God would bless each of us real good; his observation that our gift to God was service to others, and his shining example of such service; his brilliance in the administration of his office; and his fidelity to Maryland's citizens and the stewardship of their money.  He was, Mr. Speaker, an unforgettable character who made everyone feel that they were his close friend and objects of his genuine concern, as, indeed, they were. Some thought him hokey, but they saw only the facade. To know Louis was to know how deeply he cared about democracy and individual freedom and civil liberties, and how committed he was to ensuring that every American young person had an opportunity to excel to the limit of his or her talent, and their willingness to expend effort and energy in the pursuit of their goals; how much of his own time and extraordinary political skills he spent ensuring that Washington College and the University of Maryland were places where excellence was encouraged and facilitated; how much he valued the principles of his party, and how strongly he fought for its candidates.  Mr. Speaker, I do not know whether Members have ever met Louis Goldstein, how many of our colleagues have met him. I suspect many. He lit up a room and a podium, a campaign trail and another candidate's events, or certainly his own. He brought common sense and uncommon intellect and integrity to the business of politics.  God granted to Louis and to us 85 vigorous years which Louis used to the utmost. God indeed blessed us real good through the force of nature we knew for the past 40 years as our comptroller; arguably, the most popular tax collector in the history of the world.  Louis Goldstein was a wonderful servant to Maryland and America, and his death is a tragic loss for all. But the happy note is that his life was not a tragedy at all. It was a victory, a celebration, a joy. Louis Goldstein loved life and he gave it his all. He served as a public official for 51 out of his 85 years, not out of a need for power or money or even attention, but out of his earnest desire to help those less fortunate and make a difference in the lives of others. His legacy will no doubt live on, and serve as a much needed model for future leaders of our State, for future leaders of our country.  All of us would do well to emulate his charity towards all and malice towards none. Louis Lazarus Goldstein will be missed.  Louis Lazarus Goldstein first came into my life in 1962, 36 years ago. He was my friend, he was my mentor, he was an adviser and counselor. He was an extraordinary human being. He ended every speech, as I have alluded to, with, ``May God bless you all real good.'' God blessed us through Louis Goldstein.                          ____________________
