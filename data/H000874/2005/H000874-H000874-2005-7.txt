 He came to this floor, and he said he was ashamed. He was ashamed because of a bank scandal. It wasn't handled very well but there were no tax dollars involved, nobody lost anything and the account at Riggs Bank was never overdrawn. But, my friends, under his administration over the last 5 years, $1.5 trillion in deficits.  Now, let me tell you something. Economic performance, these are facts. This is not Dickens or Chaucer or Shakespeare or anybody else. These are facts from your budget book. Average weekly earnings, Bush I, minus 1.1 percent; Bush II, minus three-tenths of 1 percent; Bill Clinton, plus eight-tenths of 1 percent; Median household income, Bush I, minus eight-tenths of 1 percent; Bush II, minus nine-tenths of 1 percent; Clinton, plus 1.6 percent.                              {time}  0530  Poverty, Bush I, went up 1.8 percent. Bush II it has gone up 1.4 percent; Clinton, down 3.5 percent. Jobs, you talked about jobs. Bush I, plus-2.13 million; Bush II, now about 4 million; Clinton, 21 million new jobs average. Now, let me give you the averages. Bush I, 44,500 per month; Bush II, 34,678 per month; Clinton, 228,464 per month. Real GDP. Bush I, up 2.1; Clinton, plus-3.6 percent; Bush II, plus-2.6 percent.  Now, ladies and gentlemen, we like a lot of polls. The Dow Jones, that is sort of a poll on economic security, growth, confidence in our economy, Dow Jones under Bush I, up 46.7 percent. Under Bush II, now it has gone up a little bit the last few days, about 1 percent, from the time he took over to now.  Now, listen to this, my friends. This is a poll that counts about people who think our economy is doing well. Up under Clinton, remember it was 46 percent under Bush I, 1 percent under this President, under Bill Clinton, 255 percent increase in those 8 years.  So in conclusion, my friend, I will tell you that on every statistic, the representations you have made have been wrong. I will tell you the last 2 months, the last 2 months, ladies and gentlemen, the deficit in America went up $130 billion of deficit spending in just the last 2 months. That is the fiscal management that presents this program on the floor today. America ought to reject it, and we surely should on their behalf.
