Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, this bill is necessary for the proper functioning of the Federal court system. The legislation addresses various judicial process matters, as well as personnel and compensation issues. I will briefly mention a few of the major provisions included in this legislation.  The bill makes changes in places of holding court in order to alleviate hardships placed upon parties, jurors, lawyers, and judges that must otherwise travel great distances to participate. This will have a positive impact on the administration of justice.  The bill will permit judges to submit annual summary reports on wiretap orders acted on during the previous calendar year, such as prosecutors do. This change would simplify the reporting requirements for the judges and their staffs without affecting the accuracy or timeliness of the reporting required by statute.  The bill gives territorial judges in the District Courts of Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Virgin Islands comparable retirement arrangements as other judges.  The bill includes the judicial branch personnel in the Organ Donor Leave Program, and provides Federal judges with protection against the malicious recording of fictitious liens.  The manager's amendment makes only noncontroversial technical changes.  Section 101 is amended to clarify that bankruptcy administrators in North Carolina and Alabama have the same authority as U.S. trustees to appoint bankruptcy case trustees, standing trustees, examiners, and committees of creditors and equity security holders. It also corrects several highly technical drafting errors.  Finally, Mr. Speaker, section 204 authorizes the Director of the Administrative Office to establish a program of benefits not currently authorized by law. The Judicial Conference request for this authority is based on the conclusion that the health benefits provided for employees of the judicialbranch need to be upgraded to attract and retain employees in future years.  The Administrative Office intends to expand an existing cafeteria health benefit plan by adding a dental benefits program to it. The judiciary currently provides health benefit programs which involve the use of employee compensation contributions to medical savings accounts and long-term disability accounts. These health care costs can then be paid with pretax dollars. The dental program will require appropriated funds, and enactment of section 204 will allow the judiciary to seek funding for it from the Committee on Appropriations.  The authority provided in section 204 is not intended to provide open-ended discretion to the Director of the Administrative Office to establish benefit programs. The Committee on the Judiciary and Committee on Government Reform will exercise their oversight responsibility on this program. Also, the Committee on Appropriations will have a significant role to play as appropriations are requested to continue and expand judiciary employee benefits in the future.  I am assured that the Judicial Conference will work closely with the Congress as these programs progress in future years.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4125 will greatly assist the Federal courts in their operation. This is noncontroversial legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support it.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
