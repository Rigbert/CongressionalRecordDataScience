 President, I wish to say a few words about the severe weather that hit my home State of Kentucky yesterday. A large tornado touched down in Mayfield in Graves County in Western Kentucky. It damaged homes and businesses and reportedly injured 10 people as it made its way through that part of my State.  Tornadoes were also reported in Muhlenberg and Union Counties. Thankfully, no deaths have been reported in Kentucky as of the latest news reports. Kentuckians are, as always, reaching out to help their neighbors in times of distress, with reports that local churches and businesses have opened their doors to those displaced by the tornadoes as they recover.  We are thinking today of all the Kentuckians who have been hurt by this severe weather. We continue to monitor the situation, and we are thankful that the damage that has been reported so far was not worse.                          ____________________
