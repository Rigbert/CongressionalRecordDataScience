 President, on May 23, 2002, I was pleased to introduce with Senators Cantwell and Inouye, ``The Spokane Tribe of Indians of the Spokane Reservation Grand Coulee Dam Equitable Compensation Act.'' This bill will provide compensation to the Spokane Tribe for its contribution to the production of hydropower by the Grand Coulee Dam. This legislation, S. 2567, is very similar to S. 1525, which Senator Inouye and I introduced in the first session of the 106th Congress.  The Grand Coulee Dam is the largest concrete dam in the world, the largest electricity producer in the United States, and the third largest electricity producer in the world. It provides electricity and water to one of the world's largest irrigation projects, the one million acre Columbia Basin Project. The Grand Coulee is the backbone of the Northwest's Federal power grid and agricultural economy. The Dam has provided and continues to provide tremendous economic benefits to the region.  But for the native peoples of this region, the construction of the Grand Coulee Dam came at a very high price. To the Spokane Tribe, the Dam meant an end to a way of life. The dam flooded the Tribe's reservation on two sides. The Spokane River changed from a free flowing waterway that supported plentiful salmon runs to barren slack water that now erodes the southern lands of the reservation. The benefits that accrued to the nation and the Northwest were made possible by uncompensated injury to the Native Americans of the Columbia and Spokane Rivers.  In 1994, Congress enacted settlement legislation to compensate the neighboring Confederated Colville Tribes. That legislation provided a onetime payment of $53 million for past damages and approximately $15 million annually from the proceeds from the sale of hydropower by the Bonneville Power Administration, (BPA).  The Spokane Tribe settlement legislation would provide a settlement proportional to that provided to the Colville Tribes, which was based on the percentage of lands appropriated from the respective tribes for the dam. This translates into 39.4 percent of the past and future compensation awarded the Colville Tribes. S. 2567 would provide a one-time payment of approximately $21 million from the General Treasury as compensation for past damages. The bill would provide from BPA about $10 million to the Tribe to account for payments the Colvilles have received since 1995. In addition, the legislation would direct BPA to allocate approximately $6 million annually to the Spokanes.  Since the 1970s, Congress and Federal agencies have indicated that both the Colville and Spokane Tribes should be compensated. Since 1994, when an agreement was reached to compensate the Colville Tribes, Congress and Federal agencies have expressed interest in providing fair compensation to the Spokane Tribe, too. This legislation will provide for a long overdue settlement for the Spokane Tribe. I hope my colleagues will support this bill. I also hope the Senate Indian Affairs Committee will hold a hearing on S. 2567 at the Chairman's earliest convenience.                          ____________________
