Speaker, it is with great pride and honor that I rise today to pay tribute to an outstanding American, a true patriot, and a hero to his country, Army Pfc. John D. Amos II. Pfc. Amos died Sunday, April 4, 2004 while bravely serving in Operation Iraqi Freedom for the Army's 1st Battalion, 21st Infantry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division (Light), Schofield Barracks. He bravely sacrificed his life to ensure the safety of his fellow soldiers, the Iraqi people, and the very idea of freedom throughout the world.  Pfc. John Amos' unit was sent to the Tamin area of Kirkuk to set up a vehicle inspection point near the police academy. When his unit arrived, residents were conducting a demonstration in the streets surrounding the academy. With the streets cluttered by protesters, Amos' unit began inspecting vehicles and groups of people before they moved through the crowd. Amos was walking in a line of six soldiers when a car attempting to clear the checkpoint exploded. Pfc. Amos was posthumously awarded the Bronze Star and Purple Heart.  Pfc. Amos, a native of Griffith, Indiana, graduated from Valparaiso High School in 2002. Throughout his life, John always had the urge to protect his fellow man. In September 2001, John witnessed a fatal car accident. He tried to help the victim, called 911 and waited for help to arrive. The victim didn't make it and it affected John deeply. It's one of the reasons that prompted him to join the U.S. Army. After the terrorist attacks in 2001, John felt especially compelled to defend the United States.  John Amos is survived by his mother, Susan Amos, his father, John Amos, his sister, Rebecca Amos, two half-brothers, Hunter and Tyler Amos, his grandfather Hank Amos, and grandparents Doug and Lucy Whitehead. John's spirit and compassion will never be forgotten.  Mr. Speaker, at this time I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring the memory of Pfc. John Amos, and in sending our heartfelt condolences to his family. John is a hero, not only to his family and friends, but also to Northwest Indiana and to the United States of America. He fought bravely for the ideals of freedom, truth, and liberty, and as our nation mourns his loss, let us honor his life and his dedication to the service of his country.                          ____________________
