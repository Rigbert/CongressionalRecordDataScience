President, I am happy to join with Senators Cornyn, Kohl, and Whitehouse as we introduce the Vessel Hull Design Protection Act Amendments of 2008. An earlier version of this small but important piece of legislation was passed unanimously by both the Judiciary Committee and the full Senate last year. The updated version of the bill that we offer today reflects conversations we have had recently with the Navy and gives the Department of Defense full assurance that Government and defense designs will not be subject to unwarranted restrictions.  Congress passed the Vessel Hull Design Protection Act in 1998 to recognize the significant time, effort, and innovation involved in ship design. Litigation under the bill, however, has made it clear that in order to be effective, this law needs to be clarified and refined. Our bill does exactly this, and no more, by clarifying the definition of ``hull'' and ``deck.'' This ensures that the intellectual property rights of vessel hull designers will be protected. I hope the Senate will move quickly to pass this revised, bipartisan legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3106       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. VESSEL HULL DESIGN PROTECTION.       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Vessel      Hull Design Protection Amendments of 2008''.

(c) Exceptions.--Section 1301(a) of title 17, United States      Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:       ``(3) Exceptions.--Department of Defense rights in a      registered design under this chapter, including the right to      build to such registered design, shall be determined solely      by operation of section 2320 of title 10, the United States      Code, or by the instrument under which the design was      developed for the United States Government.''.       (d) Definitions.--Section 1301(b) of title 17, United      States Code, is amended--       (1) in paragraph (2), by striking ``vessel hull, including      a plug or mold,'' and inserting ``vessel hull or deck,      including a plug or mold,'';       (2) by striking paragraph (4) and inserting the following:       ``(4) A `hull' is the exterior frame or body of a vessel,      exclusive of the deck, superstructure, masts, sails, yards,      rigging, hardware, fixtures, and other attachments.''; and       (3) by adding at the end the following:       ``(7) A `deck' is the horizontal surface of a vessel that      covers the hull, including exterior cabin and cockpit      surfaces, and exclusive of masts, sails, yards, rigging,      hardware, fixtures, and other attachments.''.                                 ______                                       By
