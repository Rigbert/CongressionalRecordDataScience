  This conference agreement represents many weeks of negotiations with the House and the administration, and I am proud of the progress it will bring to our Nation's transportation system.  This conference agreement has already passed the House by an overwhelming margin of 371-11.  In total, the bill includes appropriations and obligation limitations totaling roughly $59.6 billion.  While that is about $1.5 billion more than the fiscal year 2001 level, it is approximately $400 million less than the amount passed by the Senate on August 1.  It was very difficult to pare $400 million out of the Senate bill, but we did so while carefully looking out for the needs of all of the critical agencies within the Department of Transportation as well as the Members' individual priorities.
