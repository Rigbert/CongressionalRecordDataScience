 President, I wish to pay tribute to George M. Van Tassel, who passed away on Monday, June 18, 2007. For 13 years, George served as mayor of my hometown, Tuscaloosa, AL. He was a personal friend of mine and along with the entire town of Tuscaloosa, I mourn his passing.  In the 1930s George moved south from New York to attend the University of Alabama School of Law. There, he met a fellow student, Juarine Berrey, with whom he quickly fell in love. They married in 1934. Several years after his gradation in 1939, George was drafted by the U.S. Army to serve in the European theater during World War II. On D-Day, George was among the soldiers who landed on the beach at Normandy, France.  Upon returning to the States, George began his law practice. In 1956, he was elected to serve as mayor of Tuscaloosa, filling the unexpired term of mayor Hal McCall. Although George oversaw many changes that took place in Tuscaloosa during his three terms as mayor, perhaps his most notable achievement was his initiative to dam the North River and create a 5,885-acre water supply reservoir we call Lake Tuscaloosa.  In 1969, George decided not to run for reelection. An avid hunter and fisherman, he wanted more time to enjoy his hobbies. He returned to the law, managing a successful practice until he retired at age 75.  George is loved and will be missed by his daughter, Linda Ayers of Tuscaloosa, and his son, George M. Van Tassel, Jr., of Birmingham. He was an inspiration to many and will be remembered for his dedication and many contributions to the city of Tuscaloosa. I ask this entire Senate to join me in recognizing and honoring the life of George M. Van Tassel.                          ____________________
