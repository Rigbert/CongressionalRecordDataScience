I thank my colleague and friend for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment, and I urge every single one of my colleagues to vote ``no.''  Every single one of the last five Presidents--including President Reagan and Bush--understood the importance of the United States Institute of peace. USIP is not a think tank. They don't sit in the clouds shouting recommendations. They jump into the conflicts and work side-by-side with DOD and with the Department of State in Afghanistan and Iraq.  Listen to the generals and the commanders who are telling us that USIP saves the life of our soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan. USIP saves American taxpayers dollars around the world. This is not a partisan issue. It is not hawk versus dove. This is basic, common sense--prevent and stop conflict, promote dialogue, build bridges, and save lives.  I ask all of my colleagues to vote ``no.'' It moves us away from peace, this amendment. Give peace a chance. Give peace a chance.
