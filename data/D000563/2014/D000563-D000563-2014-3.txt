President, I speak in support of Jorge Alonso, who has been nominated to serve as a Federal district court judge in the Northern District of Illinois. He will fill the vacancy that opened when Judge Ronald Guzman took senior status last month.  Judge Alonso is an outstanding nominee for the Federal bench. He was reported out of the Judiciary Committee last month on a unanimous voice vote.  I want to thank Chairman Leahy for his efforts to move Judge Alonso's nomination promptly through the Judiciary Committee, and I want to thank the majority leader, Senator Reid, for scheduling this vote on the floor.  Since 2003, Jorge Alonso has served as an associate judge for the Cook County Judicial Circuit. He is currently in his third appointed term as a State trial court judge. Judge Alonso has presided over hundreds of cases that have gone to verdict or judgment, including at least 88 jury trials.  He also presides over the Women's Justice Mental Health Call in Cook County. Judge Alonso helped to create this program, which provides intensive support and services to women in the justice system who have suffered from trauma and addiction.  Prior to serving as a State court judge, Judge Alonso served for 12 years as an assistant public defender in Cook County. As a public defender, he participated in approximately 30 jury trials and 150 bench trials.  In addition to his substantial courtroom and judicial experience, Judge Alonso has an admirable record of service to the Chicago community. Among his activities, he serves on the boards of the Daniel Murphy Scholarship Fund, which provides scholarships and support to low-income Chicago students, and the Cristo Rey Jesuit High School in Chicago's Pilsen neighborhood.  He also works as a judicial intervenor with the Lawyers' Assistance Program, which assists members of the bar who are struggling with mental health or addiction issues.  Judge Alonso came highly recommended to me by a bipartisan judicial screening committee that I established in the Northern District. I was pleased to recommend Judge Alonso's name to the White House for this nomination.  I also thank my colleague, Senator Kirk, for submitting his blue slip in support of the nomination.  In short, Judge Alonso has the experience, the integrity and the judgment to be an excellent addition to the Federal bench in Chicago. I urge my colleagues to support this outstanding nominee.                       Vote on Alonso Nomination
