Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  H.R. 2640, sponsored by our colleague, Mr. Walden of Oregon, is an important step towards restoring water and power abundance and jobs to a rural area that has been devastated by Federal logging restrictions.  This bill is a reflection of years of negotiation, and it is identical to the bill this Chamber passed last year without opposition. Its supporters include those who would normally be water adversaries in most parts of the West. Municipalities, irrigators, the Warm Spring tribes, utilities, organized labor, and an environmental organization have all come together to support this legislation.  I want to commend my friend, the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden), for his good work to bring all these parties together and urge adoption of this legislation.  I reserve the balance of my time.
