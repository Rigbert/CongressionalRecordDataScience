Chairman, the view of the gentleman from Florida and myself is that the juvenile justice system does not work. We see these young people committing offense after offense after offense, and there are absolutely no consequences.  What we are seeking to do with a very small portion of Federal funds is try over the next few years to get States to adopt a new philosophy with respect to juvenile justice so that, when a young person commits their initial offense, the punishment will be specific, but it will not be the most severe----
