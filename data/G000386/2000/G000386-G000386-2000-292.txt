 President, I rise to introduce a bill on removing federal law enforcement officers convicted of felonies.  Under my bill, any federal law enforcement officer, who is convicted of a felony, would have to be removed from his or her position immediately.  Mr. President, my colleagues must be wondering why the Senator from Iowa is offering this legislation. Law enforcement officers convicted of felonies are removed immediately. That's just common sense. Right?  Unfortunately, Mr. President, common sense does not always prevail in the federal bureaucracy.  Common sense is in short supply at one very important place in the Pentagon--the office of the Inspector General or DOD IG.  In October 1999, the Majority Staff on my Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts issued a report on the DOD IG.  I placed the Majority Staff Report in the Record on November 2, 1999.  The Majority Staff Report substantiated allegations of misconduct by senior officials at the Defense Criminal Investigative Service--or DCIS--between 1993 and 1996.  DCIS is the criminal investigative branch in the DOD IG's office.  I would like to remind my colleagues that Mr. Donald Mancuso was the Director of DCIS between 1988 and 1997. Today, Mr. Mancuso is the Deputy DOD IG. He may be a candidate for nomination as the next DOD IG.  Some of the allegations examined in the Majority Staff Report concerned one of Mr. Mancuso's top deputies--an agent by the name of Mr. Larry J. Hollingsworth.  The Hollingsworth case is the driving force behind my bill.  Mr. Hollingsworth was the Director of Internal Affairs at DCIS from April 1991 until his retirement in September 1996.  In July 1995, after a fellow agent recognized Mr. Hollingsworth's photo in a law enforcement crime bulletin, Mr. Hollingsworth was apprehended. His home was searched, and he confessed to filing a fraudulent passport application.  Mr. Hollingsworth was convicted of a felony in U.S. District Court in March 1996.  The authorities who investigated Mr. Hollingsworth's crimes believe that he committed about 12 overt acts of fraud between 1992 and 1994.  Mr. President, can you imagine that?  While he was hammering rank and file agents for minor administrative offenses as head of the Internal Affairs unit, Mr. Hollingsworth was deeply involved in a criminal enterprise of his own.  The State Department agents who investigated the case were troubled by Mr. Hollingsworth's actions. From past experience, they know passport fraud is usually committed in furtherance of a more serious crime. But that crime was never discovered.  While the full extent of Mr. Hollingsworth's crimes remain a mystery, this case has helped to shed a whole lot of light on Deputy IG Mancuso.  Mr. Mancuso personally approved a series of administrative actions that kept a convicted felon in an employed status at DCIS for 6 months.  Mr. Hollingsworth confessed to passport fraud in July 1995. He was convicted in March 1996 and then confined in jail. All this time--for 14 months, Mr. Mancuso kept Mr. Hollingsworth in an employed status at DCIS until September 19,1996.  Mr. President, September 19, 1996 was the magic day. That was Mr. Hollingsworth's 50th birthday.  That was the very first day he was eligible to retire. On that day, he retired with full law enforcement benefits and Mr. Mancuso's blessing.  Mr. Mancuso's generosity will eventually cost the taxpayers a big chunk of money.  The Office of Personnel Management--OPM--estimated Mr. Hollingsworth's annuity will cost the taxpayers at least $750,000.00 through the year 2008.  This is money Mr. Hollingsworth should never collect had Mr. Mancuso exercised sound judgment under the law.  Mr. Mancuso could have removed Mr. Hollingsworth in March 1996 after conviction or maybe even sooner.  Instead, Mr. Mancuso chose to personally protect Mr. Hollingsworth until he reached his 50th birthday and could retire.  Mr Mancuso shielded Mr. Hollingsworth from the law for at least 6 months.  Under the law--5 U.S.C. 7513(b), Mr. Mancuso was authorized to remove Mr. Hollingsworth after conviction--if not sooner.  Mr. President, I underscore the words authorized. DCIS was authorized but not required to remove him.  Under the law, DCIS was granted discretionary authority to decide when--or if--to remove him.  Mr. President, too much discretionary authority in a place so short on common sense can lead to mistakes. The Hollingsworth case was a big mistake.  If my bill had been in effect in 1996, Mr. Hollingsworth would have been removed within 30 days of conviction.  My staff has consulted with OPM on this legislation.  OPM offered some constructive comments on how to strengthen it. Those ideas are now in the bill.  OPM was unaware of any other instance where a federal law enforcement agency had kept a convicted felon in an employed status for 6 months after conviction.  However, OPM could not guarantee that this would never happen again.  The intent of my legislation should be crystal clear: To ensure that personnel management decisions--like those taken by Mr. Mancuso in the Hollingsworth case--are never repeated again.  Over the past 10 months, my staff has spoken with many rank and file law enforcement officers about the special treatment given to Mr. Hollingsworth.  Rank and file agents are universally disgusted by what happened.  They feel--as I do--that law enforcement officers, who are convicted of felonies--should be removed from their posts immediately.  They don't want their badges tarnished by having one of their own, who committed a felony, remain on the job--as Mr. Hollingsworth was allowed to do.  That undermines morale in the ranks.  In closing, I would like to quote from a letter Mr. Mancuso wrote--on official DOD stationery--to Judge Ellis on April 29, 1996.  Judge Ellis was preparing to sentence the convicted felon, Mr. Hollingsworth.  Mr. Mancuso's statements to Judge Ellis were absurd. They were outrageous.  This letter shows that Mr. Mancuso was totally blind to the seriousness of Mr. Hollingsworth's crimes.  In the letter, Mr. Mancuso asked the judge to consider extenuating circumstances. He told the judge that Mr. Hollingsworth had taken a half day's leave to file the fraudulent passport application. Mr. Mancuso praised the convicted felon for this unselfish act. Can you believe that?  This is what Mr. Mancuso said to Judge Ellis, and I quote: ``Mr. Hollingsworth could have come and gone as he pleased,'' but he ``took leave to commit a felony.''  In Mr. Mancuso's mind, the use of personal leave to commit a felony was a sign of moral excellence.  Mr. Mancuso concluded with this telling remark:       To this day, there is no evidence that Mr. Hollingsworth      has ever done anything improper relating to his duties and      responsibilities as a DCIS agent and manager.  Mr. Mancuso's statement to Judge Ellis was misguided for two reasons:  First, incredible as it may seem, Mr. Mancuso--a sworn law enforcement officer and current Deputy DOD IG--feels that it is OK for law enforcement officers to commit crimes so long as the agents are off duty.  Second, Mr. Mancuso's assertion about ``no evidence'' is flat wrong. It's inaccurate.  On February 1, 2000, my staff discovered a DCIS file containing information that refuted Mr. Mancuso's assertions to Judge Ellis about no evidence. It shows that in August 1995, both DCIS and the State Department did, in fact, have evidence that Mr. Hollingsworth had engaged in criminal activity at his desk in DCIS headquarters.  How could the Pentagon's top criminal investigator be so blind to evidence?  This file also contains other important revelations about Mr. Mancuso's misconduct in the Hollingsworth case.  It contains documents that indicate Mr. Mancuso was communicating with defense attorneys during the criminal court proceedings against Mr. Hollingsworth.  For example, it contains a FAX transmittal memo addressed personally to Mr. Mancuso from the defense attorney. Attached was a motion to dismiss charges against Mr. Hollingsworth. But there was no court date stamp or attorney signature on the document. And there were handwritten notes on it. This was a rough draft.  Mr. President, this really bothers me.  Mr. Mancuso--the director of a federal law enforcement agency--was furnished with a rough draft of a motion to dismiss felony charges that the U.S. Attorney was attempting to prosecute.  That is unethical conduct.  The file contains other damaging documents.  They suggest that the current Director of DCIS, Mr. John Keenan, returned 11 confiscated handguns to the convicted felon--Mr. Hollingsworth--in direct contravention of a federal court judgment and statutory law.  DCIS allegedly returned the guns to Mr. Hollingsworth on September 23, 1997, while he was still on supervised probation. This reckless act could have put a probation officer in harm's way.  We also learned that Mr. Hollingsworth was under investigation by the IRS in November 1983 for perjury. That very same month--November 1983, he was hired by DCIS to be the agent in charge of the Chicago Field Office.  The IRS concluded Mr. Hollingsworth had ``committed perjury during rebuttal testimony.'' On December 5, 1983, the IRS referred the matter to the U.S. Attorney in New Orleans for prosecution.  Mr. President, how could DCIS hire Mr. Hollingsworth under such questionable circumstances?  I don't understand it.  Mr. President, Mr. Mancuso went to extraordinary lengths to protect a convicted felon.  By doing what he did, Mr. Mancuso violated a trust that goes with the high office he occupies. He violated the trust that goes with the badge and gun he carries. In our democracy, when those sacred trusts are violated, our only protection is the law.  In this case, the law provides too much discretionary authority. It leaves the door wide open to abuse by irresponsible bureaucrats. We need to close that door.  My bill will close the loophole that Mr. Mancuso exploited in such a crafty way.  Mr. President, I would like to urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important piece of legislation.                                 ______                                       By
