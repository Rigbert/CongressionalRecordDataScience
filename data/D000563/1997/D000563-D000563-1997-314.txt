LOTT. Mr. President, we have a number of Senators that may be requesting time to speak after this. I think we can accommodate the Senator, but I would like to get a minute where maybe we can get all those wrapped up and we will get an agreement during the debate. So the Senator will get the 10 minutes shortly after the vote, if he would defer for now, and I will see what we have to do. We will certainly treat the Senator fairly in that context.
