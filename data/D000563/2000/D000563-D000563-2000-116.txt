 But I remember it well because I was lucky enough to serve on that same subcommittee. I remember that testimony as if it were yesterday. It was amazing that this issue was brought forward. We have done so much.  Our Republican colleague, who is a medical doctor, Senator Bill Frist, was a former heart and lung transplant surgeon. He came down here. He talked about how he used to carry around in his pocket the names of 10 or 12 people who needed an organ donation. He would go through the hospital to see if there were any families with a loved one who was about to pass away who would even consider that. He said since he stopped that practice a few years ago, the number of organ transplants has been increasing each and every year. But it can't continue unless there are more donors.  I hope this ``Give Thanks, Give Life Week'' around Thanksgiving will become an annual event. I want to really salute the National Football League and Paul Tagliabue, the Commissioner, for all the support they have given us. They have at least given it the kind of sendoff we hoped to achieve. Connie Payton, who was here the other day; Mark Moseley, who is a former most valuable player in the NFL; Bill Brundage, who was also a lineman for the Washington Redskins--they all came out here to endorse the concept.  Many times, people in sports can come forward and spur a lot of folks to take seriously what politicians, such as ourselves, may not be able to impress upon them. So this meeting today was a good one.                          ____________________
