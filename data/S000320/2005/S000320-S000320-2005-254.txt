 President, the amendment of the Senator from Hawaii is dressed up as a credit counseling amendment, but it would cause havoc in our modern consumer credit system. It requires that a lender stop charging interest on the outstanding debt of any bankrupt debtor who participates in a debt management program. The practical result is that lenders are forced to either waive further payments on an extension of credit or have the debt discharged in bankruptcy. This will not be good for the consumer, the borrower.  This is a sweeping change in modern banking practices. We have had no hearings in the Senate Banking Committee. I ask my colleagues to oppose this amendment.
