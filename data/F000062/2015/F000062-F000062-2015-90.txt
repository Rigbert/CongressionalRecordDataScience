 The notice for this went out less than an hour ago. The consultations with others haven't been made. It was precipitously brought to the floor, and I can only infer that it has political implications, because the President of China is due to arrive here tomorrow and, therefore, this would be passed today, moved out of committee without a vote in front of the Senate.  I don't think that is the way we should do business in this Senate. Maybe people don't believe diplomacy makes a difference, but I do. I think there will be ample time for the President to speak with the President of China and for some of us to speak as well. This is, of course--the human rights, of course--a subject. But in the absence of that, I object.
