 President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). Without objection, it is so ordered.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, Senator Nickles is going to speak for a few moments and then we are prepared to vote. It is my understanding that if the Leahy amendment is agreed to, that will be the last vote of the evening.  I yield the floor.
