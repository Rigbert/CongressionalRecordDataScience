Chairman, I offer an amendment.  The Clerk read as follows:  Amendment offered by Mr. DeFazio: At the end of title I, add the following new section:     SEC.   . LIMITATION OF USE OF AMOUNTS TO CLOSE MULTIMISSION                    SMALL BOAT STATIONS.       Amounts appropriated under the authority of this Act may      not be used to close any multimission small boat station      unless the Secretary of Transportation determines that the      closing will have less negative impact on maritime safety      than the elimination of Coast Guard administrative aircraft.  Mr. DeFAZIO (during the reading). Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be considered as read and printed in the Record.
