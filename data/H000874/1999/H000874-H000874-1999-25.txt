Speaker, I think the gentleman's comments are very important and relevant. We need to keep focused on that.  Too often we tend to denigrate Federal service at whatever level, from the administrative law judge level to a file clerk. The fact of the matter is they are very important to the fair and proper administration of the people's government. We certainly want to make sure that we have people at these positions who have sound judgment, significant legal ability, and can wisely dispose of the issues that confront them.  I also want to say that I very much appreciate the leadership of my colleague, the gentleman from Maryland, who has been the ranking member of this subcommittee, and as such has worked with the chairman in a very positive way in ensuring that we have a sound, wise public employee policy in this country. I thank the gentleman for his leadership.
