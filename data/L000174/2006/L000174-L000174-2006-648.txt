President, I know there are amendments on both sides. I have already stated my admiration for the way the Senator from Pennsylvania moved this bill through the committee and on to the floor. I would like to have finished the bill last week, and I share his sense of urgency to finish. I suspect there will be discussions about this in both the caucuses this noon. I wonder if possibly the Senator from Pennsylvania and I, and whomever else he would like, could try to sit down and work out an order for amendments so that we can move forward. But that probably will not happen until after the caucuses, and I thought we could at least have others speak. I have spoken, and I will include another statement for the legislative record this morning. But I think if we get Senators down here to talk about it, we can also work out the time for amendments.
