 I strongly support the report language that was included in Omnibus Appropriations Bill earlier this year, saying that ``the managers expect the Department of State and USAID to follow the recommendations in the House and Senate reports, unless those recommendations are modified in the statement of the managers.'' I am pleased that senior USAID officials recently met with Water Missions to begin the partnership process in implementing this particular recommendation.
