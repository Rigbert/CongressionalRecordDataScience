President, I would hope that the distinguished Senator, my good friend from Alabama, would state Judge Sessions' ruling accurately. Judge Sessions has stated he feels the death penalty is constitutional. He has a matter that has been very thoroughly ruled on in a particular case and the way it was handled in that particular case and did it in a way so that the courts of appeals can rule on it, not the least of which has been done by a number of other judges. In fact, among those judges who would rule on it, several were appointed by President Reagan and by former President Bush and the current President Bush.  I am sure if the Senator suggests there might be something political in this, it is being set up in such a way that still the ultimate decision would be decided by a majority of judges appointed by Republican Presidents.
