President, I thank the Senator from Nebraska, Mrs. Fischer, for her comments. She is such a leader on so many issues in the Senate. We work closely together on transportation issues, and she gave us very valuable input for the bill that is before us. So I acknowledge her help and assistance and guidance and thank her for her comments.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
