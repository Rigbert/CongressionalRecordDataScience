 I do not think these numbers are exactly like what he gave, but I think they are very close. I have a chart here because I want to make the very point that the Senator was making.  But what the Senator is suggesting, the distinguished chairman of the committee, is that we should solve this problem that the Marines have--and the Marine ratio is not a problem, the fact that they have one general for 2,568 Marines. That is good. That is lean.  There has been a downsizing here. And it seems to me that you keep the Marine ratio where it is. You do not solve the problem by making the Marine Corps chubby with generals like the Navy is chubby with admirals.  This is what should happen in this normal downsizing. The number of Marines go down, as we have seen here from 199,000 down to 172,000. The Army has been downsized. The Air Force has been downsized and the Navy has been downsized. You have seen a reduction in the number of general officers. You have seen the Marines keep constant during this period of time of downsizing.  I do not find fault with that. I am not saying that should be necessarily reduced like the Army, Navy, and Air Force. But more generals would bring the Marine Corps number down. At a time of budget constraints and at a time when the Secretary of Defense is advising us he has to have more money for the modernization of our military force, I just think that this is a very wise expenditure of money or a good way to set our priorities in the Defense Department.  So, as I said, I was hoping that there would be a willingness on the part of the Armed Services Committee to discuss these issues. I see one of the subcommittee chairman of the Armed Services Committee here. I would like to defer to the Senator to speak on this point because obviously he is here because he disagrees with me. But I want to answer some of the points he brings up, if the Senator has strong opposition to my amendment.
