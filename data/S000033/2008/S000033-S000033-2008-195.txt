 President, today I am introducing legislation to help protect consumers from high electricity prices that have followed deregulation of electricity markets. I am honored to have many of my colleagues joining me in offering this legislation--Senator Snowe, Senator Kerry, Senator Collins, Senator Kennedy, and Senator Leahy.  Market pricing of electricity promised to bring lower costs to consumers. Unfortunately, consumers in organized market regions--those that have a Regional Transmission Organization orIndependent System Operator, RTOs or ISOs as they are called--are experiencing just the opposite: substantial, across-the-board problems with spiraling costs, unaccountable governance, and a chronic lack of oversight. Increasingly, RTOs/ISOs are adopting questionable, unproven, and expensive market mechanisms, and there seems to be little interest at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC, or the RTOs/ISOs to question any of the economic theories behind these mechanisms. I note that on February 21, 2008, FERC finally took a step toward acknowledging that the markets are not working by issuing a proposed rule that would address some concerns. I believe, however, that the legislation I am introducing today will focus FERC on consumer issues, which were not adequately addressed in the proposed rule.  The goal of lowering costs to consumers has been lost in the race to create competitive electricity markets. In fact, something as simple as keeping costs to consumers as low as reasonably possible is not even part of the mandate, or mission statement, of any of the Nation's ISOs or RTOs! In New England, we have seen what can happen--there have been several instances in which ISO-New England has implemented expensive market mechanisms, over the objection of significant segments of electric stakeholders, without either conducting a cost-benefit analysis or comparing the costs of the proposed initiative with alternative means of achieving the desired results.  Showing the strong interest in this issue in the New England region, the legislation is supported by the Northeast Public Power Association, the Vermont Public Power Supply Authority, the Burlington Electric Department, Kennebunk Light & Power District, the Massachusetts Municipal Wholesale Electric Company, Connecticut Municipal Electric Energy Cooperative, the Connecticut Office of Consumer Counsel, and the Pascoag Utility District. The Ohio Consumers' Counsel, the Maryland Office of People's Counsel, Electricity Consumers Resource Council, and the Utility Consumers' Action Network support the legislation as well.  The legislation I am introducing today would refocus FERC on the consumer cost impacts of RTO/ISO actions. Consistent with existing law, the bill makes explicit that, when FERC considers the lawfulness of RTO/ISO rates, it must assess whether those rates will ensure that consumer costs are as low as reasonably possible consistent with the provision of reliable service. Also, in recognition of the uniquely important roles played by RTOs and ISOs, this bill requires FERC to make both goals--cost minimization and reliability--a part of each RTO or ISO's mission. These changes clarify and amplify existing law as applied to these important organizations, but do not alter, diminish, or imply an absence of similar requirements with respect to other public utilities regulated by FERC.  I believe these simple, commonsense issues, when posed by FERC to an RTO/ISO that is seeking approval for a rate, charge, or rule, will instill a much stronger sense of cost accountability. The bottom line, as I see it, is that this simple bill will likely yield substantial benefits for consumers and for many regional economies.  I urge my colleagues to join me in pushing for adoption of the Consumer Protection and Cost Accountability Act.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2660       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Consumer Protection and Cost      Accountability Act''.     SEC. 2. REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO TRANSMISSION ORGANIZATIONS.       (a) Definitions.--In this Act:       (1) Commission.--The term ``Commission'' means the Federal      Energy Regulatory Commission.       (2) Lowest reasonable cost.--The term ``lowest reasonable      cost'' means the lowest total delivered cost to consumers      consistent with the provision of reliable service.       (3) Transmission organization.--The term ``Transmission      Organization'' has the meaning given the term in section 3 of      the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 796).       (b) Rate and Charges; Schedules; Suspension of New Rates.--     Section 205 of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 824d) is      amended by adding at the end the following:       ``(g) Requirements Relating to Transmission      Organizations.--       ``(1) Definition of lowest reasonable cost.--In this      subsection, the term `lowest reasonable cost' means the      lowest total delivered cost to consumers consistent with the      provision of reliable service.       ``(2) Consideration of transmission organization rates.--     With respect to determining whether a rate or charge made,      demanded, or received (including any rule or regulation      promulgated by a Transmission Organization relating to a rate      or charge made, demanded, or received) is consistent with      each requirement described in subsection (a) or section 206,      as applicable, the Commission shall consider whether the rate      or charge (including each rule or regulation relating to the      rate or charge) would enable the Transmission Organization to      provide, or facilitate the provision of, reliable service to      consumers at the lowest reasonable cost.       ``(3) Consideration of transmission organization rate      changes.--In determining whether any filing by a Transmission      Organization to establish or change a rate or charge made,      demanded, or received (including any rule or regulation      promulgated by a Transmission Organization relating to a rate      or charge made, demanded, or received) is consistent with      each requirement described in subsection (a), the Commission      shall consider whether the rate or charge (including each      rule or regulation relating to the rate or charge) would--       ``(A) provide consumer benefits that outweigh any      anticipated direct or indirect costs to consumers, as      demonstrated by a cost-benefit analysis to be submitted by      the Transmission Organization to the Commission; or       ``(B) have only a de minimus impact on the total delivered      costs to consumer.       ``(4) Biennial audits.--The Commission shall ensure that      each Transmission Organization is subject to biennial,      independent audits that--       ``(A) include--       ``(i) an assessment of the performance of the Transmission      Organization; and       ``(ii) recommendations to lower the costs and improve the      performance of the Transmission Organization; and       ``(B) are made available to the public.''.
