Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, I thank the gentleman for affording me this opportunity to clarify the funding situation for the API lab at Lakehurst. There have been far too many delays with this project already, and H.R. 4059 will finally set the wheels in motion to begin the construction of the API lab at Lakehurst in fiscal year 2000.
