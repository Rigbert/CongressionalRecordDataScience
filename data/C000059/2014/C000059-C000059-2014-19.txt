Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to a dear friend of mine, Jorge Pavez. Jorge passed away on Saturday, March 8, 2014. Riverside County has been fortunate to have community members whose personal stories have contributed immensely to the rich history of Southern California. Jorge Pavez was one of these individuals. He was truly the definition of the American Dream fulfilled and served as an incredible inspiration to those around him. A resident of Corona for over 40 years, Jorge was a pillar of the community and will be deeply missed.  The story of Jorge's incredible life began in 1963 when he boarded a plane in his home nation of Chile, with a one way ticket to Miami. He wasn't sure what the United States of America would hold for him, but was ready to tackle any challenge that came his way. With only $150 in his pocket upon arrival, success proved distant. He struggled without any knowledge of the English language and just a small bed at the local YMCA that ran him $5 a night. After a series of unfortunate events, Jorge decided to head west to California by driving a Buick convertible there for its owner.  Jorge, who was still learning English and developing his skills, was not discouraged by the tough job market, and eventually landed a job as a parking attendant in Santa Monica. He was soon transferred to another parking lot, and the move proved to be a testament to fate, when he met his future wife, Joyce, who worked in management there. She became responsible for helping him learn English when she gave him a book to assist in the process. With the love and support of Joyce, proven hard work at the parking lot, and a new knowledge of the English language, a neighborhood insurance agent took notice of Jorge's natural work ethic and decided to give him a chance with a job. Insurance was not an industry Jorge had come to know while growing up in South America, so while he was initially skeptical, he ultimately proved to be a natural at selling policies after a few short weeks of getting accustomed to the nature of the business.  Following a tragic event in the community where an insurance policy had a real impact, Jorge became a believer in the industry and developed a passion for the craft. This would ultimately be the beginning of a long and successful career. After starting his own agency, CPI Financial & Insurance Services, in two locations and acquiring another agency all within a matter of 10 years, Jorge became one of the preeminent insurance agents in the Inland Empire.  Through all of his success, Jorge remained committed to helping others fulfill their ``American Dream.'' By promoting employment opportunities within his insurance companies, he has been able to help others looking for a chance to achieve their own form of success. From moving to the country virtually penniless, to being responsible for creating economic growth for many in the Inland Empire, Jorge proved that it is possible to accomplish your goals with a lot of hard work and dedication. On March 14, 2014, Jorge would have celebrated his 50th Anniversary in the United States of America.  On March 20, 2014, a memorial honoring Jorge's extraordinary life will be held. He is survived by his loving wife and children. Jorge will always be remembered for his incredible work ethic, generosity, contributions to the community and love of family. His dedication is a testament to a life lived well and a legacy that will continue. I extend my condolences to Jorge's family and friends; although Jorge may be gone, the light and goodness he brought to the world remain and will never be forgotten.                          ____________________
