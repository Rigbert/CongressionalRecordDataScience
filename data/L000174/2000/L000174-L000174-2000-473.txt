President, I will note, just before I start, a couple of points.  The distinguished Senator from New Hampshire spoke about video rental records of Judge Bork or Judge Thomas. He may recall when that happened, a law was passed, the Leahy-Simpson law, which I proposed, initiated, and drove through in short order, to make it illegal for anybody to go and check somebody's video records. Ideally, I would like to see us have as strong a law for our medical records, something that has been held up while we spend a lot of time on a lot of other things. That is something being held up by this Congress on medical privacy. I wish we could do the same with that situation. But on Judge Bork or Judge Thomas or any other judges, the Leahy-Simpson law says we cannot look at their records.  I also note it was the Democrats who said very strongly about both Judge Bork and Judge Thomas, there should be no filibuster. As I recall, we expedited them relatively quickly for votes. It was also this Senator, joined by some others on this side, who, on the Ginsburg matter, when items were being leaked to the press--as it turned out, some from the same White House from which his nomination came--it was this Senator who took to the floor, and spoke elsewhere, and said let us give Judge Ginsburg a hearing; he should not be subjected to anonymous leaks, wherever they are coming from. As I said, some, it turned out, came from the White House. It was the White House that then announced, news to him, he was going to be withdrawing his name, which of course he did.  It was approximately 12 weeks from the time Judge Bork was nominated until we had a vote. It was something like 15 weeks from the time Judge Thomas was nominated before we had a vote. Of course, on Judge Paez it has been 4 years; on Marsha Berzon, 2 years.  I think we should talk about facts. Up to this date, there have been a lot of red herrings set out on these two nominees. They have been held without votes. Now at the 11th hour, some have sought to raise the random assignment of the case against John Huang in the District Court of the Central District of California as another reason to extend what has already been a 4-year delay in our consideration of the nomination of Judge Richard Paez.  I have yet to hear anybody suggest that there was anything untoward in the assignment of Judge Paez on this case. The suggestion is out here, somehow this was some nefarious thing, to put Judge Paez on this case. So I checked around about what the court rules are in assigning cases, because most courts have rules on how cases are assigned. They are not secret. They are public, and they are publicly available. I know they are in my own State of Vermont. They are elsewhere. But I thought maybe there was something that those who were objecting to his assignment to this case knew that we didn't. So I checked with the Central District of California, and of course they do have court rules governing the assignment of cases.  In fact, I understand the assignment of cases in the central district is pursuant to general order No. 224 of that court. I mention this because I wonder if any of those who have impugned Judge Paez sitting on this case even bothered to check that rule as I did, as anybody can, simply by picking up the phone and calling.  Section 7 of that order deals with the assignment of criminal cases. Paragraph 7.1 says:       The assignment of criminal cases shall be completely at      random through the Automated Case Assignment System. . . .  That is how the cases are assigned. The order allows exceptions under supervision of the chief judge. In the Huang case, there is no indication any exception was involved. Quite the contrary. I am told the assignment was done pursuant to a random assignment. That is what I was told when I called. That is what anybody would have been told if they had bothered to call instead of slandering this judge.  Then to make sure, because I am amazed anybody even questioned that because it is such a longstanding rule, I went to the extraordinary length of getting a statement under oath subject to the penalty of perjury by the district court executive and clerk of court explaining how these cases are assigned; Sherri Carter, district court executive and clerk of court.  I must apologize on the record to Ms. Carter for any indication that the Senate does not take her word for this or that people insist she submit this statement under penalty of perjury. I say to her, this is a strange time. Any lawyer who practices anywhere in this country knows that practically any court has these same kind of random assignments. State courts do it. Federal courts do it. Certainly any lawyer in California knows it is a random assignment. I suspect the bailiffs can tell you that. The janitors can tell you in that court, but the Senate is so far removed from it that we need an affidavit telling us something that everybody else outside of the sacred 100 in this Chamber know.  I ask unanimous consent that the sworn affidavit of Sherri Carter, district court executive and clerk of court, saying that district judge Richard Paez was randomly assigned to the Huang case under the district court-approved random assignment methodology using an automated information processing system be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                              U.S. District Court,                               Central District of California,                                                  Los Angeles, CA.       I, Sherri R. Carter, District Court Executive and Clerk of      Court, for the United States District Court, Central District      of California, declare that case number CR-99-524-RAP, U.S.A.      v. John Huang, was randomly assigned to District Judge      Richard A. Paez, on June 14, 1999 through the District Court      approved random assignment methodology utilizing an automated      information processing system.       Pursuant to 28 UCS 1746, I, Sherri R. Carter, District      Court Executive and Clerk of Court, declare under penalty of      perjury that the foregoing is true and correct executed on      March 8, 2000.                                             Sherri R. Carter,                                          District Court Executive                                               and Clerk of Court.
