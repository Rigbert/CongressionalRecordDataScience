President, I would like to take this opportunity to commemorate the outstanding achievements of Ms. Lois McClure, voted the 2013 Vermonter of the Year by The Burlington Free Press.  I am honored to count Lois among my closest friends. Marcelle and I are constantly inspired by her deep and sustained commitment to Vermont and to those of us who call it home.  As I have worked in public service, I have often looked for guidance in the breadth and depth of Lois McClure's philanthropic work. Year after year, Lois has found just the right points of leverage for her work to make Vermont a better place.  Lois McClure continues to build on a legacy of support for the arts, cultural and historic preservation, and environmental conservation, and yet her most meaningful work may be the help that she has provided Vermonters confronting serious medical problems. Whether or not they recognize it, many, many Vermonters have Lois in their corner as they fight back against cancer and other serious illness.  The Leahy Center for Lake Champlain, the Lake Champlain Maritime Museum, the Visiting Nurses Association, the American Cancer Society of Vermont, Fletcher Allen Health Care, and many other Vermont institutions are able to better serve Vermonters today because of Lois's commitment.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article about this exceptional Vermonter who has dedicated her life to improving her community and the lives of those around her.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:            [From the Burlington Free Press, Dec. 31, 2013]                2013 Vermonter of the Year: Lois McClure       The true measure of an act of philanthropy can be taken in      the lasting impact of what the initial donation set in      motion.       Years after the act of giving, the efforts and institutions      Lois McClure has chosen to support continue their good work.       McClure's engagement reflects a broad range, many with a      common theme a focus on building a better life for people of      all ages in her community.       For her life-long commitment to enriching people's lives in      ways big and small, the Burlington Free Press editorial board      names philanthropist Lois McClure 2013 Vermonter of the Year.       Over the years, McClure has built a legacy of generosity      and caring, started decades ago with her late husband, J.      Warren ``Mac'' McClure, former owner of the Burlington Free      Press who sold the newspaper to the Gannett Co. in 1971.       The McClure name can be seen on buildings throughout      Burlington and the surrounding area speaking to the long      record of giving for which this couple has long been known in      this community.       Lois McClure carried on the work after her husband's death      in 2004, and clearly made her own mark on her friends and      neighbors, as well as people who may never have heard her      name. These are just some of McClure's good works.       She continues to serve as a director of the J. Warren and      Lois McClure Foundation founded in 1995, which focuses on      improving access for Vermonters to higher education and life-     long learning.       She is a major benefactor of the ECHO Lake Aquarium and      Science Center--Leahy Center for Lake Champlain on the      Burlington waterfront, a wonderland to children, especially,      who explore what lies beneath the waters of the lake.       The Lake Champlain Maritime Museum named its schooner Lois      McClure in honor of her support for the effort to build a      replica of a sailing canal boat that plied the Broad Lake in      the early 1860s.       McClure, along with her husband, have long been      enthusiastic supporters of the Shelburne Museum, and she has      made generous gifts to organizations ranging from the      Burlington Community Land Trust to the Vermont Historical      Society.       Following a $1 million donation to the Visiting Nurse      Association in 2006, McClure told the Free Press, ``I get a      kick out of donating money and seeing that money make a      difference.'' Yet among all her giving, the realization of a      temporary home for cancer patients and their families who are      receiving treatment at near-by Fletcher Allen Health Care      perhaps became McClure's signature project.       The American Cancer Society's Hope Lodge opened in      Burlington in 2008, named the Lois McClure-Bee Tabakin      Building in honor of McClure and her long-time friend who      each lost a daughter to cancer.       The call for nominations for Vermonter of the Year asked      readers to ``Think of someone who has made a difference this      year or through a lifetime of work; someone who stepped up in      a time of need or proved to be a leader; someone whose acts      or accomplishments embodied the best of Vermont.''       McClure has been nominated by readers many times over the      years. In 2006, Jane Osborne McKnight wrote in a particularly      telling nominating letter, ``I have never met Lois, but have      admired her good works for many years. . . . She has      personally enriched our cultural life in Vermont and      furthered our understanding of Vermont history. These are      good deeds that will be felt, undoubtedly, for many      generations.''       McClure has lived a life that embodies the best qualities      of a Vermonter who looks out for her neighbor and lives for      the betterment of her community.       The Burlington Free Press' imminent departure from the      College Street building it has occupied since the 1830s      creates an appropriate occasion to give McClure the applause      she deserves. The paper once owned by McClure's family is      moving soon into new quarters on Bank Street.       McClure has built a legacy of making a real difference to      many people.       The Burlington Free Press names Lois McClure--a friend to      Vermonters, today and for generations to come--2013 Vermonter      of the Year.                          ____________________
