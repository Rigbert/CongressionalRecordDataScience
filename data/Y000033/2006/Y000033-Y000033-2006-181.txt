Madam Speaker, I an exchange of letters between Don Young and Richard Pombo for the Record.                                         House of Representatives,                                       Committee on Resources,                               Washington, DC, September 28, 2006.     Hon. Don Young,     Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,          Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: I have reviewed the text of H.R. 5681,      the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2006, and believe that      the Committee on Resources has a jurisdictional interest in      provisions in this important legislation dealing with      fisheries. Specifically, we have identified a provision      dealing with the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands crab fishery      in the Northern Region of the management plan.       Recognizing that the House of Representatives has a      dwindling number of legislative days left before the 109th      Congress adjourns, I will forego seeking a sequential      referral of H.R. 5681. Waiving the Committee on Resources'      right to a referral in this case does not waive the      Committee's jurisdiction over any provision in H.R. 5861 or      similar provisions in other bills. In addition, I ask that      you support my request to have the Committee on Resources      represented on the conference on this bill, if a conference      is necessary. Finally, I ask that you include this letter in      the Congressional Record during debate on H.R. 5861 when it      is considered by the House of Representatives.       I appreciate your leadership on this bill and I look      forward to working with you on H.R. 586.           Sincerely,                                                 Richard W. Pombo,     Chairman.                                  ____         House of Representatives, Committee on Transportation and            Infrastructure,                               Washington, DC, September 27, 2006.     Hon. Richard W. Pombo,     Chairman, Committee on Resources,     Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Pombo: Thank you for your letter expressing      the jurisdictional interest of the Committee on Resources in      H.R. 5681, the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2006. The      Committee on Resources has a recognized claim to jurisdiction      over the conversion to catcher processor provision that is      included in this bill as proposed to be considered under      suspension. I appreciate your agreement to allow this measure      to proceed under suspension and to waive further      consideration.       I understand that your agreement to allow this bill to      proceed under suspension is conditioned upon our mutual      understanding that nothing in this legislation, or your      decision to waive further consideration, reduces or otherwise      affects the jurisdiction of the Committee on Resources over      provisions of the bill that are in your jurisdiction. I also      understand that this waiver does not affect the right of the      Committee on Resources to have its members named as conferees      in the event of a conference with the Senate on this bill.       I greatly appreciate your cooperation in allowing the      conversion to catcher processor shares provision to move on      H.R. 5681. This issue impacts only fisheries in Alaska.           Sincerely,                                                        Don Young,     Chairman.                          ____________________
