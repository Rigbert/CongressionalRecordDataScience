Madam Speaker, I thank Virginia Foxx, who is a tremendous leader for life and a great leader in this Congress, for yielding.  Mr. McGovern said we are wasting our time. Mr. Kildee talked about pandering, which I think is an insult.  I would just like to ask Mr. McGovern: Yes or no, has the gentleman watched the videos?  Mr. McGOVERN. Will the gentleman yield?
