 President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it stand in adjournment until 10 a.m. on Friday, April 24. I further ask that on Friday, immediately following the prayer, the routine requests through the morning hour be granted and the Senate then begin consideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. 1757, the State Department reorganization bill, under the consent agreement of March 31, 1998.
