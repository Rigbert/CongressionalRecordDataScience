President, today I am introducing the ``Omnibus Mercury Emissions Reduction Act of 1998.'' As United States Senators, we all have a responsibility to build a nation for our children. As a recent grandfather, this commitment has never been more real for me. I am introducing this comprehensive piece of legislation to eliminate mercury--one of the last remaining poisons without a specific control strategy--from our air, our waters and our forests. By eliminating mercury from our natural resources, we will protect our nation's most important resource--our children and grandchildren.  As we learned from the campaign to eliminate lead, our children are at the greatest risk from these poisons. I often ask myself how many Albert Einsteins have we lost in the last generation because of the toxics they have been exposed to? Just as with lead, we know that mercury has much graver effects on children at very low levels then it does on adults. The level of lead pollution we and our children breathe today is one-tenth what it was a decade ago. That figure by itself is a tribute to the success of the original Clean Air Act. I want to achieve the same results with mercury.  Mercury is toxic in every known form and of utterly no nutritional value. At high enough levels it poisons its victims in terribly tragic ways. In Japan, victims of mercury poisoning came to be known as suffering from Minimata Disease, which took its name from the small Minimata Bay in which they caught fish for their food.  For years, the Chisso Company discharged mercury contaminated pollution in the Bay, which was taken into the flesh of fish and then the people who ate them. Their disease was frightfully painful, causing tremors and paralysis, and sometimes leading to death. Thankfully, discharges of mercury like those in Minimata Bay have been eliminated. But a torrent of air pollution still needlessly pours this heavy metal into the air of North America, poisoning lakes and streams, forests and fields and--most importantly--our children. Mercury control needs to be a priority now because we know, without a doubt, of the neurological damage it causes.  This is not to say that men, women and children are doubled over in agony as they were three decades ago in Japan. But wildlife are being killed--we know that endangered Florida panthers have been fatally poisoned by mercury and that loons are endangered as well. In Lake Champlain we now have fish advisories for walleye, trout and bass even though we have relatively no mercury emissions within our own state borders.  Instead, we Vermonters are exposed to mercury and other pollutants that blow across Lake Champlain and the Green Mountains every day from other regions of the country. The waste incinerators and coal-fired power plants are not accountable to the people of Vermont and therefore a federal role is needed to control the pollution.  That is part of the reason voters send us here. They expect Members of the Congress to determine what is necessary to protect the public health and the environment nationally, then require it. And in many cases, perhaps most, we have done that. But not with respect to mercury.  Mr. President, what I propose is that we put a stop to this poisoning of America. It is unnecessary, and it is wrong. Mercury can be removed from products, and it has been done. Mercury can be removed from coal-fired powerplants, and it should be done. With states deregulating their utility industries, this is the best opportunity to make sure powerplants begin to internalize the cost of their pollution. We cannot afford to give them a free ride into the next century at the expense of our children's health.  So, too, should mercury be purged from chlor alkali plants, medical waste incinerators, municipal combustion facilities, large industrial boilers, landfills, lighting fixtures and other known sources.  My bill directs EPA to set mercury emission standards for the largest sources of mercury emissions. The bill requires reducing emissions by 95 percent, but it also lets companies choose the best approach to meet the standard at their facility whether through the use of better technology, cleaner fuels, process changes, or product switching.  We will hear a lot of rhetoric about how much implementing this bill will cost. In advance of those complaints I want to make two points. First, when we were debating controls for acid rain we heard a lot about the enormous cost of eliminating sulphur dioxide. But what we learned from the acid rain program, is that when you give industry a financial incentive to clean up their act they will find the cheapest way. More often than not, assertions about the cost of controlling pollution grossly overestimate and distort reality. If you look at electricity prices of major utilities since the acid rain program was implemented, their rates have remained below the national average and some have actually decreased--even without adjusting for inflation.  Secondly, and most importantly, the bottom line here should not be the cost of controlling mercury emissions, but the cost of NOT controlling mercury. While we may not be able to calculate how many Einstein's we have lost, if we lose one the price has been too high.                                 ______                                       By
