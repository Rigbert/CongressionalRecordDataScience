Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that information. I am constrained to observe that, from my perspective, it will be the last year that we will not start creating extraordinarily more debt for our country. But that aside, let me ask the gentleman a couple of questions.  First of all, there has been discussion in the press, certainly, and some discussion in the Congress about a possibility of a rescission package. As the gentleman knows, both he and I, the Speaker, Leader Pelosi, Mr. McConnell, and the White House, worked very, very hard on reaching an agreement so that we could pass an omnibus some weeks ago. That omnibus was the result of some very hard bargaining and negotiations and trade-offs, and certainly, not--I don't think anybody was pleased with everything that was in that bill, or, frankly, that wasn't in that bill.  I am, therefore, very concerned that I now hear talk about we are going to, in effect, go back on the agreement that we reached. It was clear that there were some things in there that I didn't like and others didn't like, and I am sure that was the case with yourself as well, Mr. Leader. But it was an agreement. It was an agreement reached after hard discussions, over months, and it was a very late agreement at that, funding 2018 finally until September 30, not until last month.                              {time}  1100  So I am very concerned about the possibility that we are going to try to, in effect, relitigate that issue.  Can the majority leader give me some insight as to whether or not, in fact, we will be facing a rescissionpackage at some point in time? And if so, can the majority leader advise us as to what may be in that package?  Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend, the majority leader.  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding to me.  Mr. Speaker, my friend is correct that in this House we worked to pass all 12 appropriation bills. We sent them to the Senate, and the Senate did not act. So as the process works, we had to come to an agreement.  My friend on the other side said he worked very hard on that, but at the end of the day, I tell my friend: You voted against it.  A rescission, as my friend knows, is not about an omnibus bill. It is about finding savings for the American people. To quote Ronald Reagan: ``The problem is not that people are taxed too little, the problem is that the government spends too much.''  On this side of the aisle, we know that unaccountable and unnecessary spending not only puts our fiscal future on shaky ground, but it also puts burdens on the programs that Americans actually rely on. That is why we passed all 12 appropriation bills. Unfortunately, the Senate Democrats blocked even debate on every single one of these bills. So they wouldn't even debate it, and they put us into this late process.  Now, as far as rescissions, I believe the Trump administration is committed to sending Congress a rescission proposal.  As my friend knows, the 1974 Budget Act would give this proposal fast-track procedures both in the House and, more importantly, in the Senate, which means, to the American public, it takes 51 votes to pass. So no longer can a minority hold up debate or hold up process to harm the American public.  While this has not been done in 20 years, President Trump is not afraid of challenging the status quo, and I personally respect that. But I want to look at history, and I want the American public to understand it.  Rescissions were once commonly used by five different administrations, both Republican and Democratic, and at times the Republican Presidents had Democratic majorities in Congress. Let me give you a for-instance: President Bill Clinton proposed 166 rescissions. Congress passed 111 of those.  George H.W. Bush, when Democrats controlled both, proposed 169. They passed 34 of those.  Ronald Reagan proposed 602, and they accepted 214 times to be able to cut spending.  Now, Jimmy Carter proposed 122, and Congress accepted 50.  President Gerald Ford proposed 152, and Congress accepted 52.  As far as what this proposal looks like, it remains a work in progress. Now, I will continue to work with the administration, but the one thing I want to be very clear about is this is not about an omnibus. This is about saving money.  So what a rescission package can do is it can go back into other accounts that have just sat there with money in them with no action. No business would run their business that way. No family would want it run that way, to keep some debt while you have money sitting over here.  If you can save, I would believe everybody in this body would want to save the taxpayers some money if there is an opportunity to do this. And if I checked my record correctly, I believe my friend has voted for a few rescissions in the past.
