 I have heard a lot of arguments tonight made about the defense of tobacco. I say to my colleagues on both sides, if you are ready to vote for this tax bill, you are already imposing a tax on tobacco of 20 cents. I am saying to you that 11 cents is going to buy a lot of good for America--not only keeping the products out of the hands of kids but finally keeping our promise to small business and family farmers.  I urge you to look beyond some of the arguments that you have heard tonight, that you have heard over and over again, and think about the bottom line when this is done. Thirty-one cents on a package of tobacco is not going to break the tobacco industry. But it is going to save a lot of small businesses which will have a chance to survive.  I yield the floor.
