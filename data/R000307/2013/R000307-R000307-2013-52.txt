President, I rise today to honor a true patriot, and fellow U.S. Marine, Col. Harold R. Van Opdorp. While some know him as ``Odie'' and others as Colonel V, we all know him as Marine. After more than 3 years of service leading the Marine Corps' Office of Legislative Affairs in the U.S. Senate, Colonel Van Opdorp has assumed the responsibilities as commanding officer of the Marine Corps' Officer Candidate School. I would like to recognize Colonel Van Opdorp's distinguished service and dedication to fostering a relationship of mutual benefit between the U.S. Marine Corps and the U.S. Senate.  With more than 2 decades of dedicated service to his country, Colonel Van Opdorp has selflessly given to the cause of freedom across the globe, from Somalia to Iran, from Norway to the South Pacific. His service leading young Marines as a platoon, company, and battalion commander, in garrison and in combat, is emblematic of the caliber of his character. His diverse service reflects the traditions of the Eagle, Globe, and Anchor that he wears and the nature of the Corps.  Over the course of the last 3 years, Colonel Van Opdorp has been instrumental to facilitating the oversight responsibilities of the Senate. Known for his in-depth knowledge of legislative issues and the operational requirements of the Marine Corps, he ensured that Members of the U.S. Senate with an interest in national security were armed with timely information on Operation Enduring Freedom, humanitarian assistance in Haiti, flood relief operations in Pakistan, Marine Security Guards at our diplomatic missions around the globe, and other forward-deployed Marine forces. Colonel Van Opdorp worked hard to ensure all Senators were fully briefed of the programs which make our Corps special, programs such as the Joint Strike Fighter, the Amphibious Combat Vehicle, and the MV-22 Osprey. In 2011, I had the pleasure of working closely with Colonel Van Opdorp during our efforts to recognize the significant contributions of the Montford Point Marines, our Nation's first African American Marines, with the Congressional Gold Medal.  Colonel Van Opdorp's absence will be felt in the Senate. I join many past and present Senators in my gratitude and appreciation for his outstanding leadership and unwavering support of the missions of the U.S. Marine Corps. I know my colleagues on the Senate Armed Services Committee wholeheartedly join me in this tribute. I wish Colonel Van Opdorp and his wife, Rebecca, fair winds and following seas as he continues to serve his Nation, charged with the great responsibility of molding our future Marine Officers. ``Ooh-rah'' and Semper Fi, Marine.                          ____________________
