President, I rise today to introduce common sense legislation that would improve the way we review proposed purchases of American assets by foreign companies and governments.  Much has already been said about the prospect of Dubai Ports World taking responsibility for some of the operations of our nation's ports. The way that the Bush Administration has handled this situation has made it very clear that the process we currently use to review the national security implications of foreign acquisitions is simply not working. We must do better.  Let me be clear: I do not believe that we should automatically dismiss out of hand any potential foreign investments in this country. Vibrant trade, when conducted sensibly and fairly, is good for America.  However, I think that for any proposed deal in which a foreign company would take over important responsibilities related to America's critical infrastructure--whether it be our ports, our railroads, our airports, or anything else that is fundamental to our national security--we should take a very close look at such a deal.  For any proposed deal in which a foreign country would take over any of our nations' companies, we should take an even closer look.  I strongly believe that we should be building our ties with friendly Arab nations, through diplomacy, trade, and all of the other mechanisms we have at our disposal. However, the process by which this Dubai Ports World deal was waved through by the Bush Administration without anything resembling a thorough review of the security risks is simply not good enough.  This bill would improve the review process in five ways.  First, my legislation would require that a more thorough 45-day investigation be undertaken by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) when either of two situations occurs: when a foreign government wants to purchase any assets in the United States, and when a foreign-owned company wants to purchase critical infrastructure in the United States.  Second, my bill would mandate that at least 7 days before the end of a foreign investment review, the CFIUS chair must submit a draft of its report to the Homeland Security committees in each chamber.  Third, when the CFIUS review is completed, each cabinet secretary whose agency has been involved in the review must certify in writing his or her agreement or dissent.  Fourth, under current law, the President can only block a transaction when the buyer ``might fail to take necessary action to prevent impairment of the national security,'' which is an extraordinarily high threshold for action. My bill would lower the threshold so that the President can realistically take action in more ambiguous situations where there is credible evidence that the buyer itself presents a national security threat.  Fifth, the bill would mandate that CFIUS should be chaired by the Secretary of Homeland Security instead of the Secretary of the Treasury.  I believe that these common sense reforms will support healthy trade and investment, but will at the same time ensure that foreign investments in American assets do not compromise our national security. I look forward to working with my colleagues to combine my bill with the many other good ideas that have been proposed in order to pass legislation that will make this review process stronger.  Our national security--and our economic strength--depend on it.                                 ______                                       By Mr. McCAIN:  S. 2443. A bill to grant the power to the President to reduce budget authority; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, in his final State of the Union Address, President Reagan stood for the last time before both Houses of Congress and asked for line-item veto authority for future Presidents.  On that evening, the President had with him three pieces of legislation: anappropriations bill that was 1,053 pages long and weighed 14 pounds; a budget reconciliation bill that was 1,186 pages long and weighed 15 pounds; and a continuing resolution that was 1,057 pages long and weighed 14 pounds. President Reagan slammed down on the lectern the 43 pounds of paper and ink, which represented 1 trillion dollars' worth of spending. He did so to emphasize the magnitude of wasteful spending in the bills--spending that the President could not stop unless he was willing to veto each piece of legislation in its entirety. In the case of the continuing resolution, that would have meant that the Federal government would shut down.  Almost 20 years later we are in exactly the same situation we were in when President Reagan said to Congress, ``Let's help ensure our future of prosperity by giving the President a tool that, though I will not get use to use it, is one I know future Presidents of either party must have. Give the President the same authority that 43 Governors use in their States: the right to reach into massive appropriation bills, pare away the waste, and enforce budget discipline. Let's approve the line-item veto.''  Last week, President Bush rightly renewed Ronald Reagan's call for line-item veto authority by sending to Congress a legislative proposal for a form of line-item veto authority known as expedited rescission. That proposal was introduced as the Line Item Rescission Act of 2006 shortly after the President offered it. I am an original cosponsor of that legislation, which would authorize the President to propose spending and targeted tax benefits that would ultimately have to be approved by a majority of each House of Congress. The Line Item Rescission Act is one way to give the President more authority to impose fiscal restraint, and if it were enacted it would constitute a significant move in Washington, DC, towards fiscal discipline.  Today, I am introducing the Separate Enrollment and Line Item Veto Act of 2006 to present what I believe is a stronger approach to granting the President true line-item veto power. Under this proposal, which is crafted to ensure its constitutionality, each item of every appropriation measure and authorization measure containing new direct spending or new targeted tax benefits passed by Congress would be separately enrolled. The President would then be able to consider each item as a separate bill and would have the power to veto items that, as President Bush has said, constitute unneeded spending that reflects special interests instead of the people's interest.  We must keep in mind that even strong line-item veto authority will not solve all of our fiscal problems. We also desperately need to reform our earmarking process and our lobbying practices--and we must remember that it is ultimately Congress's responsibility to control spending. However, granting the President line-item veto authority would go a long way toward restoring credibility to a system ravaged by congressional waste and special interest pork. I look forward to the Senate's consideration of line-item veto legislation, and I trust that Congress will act on such legislation soon.                                 ______                                       By
