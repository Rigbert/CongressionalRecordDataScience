 President, during this second anniversary of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, I wish to discuss some of the benefits this law has already brought to consumers.  Millions of Americans nationwide and in California have already benefited from this law. For the first time, insurance companies are held accountable they cannot drop coverage just because someone gets sick, they cannot deny coverage because of a preexisting condition, and they cannot impose limits on the amount of care provided in a lifetime.  This law helps women, children, young adults, seniors, families, and individuals living with disabilities and chronic medical conditions.  In California, because of the law, over 12 million people no longer have a lifetime limit on their health insurance plan. This includes almost 4.5 million women and 3.26 million children.  Now, individuals and families with medical expenses do not have to worry that they will reach a point where insurance will no longer provide coverage. Eliminating lifetime caps on coverage and phasing out annual caps will reassure Californians that their health coverage will be there when they need it.  The health reform law is taking great strides to ensure affordable prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries.  Before health reform, Medicare beneficiaries were faced with a prescription drug coverage gap that was unaffordable for many. This so-called doughnut hole forced beneficiaries to pay 100 percent of their drug costs after they exceeded an initial coverage limit. As many as one in four seniors went without a prescription every year because they simply could not afford it.  Now, the law is closing this coverage gap, and already, an estimated 320,000 Medicare beneficiaries in California have saved almost $172 million on prescription drugs.  Under the health reform law, insurance companies are already banned from denying coverage to children because of a preexisting condition, such as a heart defect, autism, or juvenile diabetes.  Parents no longer have to spend away college funds to cover children with medical conditions.  Beginning in 2014, health insurers are prohibited from denying anyone health insurance coverage because of a preexisting medical condition. This means that being pregnant can no longer be considered a preexisting condition. It means that individuals will no longer be prevented from purchasing affordable insurance simply because they had an accident, are sick, or got cancer.  Under the law, insurance companies have to pay more of the premium dollars they collect on actual medical care, not on profits.  In California, because of this provision, almost 9 million people are getting better value for their premium dollars. Furthermore, California has received over $5 million in grants from the law to fight unreasonable premium increases and to bolster scrutiny of rates.  Because of the health reform law, young adults can now stay on their family insurance plan up to age 26. Previously, insurance companies could drop coverage for young adults, many times at age 19. Now the law makes it easier and more affordable for young adults to get health insurance.  Already over 350,000 young adults in California have benefited from this provision.  This law takes great strides to equalize insurance coverage for women andto rid the system of discriminatory practices based on gender.  The practice of ``gender-rating,'' or charging more for insurance simply because of gender, is outlawed in the health reform law. This means that women can no longer be charged higher premiums.  Over a recent 3-year period, 7.3 million women 38 percent of women who tried to buy coverage on the individual market were either rejected altogether, charged a higher premium, or sold policies that excluded certain benefit coverage because of a ``preexisting condition'' like cancer or having been pregnant.  Now, women will be guaranteed coverage at a similar rate to men.  Already, almost 2.3 million Californian women with private insurance have access to no-cost preventive services because of the law. This includes necessary cancer screenings, such as mammograms, annual wellness exams, and contraception.  Additionally, over 1.6 million women in California who are on Medicare now have access to free preventive services because of the law.  These are just a few critical consumer protections that are now in play because of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, signed into law 2 years ago.  We have a long ways to go to improve our health care system and to ensure affordable quality care for all Americans, but these essential consumer protections take great strides to get us there.                          ____________________
