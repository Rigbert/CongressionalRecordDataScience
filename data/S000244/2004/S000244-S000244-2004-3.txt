Speaker, S. 2192 will help to spur the development of new technologies by making it easier for collaborative inventors who represent more than one organization to obtain the protection of the U.S. patent system for their inventions.  Members should note that the text of S. 2192 is identical to that of H.R. 2391, which received approximately 2 years of process. The House passed H.R. 2391 by voice vote on March 10 of this year.  The bill achieves this goal by limiting the circumstances in which confidential information, which is voluntarily exchanged by individual research team members, may be asserted to bar the patenting of the team's new inventions.  Today, industries that rely on intellectual property, like pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, and nano-technology serve as key catalysts to the U.S. economy, employing tens of thousands of Americans. More often than not, the innovations they develop are not done solely by researchers ``in-house'' but rather, in concert with other researchers who may be located at universities, non-profit institutions, or other private enterprises.  Carl E. Gulbrandsen, the managing director of the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation, provided an assessment of the value of university research contributions when he testified before the Intellectual Property Subcommittee last Congress that:       In 2000, non-profits and universities spent a record $28.1      billion on research and development much of which involved      collaborations among private, public, and non-profit      entities.  Sales of products developed from inventions transferred from these research centers resulted in revenues that approached $42 billion that year, a portion of which was then reinvested in additional research.  As significant as this research activity is, the tangible benefits of its application are also worth noting. Innovations like magnetic resonance imaging and the sequencing of the human genome through a process known as automated polymerase chain reaction technology were both made possible through collaborative research.  Mr. Speaker, in 1984, Congress acted to provide incentives for innovation by encouraging researchers within organizations to share information. That year, we amended the Patent Act to restrict the use of background scientific or technical information shared among researchers in an effort to deny a patent in instances where the subject matter and the claimed invention were under common ownership or control.  S. 2192 will provide a similar statutory ``safe harbor'' for inventions that result from the collaborative activities of private, public, and non-profit entities. In so doing, the bill responds to the 1997 OddzON Products, Inc. V. Just Toys, Inc. decision of the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals by clarifying that prior inventions of team members will not serve as an absolute bar to the patenting of the team's new invention when the parties conduct themselves in accordance with the terms of the bill.  In the future, research collaborations between academia and industry will be even more critical to the efforts of U.S. industry to maintain our technological preeminence. By enacting S. 2192, Congress will help to foster improved communication among researchers, provide additional certainty and structure for those who engage in collaborative research, reduce patent litigation incentives, and facilitate innovation and investment.  S. 2192 is the product of the collaborative efforts of a number of individuals and leading professional patent and research organizations. Among those who contributed substantially to the development of the bill are the USPTO, the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation, the American Council on Education, the American University Technology Managers, the Biotechnology Industry Organization, and the American Intellectual Property Law Association.  Mr. Speaker, S. 2192 will ensure that tomorrow's collaborative researchers can enjoy the full measure of the benefits of the patent law. I urge the Members to support the bill.  The Senate bill was ordered to be read a third time, was read the third time, and passed, and a motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                          ____________________
