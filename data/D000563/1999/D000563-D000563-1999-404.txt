President, the Senate and the Nation are fortunate, indeed, to have the Senator from Minnesota. He continues to redirect our attention to the life and death struggles that families go through every single day. Oftentimes he is a lonely voice on the Senate floor, but he is a person of principle and value. If it meets with his permission, I ask unanimous consent to be added as a cosponsor to this important amendment.
