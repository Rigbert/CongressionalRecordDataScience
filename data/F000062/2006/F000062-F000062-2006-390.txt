 President, I rise today to submit a Senate resolution concerning Channel Islands National Park, with Senator Boxer as an original cosponsor.  We firmly believe that Channel Islands National Park, including Santa Rosa Island, should continue to be administered by the National Park Service in accordance with the laws, regulations, and policies of the National Park Service, including the National Park Service Organic Act.  Channel Islands National Monument was designated in 1938 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt under the authority of the Antiquities Act.  The monument was expanded to include additional islands and redesignated as Channel Islands National Park in 1980 in order to protect the nationally significant natural, scenic, wildlife, marine, ecological, archaeological, cultural, and scientific values of the Channel Islands in California.  Santa Rosa Island was acquired by the United States in 1986 for approximately $30 million for the purpose of restoring its native ecology and making the island available to the public for recreational uses. The previous owners of the Island retained only an agreement for the non-commercial use and occupancy of a 7.6-acre parcel of land through 2011.  The non-native elk and deer population are to be removed from the park by 2011 under a court-approved settlement and the Island restored to management consistent with other national parks.  We introduce this resolution to express our concern with a provision that the House Armed Services Committee has included in the House version of the Defense authorization bill.  The provision would prohibit the Park Service from carrying out the court-approved settlement's direction to remove the population of non-native deer and elk.  To the contrary, we believe that Congress should not direct the National Park Service to manage Santa Rosa Island in a manner that would result in the public being denied access to significant portions of the Island for any substantial period of time.  If the Park Service is unable to manage the non-native deer and elk population, the population will likely be managed through the present practice of privately organized hunting editions that currently require the closure of about 90 percent of the Island to the general public for 4-5 months out of the year. The national parks belong to the American people, and the parks should remain freely open to the people.  We also believe that Congressional direction for Santa Rosa Island should not be inconsistent with the requirement to protect and enhance native park resources, including threatened and endangered species.  There are 11 endangered or threatened plant and animal species on the Island, many of which would be harmed by the proposal.  In particular, the bald eagle is at risk from eating carcasses containing lead bullets used by the hunters; the Santa Rosa Island fox is preyed upon by golden eagles attracted by fawns and other deer; and the Island's endangered plants are threatened by the deer and elk.  In addition, there are substantial archaeological resources on the Islandwhich could be at risk, including potentially the oldest discovered human remains in North America, 13,000 years old, and remains of the rare pygmy mammoth.  In summary, we believe that the National Park Service should manage Santa Rosa Island to ensure that the Island's natural, scenic, and cultural resources are properly protected, restored, and interpreted for the public, and that park visitors are provided with a safe and enjoyable park experience.  I urge my colleagues to support this Senate resolution.                          ____________________[Pages S4077-S4078]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]   SENATE RESOLUTION 468--SUPPORTING THE CONTINUED ADMINISTRATION OF     CHANNEL ISLANDS NATIONAL PARK, INCLUDING SANTA ROSA ISLAND, IN  ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS (INCLUDING REGULATIONS) AND POLICIES OF THE                          NATIONAL PARK SERVICE
