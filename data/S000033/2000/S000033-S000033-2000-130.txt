  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this Republican legislation and to all the proposals that the Republican Party is offering today. In fact, what they are offering is not only absurd but it is an insult to American working people. They are proposing a paltry increase in the minimum wage of $1 over 3 years, and at the same time they are proposing a huge tax break for the richest people in this country.  Millions of low wage-workers are working 40 or 50 hours a week struggling to keep their heads above water. In terms of the purchasing power of the minimum wage, it is lower today than it was 20 years ago. And in hearing this cry of working people, the Republicans are proposing a 33-cent-an-hour increase in the minimum wage. But at the same time they are proposing a gigantic tax break for the people who do not need it, the people who are making over $300,000 a year. And 75 percent of their tax proposal goes to those people.  To add insult to injury, in my State of Vermont where the legislature had the decency to raise the minimum wage to at least $5.75 an hour, the Republican proposal will mean nothing for the next 2 years. And Vermont is not alone. Many other States have moved to raise the minimum wage. So right now, at a time when this country has the greatest gap between the rich and the poor of any industrialized nation, where we have the richest 1 percent owning more wealth than the bottom 95 percent, where we have millions of workers working longer hours for lower wages than was the case 20 years ago, what the Republicans are saying is, that is not bad enough, let us make it worse.  Let us reject this proposal.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 3832. This bill is being touted as a package of tax provisions designed to offset the impacts of an increase in the minimum wage on small business. Yet some of the pension provisions included in the bill don't have a single thing to do with small business tax relief and are simply new tax breaks that mostly accrue to the wealthiest Americans.  The pension provisions in this legislation will not increase pension coverage for millions of Americans that currently lack it, and may even reduce coverage for lower and middle-income employees according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.  According to the non-partisan Institute for Taxation and Economic Policy:  The 20 percent of individuals with the highest incomes would receive 96.5 percent of the new pension tax breaks.  By contrast, the bottom 60 percent of the population would receive less than one percent of the benefits of the new pension provisions.  Last November, Treasury Secretary Summers and Labor Secretary Herman, criticized these pension provisions, saying that they ``could lead to reductions in retirement benefits for moderate and lower-income workers.''  Mr. Speaker, if the Congress is really concerned about protecting the pensions of American workers it should quickly address the cash balance pension rip off scheme being implemented by hundreds of large corporations all over this country. In fact if this Congress is really concerned about protecting the pensions of American workers it should pass H.R. 2902, the Pension Benefits Preservation and Protection Act, legislation that I authored and that now has a total of 80 co-sponsors.  Mr. Speaker, all across this country, American workers are deeply concerned about the status of their pension plans. That concern is well founded. Sine 1985, despite large profits and growing surpluses in their pension funds, twenty percent of Fortune 500 companies and over 300 companies in all have slashed the retirement benefits that they promised their employees. Many more companies are contemplating similar action. Not only is this trend outrageous, it is also illegal under current law. Cash balance schemes violate age discrimination laws because they cut the accrual rate of pension benefits as a worker gets older. Workers should not have their pension benefits reduced just because of their age.  Frankly, it is simply unacceptable that during a time of record breaking corporate profits, huge pension fund surpluses, massive compensation for CEOs (including very generous retirement benefits), that corporate America renege on the commitments that they have made to workers by slashing their pensions.  Just last month I authored comments to the Internal Revenue Service stating that these cash balance schemes violate the pension age discrimination laws. 59 other Members of Congress joined me in signing on to these IRS comments. These comments detail how corporations are stealing the benefits of their most loyal and experienced workers.  Consider this: if a company reduced pension benefits based on race, or religion, or gender, the federal government would be sure to take appropriate action against the company. But, when it comes to enforcing the pension age discrimination laws, the federal government has clearly been asleep at the wheel. Fortunately, some of us in Congress are beginning to wake them up.  Corporations currently receive over $80 billion a year in federal government subsidies through the tax code. American taxpayers have a right to expect that corporations who take advantage of this special tax treatment will not blatantly violate the law.  Yet, hundreds of corporations throughout the country from IBM to AT are doing just that by converting their traditional defined benefit pension plans to these cash balance schemes.  Cash balance schemes are nothing but a replay of the corporate pension raids we experienced during the 1980's. While these companies claim that they are converting to cash balance plans to attract younger workers into their workforce, the fact of the matter is that cash balance plans are intentional attempts to slash the pension benefits of older workers.  The reason why large corporations are targeting their older workers' pensions is easy to understand. Millions and millions of Americans in the so-called ``baby boom'' generation are rapidly approaching retirement age. Companies that reduce the pensions of older workers will thus realize tremendous cost savings when these people retire.  Companies claim that they are converting to cash balance schemes to attract a younger, more mobile workforce. But, worker mobility is not the rationale for converting to a cash balance plan, money is. As 11,000 people a day turn 50, which cash balance promoter Watson Wyatt claims will turn us into a ``Nation of Floridas,'' employers are looking for any way possible to reduce older workers' promised benefits. This is outrageous.  But, what is even more outrageous is that they are not being honest to the employees whose pensions they are slashing. As Joseph Edmunds stated at a 1987 Conference of Consulting Actuaries, ``It is easy to install a cash balance plan in place of a traditional defined benefit plan and cover up cutbacks in future benefits.''  Despite the protestations of cash balance promoters, cash balance schemes are implemented to unlawfully cut the benefits of older employees and to disguise those cuts by implementing a plan that makes it virtually impossible for employees to make an ``apples to apples'' comparison of their benefits under the old and new plans.  Not only does the federal government need to enforce the laws that are on the books, Congress also must pass meaningful pension protections right now. That is why I introduced H.R. 2902. This legislation would primarily do three things:  First, it would send a directive to the Secretary of Treasury to enforce the laws that are already on the books;  Second, it would provide a safe harbor making cash balance plans legal only if employees are given the choice to remain in their old pension plan with detailed disclosure; and  Third, it would provide a major disincentive for companies to slash the future pension benefits of employees.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2902 would provide meaningful pension protection to millions of Americans, unlike the current bill being considered right now. My legislation is being supported by the Pension Rights Center, the National Council of Senior Citizens, the Communications Workers of America, the IBM Employees Benefits Action Coalition, and several other groups. I urge my colleagues to defeat H.R. 3832, and work with me to pass real pension protection.  I include my letter to the IRS signed by 50 other Members, as follows:                                    Congress of the United States,                                     House of Representatives,                                                   Washington, DC.     Department of Treasury,     Internal Revenue Service, Ben Franklin Station Washington,          DC.     Attn: CC:DOM:CORP:R (Cash Balance Plans and Conversions).       We, the undersigned Members of Congress, are pleased to      respond to your request for comments on cash balance pension      plans. (64 Fed. Reg. 56578.)                              introduction       We commend the Internal Revenue Service and Department of      Treasury for the decision to further evaluate your position      on the conversion of traditional defined benefit pension      plans to so-called ``cash balance'' pension plans, and for      soliciting public comments on this matter. Although such      conversions have been occurring for many years, increased      understanding of these conversions has raised serious      questions, particularly whether they violate federal anti-age      discrimination statutes.\1\---------------------------------------------------------------------------     Footnotes at end of letter.---------------------------------------------------------------------------       Prior to the recent, and growing, scrutiny of cash balance      conversions by employees, Members of Congress, and some      actuaries, the complexity of these plans have made it      understandably difficult for the cognizant federal agencies      to fairly evaluate the age discriminatory effect of these      plans. In this instance, the problem has been exacerbated by      what--in the most generous terms--can be described as an      almost complete lack of candor on the part of many proponents      of cash balance conversions in communications with their      employees and the media.\2\       Numerous respected national journals have played a critical      role in bringing to light not only the age discriminatory      impact of these conversions but also the clear age      discriminatory intent of at least some cash balance backers.      Given the large volume of new information and concern about      cash balance plan conversions, we urge the Department of      Treasury, IRS, and all other cognizant federal agencies to      thoroughly reexamine the existing legal requirements for      defined benefit pension plans and the extent to which cash      balance conversions fail to comply therewith. Workers and      members of Congress do not have access to the full      documentation related to these conversions on an      individualized basis, making it critical that the key      government oversight agencies use their access to plan      documents to fully examine and understand the nature and      effect of these conversions. We urge all of the involved      agencies to act quickly within their respective regulatory      authority to remedy the significant legal irregularities that      appear to permeate these conversions, and if it is concluded      that the agencies do not have sufficient authority, to      propose legislation to Congress to address any outstanding      legal issues.       The comments that follow address the following topics:       (1) Cash balance conversions are often intentional attempts      to cut the pension benefits of older employees and increase      the operating income of employers.       (2) Cash balance plans are defined benefit plans, not      defined contribution plans.       (3) Cash balance plans fail to meet the requirements for      defined benefit plans and violate federal anti-age      discrimination statutes.       (4) The ``wear-away'' feature of many cash balance      conversions violate federal anti-age discrimination statutes.       (5) Cash balance conversions should therefore be      disqualified under existing law.       (6) A safe harbor should be established allowing cash      balance plans to meet existing legal requirements only if all      employees are allowed to choose which pension plan works best      for them with detailed disclosure.       Throughout your consideration of cash balance conversions,      we ask the IRS and the Department of the Treasury to bear in      mind, that while the United States has a ``voluntary''      pension system, that system is, and should be, subject to      rigorous statutory and regulatory oversight. This voluntary      pension system receives over $80 billion a year in federal      government subsidies through, inter alia, the tax code. It      will always be the case that corporations will favor public      subsidies without any governmental oversight. However, the      taxpayers have a right to expect that corporations who take      advantage of this special tax treatment will adhere to      requirements of the law, including federal age discrimination      statutes. Given the substantial sums of money in corporate      pension plans, experience has repeatedly shown that, without      governmental vigilance, corporations will attempt to      manipulate their pension plans at the expense of their      employees. Cash balance conversions are just the latest      vehicle to accomplish that goal. In this case, federal age      discrimination statutes provide the IRS and other federal      agencies with the means to stop these schemes, which are      intentional efforts to wring savings from the pensions of      older employers.       (1) Cash balance conversions are often intentional attempts      to cut the pension benefits of older employees and increase      the operating income of employers.       Cash balance plans are a relatively recent innovation. The      first cash balance plan was implemented in 1984, according to      the consulting firm Watson Wyatt Worldwide.\3\ Almost      universally, companies implementing a cash balance plan are      converting from some other type of defined benefit plan.\4\      To date, 22% of the Fortune 100 companies have converted to      some sort of hybrid pension plan, over 70% of which are cash      balance plans.\5\ It is estimated that 20% of those in the      Fortune 500 have converted to a cash balance plan.\6\       Cash balance promoters explain the popularity of cash      balance conversions by arguing that cash balance plans      provide employers with a competitive advantage because these      plans better suit the desires of an increasingly mobile      workforce.\7\ Promoters have also stated that cash balance      plans are easier for employees to understand because the      benefit is expressed in terms of a lump sum dollar amount as      opposed to a monthly benefit under a traditional defined      benefit plan.\8\ These rationales for cash balance      conversions are frequently pretextual.       In truth, a significant reason that corporations convert to      a cash balance plan is to cut the pension benefits of older      workers--workers who comprise a larger and larger percentage      of the workforce.\9\ That cash balance plans reduce the      accrual rate for older workers is not a well-kept secret.      Kyle N. Brown, a retirement and pension lawyer with Watson      Wyatt Worldwide said to a Society of Actuaries Conference in      October of 1998: ``The economic value that is accrued, is      different in hybrid plans than it is for traditional plans.      In essence, that is part of the reason why you want to put      these plans in. You know you are trying to get a different      pattern of accrual. Well, what that means is that for your      older, longer service workers, that their rate of accrual is      going to go down. There is going to be a reduction in their      rate of accrual.''       The reason why large corporations are targeting their older      workers' pensions is easy to understand. Millions and      millions of Americans in the so-called ``baby boomer''      generation are rapidly approaching retirement age. In Watson      Wyatt's July 1998 edition of its Insider newsletter, the      aging of the U.S. labor market is carefully detailed.\10\ As      the newsletter demonstrates, the number of workers in the 55-     64 age category is expected to grow by 54% in the decade from      1996 to 2006.\11\ Companies that target the pensions of older      workers will thus realize tremendous cost savings when these      people retire.       In addition, Watson Wyatt's Insider dispels one of the      other myths advanced by cash balance proponents, namely, that      these plans are a response to an increasingly mobile American      workforce: ``Contrary to popular belief, Americans are not      changing jobs faster than ever before. According to an in-     depth study of employment records by Watson Wyatt, as baby      boomers are driving up the average age of the workforce, job      mobility is decreasing.'' \12\       Cash balance plans are thus not a response to a more mobile      work force. In fact, as Watson Wyatt admits, the percentage      of workers staying at a single employer for 10 years has      risen in the last ten years, as has the percentage staying      with the same company for 20 years.\13\       Worker mobility is not the rationale for converting to a      cash balance plan, money is. As 11,000 people a day turn 50,      which Watson Wyatt posits will turn us into a ``Nation of      Floridas,'' employers need to find ways to retain them.      Instead of creating incentives to retain older workers,      companies have turned to cash balance plans, which make it      much more likely that older workers will have to delay      retirement.\14\ Employers who convert to a cash balance plan      thus see a two-fold benefit. Companies retain older      workers who can no longer afford to retire and the      benefits the employees do receive at retirement will be      significantly lower.       Just as with the worker mobility argument, cash balance      promoters are disingenuous when they argue that the ``lump      sum'' feature of cash balance plans are easier for employees      to understand. To the contrary, cash balance proponents have      argued in favor of these plans because they make it more      difficult for employees to understand that their benefits are      being reduced.\15\       Again, cash balance promoters have been very open amongst      themselves about the ability of these plans to mask benefit      cuts. In a July 27, 1989 letter from Kwasha Lipton to Onan      Corporation, the consultant notes, ``One feature which might      come in handy is that it is difficult for employees to      compare prior pension benefits formulas to the cash balance      approach.''       Similarly, Joseph Edmunds stated at a 1987 Conference of      Consulting Actuaries, ``[I]t is easy to install a cash      balance plan in place of a traditional defined benefit plan      and cover up cutbacks in future benefits.''       Likewise, William Torrie of PriceWaterhouseCoopers at the      October 18-     23, 1998 Society of Actuaries meeting said, ``[C]onverting to      a cash balance plan does have an advantage of it masks a lot      of the changes. . . .''       In addition, current accounting rules actually encourage      the practice of reducing pension benefits. Due to Financial      Accounting Standard (FAS) 87, companies are able to report      pension assets as operating income. By listing pension assets      as operating income, companies can increase their bottom line      by cutting the pension benefits of their workforce, which is      exactly what is happening today.\16\ This is wrong, and must      be put to an end immediately.       We understand that the intended purpose of FAS 87 was to      require the disclosure of pension liabilities. While      transparency regarding an employer's pension situation--both      as to liabilities and surpluses--would appear to be proper,      clearly pension assets are not operating income.\17\ And      allowing them to be characterized as such creates two      perverse incentives. First, it encourages employers to reduce      pension benefits in order to create large pension surpluses.      Second, it distorts the financial health of the company,      making investors believe the company is more profitable than      it actually is. Surplus pension assets should be used for      cost of living increases for pensioned retirees, and other      retirement benefits. Unfortunately, that is not happening      today.\18\ We believe that FAS 87 should be changed to      require employers to list net pension cost as investment      income instead of operating income.\19\       In summary, despite the protestations of cash balance      promoters, these conversions are implemented to unlawfully      cut the benefits of older employees and to disguise those      cuts by implementing a plan that makes it virtually      impossible for employees to make an ``apples to apples''      comparison of their benefits under the old and new plans.\20\      We ask that the Treasury Department, the IRS, and other      federal agencies keep the admissions of cash balance      promoters in mind when evaluating cash balance plans'      compliance with federal age discrimination statutes.\21\       (2) Cash balance plans are defined benefit plans, not      defined contribution plans.       Although there seems to be little dispute that cash balance      plans are defined benefit plans and not defined contribution      plans, we address it briefly.\22\ ERISA and the Code      recognize only two types of pension plans: defined benefit      and defined contribution plans. In the most basic terms, the      distinction between the two is who bears the risk of      investment gains and losses. In defined benefit plans, the      employer bears the risk and in defined contribution plans, it      is the participant. ERISA defines a defined contribution      or individual account plan as, ``[A] pension plan which      provides for an individual account for each participant      and for benefits based solely on the amount contributed to      the participant's account, and any income, expenses,      gains, and losses, and any forfeitures of accounts of      other participants which may be allocated to such      participant's account.'' \23\       A defined benefit plan is any other pension plan which is      not a defined contribution plan.\24\       Cash balance pension plans are not defined contribution      plans because they are employer-funded and participants do      not bear the risk (nor reap the benefits) of investment gains      and losses. Nor, despite the fact that participants are      presented with hypothetical ``cash balances'' do they have      segregated accounts.       Employer cash balance contributions are typically comprised      of two components: a pay credit and an interest credit. The      pay credit is generally a fixed rate of an employee's salary.      The interest credit is designed to mimic defined contribution      plans by providing a hypothetical investment return, usually      calculated as a fixed interest rate or tied to an index such      as the yield on 30-year U.S. Treasury Bonds. Because this      interest credit is calculated based on the difference between      an employee's age and normal retirement age, the amount of      this interest credit relative to the pay credit decreases as      the employee ages.       (3) Cash balance plans fail to meet the requirements for      defined benefit plans and violate federal anti-age      discrimination statutes.       Because cash balance plans are defined benefit plans, they      must comply with the letter of the relevant provisions of      ERISA, the Internal Revenue Code and the ADEA. All three      legal regimes provide that the rate of pension benefit      accruals not be reduced based on the employee's age.\25\ Cash      balance pension conversions violate these provisions because      the rate of benefit accrual is reduced and is reduced because      of the employee's age. This problem is exacerbated by plan      provisions commonly referred to as ``wear away,'' which      prevents older workers from earning new benefits under the      new plan until they exceed those that the employee accrued      under the former plan.       As the IRS is aware, the Code and ERISA contains a detailed      set of standards with which defined benefit plans must      comply. Those standards include rules for reporting and      disclosure, participation and vesting, funding, fiduciary      responsibility, and administration and enforcement. The      benefit accrual requirements, which are contained in the      participation and vesting requirements, are fundamental and      critical protections to ensure that pension plan participants      fairly accrue and receive benefits under their pension plans.      The benefit accrual rules are an important assurance that      participants are treated fairly and that the plan sponsor      does not design the plan to benefit only certain types of      workers.       Under section 204(b)(1)(G) of ERISA, defined benefit plans      are not in compliance with the law ``. . . if the      participant's accrued benefit is reduced on account of an      increase in his age or service.'' Furthermore, under ERISA      Sec. 204(b)(1)(H)(i) and Code Sec. 411(b)(1)(H)(i) and ADEA      Sec. 4(i)(1)(A), a defined benefit shall not be treated as in      compliance ``. . . if, under the plan, an employee's benefit      accrual is ceased, or the rate of an employee's benefit      accrual is reduced, because of the attainment of any age.''       In addition, one of the key elements of a defined benefit      plan is that it promises and provides benefits in the form of      an annuity, a monthly or regular stream of payments at      retirement. ERISA Sec. 3(23) expressly requires that defined      benefit plans determine an individual's accrued benefit ``. .      . expressed in the form of an annual benefit commencing at      normal retirement age.'' And, Code Sec. 411(a)(7), for      purposes of section 411 vesting and accrual rules, defines      ``accrued benefit'' in the case of a defined benefit plan as      ``the employee's accrued benefit determined under the plan      and, except as provided in subsection 9(c)(3), expressed in      the form of an annual benefit commencing at normal retirement      age.'' We firmly believe that the age-neutrality of benefit      accruals must be assessed based upon a normal retirement age      annuity and not on the basis of cash balance plan      ``hypothetical accounts'' which have no legal status under      current law.       Based upon these requirements, cash balance conversions are      in violation of ERISA, the Internal Revenue Code and ADEA. By      definition, older participants accrue benefits at a lesser      rate because they have a shorter period of time to earn      interest than younger workers do. Under a cash balance      scheme, the interest credit is tied directly to the      employee's age.       As Lee Sheppard observed in her January 11, 1999 article in      Tax Notes Today (emphasis added), ``Whether a cash balance      plan would satisfy the proposed [IRS] regulation depends on      the definition of `rate of accrual.' If rate of accrual is      defined by projecting the participant's benefit to an annual      benefit beginning at normal retirement age, then cash balance      plans flunk, because the size of the participant's      actuarially determined benefit is purely a function of his or      her age. Indeed, it is impossible to estimate a cash balance      plan participant's pension benefit without knowing his or her      age.''       Professor Edward Zelinsky of the Benjamin N. Cardozo School      of Law came to the same conclusion in his October 1999 paper,      entitled, ``The Cash Balance Controversy'' (emphasis added),      ``As a matter of law, the typical cash balance plan violates      the statutory prohibition on age-based reductions in the rate      at which participants accrue their benefits * * *. There is      no dispute about the underlying arithmetic: as cash balance      participants age, the contributions made for them decline in      value in annuity terms. Moreover, cash balance arrangements      are defined benefit plans and therefore measure accrued      benefits in terms of annuity equivalents, not in terms of the      contributions themselves.''       Cash balance promoters attempt to counter conclusions such      as Ms. Sheppard's and Professor Zelinsky's by arguing that      the rate of benefit accrual under a cash balance plan should      not be calculated by projecting the pension benefits into an      annuity beginning at normal retirement age. They point out      that neither the Code nor ERISA define ``rate of benefit      accrual.'' Instead, some suggest that the IRS should look at      the absolute dollar amount ``credited'' to employees' cash      balance ``accounts'' annually or that the IRS should remove      cash balance interest credits from its analysis.       This argument is generally founded on statutory      construction that is nonsensical. The accepted canons of      statutory construction dictate that words and phrases should      not be interpreted in isolation, but rather in the context in      which they are used. Section 411(a)(7) of the Code requires      an employees ``accrued benefit'' to be expressed in terms of      an annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age * *      *.'' The term ``accrued benefit'' is used throughout section      411(b)(1). Cash balance promoters opine that, because the      term ``rate of benefit accrual'' is used instead of ``accrued      benefit'' in section 411(b)(1)(H)(i), Congress did not intend      that the IRS should evaluate compliance with      Sec. 411(b)(1)(H)(i) by projecting an employee's annual      benefit beginning at normal retirement age.       It is not surprising that the term accrued benefit is not      used in Sec. 411(b)(1)(H)(i). This subparagraph is concerned      with the pace at which the accrued benefit grows. To insert      the term ``accrued benefit'' in this section would make it      nonsensical. However, by reference to the provisions in the      same paragraph, it is obvious that the benefit that is      accruing is the projected annual benefit at normal retirement      age.\26\       Any doubt about the meaning of the language of      Sec. 411(b)(1)(H)(i) is resolved by comparing it to the      Sec. 411(b)(2)(A), which states in relevant part, ``A defined      contribution plan satisfies the requirements of this      paragraph if * * * the rate at which amounts are allocated to      the employee's account is not reduced, because of the      attainment of any age.''       In essence, cash balance promoters argue that the IRS      should apply Sec. 411(b)(2)(A) in determining whether cash      balance conversions violate the age discrimination statute.      But,     cash balance plans are defined benefit plans, not defined      contribution plans. As such, cash balance plans must comply      with Sec. 411(b)(1)(H)(i). A comparison of the language of      these two sections evidences a different standard. The only      interpretation that makes sense given the context of      Sec. 411(b)(1)(H)(i) and a comparison with the language of      Sec. 411(b)(2)(A) is that the rate of benefit accrual is      evaluated in terms of the projected annual benefit at normal      retirement age.       This interpretation is borne out in the comments of Paul      Strella--currently at the pension consultant firm of William      M. Mercer and formerly a Tax Benefit Counsel at the      Department of Treasury--at a 1992 Enrolled Actuaries Meeting:      ``There is a rule in the Internal Revenue Code, along with      ERISA, that says that the rate of accrual, the rate of      benefit accrual in a pension plan can not decline merely on      account of increasing age. Well, a cash balance plan does      exactly that.''       This view is also apparently shared by some within the IRS.      For example, a September 3, 1998 memorandum from the District      Director of the Ohio Key District in Cincinnati, Ohio to the      Director of Employee Plans Division in Washington, DC states      that at least one cash balance plan ``does not satisfy the      clear and straightforward requirement of Sec. 411(b)(1)(H)(i)      of the Code because the plan's benefit accrual rate decreases      as a participant attains each additional year of age.''       (4) The ``wear-away'' feature of many cash balance      conversions violate federal anti-age discrimination statutes.       In addition to violating Code Sec. 411(b)(1)(H)(i), and      related sections of ERISA and the ADEA, by reducing benefit      accruals based on age, many cash balance plans violate      federal age discrimination law, including Sec. 411(d)(6) of      the Code, through their use of the wear-away mechanism. It      was only during the past year that members of Congress became      aware that in many cash balance conversions, older workers do      not accrue new pension benefits until they have ``worn away''      their previously earned benefits. To permit pension plans to      include ``wear away'' violates both the letter and spirit of      two key ERISA [and ADEA] principles: (1) that accrued      benefits cannot be reduced, and (2) that pension plans cannot      discriminate on the basis of age. To deny participants      additional accruals on the basis of years of service and      benefits already accrued under the plan before the amendment      is contrary to public policy. In this situation, benefits      accrued based on years of service absolutely is a proxy for      age. Plan wear-away provisions do not meet the ERISA/IRC      exception for explicit uniform limitations on benefit      accruals for all workers based upon a maximum number of years      of service. Under wear-away clauses, the only workers who do      not receive continued accruals are the oldest workers. To      claim that they always remain entitled to their accrued      benefit, even though every day it is being eroded and used      against their ability to earn new benefits, makes a mockery      of ERISA's accrued benefit protections.       There is little doubt that the wear-away feature of cash      balance plans is targeted at older workers. The wear-away      takes place because the benefits the employee is entitled to      under the traditional defined benefit plan are greater than      those under the cash balance plan. By definition, the      employees that fit this profile are older workers because      benefits under a traditional defined benefit plan accrue more      quickly for the older, more senior workers while the rate of      accrual under a cash balance plan accrue more slowly for this      group of employees. Given the age discriminatory intent of      cash balance promoters, the IRS should cast a jaundiced eye      at their claims that the disproportionate impact of wear-away      on older workers is not by design.       In our mind, the practice of wear-away is contrary to the      law and public policy and cannot be allowed to continue. The      fact that the IRS has not objected to these provisions in the      past, and may have given some plan sponsors prefatory      language refuting any age discrimination questions, should      not stand in the way of the IRS and other agencies fresh      assessment of whether cash balance plans comply with the law.      In light of the wealth of new information that has become      public in the past year, it is critical that the IRS take all      needed steps to ensure that all pension plans comply with the      law.       (5) Cash balance conversions should therefore be      disqualified under existing law.       As we have discussed, cash balance pension conversion are      illegal under Sec. 411(b)(1)(H) of the Internal Revenue Code,      Sec. 204(b)(1)(H) of ERISA, and Sec. 4(i)(1)(A) of ADEA in      terms of accrual rates. We have also indicated that most cash      balance conversions are in violation of Sec. 411(d)(6) of the      Internal Revenue Code dealing with wear away.       Since, cash balance conversions are in violation of these      laws, we believe that the IRS should disqualify these      conversions under current law. Cash balance promoters have      appealed for regulatory relief on the grounds that they were      lulled into a false sense of security about the legality of      cash balance conversions. We have little sympathy for their      arguments. Much of the difficulty in uncovering the age      discriminatory nature of cash balance conversions lies with      the promoters themselves and they are entitled to no benefit      from the confusion of their own making.       Finally on this point, we note that most of the arguments      made by cash balance promoters are policy arguments for why      hybrid pension plans, including cash balance plans, are a      positive development that deserve the support of the federal      government. Even if those arguments had some merit, which in      our strong view they do not, those arguments are      inappropriate in this regulatory context. Cash balance      conversions violate federal anti-age discrimination statutes.       (6) A safe harbor should be established allowing cash      balance plans to meet existing legal requirements only if all      employees are allowed to choose which pension plan works best      for them with detailed disclosure.       In consideration of the goals of the age discrimination      regimes in the Code, ERISA, and the ADEA, and based on our      considerable consultation with employees affected by cash      balance conversions, we also believe that a safe harbor      should be established that would protect the tax-exempt      status of cash balance conversions if the employers offer all      current employees the choice to remain in the traditional      defined benefit plan. We believe that such a safe harbor      would come the closest to proverbial ``win-win'' outcome for      all stakeholders in the cash balance pension debate.       The safe harbor that we are recommending would necessarily      require the employer to provide a detailed individualized      statement allowing the employees to easily compare between      the traditional defined benefit plan and the cash balance      plan. If the company does not want to provide these      individualized statements, the company may be exempted from      this requirement only if they allow their employees to      choose which pension plan works best for them on the date      that they leave the company. On this date, the company      must also allow the employees to compare exactly how much      they would receive under the traditional defined benefit      plan and the cash balance plan.       Due to the complexities involved, we believe that companies      that have already converted to cash balance plans should be      given at least 90 days to make the above changes in their      pension plan. As we noted above, from a policy standpoint we      believe this represents a middle ground that would most      effectively address the concerns of all involved. For the      employers, their pension plans would continue to enjoy tax-     exempt status. And, for the employees, they would be able to      continue to receive the pension benefits that were promised      to them.       We do not, however, offer here an opinion about whether the      IRS has the authority to implement such a safe harbor under      current federal law. If the IRS determines that it does not      have the authority to do so, we stand ready to support an IRS      request to implement the necessary statutory changes.       Thank you for giving us this opportunity to express our      views. We look forward to working with you to address the      serious age discriminatory impact of cash balance      conversions.

For instance, comments made at numerous American      Society of Actuaries meetings bear out the widespread      understanding that cash balance conversions targeted the      benefits of older workers. This does not, however, in any way      absolve the many corporations--including many Fortune 500      companies--who have made these conversions and who all      ostensibly have sufficient inhouse expertise to understand      the impact of these plans. We are not aware of any companies      who have implemented a cash balance conversion based on the      advice of outside consultations but who lacked a full      understanding of the ramifications for their older workers.      If they do exist, they have yet to come forward.     \3\ See www.watsonwyatt.com/homepage/us/news/pres_rel/Jan99/hybrid-tm.htm.     \4\ Based on unconfirmed anecdotal evidence, there may be one      or two companies that have implemented a cash balance ``from      scratch.'' However, given the hundreds of companies that have      implemented conversions, federal agencies' review of cash      balance plans should focus on them in the context of      conversions.     \5\ See www.watsonwyatt.com/homepage/us/news/pres_rel/Jan99/hybrid-tm.htm.     \6\ Daniel Eisenberg, ``The Big Pension Swap,'' Time Magazine      (April 19, 1999) at 36 (``20% of Fortune 500     companies, including AT and Xerox, now offer these plans      which cover close to 10 million workers nationwide.'').     \7\ Ellen Schultz, ``The Young and Vestless,'' The Wall      Street Journal (December 16, 1999) at A1.
