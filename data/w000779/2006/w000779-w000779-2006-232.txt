I have not been seeking to be put first in the line. What I have been seeking is what I have seen virtually every week since I have been in the Senate.  The distinguished Senator from Illinois is an expert in the rules, and it is my understanding that what we customarily do, we debate a variety of amendments, then we cluster them into a group, five, six, eight--sometimes the number will vary--and at some point the Senate goes on a vote.  I offered to the chairman of the committee to be put in the second or third cluster. I don't have to go first if colleagues feel strongly about this, but at some point it seems to me we ought to say the Senate is accountable, at a time with record profits and record prices, for a program that is the biggest of them all. That is the Royalty Relief Program.  I am happy to yield further.
