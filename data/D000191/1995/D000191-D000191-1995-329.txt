  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, referring to a couple of speakers before us, they somehow claim that we are delaying the activities of the House. The House is in pro forma session today. That means those of us who flew across the United States to attend this session, there will be no recorded votes or there should be only procedural matters. There is no substantive legislation before us. The unfunded mandates bill is not before us, because it has been delayed by the majority. The majority told us all bills will come before the House with open rules. Well, if you want to bring your unfunded mandate bill up with a open rule, what is the problem? We could be in session right now doing unfunded mandates, but you have us waiting for the Rules Committee because they want to restrict debate on unfunded mandates.  Where is the balanced budget amendment, the balanced budget amendment we were promised you would come forward with?  I am a cosponsor of a bipartisan version. Where is it? It is hung up by the majority because they want to insist on a super majority for taxes in that proposal. It is your holdup, not ours.                          ____________________
