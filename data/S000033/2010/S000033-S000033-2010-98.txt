 President, I honor Vermonter Lindol Atkins, Jr., a man who has dedicated his life to the struggle for workers' rights and economic justice. For more than 35 years, Lindol Atkins has provided spiritedand dedicated leadership in representing municipal employees in Burlington. As a former mayor of Burlington, I can attest firsthand that Mr. Atkins has distinguished himself as an indomitable leader of workers' rights efforts in the State of Vermont.  Lindol Atkins began his fight to improve the rights and protections of Burlington city employees back in 1968 when he joined AFSCME. Elected president of AFSCME Local 1343 in 1970, Lindol continued his mission to advance the rights of workers by skillfully handling all grievance and arbitration cases. As the lead negotiator for the union, he also led many successful contract campaigns that ultimately improved employees' wages and working conditions. In 2005, Mr. Atkins retired as president of the Burlington AFSCME local, but rather than slow down and enjoy his well-earned rest he continued his leadership role within the labor movement by being elected president of the Vermont State Labor Council, AFL-CIO.  A husband and father of 12, Lindol Atkins has the enviable ability to be able to do many things well--a wonderful and necessary quality in one with such a deep devotion to the labor movement as well as to his large, loving family. Indeed, it is the dedicated and remarkable people like Lindol Atkins who have kept America moving forward. His unparalleled commitment to civic values has been a major factor in earning Vermont its well-deserved reputation for social justice and principled community leadership. Lindol has received many awards for his work guiding Vermont's labor movement, with the capstone being the presentation of this year's AFL-CIO Presidential Lifetime Achievement Award.  The quality of life in Vermont, and in our Nation, is strengthened by individuals such as Lindol Atkins, Jr., whose quest to better working conditions for men and women in his community has brought a great sense of solidarity to not just the people of Vermont, but the entire Nation. I commend his loyalty and great contributions to the labor movement, to Vermont, and to the United States.                          ____________________
