 The Five Nations Citizens Land Reform Act of 2000, would transfer from Oklahoma State courts to the Federal Government, jurisdiction over the conveyance, the devise, inheritance, lease, encumbrance, and partition of restricted property, allotment lands, belonging to the members of the Cherokee Nation, Chickasaw Nation, Choctaw Nation, Seminole Nation of Oklahoma, and Muscogee (Creek) Nation.  Unlike other federally recognized Indian tribes whose jurisdiction over their lands lies with the Secretary of the Interior, jurisdiction over the lands of these five tribes was placed in various Oklahoma district courts many years ago. H.R. 5308 would have probate proceedings and management and disposition of Indian lands proceed through the Department of the Interior rather than through the multiple State courts. Thus, the restricted lands of the five tribes would be treated like the federally protected allotments of land of other federally recognized tribes.  H.R. 5308 would also allow for simplification of the law applicable to allotted Indian lands, would simplify the process for leasing allotted lands, would simplify the Indian land probate and heirship determination process, and would assist in the prevention of the fractionation of Indian lands.  Nothing in H.R. 5308 would diminish the trust responsibility of the United States over restricted lands. The five tribes and the Oklahoma State Bar Association, the governor of Oklahoma, and members of the Oklahoma delegation have spent years working on this legislation.                              {time}  1415  Now that everybody has agreed, it is time to pass H.R. 5308.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
