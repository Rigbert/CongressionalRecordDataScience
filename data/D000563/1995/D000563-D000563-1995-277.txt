Possibly the greatest investment in modern times in America's infrastructure was made under a Republican President, President Eisenhower, who decided in the fifties that the United States would embark on an Interstate Highway System. It was unheard of. He was going to link up every corner of America through a modern highway system. In my part of the world, my hometown, Springfield, IL, is on old Route 66. It used to be the subject of a lot of songs and a lot of Americana. But Route 66 was replaced by Interstate 55, and so many other interstate systems. At the same time the middle class is growing after World War II with our GI bill and our investment, America made an investment in infrastructure that has paid off so handsomely for us. It is the greatest thing in the world when one of my communities, Quincy, IL, was recently designated as being on an interstate highway. All of a sudden now they have a chance to brag and say not only have we got a great highway, it is interstate standard. So you think about what this means to a community. If we do not keep up that investment in not only our highways and our bridges and our airports and ports, but in the people who build them, then frankly we will pay dearly in the future.  I watch some of these cuts that are coming down the line here.
