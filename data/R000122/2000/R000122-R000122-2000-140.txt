Con. Res. 93       Whereas multiple sclerosis is a chronic and often disabling      disease of the central nervous system which often first      appears in people between the ages of 20 and 40, with      lifelong physical and emotional effects;       Whereas multiple sclerosis is twice as common in women as      in men;       Whereas an estimated 250,000 to 350,000 individuals suffer      from multiple sclerosis nationally;       Whereas symptoms of multiple sclerosis can be mild, such as      numbness in the limbs, or severe, such as paralysis or loss      of vision;       Whereas the progress, severity, and specific symptoms of      multiple sclerosis in any one person cannot yet be predicted;       Whereas the annual cost to each affected individual      averages $34,000, and the total cost can exceed $2,000,000      over an individual's lifetime;       Whereas the annual cost of treating all people who suffer      from multiple sclerosis in the United States is nearly      $9,000,000,000;       Whereas the cause of multiple sclerosis remains unknown,      but genetic factors are believed to play a role in      determining a person's risk for developing multiple      sclerosis;       Whereas many of the symptoms of multiple sclerosis can be      treated with medications and rehabilitative therapy;       Whereas new treatments exist that can slow the course of      the disease, and reduce its severity;       Whereas medical experts recommend that all people newly      diagnosed with relapse-remitting multiple sclerosis begin      disease-modifying therapy;       Whereas finding the genes responsible for susceptibility to      multiple sclerosis may lead to the development of new and      more effective ways to treat the disease;       Whereas increased funding for the National Institutes of      Health would provide the opportunity for research and the      creation of programs to increase awareness, prevention, and      education; and       Whereas Congress as an institution, and Members of Congress      as individuals, are in unique positions to help raise public      awareness about the detection and treatment of multiple      sclerosis and to support the fight against multiple      sclerosis: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives      concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--       (1) all Americans should take an active role in the fight      to end the devastating effects of multiple sclerosis on      individuals, their families, and the economy;       (2) the role played by national and community organizations      and health care professionals in promoting the importance of      continued funding for research, and in providing information      about and access to the best medical treatment and support      services for people with multiple sclerosis should be      recognized and applauded; and       (3) the Federal Government has a responsibility to--       (A) continue to fund research so that the causes of, and      improved treatment for, multiple sclerosis may be discovered;       (B) continue to consider ways to improve access to, and the      quality of, health care services for people with multiple      sclerosis;       (C) endeavor to raise public awareness about the symptoms      of multiple sclerosis; and       (D) endeavor to raise health professional's awareness about      diagnosis of multiple sclerosis and the best course of      treatment for people with the disease.
