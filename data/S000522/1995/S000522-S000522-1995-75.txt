Mr. Chairman, I hear some people saying we have too many votes on abortion. I frankly do not like a lot of votes and debate on this issue. Let me just say very candidly and clearly that absent the votes and the amendments and the language we will be paying for, in one appropriations bill after another, abortion on demand.  This is not a benign process. If there is not explicit language proscribing the use for abortion, we will then be subsidizing abortion on demand. This language that is included by the gentleman from Kentucky, Hal Rogers, the chairman of the subcommittee, would stop funding abortions in the Bureau of Prisons. Forty or so abortions were done prior to the language going into effect some time ago in the 1980's. The gentleman from California, Bob Dornan, was the author of that language.  It seems to me it is worth the inconvenience, it is worth the difficulty, and again, I do not like going through this time and time again, but it is worth it if we can cease the facilitation and the subsidization of the killing of at least one child, and in this case we are talking about dozens of children. It seems to me that again we are talking about Government subsidization of abortion on demand.  The pendulum, without question, is swinging in favor of life. People no longer want to subsidize and pay out of their pockets for the chemical poisoning or the literal dismemberment of an unborn child's body. We happen to believe that the women are the victims as well, the co-victim, if you will. We want to see positive, nonviolent solutions to women who have pregnancies that were unintended, not the killing of their unborn babies.  Please, do not force me, my wife and my family and all of us, to pay for it. Again, the language the gentleman from Kentucky has put in would do that. Defeat the Norton amendment.
