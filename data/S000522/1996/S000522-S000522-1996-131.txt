Mr. Chairman, I want to respond briefly to my good friend from California [Mr. Doolittle] and the comments he made a while ago. Actually the chart that he showed shows the exact opposite, if I may say so.  At the beginning of the Bracero program we had an increase in the number of illegal aliens coming into the country. The decrease that was caused was not by the Bracero program. It was by President Eisenhower instituting what was then called Operation Wetback that effectively sealed the border. It had nothing to do with the Bracero program. The reduction in illegal aliens was because of the President's policy at that time. The Bracero program at the beginning of it actually increased the number of illegal aliens coming in, because more people were encouraged to come and try to get into the country.
