President, I ask unanimous consent that following Senator Bryan's remarks, the Senate then proceed to consideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. 2605, the energy and water appropriations bill. I further ask consent that reading of the report be waived and there then be 1 hour of debate equally divided between the chairman and ranking member.  I finally ask consent that at 2:15 today the Senate proceed to a vote on the adoption of the conference report, with no intervening action or debate.
