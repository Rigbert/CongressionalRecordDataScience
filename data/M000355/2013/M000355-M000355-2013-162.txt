 The one thing the two leaders have always agreed on is to protect the integrity of the institution.  For those who may be observing this colloquy, they probably wonder why it is occurring. I wish to explain to our colleagues--and to any others who may be watching while this colloquy occurs--Senate Republicans are tired of the culture of intimidation.  We have seen it over in the executive branch with the IRS and we have seen it at HHS with regard to ObamaCare; this feeling that if you are not in the majority you need to sit down, shut up, and get out of the way. That mentality, that arrogance of power, has seeped into the Senate.  The culture of intimidation is this: Do what I want to do when I want to do it or I will break the rules of the Senate--change the rules of the Senate by breaking the rules of the Senate. In other words, it is the intimidation, the threat that has been hanging over the Senate as an institution for the last few months. It needs to come to an end.  I believe that is why the Senator from Tennessee and myself would like the majority leader to answer the question does he intend to keep his word.  Senators shouldn't have to walk on eggshells around here, afraid to exercise the rights they have under the rules of the Senate. There is no question that all Senators have a lot of power in this body. This body operates on unanimous consent. That means if any 1 of the 100 wants to deny that, it makes it hard. That is the way the Senate has been for a very long time.  I want the culture of intimidation by the majority in the Senate to come to an end. The way it can end is for the majority leader to say: My word is good, and we will quit having this culture of intimidation hanging over the Senate for the next year and a half.
