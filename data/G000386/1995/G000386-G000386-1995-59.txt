 President, several weeks ago on this floor, I addressed the issue of what I regard as a serious and growing problem in this country. The problem has two major features: Disturbing indications of a new drug epidemic among the Nation's young; and a lack of leadership from the administration either to provide the necessary moral guidance at home or to sustain programs overseas.  I called upon Democrats and Republicans to join in an effort to reverse this trend. In addition, Senator Coverdell and I worked to restore funding to our international narcotics efforts as did Senator McConnell. We hope that as we go to conference with the House that we can preserve the funding for our international programs that contribute to our overall efforts to fight drug abuse. Yesterday, Senator Hatch, in an eloquent and forceful statement, joined me in summoning up the awareness and resolve that we need to address now the dangerous trends we see in teenage drug use. Something that we must do before we find ourselves deep in a new wave of addicts and ruined lives.  Two weeks ago, Senator Dole pointed out the seriousness of the problems that we face in an insightful opinion piece. As he noted there, we have lost our focus on drug policy. As a result the voice most commonly heard on the drug issue is from those who favor legalization in one form or another. Despite the fact that the public routinely, by overwhelming majorities, opposes any such notion, the press, our cultural elite, and some of our political leaders act as if this was not the case. The most remembered voice on the Clinton administration's drug policy was the call by Joclyn Elders, the Surgeon General of the United States, for legalization. The result of a policy of replacing Just Say No with Just Say Nothing has had predictable results.  Our interdiction efforts have fallen off as the focus on law enforcement has diminished. The priorities at DEA and Customs have shifted away from international efforts. Even domestically these agencies are doing far less to combat drug trafficking, as declines in arrests and seizures indicate. The Coast Guard has seen its budget shrink for drug control, and DOD counterdrug funding has plummeted. More seriously, the administration has not fought for its own programs or supported its own drug czar in Congress. And the President has abandoned the bully pulpit--something that his own Attorney General, his Secretary of Health and Human Services, and his drug czar have called one of the most important tools in our counterdrug arsenal.  As a consequence, the message that drug use is both harmful and wrong is simply not getting to the audience that most needs it--young Americans. Marijuana use is on the rise, dramatically. Lest anyone forget, this was how the drug epidemic of the 1960's and 1970's got started. Marijuana was the gateway to an age of major drug addiction. We are seeing a repeat of that history because we failed to learn from our history. Today's marijuana, however, is many times more potent than anything from the 1960's, and we know a great deal more about the dangerous health consequences of even small use. Thus, we are not ignorant. We are, however, in danger of being negligent.  It is not as if we have learned nothing about what works. After many years of trial and error, we hit upon the mix of things that gets the job done. The first hurdle we overcame in the efforts of the late 1980's was to realize that counterdrug efforts cannot be a sometime thing. We need consistency and sustained effort.  We also learned that we needed comprehensive programs that combine effective interdiction, law enforcement, education, prevention, and treatment in well-publicized efforts. This is what it takes to send a clear message to the most at-risk population--young people between the ages of 12 and 20. When we managed to put these things together we saw significant declines in use.  Now, however, all that is at risk. We have retreated from what works. We have seen rhetoric that tries to ignore one of the most significant parts of the message about illegal drug use--that drugs are illegal because they are dangerous and wrong. Instead, the voice we hear says that drugs are dangerous because they are illegal. Or just as bad, that the only way to deal with the problem of drug abuse is through treatment. And we have seen program changes that reinforce this view. Once again, however, we can see the obvious: When you do not make it clear that drug use is not only harmful but wrong, and that use has consequences both social and judicial, then the coherence of the message is lost on our young people.  We need to revitalize our efforts. To remind ourselves of our responsibilities and of what is needful. It also involves asking ourselves what are the appropriate responses of the Federal Government. It certainly is not simply throwing money at programs.  There are a number of things the Federal Government is best able to do and most responsible for. First, there is a need to develop sound strategies that have substance rather than rhetoric as their main components. Second, Federal authorities need to focus on those things State and local authorities are less able or unable to do. This means, in particular, a major focus on interdiction, international control efforts, and law enforcement at and near the borders. These are areas that have suffered the most in recent years.  Third, we need consistent, visible leadership that ensures the level of cooperation and oversight of individual programs necessary to produce coordinated efforts. We need a drug czar whose authority is backed by a President committed to the effort.  Fourth, we need to renew our public agenda. To encourage local groups, family organizations, and private, voluntary groups in their efforts to fight drug abuse and the creeping influence of legalizers. We need a Just-Say-No czar with visibility and credibility.  Fifth, we need to revitalize our interdiction efforts at and near the borders and to recover the lost ground in recent years. We need to stop using our Federal drug law enforcement officers as deputy sheriffs in local jurisdictions. They should be focusing on the major cases that involve multiple jurisdictions. We need a recommitment to protect our borders, something even more important as we move forward with NAFTA.  Sixth, we need a major international effort to go after the major criminal organizations that are responsible for a spreading wave of criminality here and abroad.  Finally, we need congressional commitment to sustain realistic programs that have proven records. We need all of these things today.  As chairman of the Drug Caucus, I have highlighted the problems in the past. It is time for us to move ahead. In this regard, as a first step, I intend to offer a sense-of-the-Senate resolution in the coming days calling for a day of national drug awareness. This is in conjunction with Red Ribbon Week, sponsored by the National Family Partnership. I call on my colleagues and all Americans to wear a red ribbon during the period of October 23-31 in memory of a real hero in the drug war, Enrique Camarena, a DEA agent killed fighting drug traffickers, and as a reminder of and commitment to a drug free country.  In the coming weeks I will be working with the private sector and my colleagues to bring greater focus to and effort on the drug issue. It is time. It is necessary. It is right. We need to make the whole country one big drug-free zone.                          ____________________
