 President, today I wish to honor BG Michael T. Heston of Richmond, VT. This Sunday, July 15, 2018, Brigadier General Heston will relinquish command of the Vermont Army National Guard and celebrate his military retirement. We are truly fortunate to have such a dedicated leader as Brigadier General Heston serving in our Armed Forces, and I sincerely thank him for his 32 years of extraordinary service to Vermont and our country.  Brigadier General Heston began his military career as an enlisted member of the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve. He received his commission from Vermont's officer candidate school in 1990 as a second lieutenant and then swiftly rose through the ranks, reaching his current rank of brigadier general in 2014.  Throughout his career, Brigadier General Heston has commanded at all levels, from platoon leader of an armor platoon to commanding the entire Vermont Army National Guard, leading the women and men of the Green Mountain Boys in critical missions within our State of Vermont, as well as overseas, including three deployments to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. His unwavering leadership and dedication has been recognized with numerous awards and decorations, including the Bronze Star Medal with bronze oakleaf cluster, the Meritorious Service Medal with three oakleaf clusters, the Army Commendation Medal with three oakleaf clusters, the Army Reserve Components Achievement Medal with silver oakleaf cluster and two oakleaf clusters, the Vermont Career Service Award, and many others.  In addition to his military service, Brigadier General Heston served as a member of the Vermont State police from 1983 until his retirement in 2009. He has also served as the deputy adjutant general of the Vermont National Guard since 2014, a position he will continue to fill as he enters civilian life. We are fortunate to continue benefiting from Brigadier General Heston's many years of experience as he mentors leaders and members of Vermont's National Guard and provides invaluable advice and support to the adjutant general.  There is no doubt that Brigadier General Heston's decades of dedication, leadership, and service will be long remembered by a grateful State and Nation. I know his wife, June, their children Kelsey and Keegan, and his fellow members of the Vermont National Guard join me in congratulating him on his many accomplishments so far and wishing him well in the next phase of his career. The State of Vermont is lucky to count him as one of our own, and we look forward to his continued presence with the Vermont National Guard.                          ____________________
