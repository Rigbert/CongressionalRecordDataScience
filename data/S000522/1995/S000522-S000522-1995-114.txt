Mr. Chairman, I just want to remind Members, too, the International Planned Parenthood Federation out of London, not only supports abortion globally, but considers it their goal to lobby to bring down pro-life statutes throughout the world.  But this is from the Chinese news agency:       Dr. Halfdan Mahler, a top official of the International      Planned Parenthood Federation, today praised China as a model      for all countries, particularly developing countries in      family planning. ``China has set a good example for      developing countries to follow in controlling the population      growth,'' he said.  The date of that quote is August 27, 1994.  These are the kind of organizations that, if they decide to put up that wall of separation, yes, we will provide money to them, as we have in the past. Again, that money has gone up during the Reagan-Bush years under the Mexico City policy.  But that kind of statement about the Chinese policy is contemptible, where women are being exploited, where forced abortion is the rule, not the exception, and where now we see such egregious practices as infanticide, where children are killed right at birth, primarily because they are girls, and where just recently, as Members know, a nationwide policy went into effect that is absolutely reminiscent of the Nazis: a eugenics policy where if even the one child is found to be defective in some way, that woman is forcibly aborted because they want to have a master race. That is absolutely sick.  I ask for a ``no'' vote on the Meyers amendment and a ``yes'' vote on the underlying Smith amendment.
