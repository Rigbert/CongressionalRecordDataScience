President, I rise in support of S. 1959, the fiscal year 1997 energy and water development appropriations bill.  I am particularly pleased that the Senate is restoring funding for renewable energy programs. A portion of the restored funds will go to support a Federal interagency board, The Committee on Renewable Energy Commerce and Trade [CORECT]. This program came out of legislation authored by Senator Hatfield and myself in the 97th Congress which President Reagan signed. The premise of the legislation was simple: build effectiveness of Government export assistance programs by having Federal agencies work together, team together. CORECT has worked well. Not only has United States industry identified nearly $2 billion of potential in Latin America alone, but global sales for United States renewable energy equipment and services have more than doubled over the last few years.  Mr. President, I also want to thank the chairman and ranking member for including funding for a particular project--the restoration of wetlands on the Williamson River in Oregon.  This project is one of the results of an environmental initiative by my colleague, Senator Hatfield, over the past several years.  When endangered fish concerns and other environmental problems started coming to light on the Upper Klamath River in the southern part of our state, it was Senator Hatfield who provided funding and direction to all the Federal agencies involved to work together on solutions, instead of standing around blaming each other for the problems. And, it was Senator Hatfield who got them to bring the local stakeholders together to work in league with the agencies in considering those problems and trying to agree on solutions--not in the courts, but sitting down face to face with each other.  The people at that table--including the farmers who use water from the Bureau of Reclamation's Klamath project, the Klamath Tribe, hydro generators, other commercial interests, Oregon Trout, and the Nature Conservancy--probably won't ever achieve perfect harmony. They each have their own priorities. But working together, they have been able to agree on positive steps to take to solve some of the environmental problems in the Upper Klamath Basin--and the Tulana Farms wetlands restoration project at the mouth of the Williamson River is one of those.  The Fish and Wildlife Service identified this restoration as a key element in restoring two endangered fish species on the river, and the Nature Conservancy worked with CH2MHill to design the project in such a way that it adds flexibility to the use of the hydro and irrigation projects on the river, rather than constraining it.  They also designed the project to keep a parcel of the Tulana Farms property in agricultural production, because of its role as an important source of seed potatoes for neighboring farmers.  The Federal Government has a responsibility to address the sorts of problems people are facing on the Upper Klamath. But I am proud to say that the Klamath Basin Working Group working with the Klamath Ecosystem Restoration Office did not simply pass the responsibility for solving these problems--or the bill--to the Federal Government.  They have taken on a substantial part of that responsibility. The restoration work and management of the project will be done by the Nature Conservancy. PacifiCorp and the New Earth Co., both of which have operations on the Upper Klamath system, are contributing $4 million of private funding to the project.  Complaining about a problem is a whole lot easier than solving it, especially when a solution affects lots of different interests, and lots of different people. I want to congratulate the people who have worked together to make this project possible, and urge my colleagues to support the work they have taken on.         tva competing with private sector on engineering work
