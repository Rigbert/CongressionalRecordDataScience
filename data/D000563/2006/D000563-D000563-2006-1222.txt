President, I rise today to honor an outstanding Illinoisan, Dr. Dwain ``Doc'' Preston, one of our State's finest educators, and congratulate him on his upcoming retirement.  Doc Preston began his teaching career in 1961, after serving in the Air Force, at Quincy Junior High School in Quincy, IL. Since then, he has taught high school and college students in a variety of fields including American history, English, and speech.  Doc Preston is retiring from his position at Quincy Notre Dame High School, QND, where he has educated and inspired his students for more than 25 years. He has also taught at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign, Western Illinois University in Macomb, and John Wood Community College in Quincy. Doc has taught his mother, mother-in-law, wife, and all four of his daughters at some point in time. He also takes great pride in teaching senior citizens how to tell their life stories through writing.  Doc has served as a mentor and role model to so many students in western Illinois, including current and former members of my Senate staff. He has emphasized the importance of writing and public speaking in all fields and careers and gently encouraged even the quietest students to express themselves.  In addition to his many successes as an educator, including winning the prestigious Golden Apple and Rush Memorial Awards, Doc Preston is a prolific author and photographer as well as a professional storyteller. He possesses a lifetime love of politics and has been active in his community. He is a sage political observer and adviser, whether helping students on the Quincy Notre Dame Student Council or lending a hand in writing announcement speeches for candidates.  Doc is supported in all his endeavors by his wonderful wife, Regina, also a QND faculty member, and their 4 daughters--Carolyn, Cheryl, Deborah, and Teresa--and 11 grandchildren. He has shown his devotion to his family by writing poems and books to mark the births and birthdays of his grandchildren as well as the weddings and birthdays of his daughters and wife.  Mr. President, I congratulate Dr. Dwain Preston on his many accomplishments throughout his long and distinguished career. I am sure his retirement will give him more time to spend with his family, write, and cheer on the St. Louis Cardinals.  I thank him for his service and wish him all the best.                          ____________________[Page S3568]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                       HONORING DR.
