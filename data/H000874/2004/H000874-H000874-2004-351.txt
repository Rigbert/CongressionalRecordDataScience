 Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, next week the House will convene on Monday at 12:30 p.m. for morning hour debates and 2 p.m. for legislative business. We will consider several measures under suspension of the rules, and a final list of those bills will be sent to Members' offices by the end of this week. Any votes called on these measures will be rolled until 6:30 p.m.  On Tuesday, the House will convene at 12 p.m. We plan to consider additional measures under suspension of the rules, as well as H.R. 3966, the ROTC and Military Recruiter Equal Access to Campus Act. Next week we also expect to consider H.R. 3550, the TEA-LU highway bill.  Finally, I would like to remind all Members that next week is a full 5-day work week. We may work some late nights as we work to complete these important pieces of legislation. I am happy to answer any questions.                              {time}  1830
