Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 65th anniversary of Toledo's unique train station. Toledo's Union Terminal, now known as the Martin Luther King, Jr. Plaza, celebrated its 65th year serving America's rail system on September 22, 2015.  Toledo's station is the busiest rail station in Ohio. It opened with fanfare just south of downtown Toledo in 1950. Envisioned as the presentation of the city to the world, Toledo's train terminal was a modern design creatively utilizing the glass which put Toledo on the world stage.  As the 20th Century dawned, Toledoans clamored for a modern station with a look toward the future, even cheering when the city's train depot caught fire in 1930. However, it would be decades before the 1886 Victorian structure would be replaced. Following WWII railroads again turned toward infrastructure improvements, including the Toledo station.  As Amtrak describes in its Great American Stations, ``Upon its opening in September 1950, Toledo Union Station was hailed in the New York Times as the ``$5,000,000 Dream of 40 Years,'' and a week of events was planned to celebrate the new building. Admiral Chester Nimitz, commander-in-chief of the combined American forces in the Pacific during World War II, was invited as the principal speaker. Events included a ``Youngster's Day,'' a city-wide tea party, and ``Glass Day'' during which the city's glass manufacturers unveiled a Vitrolite (an opaque, pigmented glass then manufactured by the local Libby Owens Ford Company) mural in the building. The highlight of the festivities was the opening day parade where a model of the old Union Depot was set on fire.  ``The station which rose along Emerald Ave from 1947 to 1950 was unabashedly modern, incorporating restrained Art Deco lines and large expanses of glass block in reference to the city's main industry. Commentators expounded upon the variety of glass used in the building, including plate glass, glass block, double-glazed and tempered glass. Soon enough, the press referred to the station as the `Palace of Glass.' ''  In 1995 the Toledo-Lucas County Port Authority purchased Union Terminal from Conrail,which has succeeded New York Central. With the help of significant federal investment augmented by a partnership from state and private sources, the station underwent a major renovation and was renamed Central Union Plaza. Amtrak's history notes that ``The Port Authority worked with the State Historic Preservation Office and the Northwest Ohio Historic Preservation Council in order to maintain the building's essential historic design features remained intact.'' Because ``City funding stipulated that one percent of project monies had to be used on public art, the Port Authority worked with the Arts Commission of Greater Toledo to add contemporary sculptures to the grounds to enhance its function as a vital piece of the public realm.''  In 2001, the station was renamed in honor of eminent civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. It now serves as a modern train station through which more than 63,000 travelers pass each year. It will soon add bus service as it grows into a greater multimodal transportation hub linking rail and bus, as well as proximity to waterborne vessels.  Historically, the Toledo passenger rail center has anchored northwest Ohio along the well-established east-west Chicago-Cleveland freight and passenger rail route so vital to the economy of the region and northern Ohio. Meeting the needs of the future for this region will require the recognition that modernization of this rail corridor is essential to future commerce including separation of freight and passenger service to make both more efficient.  I am honored this week to join with the community of Toledo, Ohio in celebrating the anniversary of the Martin Luther King, Jr. Plaza, a jewel in our city born of an era when trains were a modern marvel of transportation and traveling toward a future which meets the needs of travels in the 21st Century and beyond.                          ____________________
