 President, I am very pleased to rise today in support of the Hatch-Feinstein amendment, a comprehensive package which contains no less than three different bills which I have introduced, which all seek to stem the steady tide of criminal violence in this country.  Specifically, it includes the following bills which I have introduced:  The Federal Gang Violence Act, a comprehensive package of measures which were recommended by law enforcement to increase their ability to combat the increasingly-violent criminal gangs which are spreading across the country. Senator Hatch and I introduced this legislation in the past two congresses, and some of its provisions have already been included in thebill before us today, as Title II of the bill.  The James Guelff Body Armor Act of 1999, which is designed to increase police and public safety by taking body armor out of the hands of criminals and putting it in the hands of police. I introduced this earlier this year as S. 783, and it has been co-sponsored by Senators Sessions, Boxer, Reid, Bryan, and Kerry. We also have incorporated S. 726, the Officer Dale Claxton Bullet Resistant Police Protective Equipment Act of 1999, which was introduced by Senators Campbell and Torricelli.  Anti-bombmaking legislation, which is designed to do everything possible under the Constitution to take information about how to make a bomb off the Internet by criminalizing the distribution of such information for a criminal purpose. I have introduced it in the past as an amendment to other bills, with the support of Senator Biden, and introduced it earlier this year as part of S. 606, with Senators Nickles, Hatch, and Mack.  This amendment also includes provisions drafted by Senator Hatch to address animal enterprise terrorism, which he introduced earlier this year as part of his omnibus crime bill, S. 899.  I want to express my great thanks to the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee for working with me to put this package together, which is obviously of the highest priority to me.  Let me now describe what it does, in more detail:                                 gangs  Gangs are no longer a local problem involving small groups of wayward youths. Rather, gang violence has truly become a problem of national scope.  The U.S. Justice Department issued a report which details the dramatic scope of this problem: there are over 23,000 youth gangs, in all 50 states; it will come as no surprise to you to learn that California is the number one gang state, with almost 5,000 gangs, and more than three times as many gang members as the next-most gang-plagued state; and overall, there are almost 665,000 gang members in the country, more than a ten-fold increase since 1975. [Source: U.S. Department of Justice, 1995 National Youth Gang Survey, released in August, 1997.]  In Los Angeles alone, nearly 7,300 of its citizens were murdered in the last 16 years from gang warfare, more people than have been killed in all the terrorist fighting in northern Ireland.  Today's gangs are organized and sophisticated traveling crime syndicates--much like the Mafia. They spread out and franchise across the country, many from California.  The Los Angeles-based 18th Street gang now deals directly with the Mexican and Colombian drug cartels, and has expanded its operations to Oregon, Utah, El Salvador, Honduras, and Mexico.  Local police and the FBI have traced factions of the Bloods and Crips to more than 119 cities in the West and Midwest with more than 60,000 members.  The Gangster Disciples, according to local authorities, is a Chicago-based 30,000 member multi-million dollar gang operation spanning 35 states, which traffics in narcotics and weapons, with income estimated at $300,000 daily.  A 1995 study of gang members by the National Gang Crime Research Center found: three-quarters of the gangs exist in multiple geographic areas; half of the gang members belonged to gangs which did not arise locally, but arose with contact from a gang from outside the area; and 61 percent indicated their gang was an official branch of a larger national gang.  Sgt. Jerry Flowers with the gang crime unit in Oklahoma City captured the migration instinct of these gangs when he said: ``the gang leaders realized that the same ounce of crack cocaine they sold for $300 in Los Angeles was worth nearly $2,000 in Oklahoma City.''  Gangs also steer at-risk youth into crime. A recently released study by the National Institute of Justice went about answering the question: ``Are gangs really responsible for increases in crime or are youths who grow up in very difficult circumstances but do not join gangs committing just as many crimes?'' To answer this, the Institute scientifically compared gang members with demographically similar at-risk youth in four cities.  The results were very revealing, and I think it's important to share these with the Senate:       The research revealed that criminal behavior committed by      gang members is extensive and significantly exceeds that      committed by comparably at-risk but nongang youth.                           *   *   *   *   *       Youths who join gangs tend to begin as `wannabes' at about      age 13, join about 6 months later, and get arrested within 6      months after joining the gang. By age 14 they already have an      arrest record.                           *   *   *   *   *       An important positive correlation exists between when these      individuals joined gangs and when their arrest histories      accelerated.                           *   *   *   *   *       [D]ata indicate that gang involvement significantly      increases one's chances of being arrested, incarcerated,      seriously injured, or killed.                           *   *   *   *   *       [G]ang members are far more likely to commit certain      crimes, such as auto theft; theft; assaulting rivals;      carrying concealed weapons in school; using, selling, and      stealing drugs; intimidating or assaulting victims and      witnesses; and participating in drive-by shootings and      homicides than nongang youths.                           *   *   *   *   *       Gang members . . . are better connected to nonlocal sources      than nongang drug traffickers.                           *   *   *   *   *       [N]early 75 percent of gang members acknowledged that      nearly all of their fellow gang members own guns. Even more      alarming, 90 percent of gang interviewees reported that gang      members favor powerful, lethal weapons over small caliber      handguns.  Finally, the study noted, ``By all accounts, the number of youth gangs and their members continues to grow.''  To help stem this tide, my staff met for months with prosecutors, law enforcement officers, and community leaders to search for solutions to the problem of gang violence.  The Federal Gang Violence Act makes the federal government a more active partner in the war against violent and deadly organized gangs. Provisions which are already in the bill include:  Making it a federal crime to recruit someone to join a criminal gang, subject to a one year mandatory minimum if an adult is recruited, and a four year mandatory minimum if a minor is recruited.  One of the most insidious tactics of today's gangs is the way they target children to do their dirty work, and indoctrinate them into a life of crime.  For example, the 18th street gang which I described earlier, according to the Los Angeles Times, ``resembles a kind of children's army,'' with recruiters who scout middle schools for 11- to 13-year-old children to join the gang. The gang's real leaders, however, are middle-aged veteranos, long-time gang members who direct its criminal activities from the background.  The establishment of a High Intensity Interstate Gang Activity Area program.  Efforts to combat gang violence have been hampered by jurisdictional boundaries. The Los Angeles Times has opined that,       To date, that sort of `in it for the long haul' anti-gang      effort has not occurred among law enforcement authorities      here. Local police agencies fail to share information and are      unwilling to commit resources outside their boundaries; this      is always a problem in multi-jurisdictional Southern      California. Federal law enforcement agencies have come in,      but only for limited times. Meanwhile, the outlaw force gets      nothing more than a bloody nose.       The growth, greed and brutality of the 18th Street gang      demand a coordinated local, state and federal response, one      prepared to continue for months and even years if necessary.  To remedy this situation, I crafted a program modeled after the popular High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area, or HIDTA, program. The HIIGAA program:  Adds $100 million per year for prosecutors and prevention programs, targeted to areas that are particularly involved in interstate criminal gang activity, for: Joint federal-state-local law enforcement task forces, ``for the coordinated investigation, disruption, apprehension, and prosecution of criminal activities of gangs and gang members'' in the areas; and community-based gang prevention programs in the areas.  These areas are designated by the Attorney General, who in so doing mustconsider: The extent to which gangs from the area are involved in interstate or international criminal activity; the extent to which the area is affected by the criminal activity of gang members who are located in or have relocated from other states or foreign countries; and the extent to which the area is affected by the criminal activity of gangs that originated in other states or foreign countries (e.g., by migration of Crips and Bloods).  I believe that this program could be tremendously helpful to the L.A. area in particular, as it is the leading source of interstate gang activity in the country, and could help bring together Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino and other counties with the state and federal governments, in a coordinated, focused effort, balanced between enforcement and prevention, to beat back the gangs.  The amendment Senator Hatch and I are offering today would increase the emphasis upon prevention in this program by boosting that share from 25 to 40 percent, consistent with the committee's action last Congress. The recent NIJ study which I mentioned earlier concluded: ``It is also important to address the brief window of opportunity for intervention that occurs in the year between the ``wannabe'' stage and the age at first arrest. It is vital that intervention programs that target gang members and successfully divert them from the gang are funded, developed, evaluated, improved, and sustained.'' This program, and the change we propose today, will help to do that.  This amendment also would add the following anti-gang provisions to the bill:  1. Increases sentences for gang members who commit federal crimes to further the gang's activities, by directing the Sentencing Commission to make an appropriate increase under the Sentencing Guidelines.  2. Makes is easier to prove criminal gang activity, by:  Reducing the number of members prosecutors have to prove are in a gang from five to three;  Changing the definition of a criminal gang from a group ``that has as one of its primary purposes the commission of'' certain criminal offenses to a group ``that has as one of its primary activities the commission of'' certain criminal offenses;  Adding the following federal offenses to the list of gang crimes: extortion, gambling, obstruction of justice (includes jury tampering and witness intimidation), money laundering, alien smuggling, an attempt or solicitation to commit any of these offenses, or federal violent felonies or drug crimes, which are already included in the current law), and gang recruitment;  Adding asset forfeiture  3. Amends the Travel Act, which passed in 1961 to address Mafia-type crime, to deal with modern gangs, by adding gang crimes such as: assault with a deadly weapon, drive-by shootings, and witness intimidation to its provisions. It also increases penalties under the Act, and helps prosecutors by adding a conspiracy provision to the Act.  4. Adds serious juvenile drug offenses to the Armed Career Criminal Act, which provides for a 15 year mandatory minimum sentence if a felon with three prior convictions for violent felonies or serious drug offenses is caught with a firearm.  5. Further targets gangsters who exploit children by adding a three-year mandatory minimum sentence to the existing law against knowingly transferring a firearm for use in a violent crime or drug trafficking crime, where the gun is transferred to a minor.  6. Provision addressing clone pagers, which Sen. DeWine has worked on, which would make it easier to investigate gang members by allowing law enforcement to obtain pagers which are clones of those possessed by gang members, under the lower standard which applies to pen registers, rather than the more difficult wiretap standard, which currently applies.  I want to note that we did not include the provision of last year's bill which was criticized for federalizing much gang crime.  Altogether, this anti-gang package gives federal law enforcement a set of powerful new tools with which to team up with state and local law enforcement and crack down on criminal gangs.                               body armor  The next piece of this comprehensive amendment is the James Guelff Body Armor Act of 1999, which is designed to increase police and public safety by taking body armor out of the hands of criminals and putting it in the hands of police. As I mentioned previously, I introduced this earlier this year as S. 783, and it has been cosponsored by Senators Sessions, Boxer, Reid, Bryan, and Kerry.  Currently, Federal law does not limit access to body armor for individuals with even the grimmest history of criminal violence. However, it is unquestionable that criminals with violent intentions are more dangerous when they are wearing body armor.  Many will recall the violent and horrific shootout in North Hollywood, California, just 2 years ago. In that incident, two suspects wearing body armor and armed to the teeth, terrorized a community. Police officers on the scene had to borrow rifles from a nearby gunshop to counteract the firepower and protective equipment of these suspects.  Another tragic incident involved San Francisco Police Officer James Guelff. On November 13, 1994, Officer Guelff responded to a distress call. Upon reaching the crime scene, he was fired upon by a heavily armed suspect who was shielded by a kevlar vest and bulletproof helmet. Officer Guelff died in the ensuing gun-fight.  Lee Guelff, James Guelff's brother, recently wrote a letter to me about the need to revise the laws relating to body armor. He wrote:       It's bad enough when officers have to face gunmen in      possession of superior firepower . . . But to have to      confront suspects shielded by equal or better defensive      protection as well goes beyond the bounds of acceptable risk      for officers and citizens alike. No officer should have to      face the same set of deadly circumstances again.  I couldn't agree with Lee more. Our laws need to recognize that body armor in the possession of a criminal is an offensive weapon. Our police officers on the streets are adequately supplied with body armor, and that hardened-criminals are deterred from using body armor.  This body armor amendment has three key provisions. First, it increases the penalties criminals receive if they commit a crime wearing body armor. Specifically, a violation will lead to an increase of two levels under the Federal sentencing guidelines.  Second, it makes it unlawful for violent felons to purchase, use, or possess body armor. Third, this bill enables Federal law enforcement agencies to directly donate surplus body armor to local police.  I will address each of these three provisions.  First, criminals who wear body armor during the commission of a crime should face enhanced penalties because they pose an enhanced threat to police and civilians alike. Assailants shielded by body armor can shoot at the police and civilians with less fear than individuals not so well protected.  In the North Hollywood shoot-out, for example, the gunmen were able to hold dozens of officers at bay because of their body armor. This provision will deter the criminal use of body armor, and thus deter the escalation of violence in our communities.  Second, this amendment would make it a crime for individuals with a violent criminal record to wear body armor. It is unconscionable that criminals can obtain and wear body armor without restriction when so many of our police lack comparable protection.  The bill recognizes that there may be exceptional circumstances where an individual with a brutal history legitimately needs body armor to protect himself or herself. Therefore, it provides an affirmative defense for individuals who require body armor for lawful job-related activities.  Another crucial part of this body armor amendment is that it speeds up the procedures by which Federal agencies can donate surplus body armor to local police.  Far too many of our local police officers do not have access to bullet-proof vests. The United States Department of Justice estimates that 25 percent of State, local, and tribal law enforcement officers, approximately 150,000 officers, are not issued body armor.  Getting our officers more body armor will save lives. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, greaterthan 30 percent of the 1,182 officers willed by guns in the line of duty since 1980 could have been saved by body armor, and the risk of dying from gunfire is 14 times higher for an officer without a bulletproof vest.  Last year, Congress made some inroads into this shortage of body armor by enacting the ``Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 1998.'' This act established a $25 million annual fund to help local and State police purchase body armor. This amendment will further boost the body armor resources of local and State police departments.  These body armor amendments have the support of over 500,000 law enforcement personnel nationwide. The Fraternal Order of Police, the National Association of Police Organizations, the National Sheriffs' Association, the National Troopers Coalition, the International Association of Police Chiefs, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association (FLEOA), the Police Executive Research Forum, the International Brother of Police Officers, the Major City Chiefs, and the National Association of Black Law Enforcement Executives, have all endorsed the legislation.  An additional piece of this body armor package is S. 726, the Officer Dale Claxton Bullet Resistant Police Protective Equipment Act of 1999 introduced by Senator Campbell and cosponsored by Senator Torricelli.  Senator Campbell's proposals are dedicated to the memory of Dale Claxton, a Colorado police officer who was fatally shot through the windshield of his police car. These proposals include:  Authorizing continued funding for the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act program at $25 million per year;  Second, creating a $40 million matching grant program to help State and local jurisdictions and Indian tribes purchase bullet resistant glass, armored panels for patrol cars, hand-held bullet resistant shield and other life saving bullet resistant equipment;  Third, authorizing a $25 million matching grant program for the purchase of video cameras for use in law enforcement vehicles; and  Finally, the amendment directs the National Institute of Justice to promote bullet-resistant technologies.  I am pleased that we were able to include these measures in our amendment as well. They strengthen the amendment's purpose to protect police and the public.                               bombmaking  Let me turn now to the bombmaking piece of this package.  According to authorities, the killers in Littleton learned how to make their 30-plus bombs form bombmaking instructions posted on the Internet.  Hundreds and hundreds of Web sites contain instructions on how to build bombs, such as this Terrorists' Handbook, which my staff downloaded from the Internet a week after the tragedy. This bombmaking manual contains detailed, step-by-step instructions for building devices such as pipe bombs, lightbulb bombs, and letter bombs, which have no legitimate, lawful purpose. It also tells the reader how to break into college labs to obtain useful chemicals, how to pick locks, and even contains a checklist for raids on laboratories.        internet bombmaking incidents continuing after littleton  Unfortunately, in the short time since the tragedy in Littleton, Colorado, there has been a steady stream of incidents of youths using the Internet to build bombs and threaten their use at school:  Police arrested five students at McKinley Junior High School in Brooklyn for possessing a bomb-making manual, a day after the eighth-graders were caught allegedly plotting to set off a bomb at graduation. The arrested students, all 13, were charged with second-degree conspiracy after allegedly bringing bomb-making information found on the Internet to class, police and school officials said.  Salt Lake City School District has received about 10 reports of threats to kill or blow up schools, said Nancy Woodward, district director of student and family services. Many of the students making such threats have a history of violent threats and have written about such violence in notebooks or downloaded Internet information. [4/28/99 Deseret News]  Three Cobb County, Georgia boys arrested for possession of a pipe bomb on school property learned how to make the explosive by browsing the Internet, according to testimony at a court hearing.  One week after the high school killings in Colorado, authorities across Texas are reporting a spate of incidents that involve violent threats by students and crude efforts to manufacture bombs.  In Port Aransas, Texas, a 15-year-old boy who allegedly downloaded from the Internet information on bomb making and killing faced criminal charges after the was turned in to police by his father. The boy had threatened teachers and classmates.  At least seven teen-agers are being held in Wimberley and Wichita Falls alone, all of them on suspicion of making explosives, some of which officials say were to be used to attack a school.  A judge ordered four Wimberley, Texas junior high school students to remain in a juvenile detention center, accused of planning an attack on their own school. Sheriff's deputies questioned the four eighth-graders over the weekend and searched their homes, turning up gunpowder, crudely built explosives and instructions on making bombs on computer disks and downloanded from the Internet.  More than 50 threats of bombings and other acts of violence against schools have been reported across Pennsylvania over the last four days, which state officials attributed partly to last week's bombing in Littleton, Colo.  Elsewhere on the Web, the Columbine tragedy has triggered a kind of electronic turf warfare, as individuals snap up site addresses containing words reflecting the tragedy, such as the killers' names or the name of their clique, the Trench Coat Mafia. At least one such site, filled with images of guns and bomb-making instructions, was offered for sale to the highest bidder on eBay, an online auction. ``When we became aware of it, we took it down immediately,'' an eBay spokesman said. ``It is totally inappropriate.''  And just 28 miles away from where we stand today, three students at Glen Burnie High School, in Maryland, were arrested for issuing bomb threats and possessing bomb-making components. One of those arrested had told another student, ``You're on my hit list.'' A police search of the boys' homes found match heads, suitcases, wires, chemicals, and printouts from the Internet showing how to put it all together to make bombs. Graffiti at the school read, ``if you think Littleton was bad, wait until you see what happens here.''                     Description of the Legislation  I have been trying to do as much as I can under the First Amendment to get rid of this sort of filth for four years now. This amendment:  Makes it a federal crime to teach or distribute information on how to make a bomb or other weapon of mass destruction if the teacher: Intends that the information be used to commit a federal violent crime or knows that the recipient of the information intends to use it to commit a federal violent crime; and sets a maximum sentence of 20 years.  This legislation has been endorsed by both the explosives industry (Institute for Makers of Explosives) and the Anti-Defamation League.                        Hitory of the Amendment  The substance of this amendment has passed the Senate or the Judiciary Committee in each of the past four years, without a single vote in opposition: in 1995, as an amendment to the anti-terrorism bill, by unanimous consent; in 1996, as an amendment to the Department of Defense authorization bill, again by unanimous consent; in 1997, again as an amendment to the Department of Defense authorization bill, this time by a vote of 94-0; and last year, in the Judiciary Committee, as an amendment to a private relief bill for Kerr-McGee Corporation, by unanimous consent.  Unfortunately, despite the unanimous support of the Senate, the House has killed the amendment in conference each time it has passed the Senate: On the terrorism bill, it was replaced by a directive to the Attorney General to study and report to Congress on six different issues related to the amendment; on the FY 97 Defense bill, it was eliminated because the Attorney General's study was then ongoing, and she had not yet issued her report; on the FY 98 Defense bill, it waseliminated because it falls within the jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committees, and the House objected to its not taking this usual course.                       Justice Department Support  I mentioned the Justice Department report earlier; that report found that the amendment was justified on each of the six factors the Department was asked to consider, and recommended that Congress finally pass this legislation:  Factor: ``(1) the extent to which there is available to the public material in any medium (including print, electronic or film) that provides instruction on how to make bombs, destructive devices, or weapons of mass destruction.''  DOJ Report: ``It is readily apparent from our cursory examination that anyone interested in manufacturing a bomb, dangerous weapon or weapon of mass destruction can easily obtain detailed instructions for fabricating and using such a device.''  Factor: ``(2) the extent to which information gained from such materials has been used in incidents of domestic or international terrorism.''  DOJ Report: ``Recent law enforcement experience demonstrates that persons who attempt or plan acts of terrorism often possess literature that describes the construction of explosive devices and other weapons of mass destruction (including biological weapons).''  ``[R]eported federal cases involving murder, bombing, arson, and related crimes, reflect the use of bombmaking manuals by defendants and the frequent seizure of such texts during the criminal investigation of such activities.''  ``Finally, information furnished by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms reveals that such literature is frequently used by individuals bent upon making bombs for criminal purposes.''  The report connected ``mayhem manuals'' to numerous terrorist and criminal actions, including: The World Trade Center bombing; the Omega 7 group, who conducted terrorist bombings in the New York area; an individual attempting to bring enough ricin--one of the most toxic substances known--into the U.S. to kill over 32,000 people; and the ``Patriots Council'' began developing ricin to attack federal or local law enforcement officials.  Factor: ``(3) the likelihood that such information may be used in future incidents of terrorism.''  DOJ Report: ``both the FBI and ATF expect that because the availability of such information is becoming increasingly widespread, such bombmaking instructions will continue to play a significant role in aiding those intent upon committing future acts of terrorism and violence.''  Factor: ``(4) the application of Federal laws in effect on the date of enactment of this Act to such material.''  DOJ Report: while there are several existing federal laws which could be applied to bombmaking instructions in some circumstances, ``current federal law does not specifically address certain classes of cases.''  Factor: ``(5) the need and utility, if any, for additional laws relating to such material.''  DOJ Report: ``the Department of Justice agrees with [Senators Feinstein and Biden] that it would be appropriate and beneficial to adopt further legislation to address this problem directly, in a manner that does not impermissibly restrict the wholly legitimate publication and teaching of such information, or otherwise violate the First Amendment.''  Factor: ``(6) an assessment of the extent to which the first amendment protects such material and its private and commercial distribution.''  DOJ Report: ``where such a purpose [to aid or cause a criminal result] is proved beyond a reasonable doubt, as it would have to be in a criminal case, the First Amendment should be no bar to culpability.''  ``we think these First Amendment concerns can be overcome, and that such a facilitation prohibition could be constitutional, if drafted narrowly.''  I ask that the Justice Department's report be incorporated by reference as part of the Record.  The Justice Department proposed a slight re-draft of the original version of the Feinstein amendment. It is this re-draft which we have included in this amendment with one further modification, removing state crimes from its scope, made at the request of Representative McCollum.                               Conclusion  This is a powerful set of amendments, which I am convinced can do a great deal to reduce criminal violence in America. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
