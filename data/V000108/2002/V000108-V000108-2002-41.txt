Speaker, I rise today to congratulate a distinguished young lady for attaining the Girl Scout Gold Award. Nicole Love, the daughter of Diane Love, is a member of Senior Girl Scout Troop #349 located in Griffith, Indiana. She will receive this honor at a Girl Scout Gold Award Ceremony on May 16, 2002 at The Center on the campus of Purdue University Calumet, in Hammond, Indiana. This is the highest award in Girl Scouting and it is earned when the girls are committed to working towards the goals they set for themselves. I am honored to have the opportunity to congratulate Nicole for her success, for I know that she has grown during this pursuit. Additionally, Nicole attained the Gold Award in conjunction with her academic achievement at Griffith High School. She will graduate this June and plans to attend college.  Troop #349 is part of the Girl Scouts of the Calumet Council, which serves girls in Whiting, East Chicago, Hammond, Highland, Munster, Griffith, Schererville, St. John, and Dyer in the State of Indiana and Lansing, Lynwood, Calumet City, and Burnham in the State of Illinois. The Council was charted in 1954 and operates two program centers that serve over 5,700 adults and girls.  A special significance is attached to the title of Girl Scout Gold Award, a significance that accompanies a young woman throughout her life. As she pursues endeavors in higher education, business, industry and community service, she carries with her the lofty goal of success through leadership. To qualify for the Gold Award, each Girl Scout has had to fulfill rigorous requirements in the areas of leadership, career interest and service. Upon completing the above requirements, a prospective Gold Award candidate must find and complete a project that fulfills a need in the community. Nicole's Gold Award Project involved coordinating a sports weekend for Junior Girl Scouts called ``Sports n' More'' in October 2001. Over 3,500 Senior Girl Scouts design, implement, and complete Gold Award projects each year. Nicole can be very proud of the success that she has achieved through hard work and dedication to serving her community.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in congratulating Nicole Love for her commendable achievement. Her mother can be proud of her daughter because it takes a great deal of tenacity and devotion to achieve such an illustrious award. This young lady has a promising future ahead of her, which will undoubtedly include improving the quality of life in Indiana's First Congressional District.                          ____________________
