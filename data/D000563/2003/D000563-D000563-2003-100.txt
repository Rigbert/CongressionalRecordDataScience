In fact, the Constitution is explicit that we have the power of advice and consent. The facts show us that 98 percent of the nominees sent by the President have been approved; 168 have been approved, and only 4 have been held back.  The Republicans cannot argue they treated President Clinton any better. In fact, the record reflects there were 60 nominees sent to the Senate by President Clinton who were never even given a hearing before the Republican-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee.  It leads me to a question of the Senator from Nevada, through the Chair, Why then are we going to take 30 hours to debate the obvious? If we have the constitutional right to say no to a nominee, if we have said yes to 98 percent of the President's nominees, if the Republicans, when they were in control, turned down an even greater percentage of President Clinton's nominees, why then wouldn't we get about the business of the people of this country, pass the important appropriations bills, try to do something to help the economy, instead of wasting 30 hours debating the obvious?
