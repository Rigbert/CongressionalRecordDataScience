 President, 15 years ago this Sunday, Al Qaeda terrorists launched brutal and vicious attacks against our country. Yet this weekend America will remember not only the horror of those attacks but also the heroism of our response.  We saw firefighters, police officers, and first responders rush in to confront danger. We saw the men and women of our Armed Forces stand ready and sacrifice greatly in defense of our country. We saw Americans across the land work together in a spirit of unity. So 15 years later, it is clear that the terrorists did not succeed. We remain united against terror.  So this Sunday is a day to remember and honor the victims of September 11 and pray for their families. It is also a day to express gratitude to the many Americans who have fought to keep us safe ever since--the men and women who fight for the very thing that makes this the greatest Nation on Earth--freedom.                          ____________________
