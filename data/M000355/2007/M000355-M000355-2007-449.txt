 President, I thank my friend from Wyoming.  I wish to take a moment to congratulate Senator Enzi on this wonderful, bipartisan effort he has been engaged in with our friend from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy. They have worked tirelessly for the past 3 weeks, through markup and floor consideration.  I also wish to commend Senator Gregg, who worked very hard with Senator Enzi to reach a bipartisan compromise on this important measure.  I particularly wish to note Senator Roberts was instrumental in working out the problems with direct-to-consumer advertising provisions. I know he would have liked to have been here today to support this bill, but he is out in Kansas with the President touring hurricane damage in his State.  Also, I wish to commend Senator Cochran. We appreciate his efforts to ensure that any proposal to bring drugs in from other countries must be certified by the Secretary of Health and Human Services as safe for the American people.  So again, I thank the Senator from Wyoming for his extraordinary accomplishment in moving this important, bipartisan legislation forward.  With that, I yield the floor.
