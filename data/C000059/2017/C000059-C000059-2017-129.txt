Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to William H. Hecht, a dear friend of mine who passed away on Monday, June 12, 2017. Bill lived a rich life filled with a myriad of accomplishments. He would count his family as the greatest of those accomplishments. A true family man, he was the beloved husband of Susan; a devoted father to Herb, Robert David, Tim and Jim; a proud father-in-law to Dana, Jill and Melissa; and a doting grandfather to Caroline, Rachel, Will, Robbie, Christian, Danny, Hannah, Sammy, Holly and Johnny. Along with all of them, I will deeply miss Bill.  Born in 1933 in Tifton, Georgia, Bill received his Master's of Divinity from Concordia Seminary in St. Louis, Missouri and a degree in Philosophy from Washington University. He served as a Lutheran pastor and later became the campus pastor at the University of Oklahoma, also teaching in the Philosophy Department. Among the many tributes Bill received are the Miles Christi Award from Concordia Seminary, an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Concordia University, and the Silver Beaver Award from the National Capital Area Council of the Boy Scouts of America. In 2012, Bill received a commendation as an ``Outstanding Georgian,'' one of only three people to receive that honor.  Bill was a lifelong participant in politics. In 1967, he became the Executive Director of the Missouri State Republican Party and later served as vice president of the American Security Council. Moving to Washington, DC, he was hired as the Executive Assistant to the Chairman of the House Committee on Internal Security and then moved on to be vice president of legislative affairs at the Tobacco Institute. He worked on the Reagan for Presidentcampaign before opening Hecht, Spencer & Associates, a firm that celebrated its 35th Anniversary last year.  I was a beneficiary of Bill's education and experience over many hours spent at his favorite table at the Capitol Hill Club. He could philosophize on any number of subjects and would hold all of us there at the table in rapt attention with stories from his past or explanations of why his St. Louis Cardinals were the greatest franchise in baseball history. The Club will never be the same without him and he will always be in my thoughts when I am there.  I extend my heartfelt condolences to the Hecht family and Bill's many friends. Although Bill may be gone, his legacy and memory will live on.                          ____________________
