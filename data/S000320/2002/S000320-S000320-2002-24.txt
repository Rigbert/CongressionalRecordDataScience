 President, I wish to recognize and pay tribute to Colonel Timothy A. Peterson, Chief, Senate Liaison Division, Office of the Chief of Legislative Affairs, and Department of the Army who will retire on June 1, 2002. Colonel Peterson's career spans over 28 years, during which he has distinguished himself as a soldier, scholar, leader and friend of the United States Senate.  A New York native, Colonel Peterson graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1974 and was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Field Artillery Branch of the U.S. Army. During his career he has commanded soldiers from the battery through the installation level. At Schofield Barracks in Hawaii, he commanded the 7th Battalion, 8th Field Artillery Regiment of the 25th Infantry Division and later served as the Installation Commander of the U.S. Army Garrison at Fort Dix, NJ. As a scholar Tim Peterson has sought opportunities to improve himself throughout his career. In addition to teaching mathematics to cadets at the United States Military Academy, he has served as an American Political Science Association Congressional Fellow and a Army Senior Fellow, Secretary of Defense Corporate Fellowship, as well as receiving advanced degrees from the University of Puget Sound, University of Washington, the Salve Regina College and the U.S. Naval War College.  Since September 1999, Tim Peterson has served with distinction as the Chief Army Senate Liaison. He has superbly represented the Chief of Legislative Liaison, the Army Chief of Staff, and the Secretary of the Army while promoting the interests of the soldiers and civilians of our Army. His professionalism, mature judgement, sage advice and interpersonal skills have earned him the respect and confidence of the Members of Congress and Congressional staffers with whom he has worked on a multitude of issues affecting our Army, its soldiers and civilians. In almost 3 years on the Hill, Tim Peterson has been a true friend of the United States Senate and the Congress. Serving as the Army's primary point of contact for all Senators, Congressional Committees and their staffs, he has assisted Congress in understanding Army policies, operations, requirements and priorities. As a result, he and his staff have been extremely effective in providing prompt, coordinated and factual replies to all inquiries and matters involving Army issues. In addition, he has personally provided invaluable assistance to Members and their staffs while planning, coordinating and accompanying Senate delegations traveling worldwide. His substantive knowledge of the key issues, keen legislative insight and ability to effectively advise senior Army leaders have directly contributed to the successful representation of the Army's interests before Congress.  Throughout his career, Colonel Tim Peterson has demonstrated his profound commitment to our Nation, a deep concern for soldiers and their families and a commitment to excellence. Colonel Peterson is a consummate professional whose performance in over 28 years of service has personified those traits of courage, competency and integrity that our Nation has come to expect from its professional Army officers.  I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Colonel Peterson for his honorable service to our Army, its soldiers and the citizens of the United States. We wish him and his family well and all the best in the future.                          ____________________
