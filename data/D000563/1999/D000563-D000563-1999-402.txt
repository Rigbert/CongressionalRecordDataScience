 Let me wrap up by saying that our goal is the most accurate census possible. The census has a real impact on the lives of real people. We have to do everything for a fair, accurate, and complete count.  It is my understanding that my colleagues, Senators Gregg and Hollings, the chairman and ranking member of the Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State, and the Judiciary, will hold a hearing in the very near future on this issue of underfunding. I look forward to the resolution of this important issue.  I have spoken with the White House as well. They assure me that this issue will be resolved, and we won't repeat the disastrous census undercount of 1990 in the year 2000.  I thank the Chair, and I yield back the remainder of my time.
