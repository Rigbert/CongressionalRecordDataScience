President, thank you for the recognition.  I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania. Let me say at the outset that my colleague from Pennsylvania comes to this floor to discuss this issue with heartfelt emotion. I am convinced of his commitment to this cause. I have served with him in both the House and the Senate. I would never question his motives. And I know a little bit about his family situation. I am sure that they are sincere.  I also say to you that this may be the most difficult issue for any politician to deal with in America today. I have been in and around public life for 32 years. It has not gotten any easier in 32 years, at least not since the Roe v. Wade decision, because the American people are basically conflicted internally about this issue of abortion.  There are some who would argue no abortions under virtually any circumstances and others who would argue that the State--Government--should not restrict abortions under any circumstances. But the vast majority of Americans, I think personally, fall into some middle ground where they understand that a woman's right to make this decision, in concert with her doctor, her family and her conscience, is something that should be protected under law--it is currently protected under law--but they want to see us do everything we can as a Government and as a people to reduce the likelihood of abortion in this country. The number of abortions have diminished some over the past few years, but it is still a very widespread practice and medical procedure in America.  My own personal views on it--I personally oppose abortion but I believe that we should take care where we draw the line about the Government's involvement in that decision. You would think after serving on Capitol Hill for 16 years, and facing literally hundreds of votes on the issue, that this would become rote, that it would be an easy, automatic, reflexive vote. It has never been that for me. It never will be. I pause and think and worry over every vote on this subject because I know what is at stake is very serious.  Today, the Senator from Pennsylvania comes to the floor and asks us to vote to override President Clinton's veto of his bill banning what is known as the partial-birth abortion procedure. I will be voting to sustain the President's veto. I will be voting in opposition to the Senator from Pennsylvania, but I want to make it clear why I am doing so.  It is my belief that this bill, as far as it goes, addresses one challenge before us. This bill addresses one abortion procedure. But there are many different kinds of procedures. As terrifying and troubling as this procedure is, there are others. And the Senator from Pennsylvania would ban this one procedure, if I am not mistaken, at any stage in the pregnancy. Many of us believe that this issue should be addressed in a different manner.  When it comes to the issue of late-term abortions, allow me to try to explain what I mean when I use that term. In the Roe v. Wade decision--I believe in 1972, if I am not mistaken--the Court, the Supreme Court across the street, divided a pregnancy into three sections, three different trimesters, three different periods of 3 months and basically said in the first two trimesters, the first 6 months of the pregnancy, that they would give the paramount right to the woman to make the decision whether she continued the pregnancy. They made it clear that in the third trimester, the end of the pregnancy, that the State would be able to impose restrictions.  They drew a distinction between that time when the fetus could survive outside the mother's womb and that time when it could not. And if it could not--the previability phase--then they felt that this was more a decision for the woman to make. After viability, that is, the ability of the fetus to survive outside the womb, then the State--the Government--could step in and say, ``We will limit the circumstances under which a woman can seek an abortion.''  Unfortunately, the bill before us today does not make that distinction. It does not draw that line. I fear it is fatally flawed from a constitutional viewpoint, from the viewpoint of the case of Roe v. Wade which guides us in this debate. As a result, I am not certain that this bill, even if it were enacted over the President's veto, would survive a Court test. I believe the Court has said repeatedly, ``We are serious about drawing that line.'' This particular bill does not draw that line.  Having said that, though, let me tell you that I am not going to engage this debate just on pure legalisms and interpretations of Roe v. Wade. Let me go to the real question before us. Let me try to address some of the points which the Senator from Pennsylvania has made.  I am not a medical doctor. Some Members of Congress are; I am not. When I hear medical doctors say that this procedure, this partial-birth abortion procedure, is never medically necessary, I take that very seriously.  Recently, in the Chicago Tribune, in my home State of Illinois, a professor from, I believe, Notre Dame University, Douglas Kmiec--I hope I am pronouncing it correctly--wrote an article on July 27 in which he quoted a man whom I respect very much, C. Everett Koop, a medical doctor who served as our Surgeon General and who I have worked with closely on the tobacco issue. He quoted Dr. Koop as saying that this medical procedure, this ``Partial-birth abortion is never medically necessary to protect a mother's health or future fertility.''  As I said, such a statement from a medical doctor, and someone of Dr. Koop's reputation, I take very seriously. As a result, I came back to my office and wrote a letter the following day, on July 28, 1998, to a group which I respect, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists here in Washington, DC. I did not try to color this letter or to influence their reply in any way. I wrote to them and said, ``Tell me, is Dr. Koop right? Is this abortion procedure never medically necessary?''  A few days later I received a reply from Dr. Ralph Hale, executive vice president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. I askunanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                               American College of                              Obstetricians and Gynecologists,                                  Washington, DC, August 13, 1998.     Hon. Richard J. Durbin,     364 Senate Russell Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Durbin: I am writing in response to your July      28th letter in which you asked for the College's response to      Dr. Koop's statement that ``Partial-birth abortion is never      medically necessary to protect a mother's health or future      fertility.''       The College's position on this is contained in the      statement of policy entitled Statement on Intact Dilation and      Extraction. In that statement we say, ``Terminating a      pregnancy is performed in some circumstances to save the life      or preserve the health of the mother.'' It continues, ``A      select panel convened by ACOG could identify no circumstances      under which this procedure, as defined above, would be the      only option to save the life or preserve the health of the      woman.'' Our statement goes on to say, ``An intact D & X,      however, may be the best or most appropriate procedure in a      particular circumstance to save the life or preserve the      health of a woman, and only the doctor, in consultation with      the patient based upon the woman's particular circumstances      can make this decision.'' For this reason, we have      consistently opposed ``partial-birth abortion'' legislation.       Please find enclosed ACOG's statement on intact D & X.      Thank you for seeking the views of the College. As always, we      are pleased to work with you.           Sincerely,                                                Ralph W. Hale, MD,                                         Executive Vice President.       Enclosure.                                  ____       ACOG Statement of Policy on Intact Dilation and Extraction       The debate regarding legislation to prohibit as method of      abortion, such as the legislation banning ``partial birth      abortion,'' and ``brain sucking abortions,'' has promoted      questions regarding these procedures. It is difficult to      respond to these questions because the descriptions are vague      and do not delineate a specific procedure recognized in the      medical literature. Moreover, the definitions could be      interpreted to include elements of many recognized abortion      and operative obstetric techniques.       The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists      (ACOG) believes that the intent of such legislative proposals      is to prohibit a procedure referred to as ``Intact Dilatation      and Extraction'' (Intact D & X). This procedure has been      described as containing all of the following four elements:       1. deliberate dilation of the cervix, usually over a      sequence of days;       2. instrumental conversion of the fetus to a footling      breech;       3. breech extraction of the body excepting the head; and       4. partial evacuation of the intracranial contents of a      living fetus to effect vaginal delivery of a dead but      otherwise intact fetus.       Because these elements are part of established obstetric      techniques, it must be emphasized that unless all four      elements are present in sequence, the procedure is not an      intact D & X.       Abortion intends to terminate a pregnancy while preserving      the life and health of the mother. When abortion is performed      after 16 weeks, intact D & X is one method of terminating a      pregnancy. The physician, in consultation with the patient,      must choose the most appropriate method based upon the      patient's individual circumstances.       According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention      (CDC), only 5.3% of abortions performed in the United States      in 1993, the most recent data available, were performed after      the 16th week of pregnancy. A preliminary figure published by      the CDC for 1994 is 5.6%. The CDC does not collect data on      the specified method of abortion, so it is unknown how many      of these were performed using intact D & X. Other data show      that second trimester transvaginal instrumental abortion is a      safe procedure.       Terminating a pregnancy is performed in some circumstances      to save the life or preserve the health of the mother. Intact      D & X is one of the methods available in some of these      situations. A select panel convened by ACOG could identify no      circumstances under which this procedure, as defined above,      would be the only option to save the life or preserve the      health of the woman. An intact D & X, however, may be the      best or most appropriate procedure in a particular      circumstance to save the life or preserve the health of a      woman, and only the doctor, in consultation with the patient,      based upon the woman's particular circumstances can make this      decision. The potential exists that legislation prohibiting      specific medical practices, such as intact D & X, may outlaw      techniques that are critical to the lives and health of      American women. The intervention of legislative bodies into      medical decision making is inappropriate, ill advised, and      dangerous.       Approved by the Executive Board, January 12, 1997.
