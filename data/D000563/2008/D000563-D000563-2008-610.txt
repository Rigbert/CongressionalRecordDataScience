2284, a bill to restore the financial solvency of the National Flood Insurance Fund.  As a reminder, all amendments to the flood insurance bill must be offered today. Senators should expect rollcall votes to occur throughout the day as we work to complete action on the bill. I ask everyone to focus on the amendments and showing up in a timely fashion. We want to complete this as quickly as we can.                          ____________________
