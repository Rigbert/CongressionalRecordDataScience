President, in visiting with fellow Vermonters in and around Brattleboro in southern Vermont last weekend, I appreciated the opportunity to be in town during the month The Brattleboro Reformer marked its centennial anniversary. Local newspapers serve their communities in so many vital ways, and we in Vermont are blessed to have so many that have endured and served for so long.  These are challenging times for newspapers, as newsrooms and publishers adapt to rapidly changing technologies and public preferences. The Brattleboro Reformer has been quick on its feet to meet these challenges. I join with all Vermonters in congratulating The Reformer's hard-working staff on this historic anniversary, and we wish them many more.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a recent news article about this milestone.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                   The Brattleboro Reformer Turns 100               [From the Vermont Digger, March 10, 2013]                        (By Randolph T. Holhut)       BRATTLEBORO--The Brattleboro Reformer celebrated its 100th      anniversary as a daily newspaper with cake, coffee, and an      open house for well-wishers on March 1.       For Publisher Ed Woods, the fact that a small town in      Vermont has held on to its daily newspaper while other major      cities have seen their daily papers cut back in publishing      frequency, or close down altogether, is a testament to the      uniqueness of Windham County.       ``Southern Vermont is different from the rest of the      country,'' said Woods, who has been the Reformer's publisher      since 2008. ``We're providing news and information in the way      that our customers request it.''       That means delivering a paper-and-ink edition of the      Reformer every day but Sunday, while gradually building up an      audience that wants its news online.       According to the most recent circulation figures for the      Reformer by the Audit Bureau of Circulations, the paper's      total average daily circulation was 6,756 print editions and      1,093 digital editions, or a total of 7,849 as of March 31,      2012.       For the Saturday Weekend Reformer, circulation was 8,155      print and 1,091 digital for a total of 9,246.       By comparison, in the March 31, 2007, report, total average      circulation was 9,684 on weekdays and 10,709 on Saturdays.       Although print circulation is down, Executive Editor Tom      D'Errico is quick to point out that the digital reach of the      paper is growing.       The paper currently has 6,000 followers of its Facebook      page, which D'Errico said it is using as a breaking news site      that complements www.Reformer.com, and there are 1,200      subscribers to the paper's Twitter feed.       ``These things didn't exist for us two and a half years      ago,'' said Woods. ``Social media is bringing our news to a      new audience. The transition to digital is going to happen,      but it's going to happen more slowly here.'' He cited the      slow progress of bringing universal broadband coverage to      southern Vermont, and the older population of the county that      still prefers a paper-and-ink news source.       D'Errico, who became the managing editor of the Reformer in      2007, said that social media--Facebook, Twitter, and the      like--has become critical to the way his paper gathers and      disseminates the news. ``That's how people tip us off to      stories now,'' he said. ``It's easy and instantaneous,      compared to email or a phone call.''       And, with a newsroom that is smaller than it used to be, it      allows the four full-time reporters to cover more ground than      before.                              Long history       Although the Reformer published its first daily edition on      March 3, 1913, the paper had long history prior to that date.       Charles Davenport, a stalwart Democrat, started The Windham      County Reformer in 1876 as a weekly paper to counter what      Davenport believed was the pro-Republican bias of The Vermont      Phoenix--then the dominant weekly newspaper in Brattleboro.       Howard C. Rice bought an interest in the paper from      Davenport in 1905, and two years later, moved it into the      American Building on Main Street--the Reformer's home for the      next seven decades until it moved to its present location on      Black Mountain Road in October 1981.       Few had faith that Brattleboro could support its own daily      paper, but Rice eventually convinced Windham County that it      could consume its news in daily bites, and like it. That      began in 1913, when the Phoenix and Reformer merged. The      Phoenix continued as the weekly edition of the Reformer until      it was discontinued in 1955. By that point, the daily      Reformer's circulation had grown from less than 2,500 to more      than 7,000.       Rice stepped down as editor and publisher in 1950 and was      succeeded by John S. Hooper. The Rice family continued to own      the paper until 1966, when it was purchased by the Miller      family, owners of The Berkshire Eagle in Pittsfield, Mass.       Under the Millers, the changes came fast and frequent.      Offset printing was introduced in 1969, and molten lead and      Linotypes gave way to computerized typesetting and paste-up.      Typewriters gave way to video display terminals in the late      1970s. The biggest change of all, besides the move to the new      plant off Putney Road, was the switch from afternoon to      morning publication in 1982.       All of these changes were overseen by Norman Runnion, who      started at the Reformer as Hooper's assistant in 1969 and      became the managing editor in 1971.       By the time the Reformer celebrated its 75th anniversary as      a daily in 1988, circulation had grown to more than 10,000.      Runnion retired two years later, leaving a legacy of building      what former Boston Globe editor Tom Winship once called the      best small newspaper in New England.       But the next big change came in 1995, when the Miller      family sold the paper to Denver-based MediaNews Group (MNG),      ending more than eight decades of local ownership.                          Change is constant.       In the years since the sale of the paper to MediaNews      Group, the paper has made the change from analog to digital,      in the design of its news pages as well as its photography.       Delivery of the news changed also. The World Wide Web went      from a curiosity to a disruptive force in publishing in the      space of a decade, and papers large and small have scrambled      to keep up.       Meanwhile, MNG acquired the Town Crier family of free      weeklies in the late 1990s, and expanded the Black Mountain      Road plant to accommodate their new purchase. They also      bought the Original Vermont Observer, another weekly, in the      mid-2000s. The papers were ultimately merged into one weekly,      and were discontinued in 2012.       But for all the turmoil of a changing industry, and      changing economics, the Reformer endures. With MNG joining      the Journal Register Company to form Digital First Media in      2011, there has been a greater emphasis on transforming the      two newspaper companies into one online media company.       ``John Paton [the CEO of Digital First] has brought to us a      business model to make the transition to digital media,''      said Woods. ``We are beginning to see the resources arrive      here to make that transition. Our mission to provide the news      hasn't changed, just the way we deliver the news.''       And both Woods and D'Errico say they have come to realize      what a humbling experience it is to run a newspaper that      people still feel passionate about, and are quick to offer an      opinion about.       ``A lot is changing in this industry, and it is impossible      not to embrace the change,'' said Woods. ``But our core      responsibility is not changing at all.''       ``Small-town newspapers offer something that can't be found      anywhere else,'' said D'Errico. ``While big city newspapers      are struggling, our focus on local news makes us as valuable      today as we were in 1913.''                          ____________________
