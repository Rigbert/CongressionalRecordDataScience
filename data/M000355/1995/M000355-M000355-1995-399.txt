 President, I rise today to pay tribute to an outstanding Kentuckian who was recently honored with the Kentucky Enquirer's Woman of the Year award. Mrs. Alice Sparks of Crescent Springs, KY, has dedicated her time and energy for the betterment of northern Kentucky and its citizens.  Mrs. Sparks has made it common practice to work hard for the causes that she deems important. She has always strived to make a difference, especially when it comes to education. This interest in education has been acknowledged by her appointment to chair the Northern Kentucky University board of regents.  In addition, Mrs. Sparks has been politically active for the past 40 years. Often, her political interest has been combined with her interest in education. In particular, she helped usher in the Kentucky Education Reform Act, a major piece of legislation in my State.  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to Alice Sparks, the Kentucky Enquirer's Woman of the Year. I know that Mrs. Sparks will continue to display the leadership and dedication that she has demonstrated so capably in the past.  Mr. President, I ask that the Enquirer's March 6, 1995, article on Alice Sparks be printed in the Record.  The article follows:               [From the Kentucky Enquirer, Mar. 6, 1995]                Sparks Flies Into Adventures With Aplomb                           (By Krista Ramsey)       Alice Sparks sits contentedly behind her desk in a      nondescript corner of the WCET-TV (Channel 48) studios, and      it's hard to imagine that a week earlier the 60-year-old was      swimming with the piranhas in the Amazon.       It's not much easier to picture her tearing across the      explosive Brazil-Colombia border in a Volkswagen caravan.       It was ``just for fun,'' she says of the escapade, the      third in a series of adventure vacations that have taken her      to Tanzania and the mountains of Costa Rica. Back at the WCET      studios, she says, is where the real pressure lies.       For 11 years, the Crescent Sprints resident and WCET      trustee has been scheduling chairman for the Action Auction,      the station's annual April fund-raiser. From her office, she      routes more than 4,400 items to be sold over a 10-day period.       ``I'm laid back in a lot of ways, but I'm also dead      serious,'' she says of the auction. ``Don't get in my way      when we go on the air.''       No one does.       Sparks is granite sheathed in satin. She has the savvy of a      political trench worker sweetened with the smile of a      homecoming queen.       When the cause is right--and the cause is always      education--Sparks can be found in the back halls of WCET      lining up auction chattel, or in the back rooms of the state      Capitol in Frankfort, lobbying for legislative support.       As state legislative chair for the Kentucky PTA from 1988      to 1993, Sparks served as midwife as the Commonwealth gave      birth to the Kentucky Education Reform Act (KERA) of 1990.       The legislation changed everything, from how schools are      funded to how students are arranged in classes. It sparked      controversies, which never deterred Sparks.       ``I like all of KERA,'' she says firmly. ``I can see the      results. There are now more opportunities for parental      involvement in      the schools than ever before.'' Status quo wasn't good      enough, she says. The Commonwealth was ready to take a      risk.       Sparks is comfortable with risk, piranha and otherwise.       ``I like to gamble,'' she admits conspiratorially, leaning      across her desk. ``My father liked to gamble. In the summer,      we'd play cards all night.'' The itch still sends Sparks off      on periodic trips to Las Vegas, and to play the ponies      locally.       Besides how to spot a good poker hand, Sparks' father      taught her to like another kind of risk. He was a printer at      the Louisville Courier-Journal, and became an international      representative for the printers union. A staunch Democrat, he      always was concerned with social issues, she remembers.       The political bug bit his daughter as well, but the      Republican strain. Her entry into Kentucky politics began      nearly 40 years ago, when she left college and went to work      as a social secretary for Mildred Chandler, wife of former      Gov. A.B. ``Happy'' Chandler.       ``The Chandlers made me a member of the family,'' she says.      ``I had an apartment right by the mansion. I learned a lot. I      met a lot of influential people.''       Later, she served on the Kenton County Republican Executive      Committee, and is a member of the local and statewide Women's      Political Caucus and the Kenton County Republican Women's      Club.       In 1992, she earned an appointment to the Northern Kentucky      University Board of Regents. Two years later, she became the      first woman to chair the board. When Sparks speaks of NKU,      she uses the collegial ``we.''       ``We're playing the third-place team,'' she says of men's      basketball. ``We need a new science building,'' she says of      the university as a whole.       Sparks' involvement with a cause, says W. Wayne Godwin,      general manager of WCET, is paid for with ``personal      currency.''       ``Alice gives her causes her dedication, energy and      thoroughness,'' Godwin says. ``She works at an institutional      level--as a trustee or board member--but she always stays      focused on the personal level.''       Sparks works so hard that the thought of spare time makes      her nervous, she says. She has cut back on socializing to      make room for more causes, but chooses carefully. Many, like      her membership on the board of the Greater Cincinnati Film      Commission, are a chance to make sure Northern Kentucky is      well represented.       In daily life, little fazes Sparks. She bounced through her      South American trip in turbulent skies without complaint. On      her return, she was gracious about finding a stuffed      wildebeest in her family room, a gift of her son-in-law.       She knows who she is, what she can do and what she's after.      She's used to moving things along, from goods at the Action      Auction to play on a golf course.       ``I do still golf, especially at benefits,'' she says.      ``But I always stand on the green and admit I cheat. I don't      have time to worry about a bad lie. I just kick it      out.''                               ____________________
