President, I also add my voice, support, and praise for our colleague, Senator Inouye of Hawaii, who now becomes the third longest serving Member of this great body. Dan Inouye has spent his life fighting for freedom, democracy, and equality in uniform, as a Member of Congress and the Senate.  Senator Daniel Inouye may be the only American who saw with his own eyes the smoke from Pearl Harbor and the black smoke that rose from the Pentagon on 9/11. On both of those terrible days, when the Nation he loved was under attack, Dan Inouye stood ready to protect and serve this great country. I am honored to call him a colleague.
