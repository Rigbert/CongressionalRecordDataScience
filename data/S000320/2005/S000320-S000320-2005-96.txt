 President, on behalf of the leader, and as manager of the bill, I announce to my colleagues that we are very close to completing action on the bill. Earlier, we had hoped to finish this evening but we were working on just a few remaining issues.  Tomorrow, we will resume consideration of the bill shortly after 9:30 a.m. At that time, we hope to clear several of the remaining amendments. That will then allow us to proceed to votes on those few amendments which require votes.  It is the expectation of the leader that we will begin voting around 10:45or 11 tomorrow morning. We should continue voting until we proceed to final passage.  Again, I thank my colleagues for their cooperation on the bill today, and I look forward to completion of the bill at an early hour tomorrow.                          ____________________
