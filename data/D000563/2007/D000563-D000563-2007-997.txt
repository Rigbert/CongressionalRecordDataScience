President, traumatic brain injury is the signature injury of the Iraq war. The widespread use of Improvised Explosive Devices, IEDs, has taken a terrible toll. Even those who have walked off the battlefield without visible scars often find they have suffered the internal trauma of a traumatic brain injury.  Today, I am introducing legislation, along with Senators Warner, Murray, Graham, Obama, Webb, and Cantwell, to create a Traumatic Brain Injury Program, operated jointly by the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs, to ensure that those servicemembers who suffer a brain injury receive all the services they need. The legislation establishes a standard of care for each individual found to have suffered a brain injury, improves the coordination of care, strengthen the rights of brain injury patients, and expands brain injury research in the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs.  This legislation will reduce the number of our wounded soldiers who fall through the cracks and are left to fend for themselves as they struggle to recover from a traumatic brain injury. I am pleased to have the support of Veterans for America for this legislative effort.  We have made tremendous progress in battlefield medical care. During Vietnam, one in three servicemembers who were injured died. In Iraq and Afghanistan, 1 in 16 who are injured die. But with the changes in warfare and in medical technology, more of our servicemembers are coming home with serious brain injuries from Iraq and Afghanistan than from any other recent conflicts we've known.  For some of these wounded warriors, the greatest battle comes at home when they seek care. Many of these returning troops need long-term treatment and rehabilitation long after their discharge from active duty, as they fight to overcome the severe disabilities that a traumatic brain injury can cause.  For others, there is a different story. Some servicemembers don't even realize they suffered a traumatic brain injury until long after their discharge, because we don't do a very good job of identifying and treating those who may have suffered a brain injury.  Fortunately, many of those who suffer a brain injury are able to recover fairly quickly. But for some, the experience is life-altering, even life-shattering. We must not fail them in their time of need.  Consider the case of Sgt. Eric Edmundson. Eric left my home state of Illinois to serve in Iraq. In October 2005, he suffered a severe head concussion when a roadside bomb exploded near him. He was cared for at Walter Reed Hospital, then was transferred to a VA facility where he and his family felt he was not receiving the kind of treatment that would allow him to continue to make progress in rehabilitation.  He would have been stuck there if the family had not found a creative way to obtain the care he needed. The family found a way to ensure that Eric could receive treatment and rehabilitation at one of the premiere rehabilitation hospitals in the nation: the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago. He is making great progress there and hopes to walk out of the hospital some day soon.  We need to use private hospitals more. In fact, we should use them whenever they are the best option for our returning soldiers who are wounded. In the case of traumatic brain injury, they often have the special expertise needed, because the leading facilities in this field deal with brain injuries day in and day out as a result of construction accidents and car crashes.  Now consider the case of Sgt. Garrett Anderson of Champaign, Illinois. Garrett went to Iraq with the Illinois National Guard. After 4 months there, an IED exploded next to his armored Humvee in Baghdad. The blast tore off his right arm below the elbow, shattered his jaw, severed part of his tongue, damaged his hearing, and punctured his body with shrapnel.  He spent 7 months at Walter Reed, where he received excellent care in Ward 57, the famous amputee ward. However, the outpatient care that followed has been filled with paperwork and red tape. It was months before the VA recognized that Garrett had suffered a traumatic brain injury. He has not received the kind of treatment for brain injury that could make a significant difference in the trajectory of his rehabilitation.  We need to change the way we handle patients with traumatic brain injury, so that they receive the care they need at the time they need it.  The legislation I am introducing takes a comprehensive approach to dealing with the traumatic brain injuries that plague our troops and veterans.  First, this legislation would establish a Traumatic Brain Injury Program, run by DOD and the VA, to provide treatment and rehabilitation to servicemembers and veterans who have suffered a service-connected traumatic brain injury.  Second, this bill would establish a standard of care for the participants in the TBI Program. Specifically, each individual in the program shall be provided ``the highest quality of care possible based on the medical judgment of qualified medical professionals in facilities that most appropriately meet the specific needs of the individual. ``And they shall be rehabilitated to the fullest extent possible using the most up-to-date medical technology, medical rehabilitation practices, and medical expertise available.''  That's the standard of care we should provide to these injured troops who gave so much of themselves for us. They should receive the best we have to give.  Third, the measure would direct the Defense Department to develop and administer a standardized cognitive pre-test, which would be administered to all military personnel prior to deployment and again upon return from deployment to determine if they have suffered a brain injury.  It also would require DOD and the VA to refer any servicemember or veteran for TBI screening if it is found, in the course of later treatment or contacts, that the servicemember or veteran may have suffered a service-connected brain injury.  Anyone found to have suffered a traumatic brain injury would be enrolled in the TBI program and receive the care they need.  One of the things the families of TBI patients complain most about is the confusion that surrounds their efforts to ensure that their loved one received all needed care. The fourth thing this measure would do is to direct DOD and the VA to assign each patient a lead case manager to ease the stress on the patient and family, facilitate navigation through the DOD and VA systems, ensure proper care, present options for care outside of DOD and the VA, and ensure consistent guidance. Additionally, DOD and the VA would assign to each patient a lead primary care physician to coordinate and oversee the care provided to the patient, including all treatment, rehabilitation, and medications.  Another complaint of families and TBI patients is that they are sometimes blocked from receiving the care they need due to their status as either a veteran or an active duty member. DOD and the VA have different health benefit options. In some cases, servicemembers have found that, because they accepted a discharge, they lost access to benefits that would help them.  Our bill addresses this problem by establishing, for these TBI patients, a temporary overlap of benefits. The participants in the TBI Program will be allowed, for 2 years, to receive any of the benefits available to veterans and to active duty members, regardless of their active duty status. This will help ensure they receive the best care and rehabilitation available, wherever it may be.  Our bill would spell out some other rights that are important for the rehabilitation of TBI patients. First, DOD and the VA would be required to provide a referral to a medical professional outside of DOD and the VA when requested by a TBI patient. This will allow patients to determine whether there is better care in the private sector that is not being provided to that patient. They would also have a right to an appeals process to challenge any failure to provide the standard of care required in the TBI Program.  In some cases, undiagnosed traumatic brain injuries may contribute to behavior resulting in other than honorable discharges. Upon the request of a servicemember who served since 2001 and was discharged under other than honorable conditions, the DOD would be directed to review the discharge to determine whether a brain injury might be the root cause of the actions that precipitated the adverse discharge, with fair reconsideration of the discharge if such evidence is found.  Similarly, the VA would be required to make available, upon request, an appeals process to update the disability rating of a veteran who is found to have suffered a traumatic brain injury.  Finally, this measure authorizes additional funding for research related to traumatic brain injury both in DOD and in the VA, to improve screening, diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation for traumatic brain injury.  This is a comprehensive effort to improve the treatment of our Nation's wounded servicemembers who have suffered a traumatic brain injury. I can't imagine the anguish that must be associated with such an injury, but I can imagine the kind of medical system I would like to have in place if it were my son or daughter struggling to recover from such an injury. This legislation reflects that vision.  I thank my cosponsors, Senators Warner, Murray, Graham, Obama, Webb, and Cantwell, and I urge all of my colleagues to support this measure.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1349       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
