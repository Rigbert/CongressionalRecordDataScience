First, the position Senator Smith and I have tried to convey will cost the taxpayers no money, but what Senator McCain is talking about will cost taxpayers money. Second, there are no objective criteria for the project. There would be if the Smith-Wyden proposal went forward because we laid out basic criteria for dealing with life in Oregon. These people are saving lives. That is what people all over this country saw on national TV.  Now, without any objective criteria and in a way that will cost taxpayers money, we are not even having a chance to debate a bipartisan amendment. That is regrettable. We ought to be following the example that Chairman Byrd and Senator Stevens have followed. That is what Senator Smith and I have tried to be a part of. We will be back on this floor again and again and again. Let us put the Senate on notice. We are going to stay here all the way through this session until this gets done.
