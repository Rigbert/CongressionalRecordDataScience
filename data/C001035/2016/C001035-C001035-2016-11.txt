President, I am delighted to commend the Sea Road School of Kennebunk, ME, on being named a 2016 National Blue Ribbon School of Excellence. This outstanding elementary school is one of only 329 schools across the country to receive this prestigious recognition from the U.S. Department of Education.  Created in 1982, the Blue Ribbon Schools Program honors public and private schools that are either academically superior in their States or that demonstrate significant gains in student achievement. The schools singled out for this national recognition are models of high educational standards and accountability.  This award recognizes the hard work and determination of the Sea Road School's pupils and staff. Sea Road School is a top-performing school on State-required assessments, and staff at the school use assessments throughout the academic year as a tool for improving and customizing instruction.  Students also participate in extracurricular activities, which helps forge a strong school community where students are connected and encouraged to pursue their interests. Indeed, a successful vote on a town ordinance to ban single-use plastic bags in Kennebunk this spring started with research and advocacy by Sea Road School students.  Sea Road School is a member of Regional School Unit 21. Six years ago, Kennebunkport Consolidated School, another member, was also named a Blue Ribbon School. RSU 21 is the first administrative unit in Maine to have two schools attain this distinction.  This Blue Ribbon award is a tribute not only to the students, but also to the administrators, teachers, staff, and parents of Sea Road School. Together, they are succeeding in their mission to generate excitement and momentum for learning. They are making a difference in the lives of their students, helping them reach their full potential as independent, responsible learners and citizens. I congratulate the entire community for this well-deserved recognition.                          ____________________
