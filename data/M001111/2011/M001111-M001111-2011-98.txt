 President, I would like to recognize the accomplishments and discoveries of investigators and scientists at the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA, who have brought about critical advances in health care delivery and medical knowledge through innovative medical research. These researchers and the veterans that make it all possible will be honored this week by National VA Research Week, which celebrates the historic success of VA research collaborations through this year's theme of ``Discovery and Collaboration for Exceptional Health Care.'' I would like to share some of the amazing breakthroughs that have resulted from VA research and that have advanced the quality of health care for all Americans.  At the conclusion of World War I, it was clear that servicemembers returning from a new type of warfare needed innovative medical treatment. VA research began conducting hospital-based medical studies in 1925 and since then has continued to publish significant research studies on a regular basis. While VA research studies have changed dramatically over the years to reflect the needs of veterans of each conflict, the goal of providing quality care has remained paramount.  This commitment to quality care has led to a litany of medical breakthroughs and discoveries that are respected and have been utilized around the world. Without the tireless efforts of VA researchers, the medical community would not have lifesaving tools such as the pacemaker and the heart stint. Without the breakthroughs of VA research, the world may never have seen a successful liver transplant, a safer cure for tuberculosis, or genetic mapping that may one day lead to the eradication of Alzheimer's disease. The many successes of VA research continue today as ongoing projects close in on a possible cure for cancer, create new pharmaceutical solutions for serious mental illness, and build new prosthetics and assistive devices that make a return to normal life possible for our wounded warriors.  VA research holds the promise to improve treatment and rehabilitation for our Nation's veterans. From developing new prosthetics to understanding and treating traumatic brain injuries, veterans can be certain that VA medical staff will always be prepared to best heal their wounds. Wounds, both visible and invisible, must receive the best care and treatment possible, and I am proud that VA is leading the way on new treatments for post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD.  VA breakthroughs in the treatment of PTSD have not only helped thousands of veterans but have served as an example for both the American and international mental health community. Most recently, VA has been a resource for the people of Japan while they grapple with the mental wounds of the tragic earthquake and tsunami that so violently shook that country earlier this year. Today, while the first responders and the resilient people of Alabama and the areas affected by recent tornado destruction begin physically rebuilding their homes and communities, they can rely on the Psychological First Aid Field Operations Guide to provide tips on how to begin the healing process.  Medical and scientific advances from VA research have often come through collaboration. VA has the privilege of relying on one of our Nation's greatest assets, the men and women who serve. These veterans understand that oftentimes, their participation in VA Research may not directly benefit their lives. Instead, they continue to serve their fellow Americans by trying to ensure better quality care for those who return from armed conflicts in the future. By partnering with 1 million veterans, VA is launching the Million Veteran Project, an effort to learn more about how genetics affect health.  VA also has the ability to partner with some of the best medical research institutions through their relationship with the Association of American Medical Colleges. This year's theme marks the 65th anniversary of an agreement which allowed VA to join with medical schools and create innovative partnerships directly impacting the quality of care. This partnership is a significant reason for VA research being so successful at finding innovative solutions to health care problems. Because of this collaboration, VA scientists and researchers have access to both VA medical centers and various university medical centers to conduct their research. This partnership brings together the brightest minds of our medical and scientific communities and yields positive results for our veterans.  I am proud to have been a long-time, ardent supporter of VA research. I know that VA's world-class researchers could easily work elsewhere, but they continue to work with the Department in fulfilling its obligations to constantly improve the quality of care for our veterans. At a time when more and more veterans are coming home from war and relying on VA for their health care needs, we here in Congress must make sure we can lead the way with a strong investment in our veterans and the high quality care we are committed to providing them.                          ____________________
