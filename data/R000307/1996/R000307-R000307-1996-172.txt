We have discussed this at length. I thank the gentleman from Texas for his question.  One of our technical amendments, I think, certainly clarifies this situation. Under our bill, anyone who has been eligible for payments under current law will be eligible for transition contract payments. The traditional protection afforded both the landlord and the tenant based on the amount of risk taken between the landowner and the tenant in distributing the payments will remain in the same manner in H.R. 2854, or freedom to farm, as current law.  I can assure the gentleman we have heard his constituents. We have heard you, and we addressed it. I thank the gentleman for his concerns.
