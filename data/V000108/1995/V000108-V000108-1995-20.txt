Speaker, I rise today to express my strong opposition to the conference report on the budget, because I want to balance the budget and I want to be fair. Although the language in the conference report is an improvement over the House budget resolution, it still contains a fatal flaw, $245 billion in tax cuts which will delay the benefit our constituents will get from deficit reduction.  As someone who voted for both rescission bills this year, I do not believe that tax cuts are warranted until we have implemented tough spending decisions. Taxes today, and we should remember this, take out of the economy less than they did 25 years ago. When Richard Nixon was President in 1970, Federal taxes consumed 19.6 percent of the gross domestic product. Today the percentage is smaller, 19.2 percent.  What is more, the Republican plan backloads deficit reduction until after the year 2000, but gives away an easy tax cut immediately. The tax cut increases the deficit in 1997, and hopes to pay for deficit reduction in the final 2 years.
