President, today I want to pay tribute to one of Oregon's and indeed our Nation's finest higher education leaders, Dr. Daniel O. Bernstine, president of Portland State University. Portland State University is our state's largest university, and is foundational to Oregon's well-earned reputation for educational and technological innovation. Earlier this year, President Bernstine announced he would leave PSU at the end of the academic year and become the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Law School Admissions Council in Pennsylvania.  Pennsylvania's gain is truly Oregon's loss. As president of Portland State, Dan and his team have truly transformed Oregon's only urban university. Under his leadership the enrollment has grown substantially; research funding has increased from $17 million to more than $40 million; the University completed its first ever comprehensive campaign; and the campus has added a new Urban Center, the University Place hotel, the Native American Student and Community Center, the Simon Benson House, Epler Hall, the Broadway Housing complex, the Peter Stott recreational field, the Northwest Center for Engineering, Science, and Technology, and the Portland Streetcar.  Dan has forged community partnerships that truly reflect the university's motto: Let Knowledge Serve the City. These include many of the nonprofit organizations in the Portland Metropolitan community, the urban and suburban school districts, and the area's community colleges.  I want to highlight a development at Portland State that is especially important to me and to the work I have pursued in the Senate. Shortly after his arrival, Dan said that investment in science, technology, and engineering would be a priority. One area that has emerged as a national research center is in nanometrology. Attracting Dr. Jun Jiao to Portland State set the initiative in motion and today PSU has one of the premier centers for Electron Microscopy and Nanofabrication. This is evidence that President Bernstine understands the importance of nanotechnology and is committed to having PSU make a major contribution in this area.  Under President Bernstine's leadership, Portland State University has received national recognition for its faculty, community and service-learning programs and is listed in the Princeton Review book, Colleges with a Conscience: 81 Great Schools with Outstanding Community Involvement. For its work to revitalize its community, its work in urban development, and support for the local economy, Portland State University is listed on the first President's Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll and was recognized by The New England Board of Higher Education as one of 25 universities considered ``Saviors of Our Cities.'' The Association of American Colleges and Universities also recognized PSU in its report, ``College Learning for the New Global Century,'' as a leader in the area of fostering civic, intercultural, and ethical learning. And for the past 5 years, Portland State University has ranked among the Nation's best colleges in five categories that lead to student success, according to U.S. News & World Report in its America's Best Colleges 2007 edition.  For these reasons and more, I consider President Bernstine's decision to take on this new responsibility to be a loss to Portland State University and to Oregon. I am pleased that he will remain active in the higher education community and I wish him well in his new position in Pennsylvania. Mr. President, Daniel O. Bernstine is an Oregon treasure and has made a positive difference in the lives of students and to our community.                          ____________________
