 Speaker, today, I recognize the outstanding work done by participants in my Student Congressional Town Meeting held this spring at the University of Vermont. These participants were part of a group of high school students from around Vermont who testified about the concerns they have as teenagers, and about what they would like to see government do regarding these concerns.  I respectfully request that the following testimonials be included in the Congressional Record.  On Behalf of Stephanie Horvath, Katie Blanchard, Cady Merrill, and                     Jesse Butler Regarding Abortion       STEPHANIE HORVATH. We are doing our presentation on      abortion.       Abortion is never an easy decision to make, but women have      been making these choices for thousands of years, for many      different reasons. Whenever society has sought to outlaw      abortion, it has driven women to back alleys, where this      procedure becomes dangerous and illegal.       Each year 50,000 to 100,000 women die after receiving an      abortion in unsafe and unsanitary conditions, and an      estimated 20 million unsafe abortions take place each year.       KATIE BLANCHARD. Regardless of what people around you think      about a decision such as abortion, it is the ultimate choice      of the woman, their doctor, and their god. Parental      involvement for minors should be necessary due to the      conditions performed in this surgical procedure.       Every woman should have a supportive mentor to turn to in      case of an emergency following an abortion. A parent could be      there to care for, protect and comfort child in such a      situation. Most women experience such complications as loss      of appetite, lack of sleep, persistent crying, isolation from      friends, excessive anger and thoughts of suicide.       CADY MERRILL. Although a parent's reaction could be      unexpected, it is normal for them to have some emotional      feelings about their daughter's pregnancy. It is normal to      feel frightened, sad, angry, betrayed and disappointed.      Regardless, most parents are and should be beside their child      through hard times, and would only help their daughter      through an abortion if that was her choice.       JESSE BUTLER. Abortion is a highly sensitive topic. I'm not      here to debate whether it is right or wrong. I am here,      however, to state that I think, when an abortion is being      considered by a minor, at least one parent or the legal      guardian of the minor should be required to be involved. The      state has already established that minors are not allowed to      make many decisions or perform many actions without their      parent's or guardian's consent. Abortion should not be any      different.       Many questions have to be considered when thinking of      having an abortion. Some of those questions included whether      or not the abortion or pregnancy or baby can be supported.      Another question includes whether or not a minor can deal      with the physical and psychological consequences of whichever      decision is made. All of those questions are serious      questions a minor may not have enough life experience to be      able to make good judgments on. 5 percent of the time,      abortion should involve a doctor's opinion. Adults will also      be more inclined to recognize and respect a doctor's opinion.      Young women may be afraid to tell their parents that they are      pregnant. Requiring parents to be involved in the abortion      decision will encourage parents to pay attention to any clues      that their child may be pregnant. Overall, I think if an      adult is involved in a decision, it is more likely that the      best judgment will be made.  On Behalf of Elizabeth Echeverria and Damon Rooney Regarding Labor                               Exploitation       DAMON ROONEY. First of all, I would like to thank you,      Congressman Sanders, for letting us come here. And I also      thank Lamoille; we really appreciate you switching your      timeframe with us.       ELIZABETH ECHEVERRIA. We are dealing with labor      exploitation, and this touches on a couple of the topics that      were already talked about. It ties in with child labor, and      it ties in with free trade, and things like that.       Do you wear brand-name clothes? Do you drink coffee? Have      you ever wondered where these things came from? The answer      may surprise you. Because many of these things are made or      picked by malnourished, oppressed and exploited men, woman      and children.       DAMON ROONEY. I would like to read a passage written by the      National Labor Committee: We went there by chance on an early      Friday afternoon, the Muslim holiday, when the garment      workers were supposed to have their weekly day off. We met an      18-year-old girl who, minutes before, had just returned from      having been forced to work three 20-hour shifts in a row. She      had worked 64 hours in the last three days, 120 hours in the      last week. She was working seven days a week. Her eyes were      more bloodshot than I'd ever seen anyone's before. The entire      eyeball was pale, glassy red. She could barely speak. She was      not just exhausted, but she had nearly lost her voice, and      all that was left was a painful, low harsh rasp. This woman      earned 14 cents an hour, $6.83 a week, sewing clothing for      U.S. companies.       ELIZABETH ECHEVERRIA. That is just one example of the      conditions that our American companies are fostering. People      all other the world, in factories like the one this woman      works in, are kept in abject misery and poverty. These      factories are poorly ventilated, poorly lighted, and,      basically, miserable places to be.       In an article from the New York Times, Adelia Pinvata, who      investigated conditions in the San Marcos Free Trade Zone in      San Salvador, said, and I quote: The wages are not enough to      cover the basic food basket. It is a scandal. There are      workers who faint because of the heat inside the factories,      and because they are badly nourished. Various workers fainted      when we were there.       An example is one of these types of factories, the Active      Sporting Limited factory in Bangladesh, who makes hats for      Rebok, Falcon Headware, Georgetown University, University of      Connecticut, and various other U.S. companies and      universities.       I came across some disturbing facts. Many workers must put      in up to 60 to 70 hours of mandatory overtime a month,      ``mandatory overtime'' being illegal in Bangladesh. They have      no regular scheduled holidays. They have a maximum of two      days off per month. They don't even get weekends off. Their      wages are below the legal minimum. A maternity leave isn't      paid. Workers may not talk during their shifts. They must ask      permission to use the bathroom. Their bathroom visits are      timed, and the water is unsafe to drink. There are no sick      days allowed. And they are reportedly slapped and beaten with      sticks for misbehavior.       No one could last more than 10 to 15 years. In the end,      they are sick, exhausted, and penniless. And it is not an      isolated occurrence, it is typical. For example, according to      an article from the October 9, 1995, edition of the New York      Times, in Central America free-trade zones, many factories      are surrounded by 15-foot cinder-block walls, barbed wire,      and armed guards.       Yet these workers cannot break out of poverty and      degradation, because in most places, anyone who attempts to      form a union is methodically fired and blacklisted.       DAMON ROONEY. Labor exploitation is a difficult problem,      but we can find solutions. The biggest problem is that wages      are too low to even buy adequate food. One obvious solution      to this problem is to pass legislation that forces U.S.      companies and their contractors to pay higher wages.       But this is tricky, because we don't want to put them out      of business. We also should think twice about boycotting for      this reason. Because any poor laborer would agree that it is      better to be exploited than to have no job at all. But      getting them to raise their prices a little won't break them.      The U.S. must force them to pay subsistence wages--in other      words, earn enough for food, clothing, and adequate shelter.      And this is not that big of a demand, considering that the      estimated subsistence wage for Bangladesh, for example, is      only 34 cents an hour, or day.       ELIZABETH ECHEVERRIA. An hour. And that is a high-end      estimate, by the way.       Another approach would be to force the companies to pay the      workers a higher percentage of the retail value of the      product that they are producing. This would help level out      the distribution of wealth. Because, for example, according      to Forbes Magazine, Donald Fisher, CEO of GAP and Banana      Republic, is worth $1.5 billion, while hat makers in Dacca,      Bangladesh, receive an average of 1.6 cents for every $17.43      University hat they make. That means the workers are only      receiving .01 percent of the hat's retail price. Double their      wages, and the hat cost less than two cents more for us to      buy. Where do you think all the money is going?       DAMON ROONEY. Another problem is lack of inspectors to      enforce labor laws. Because there are numerous labor laws and      U.S. national company protocols in places that are not being      followed, there are only eleven for the whole Dacca export      zone, which has over one million clothing workers. We must      get more inspectors in there, and also raise the penalties.      We could have U.S. inspectors inspect the factories that      export to the United     States, and if the conditions are not satisfactory, then the      products cannot be sent to the U.S. That way, factories don't      get paid if they don't follow the rules.       ELIZABETH ECHEVERRIA. Before any of these solutions can be      put into motion, we must heighten awareness of these      injustices. American people have a strong voice. Because only      when these companies realize that their profit will go down      will they listen.       We are the consumers and we have the power. So the most      important thing that all of you in the audience can do is      write letters to the CEOs of these places--the GAP, Liz      Clayburn, Reebok, et cetera--and let them know that the      public is concerned.       DAMON ROONEY. Labor exploitation is a problem that affects      us all. We are the ones wearing the clothes and drinking the      coffee picked by exploited hands. It is up to us to change      these injustices.       Thank you, Mr. Sanders, for your time.                                 ____________________
