President, today I wish to recognize the contributions of Business Executives for National Security, BENS.  Since 1982, this national organization has been a primary channel through which American business leaders have contributed their special experience and talent to help build a more secure nation. Founded by business tycoon Stanley A. Weiss, BENS operates on the principle that America's national security is everybody's business. BENS is a highly respected nonpartisan organization of senior executives and entrepreneurs dedicated to enhancing our national security by implementing proven practices of the private sector.  Working with Congress and the Department of Defense, BENS helps protect the American homeland and build a more efficient and effective military. As the United States continues to confront domestic and international threats, BENS proves more important than ever before.  BENS has provided distinguished service to the Nation for over a quarter century. This service includes reforming the business of defense, protecting the homeland, tracking terrorist funding, and banning chemical weapons. BENS helps our Armed Forces by slashing bureaucracy, streamlining operations, and cutting waste, making more funds available for urgent priorities such as military readiness and modernization.  BENS is a pioneer in homeland security creating innovative partnerships around the country that civic-minded companies that provide assistance to local and State governments in times of emergency. BENS works with the Department of the Treasury to improve America's ability to locate and suspend suspicious financial activities that fund terrorism.  BENS is a strong advocate of the Chemical Weapons Convention to eliminate the chemical weapons stockpile by 2012, reducing the chances such weapons will be used against the United States through a terrorist attack.  Mr. President, I ask my distinguished colleagues in the Senate to join me in recognizing BENS and their commitment to national security interests.                          ____________________
