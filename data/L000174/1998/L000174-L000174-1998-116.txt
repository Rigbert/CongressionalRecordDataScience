President, I have heard from scores of Vermonters lately who are steaming mad after being told by their home satellite signal providers that they are about to lose some of their network satellite channels. They have every right to be upset. It is within Congress's ability to un-muddle this mess, and the public has every reason to expect Congress to get its act together to do that, and to do that promptly.  While the hills and mountains of Vermont are a natural wonder, they can also be barriers to reception of clear TV signals over-the-air with rooftop antennas. At my home in Middlesex, Vermont, we can only get one channel clearly, and lots of ghosts on the other channel we receive. We get so many ghosts on our family set that it looks like Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa are hitting four homeruns at a time.  That is why Vermonters have chosen satellite reception: They cannot get a clear picture without it.  I am gratified tonight that we are finally in a position to announce an understanding that I hope will keep satellite TV viewers from having to lose station signals this year. I am joining with both the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee and the Chairman of the Commerce Committee on two separate bills designed fix these problems. I am certain that most Senators will be pleased with this breakthrough, and I hope we can pass this bill without objection in the Senate.  Under a court order, thousands of viewers--many of them living in my home state of Vermont--will be cut off from receiving satellite TV stations that they are paying to receive. We have 65,000 home satellite dishes in Vermont. the court order directly affects only those subscribers who signed up for service after March 11, 1997, but most subscribers are being warned nonetheless by their signal providers that they will soon lose several network channels they now receive.  This huge policy glitch is intruding right now into hundreds of thousands of homes. It is a royal mess, and Congress and the FCC need to fix it.  I introduced a bill in March of this year with Chairman Hatch so that we could try to resolve this issue before it became a major problem. We have tried in the many months since then to push Congress toward a solution. Many viewers have lost signals already. We are trying to get these bills passed in the next couple of weeks to restore service and to keep other households for losing their satellite TV signals--not just in Vermont but throughout the nation.  I am pleased that Chairman Hatch and I have worked out arrangements with the Chairman of the Commerce Committee and other Senators active on this issue, including Senators DeWine and Kohl, that significantly raise the prospects that Congress can soon pass a bill to prevent the cutoff of thousands of viewers this month and in October. We hope and we believe that all Senators can support this approach.  This legislation would keep signals available to Vermonters and subscribers in other states until the FCC has a chance to address these issues by the end of next February.  Our legislation will direct the FCC to address this problem for the future, and our proposal ultimately will mean--as technology advances--that Vermonters will be able to receive satellite TV for all Vermont full-power TV stations. Viewers in all states would be similarly protected. This effort eventually will promote head-to-head competition between cable and satellite TV providers.  The goal is to provide satellite home viewers in Vermont and across the nation with more choices and more channel selections, and at lower rates. The evidence is clear that in areas of the country where there is full competition between cable providers, rates to customers are considerably lower. The same will be true when there is greater effective competition between cable providers and satellite signal providers.  Over time, this effort will permit satellite TV providers to offer a full selection of local TV channels to viewers--even to those living in or near Burlington, Vermont, where local signals are now blocked.  Under current law, those families must get their local TV signals over an antenna which often does not provide a clear picture. These bills eventually will remove that legal limitation that prohibits satellite carriers from offering local TV signals to viewers.  Over time, satellite carriers will have to follow the rules that cable providers have to follow which will mean that they must carry all local Vermont TV stations. In addition, Vermont stations will be available over satellite to many areas of Vermont that today are unserved by satellite or by cable.  Vermonters now receive network satellite signals with programming from stations in other states. In other words, they may get a CBS station from another state but not WCAX, the Burlington CBS affiliate.  By allowing satellite providers to offer a wider variety of programming, including local stations, the satellite industry would be able to compete with cable, and the cable industry will be competing with satellite carriers. Cable will continue to be a highly effective competitor with its ability to offer extremely high-speed Internet connections to homes and businesses.  The second major improvement offered through our legislation is that satellite carriers that offer local Vermont channels in their mix of programming will be able to reach Vermonters throughout our state. The system will be based on regions called Designated Market Areas, or DMAs. Vermont has one large DMA covering most of the state--the Burlington-Plattsburg DMA, and two smaller ones in southeastern Vermont--the Albany-Schenectady-Troy DMA includes Bennington County--and in southwestern Vermont, where the Boston DMA includes Windham County.  Using current technology, signals would be provided by spot-beam satellites using some 150 regional uplink sites throughout the nation to beam local signals up to two satellites. Those satellites would use 60 or so spotbeams to send those local signals, received from the regional uplinks, back to satellite dish owners. High-definition TV would be offered under this system at a later date. This system is likely to take two to three years to be put into full operation. In the meantime, another company called EchoStar may provide some local-into-local service in some parts of the country.  Under the bill that Senator Hatch and I introduced in March, this spotbeam technology would mean that home owners with satellite dishes in downtown Burlington, and in every county in Vermont except Windham and Bennington, would receive all the full-power TV stations in the Burlington-Plattsburg DMA, including PBS stations. Bennington residents would receive the stations in the Schnectady-Albany-Troy DMA, and Windham County residents would receive Boston signals, since they are in the Boston DMA. Over time these counties could be blended into the Burlington-Plattsburg DMA.  Since technology advances so quickly, other systems could be developed before this bill is fully implemented that would provide similar service but using different technology. And existing systems would be accommodatedunder our legislation, but those systems would follow rules similar to current rules until conversion to this new technology takes place.  It is time for this Congress to step up to the plate and solve this policy nightmare that is now at the door of countless homes across the nation. Our constituents rightly will not take ``not now'' as an acceptable answer.  I commend Chairman Hatch and Chairman McCain for the leadership they have shown in solving this problem, and I look forward to continue working closely with them and with other Senators as we move this solution toward, and eventually across, the goal line.                          ____________________
