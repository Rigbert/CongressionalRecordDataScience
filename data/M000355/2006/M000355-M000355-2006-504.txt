 President, I understand that Senator Obama has an amendment at the desk. I ask unanimous consent that it be considered and agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read the third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating thereto be printed in the Record as if read, without intervening action or debate.
