President, on October 6, 2005, I introduced S. 1832, the ``Fort Reno Mineral Leasing Act''. At that time I introduced letters of support for this legislation. Since then I have received a letter from Mrs. Donna Von Tungeln that I would like to submit for the Record.  Mrs. Von Tungeln and her late husband Henry Jo have been active supporters of preserving the historical buildings at Fort Reno. Their dedicated work to this project is greatly appreciated.  I ask unanimous consent the following letter be printed for the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                            Von Tungeln Farms,                                  Calumet, OK, September 28, 2005.     Hon. Jim Inhofe,     Russell Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Inhofe: I appreciate your interest in helping      the citizens of Oklahoma to preserve one of our most      important historical assets, the buildings of Fort Reno.      Funding is badly needed to restore and maintain the Fort's      buildings, many of which were built as early as the 1880's.      The legislation you are willing to introduce on our behalf      will insure that these priceless buildings are not lost, but      are preserved and maintained and made available for viewing      and use by generations of Oklahomans.       I also appreciate that you support a revenue-neutral      approach to financing the restoration of Fort Reno without      increasing our tax burden. My late husband, Henry Jo, first      suggested this mechanism about two years ago, and worked to      have it considered. Your willingness to implement the plan      means a great deal to me. Success with the legislation will      mean much to many other Oklahomans, as well as the thousands      of out-of-state tourists who visit Fort Reno each year.           Sincerely,     Donna Von Tungeln.                          ____________________
