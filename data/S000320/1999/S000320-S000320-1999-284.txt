 President, I rise today to pay tribute to Daniel Pratt, a distinguished Southern Industrialist and founder of the city of Prattville, Alabama. A man whose vision guided the state on a course of industrialization and modernization. As a celebration of Daniel Pratt's 200th birthday, 1999 has been named the ``Year of Industry'' in Alabama. This is a significant tribute to honor a very important figure in the history of Alabama. Daniel Pratt's legacy not only includes the beginning of modern industry to the state, but also philanthropic deeds that were unrivaled for his era. Daniel Pratt's indomitable pioneer spirit serves as an inspiration to others who have faced adversity and conquered the unknown.  Born in 1799, Daniel Pratt was raised in Temple, New Hampshire. Brought up as a Congregationalist in a traditional Puritan family, Daniel Pratt grew up disciplined, structured, and religious. He received only a limited education, but took advantage of an opportunity to apprentice under a family friend, who was an architect and a builder. This new focus in his life helped to channel his natural inclination towards machinery and building. After his mother's death in 1817, Daniel Pratt acted on his ambitions and set out for the South, which he regarded as a land of opportunity. Daniel Pratt's formative years instilled in him a strong work ethic and religious convictions, along with a sense of compassion. These two attributes would help to guide him through difficult decisions throughout his life.  After sailing to Savannah, Georgia, Daniel Pratt did not immediately become a rich entrepreneur. Initially, he put the tools of his apprenticeship to work as a builder and planner for wealthy planters. After a few years, he moved onto ship building, adding to his burgeoning knowledge of construction and the industrial process. Daniel Pratt was willing to take the long road to success. He realized that the only way to succeed in life was through hard work and gritty determination. He also had the common sense to learn from others, which paid off when he befriended Samuel Griswold, who was a prominent cotton gin manufacturer in the area. Through friendship as well as a business relationship, Daniel Pratt learned the trade which would ultimately thrust him into the forefront of Southern industrialization. Daniel Pratt proved to be so adept at the manufacture and sale of cotton gins, that he became a partner in the enterprise within a year. At this point in his life, Daniel Pratt's unbridled vision was able to manifest itself in his actions. He saw that the expansion of the cotton gin into the West was a fantastic opportunity for his new enterprise. He realized that the center of distribution in the South would revolve around the great river systems which offered the advantage of water as a cheap source of power. Pratt had planned to stay in business with his partner, but with Indian uprisings in the Alabama area, his partner became apprehensive. This did not deter Daniel Pratt in the slightest. As his first biographer, Shadrack Mims wrote: ``The indomitable will of Daniel Pratt, that spirit of enterprise which characterized him through life, was not to be daunted nor discouraged by Indian uprisings. He purchased material for fifty gins, put the same on wagons, and in 1833, he with his brave wife headed for Alabama.''  Daniel Pratt rapidly met the success he foresaw in his move to Alabama. He found quick sales among the planters of the Alabama Black Belt. He established a temporary site for his factory along Autauga Creek and immediately began to expand his operations. Within a period of five years, it was evident that he needed a larger area for a permanent site. He chose to settle on a marshy, heavily wooded piece of land only three miles from his original site. In only ten years, he turned this hostile area into a thriving manufacturing village of eight hundred people. This is the site that would eventually form the booming industrial town of Prattville.  Initially, the Gin Factory was the corner stone of the economy in the new settlement. But as business grew, Daniel Pratt reinvested the profits into new industries in the town. By the 1850's, Prattville, for its size, furnished the most diverse industrial pattern in the United States. In addition, the Pratt Gin Company became the largest gin factory in the world, with unrivaled quality in construction. Daniel Pratt's business was so successful, that he began to invest money in the state infrastructure. He presided over railroad conventions and sparked Southern railroad growth with his generous infusion of capital.  Daniel Pratt also used his good fortune to invest in the Red Mountain Iron and Coal Company, and he controlled the Oxmoor iron furnaces in the Birmingham Industrial district. In his honor, the great vein of coal west of Birmingham was named the Pratt Vein, and Pratt City was later incorporated into the town of Birmingham. These furnaces were destroyed by Wilson's Raiders during the Civil War, but Daniel Pratt was determined to rebuild them. With the help of his son-in-law, Henry Debardeleban, he did just that, and by 1873, they were back in operation. The name was changed to the Eureka Mining Company, and the towns of Birmingham and Bessemer began to thrive. Daniel Pratt is credited with being one of the driving forces behind the development of that entire area of the state.  In 1847, the University of Alabama awarded him the degree of Master of Mechanical and Useful Arts, the only one of it's kind the University has ever given. Pratt also served as a distinguished member of the Alabama House of Representatives throughout the duration of the Civil War.  However, it was Daniel Pratt's philanthropic deeds which set him apart from other industrialists of his time. Pratt built schools and churches for workers in his textile mill with his own money. His boundless paternalism towards his workers led him to teach in Prattville's Sunday Schools. It was his sincere desire to better both the town of Prattville as well as the entire South through his relentless efforts to preach the industrial gospel. He wrote numerous letters and articles professing his industrialist beliefs, which were published in southern newspapers and periodicals across the area.  Although born 200 years ago, Daniel Pratt serves as a shining example of a pioneer spirit which transformed the South into a thriving industrial center. His leadership, vision, courage, and generosity is an inspiration to everyone.                          ____________________
