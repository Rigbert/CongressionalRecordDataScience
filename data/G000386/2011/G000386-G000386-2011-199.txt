 President, it is with deep regret that I must inform the Senate about the passing of a soldier from my home State, specialist Donald L. Nichols of Shell Rock, IA. He was 21 years old. Specialist Nichols enlisted in the Iowa National Guard in March of 2008 and was assigned to the Iowa Army National Guard's Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 1st Battalion, 133rd Infantry, 2nd Brigade Combat team, 34th Infantry Division, based in Waterloo, IA. Specialist Nichols was killed by an improvised explosive device that struck the armored vehicle while he was patrolling in the Mehtar Lam District, Laghman Province, Afghanistan.  Specialist Nichols is survived by his mother Becky Poock; his father Jeff Nichols; his fiance Chelsey Bliss; two brothers, and many other family and friends.  The family and friends of Specialist Nichols remember him as a dedicated soldier who truly loved serving his country. His fellow soldiers remember him as a ``studious soldier who took his duty with zeal.'' Donald had decided that he wanted to join the Armed Forces even before he graduated high school. He showed a dedication to service that is typical of all of the men and women fighting for our Nation but one that is so rare in the common man. The memory of his sense of humor and his love for family, friends, and country will remain constantly with his loved ones.  SPC Donald L. Nichols will be missed by all that were privileged to know him and my thoughts and prayers go out to his loved ones in this incredibly difficult time.                          ____________________
