Mr. Chairman, it is time to be frank and honest about this tax bill. Republicans used budget gimmicks, smoke and mirrors, to hide the true effect of their plan. Why? Because the American people know the Republicans are looking out for Wall Street and wealthy Republican supporters.  This debate is not about whether to have a tax cut. Democrats support a tax cut. This debate is about who will get the tax cut, Wall Street or Main Street. Democrats support a child tax credit for all working families. We support a HOPE scholarship to help our children, all of our children, go to college. We support allowing middle class American families to sell their homes without paying taxes.  But this is not what the Republicans want.
