President, I appreciate the kind words of the majority leader. He and I have been friends for decades. He worked with me and was in touch with me throughout the recent effort on the NSA reform bill, the USA FREEDOM Act of 2014. He knew we had cosponsors, Republicans and Democrats, from across the political spectrum. This was an effort to do what was best for America and do it at a time when we would not be under urgent deadlines. Several of the authorities we were trying to amend expire on June 1 of next year.  We had a piece of legislation that began in the House of Representatives by a Republican chairman. We added to the bill in the Senate. There was a very clear signal from the House of Representatives that if we had passed the USA FREEDOM Act of 2014 here in the Senate, they would have taken it up and passed it. We would be enacting legislation that would improve not only the security of Americans, but also the privacy and individual liberties of Americans. And we would not do it under a deadline. So it was unfortunate last night that there was a partisan effort to stop it. There was some of the worst fear-mongering I have heard on this floor in 40 years. But I say this as more of a way to thank the distinguished majority leader for his steadfast support.
