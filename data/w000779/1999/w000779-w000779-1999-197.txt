I will make this point very briefly. One of the key concerns that senior citizens now have is the problem of taking prescription drugs in the proper way. We have learned a great deal, for example, about how billions of dollars are wasted as a result of seniors not being in a position to get good information about drug interactions.  One of the ways that we are best able to tackle that problem, and save billions of dollars, in order to make sure that seniors have their needs met in terms of prescriptions is to get some of this information online. This is now just beginning to be done. I submit that it is a perfect example of how we should not be pitting the issues relating to Y2K against those affecting low-income citizens.  I think the Senator from Massachusetts is absolutely right with respect to minimum wage, and I just say that on the basis of even the example I have given with respect to drug interactions among the elderly, and the billions of dollars that are wasted as a result of people not being in a position to take their medicine in a proper fashion. That is an example of how this Y2K issue really does affect all citizens--even on the question of pay. If the computers break down, it is going to be hard for folks to get their paychecks early next year.  So I think the Senator from Massachusetts is absolutely right with respect to the need to raise the minimum wage. And I share his view on the need to help seniors with respect to their prescriptions. But I do think that this question of addressing the Y2K issue in a responsible kind of way is beneficial to all Americans, regardless of their income, in our country.  I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator from North Carolina. I want to wrap up with a couple of comments with respect to issues that Members of my party may have about the Y2K legislation. For example, there are a number of Senators on the Democratic side of the aisle who have been concerned about the question of punitive damages. Well, in the last few hours, we have made substantial progress on this issue. I happen to believe that it is critically important that when you engage in egregious conduct, you be in a position to send a very powerful message with respect to punitive damages on these questions of fraudulent activity.  In the last couple of hours, a great deal of progress has been made with respect to this issue. Senator Dodd, in particular, deserves a great deal of credit. These changes that have been made in the last couple of hours with respect to punitive damages respond directly to what a number of Democratic colleagues have gotten from the administration this morning.  The other issue I would like to touch on that was mentioned as well by a number of our colleagues on the Democratic side deals with the question of evidentiary standards. I think it is clear that we do need evidentiary standards that are fair to consumers and are fair to plaintiffs. In the last couple of hours, again, for Democrats looking at this issue, a substantial amount of progress has been made, largely due to the efforts of the Senator from Connecticut. I am very pleased to be able to report that those changes have been made as well. Democratic Senators, I think, will be pleased with some of the other changes as well. I know that early on--and I think this was a concern that the Senator from North Carolina, who has been such a valuable addition to the Senate, had raised--the bill that came out of committee talked about a very ill-defined defense for defendants, essentially saying if they engage in a reasonable effort, that would in some way provide them with a defense from wrongful conduct. That, too, has been eliminated.  So I am very hopeful that Members on this side of the aisle will look at the progress that has been made in the last couple of hours. I want it understood that I very much want to work with the Senator from North Carolina on the points that he, I know, is going to raise in connection with this legislation. I want to see this bill go forward. I believe there is a coalition on both sides of the aisle that is now prepared to continue to work in a constructive kind of way to get this legislation done.  As one who feels strongly about an increase in the minimum wage, as one who feels that this Y2K legislation, properly done, has the opportunity in it for us to help lower health care costs and make sure seniors don't have these drug interactions that hurt them and waste billions of dollars, I hope that in the name of trying to address both of those issues the Senate will move forward in a bipartisan way.  I will just wrap up, Mr. President, by asking unanimous consent to have printed a letter from the American Bar Association on this legislation.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                         American Bar Association,                                  Governmental Affairs Office,                                   Washington, DC, April 28, 1999.     Senator Ron Wyden,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Wyden: In listening to yesterday's Y2K debate      on the Senate floor, we at the American Bar Association were      surprised to hear that you and Senator Sessions believe the      ABA has issued a report saying, among other things, that the      Y2K litigation could affect billions and billions of dollars      of our economy. I can assure you that the ABA has not issued      a report estimating litigation costs of the Y2K problem and      has not taken any position on the pending Y2K legislation. I      understand that your misunderstanding comes from the reading      of a Backgrounder prepared by the Progressive Policy      Institute which cites in turn from an article in the Newark      Star-Ledger.       The ABA had several programs on the Y2K issue at our 1998      Annual Meeting in Toronto and we had speakers at those      programs representing all sites of the Y2K debate. In one      program, presented by the ABA Section of Business Law's      Committee on Corporate Counsel, there were seven speakers.      One of the speakers, Jeff Jinnett, said that ``there has been      considerable speculation in the legal and public press that      the year 2000 computer problem will generate considerable      amounts of litigation.'' He summarizes some of the      speculation, including the views of one commentator, who had      provided the estimate cited in the Newark Star-Ledger. Mr.      Jinnett concluded in his speech that ``we can only speculate      as to the actual litigation which will result from the Year      2000 computer problem and the cost of the ultimate      litigation, since (a) no substantial litigation (other than      the Produce Palace, Software Business Technologies, Symantec,      Macola, and Intuit lawsuits, discussed below) has been      reported to have occurred as of the date of this article      based on the Year 2000 problem and (b) we do not know how      much necessary Year 2000 corrective work will ultimately not      be completed on time.'' In any event, the views he expressed      are not those of the American Bar Association and should not      be referred to as either our policy position or as coming      from an ABA ``study'' ``report.''       We would appreciate it if you would do what you can to      correct the record on this matter. If you have any questions,      please let me know.       I will be sending a similar letter to Senator Sessions to      let him know our views as well.       Thank you for any assistance you can provide on this      matter.           Sincerely,                                                  Robert D. Evans,                                                         Director.
