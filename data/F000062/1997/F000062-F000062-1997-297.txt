 249, the Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1997.                                The Bill  This bill does four things:  For treatment of breast cancer, it requires insurance plans to allow physicians to determine the length of a patient's hospital stay according to medical necessity; and it requires health insurance plans to cover breast reconstruction following a mastectomy.  For treatment of all cancers, it requires health insurance plans to cover second opinions by specialists whether the initial diagnosis is positive or negative; and it prohibits insurance plans from financially penalizing or rewarding a physician for providing medically necessary care or for referring a patient for a second opinion                          Two California Cases  I have received two letters from constituents describing firsthand their treatment by insurance companies in having a mastectomy.  Nancy Couchot, age 60, of Newark, CA, wrote me that she had a modified radical mastectomy on November 4, 1996, at 11:30 a.m. and was released by 4:30 p.m. She could not walk and the hospital staff did not help her ``even walk to the bathroom.'' She says, ``Any woman, under these circumstances, should be able to opt for an overnight stay to receive professional help and strong pain relief.''  Victoria Berck, of Los Angeles, wrote that she had a mastectomy and lymph node removal at 7:30 a.m. on November 13, 1996, and was released from the hospital 7 hours later, at 2:30 p.m. Ms. Berck was given instructions on how to empty two drains attached to her body and sent home. She concludes, ``No civilized country in the world has mastectomy as an outpatient procedure.''  These are but two examples of what, unfortunately, is becoming a national nightmare--insurance plans interfering with professional medical judgment and refusing to cover hospital stays of mastectomy patients.                           Need for the Bill  Increasingly, insurance companies are dropping and reducing inpatient hospital coverage of mastectomies. This is beyond the pale. It is unconscionable.  The Wall Street Journal on November 6 reported that ``some health maintenance organizations are creating an uproar by ordering that mastectomies be performed on an outpatient basis. At a growing number of HMOs, surgeons must document ``medical necessity'' to justify even a one-night hospital admission.''  In 1997, over 184,000 women--or 1 in every 8 American women--will be diagnosed with invasive breast cancer and 44,300 women will die from breast cancer; 2.6 million American women are living with breast cancer today. In my State, 20,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer and 5,000 will die or one every 27 minutes. San Francisco has among the highest incidence rates of breast cancer in the world.  After a mastectomy, patients must cope with pain from the surgery, with psychological loss--the trauma of an amputation--and with drainage tubes. These patients need medical care from trained professionals, medical care that they cannot provide themselves at home.  In the last 10 years, the length of overnight hospital stays for mastectomies has declined from 4 to 6 days to 2 to 3 days to, in some cases, no days. With the average cost of one day in the hospital at $930, if insurance plans refuse to cover a hospital stay, patients are forced to go home.                         Breast Reconstruction  Insurance plans also refuse to cover breast reconstruction. Our bill requires coverage. Breast reconstruction is an important followup part of breast cancer treatment and recovery. One study found that 84 percent of patients were denied insurance coverage for reconstruction of the removed breast. Commendably, my State has passed a law requiring coverage of breast reconstruction after a mastectomy. However, we need a national standard, covering all insurance policies.                        Second Opinions Covered  Another important feature of our bill is insurance coverage of second opinions for all cancers. The news of possible cancer is traumatic. It is a dreaded fear that we all live with daily. For this life-threatening disease for which there is no cure, more information is better than less. Expert advice is needed to make all-important decisions. I believe it is reasonable to encourage people to have a second consultation with a specialist, by requiring insurance plans to cover second opinions.  Patients often need specialty care. A December 1996 study reported in the New England Journal of Medicine found that specialty care improves the outcome of heart attack patients. This should come as no surprise. Specialists are knowledgeable about their field. A California doctor pointed out that nonspecialists may order a ``battery of unnecessary and sometimes invasive and risky examinations'' for patients. Thus, incentives that discourage the use of specialists or referrals to specialists, can end up costing the insurance plan more--instead of saving money.                        No Financial Incentives  Finally, our bill prohibits insurance plans from including financial or other incentives to influence the care a doctor provides, similar to a law passed by the California legislature last year. Many physicians have complained that insurance plans include financial bonuses or other incentives for cutting patient visits or for not referring patients to specialists. Our bill bans financial incentives linked to how a doctor provides care. Our intent is to restore medical decisionmaking to health care.  For example, a California physician wrote me, ``Financial incentives under managed care plans often remove access to pediatric specialty care.'' A June 1995 report in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute cited the suit filed by the husband of a 34-year-old California woman who died from colon cancer, claiming that HMO incentives encouraged her physicians not to order additional tests that could have saved her life.  Our bill tries to restore professional medical decisionmaking to medical providers, those whom we trust to take care of us. It should not take an act of Congress to guarantee good health care, but unfortunately that is where we are today.  I hope my colleagues will join us in enacting this bill, an important protection for millions of Americans who face the fear and the reality of cancer every day.                                 ______                                       By
