She is now in the third week of her hunger strike, and her health has seriously declined. An agreement between the Spanish and Moroccan governments was reportedly reached on Friday, but it fell through at the last minute and Ms. Haidar remains at the Lanzarote Airport.  Given this dire situation and the damage it is causing to efforts to resume good-faith negotiations on the future status of the Western Sahara, I want to repeat my appeal to the Moroccan authorities to reinstate Ms. Haidar's passport and allow her to return home to her family.  Morocco and the United States are friends and allies. The denial of citizenship and forcible exile of Ms. Haidar is inconsistent with international human rights norms to which Morocco is a signatory and will accomplish nothing positive. It also raises the question, as do the recent arrests of other Sahrawi activists, of whether the United Nations' mandate in Western Sahara should be expanded to include human rights monitoring. I believe the State Department should seriously review this issue when the UN mission's term comes up for extension in the Security Council in April.  There is still time, but it is running out, to resolve this issue in a manner that serves Morocco's interests and protects Ms. Haidar's rights.                          ____________________
