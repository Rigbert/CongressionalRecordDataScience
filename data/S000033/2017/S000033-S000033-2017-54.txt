 President, this is not a bad budget bill. It is a horrific budget bill, an extremely cruel bill, and the most unfair budget ever presented in the modern history of our country.  At a time of massive income and wealth inequality, this budget provides $1.9 trillion in tax breaks for the top 1 percent. At a time when millions of working families are struggling to keep their heads above water, this budget cuts Medicaid by $1 trillion. Fifteen million Americans could lose their health insurance.  This is a budget that poll after poll shows the American people do not want. Let us defeat it.
