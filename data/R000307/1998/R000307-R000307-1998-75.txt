I just want to point out that after every sanction, after every embargo, after every hindrance to every export program that we have had, we have had hearing after hearing after hearing in the House Agriculture Committee. I was privileged to be the chairman of that committee for 2 years. I have attended more hearings, more discussions, more farm meetings, been to more farm organization resolution meetings in State after State, to do something about a clear, comprehensive export policy that wards off these very counterproductive embargoes--and is simply misdirected. We have ample, ample evidence that this does not work.  I am on the sanctions task force. I went to the first meeting. We have taken some rifleshot reforms here that are sorely needed right now. It doesn't take away from the sanctions task force and their overall approach, to see if Senator Lugar's bill is appropriate, or Senator Dodd's bill, Senator Biden, Senator Hagel, myself--to look back on sanctions. That is the appropriate agenda in regard to the task force. But I can assure the Senator, in terms of voluminous hearings ad nauseum, because of the hurt it has caused in farm  country that we have had ample hearings.  I didn't ask the Senator a question, except to say I truly appreciate him yielding. I will cease and desist at this point.
