Speaker, September 2003 brings with it the 25th anniversary of the Eleanor M. Kahle Senior Center in our district. Starting life as the West Toledo Senior Center, it was renamed in 1995 upon the passing of its founder and guiding light, Mrs. Eleanor Kahle of Toledo, who passed from this life at the age of 78 years young on August 13, 1995.  In fact, a recognition of the senior center's milestone cannot be made without a tribute to its original inspiration: Eleanor Kahle, Polish-American by heritage, began her life on September 10, 1916, in what was then the small community of Sylvania outside of the city of Toledo. At the time of her death, she had become a citizen of the world. In all of the careers of her life--widowed wife and mother of six children, pastoral associate in the Roman Catholic Church, executive director of the West Toledo Senior Center, and elected official in the city of Toledo--Eleanor Kahle forged new ground. She delighted in the achievements of her sons and family. A devoted woman of the church, she became the first woman to serve as a pastoral associate, and essentially rose to the highest-ranking woman in the U.S. Roman Catholic Church at that time. In 1987, at the age of 70 when most people would not dream of making such a major change in their life, Eleanor Kahle began her stellar political career as an elected official, winning a seat on Toledo's city council, and eventually was elected the city's vice mayor. This work led to her involvement in Sister Cities International. Eleanor Kahle was a woman who drank deeply from life's cup. She was always planning, always working toward unmet horizons.  In 1977, at the suggestion of Eleanor Kahle, a group of people in West Toledo got together to determine the needs of the area's 17,000 seniors. Representatives from fourteen different service and church groups ``passed the hat'' and collected $12.47. On September 12, 1978, thirty founders ratified a Constitution, and West Toledo Senior People Inc. was born. They began to plan a center dedicated to meeting the needs of seniors in the neighborhoods of West Toledo. Under the Older Americans Act, such ``multi-purpose centers'' offered nutritional meals, learning opportunities, invigorating activities, and supportive services to elders in communities all across our Nation. Despite tremendous opposition, West Toledo Senior People doggedly pursued the creation of a senior citizens center. That dream became a reality in 1979 with the birth of the thriving West Toledo Senior Center in the renovated Willys Park Shelter House. Over the following year, 620 volunteers put in nearly 5,000 hours to make the shelter house the home of the West Toledo Senior Center. Eleanor Kahle was the center's first director, leading its growth until her retirement in 1993. Today that center stands, hundreds of seniors strong, housed in a large, expanded, pleasant building, as a true legacy to its founding members.  Immediately, the West Toledo Senior Center made its reputation as an active, involved, savvy group of people dedicated to making life better not only for themselves but seniors as a whole and our community at large. For many years the West Toledo Senior Center was the largest in Toledo. Its members include people from every walk of life, multiple generations, and all corners of West Toledo. It is truly a neighborhood center, and all who enter are immediately swept up into activity, delight, and camaraderie. The center has weathered difficult times as well, as founding members and original activists aged, passed on, and a new crop of leaders emerged to direct the center in the 21st century. Even as its founders pass into memory, the Eleanor M. Kahle Senior Center retains their light, and it continues to be a beacon in our community.  I join with the center's long time members and friends as we look back on a fruitful first 25 years, remembering old friends, special times, and inspiring moments. Yet, none will rest on the center's history nor the accomplishment of those who brought it to life, nurtured it, saw it through growing pains, and guide it into maturity. Rather, we cherish the first quarter century and look forward toward the bright horizon of tomorrow.                          ____________________
