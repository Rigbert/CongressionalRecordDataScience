 President, on another matter, last week Congress passed legislation to reauthorize the FAA, including its authority to collect and spend money for repairs and replacement parts for our air traffic control system. I am proud that we worked together to get this bill over the finish line. Now the FAA can continue to play a critical role in the Federal Government's response to the powerful hurricanes that have hit our country.                          ____________________
