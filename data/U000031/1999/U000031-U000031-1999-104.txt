Speaker, I rise today to join my colleague and friend, Rep. Anna Eshoo, in introducing important consumer protection legislation. This legislation addresses the safety of medical devices which are designed to be used once but which are reprocessed for further use.  In correspondence to Rep. Eshoo, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ``agrees that the reuse of disposable medical devices and devices labeled for a single use is a very important public health issue.'' The agency further indicates that cleaning and sterilizing these devices can be very difficult and that material properties and device performance can be affected by resterilization. Yet single use device reprocessors, which may be companies specializing in this practice or hospitals or other health care facilities, are unregulated. They are not required to register with the FDA or to provide convincing evidence that the processes they use are appropriate and that the reprocessed devices are safe and effective.  Our legislation would correct this loophole in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act by requiring single use device reprocessors to register with the FDA and to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of reprocessed devices. The bill will also require device users to obtain informed patient consent for the use of the device and establish a system whereby the safety and effectiveness of the devices when actually used in patient care may be tracked.  I urge my colleagues to join me supporting this important consumer protection measure.                          ____________________
