Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Madam Speaker, I rise today to support the resolution authored by Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Doc Hastings, and the entire State of Washington delegation.  The Grand Coulee Dam is the largest concrete structure ever built in the United States, with enough concrete to build a sidewalk around the Earth twice. The dam helped us win World War II by providing much needed electricity to build fighter planes and naval ships. The dam was also constructed to provide flood control, recreation and irrigation.                              {time}  1345  Today, it serves over 600,000 acres of irrigated cropland which feeds consumers nationwide and around the world.  As you know, we have major energy problems in this Nation. The Grand Coulee Dam is an example of what our country has done right. It's a shining beacon of clean, renewable, domestic energy. In 2006, the dam provided22,000 gigawatts of emission-free hydroelectricity. This translates into the reduction of 18 million tons of carbon dioxide, into 55,000 tons of sulfur dioxide and into 44,000 tons of nitrogen oxide.  Without this clean form of energy, 36.4 barrels of fuel oil, 10.7 million tons of coal or 223 billion cubic feet of natural gas will have to be used to keep the lights on. In fact, Grand Coulee is so environmentally friendly that the NBC Today Show focused solely on the dam as part of the Earth Day broadcast.  Despite the consensus that hydropower is clean, renewable and emissions-free, the Democrat leadership continues to exclude long-term hydropower resources, such as the Grand Coulee Dam, as part of its proposed renewable portfolio standard. This is logic-free given the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions that I just mentioned. We hope the Democrats come to their senses and see the reality that large hydropower sources should be counted as a renewable resource in future bills.  Madam Speaker, this resolution couldn't be brought up at a better time. I strongly support the 75th anniversary of the Grand Coulee Dam.  I reserve the balance of my time.
