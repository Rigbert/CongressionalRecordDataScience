 President, I join with my colleagues in expressing my strong support for the Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001, legislation of which I am an original cosponsor.  Popularly known as the ``Hate Crimes Prevention Act,'' this legislation would expand current federal protections against hate crimes based on race, religion, and national origin; amend the criminal code to cover hate crimes based on gender, sexual orientation, and disability; authorize grants for State and local programs designed to combat and prevent hate crimes;and enable the federal government to assist State and local law enforcement in investigating and prosecuting hate crimes.  While past efforts to enact this legislation have received strong bipartisan support, we have not been able to get it to the President's desk for his consideration. We must now work to ensure that this legislation is not simply supported, but actually passed and signed into law by the President.  This important legislation would enhance current hate crimes law and enable the federal government to offer assistance to states and localities in investigating and prosecuting bias-motivated crimes. Even with the strides we have made in combating hate crimes thus far, these crimes are still frequently under-reported and therefore go unprosecuted.  In California, I have seen, first-hand, the devastating impact these crimes have on victims, their families and their communities. Hate crimes divide neighborhoods and breed a sense of mistrust and fear within communities. This is why I have long supported legislation aimed at protecting citizens from crimes based on races, ethnicity, religion, gender, disability, or sexual orientation.  Prior to 1990, while we knew that hate crimes existed, we had no tools to measure the number of instances in which such crimes were committed. In 1990, Congress enacted the Hate Crimes Statistics Act. Because of this law, we are now able to quantify the extent of the problem. What we found was disturbing. For the first time, data was collected and analyzed on the incidence of hate crimes. In 1991, the first year after the Act took effect, 4,588 hate crimes were reported nationwide. In 1998, the last year for which we have statistics, that number rose to 7,755. These statistics provide federal and state law enforcement officials the tools to recognize the problems particular to their communities and have encouraged many to come up with solutions.  In 1993, I sponsored the Hate Crimes Sentencing Enhancement Act in 1993, which was subsequently signed into law as part of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. This act increased penalties for hate crimes targeting individuals because of their race, color, religion, national origin, gender, disability or sexual orientation.  While current hate crime laws help us better understand the problem and penalize those who would resort to such violent acts, these laws do not extend to the thousands of people who are victimized because of their gender, sexual orientation or disability. Nor are they broad enough to help those who were not engaging in such federally protected activities as attending school, or voting, when they were victimized.  In New Jersey, for example, a mentally disabled man was tortured by eight different people at a party. The man was burned with cigarettes, beaten, choked, and then left alone in the wilderness. Investigators found that this man was tortured only because of his disability. This was the third time this man had been attacked at a party.  Just recently, my staff met with a constituent who is a teacher at a Beverly Hills high school. The teacher expressed concern about the safety of gay students, many of whom had been targeted and attacked by other students on account of their sexual orientation. She felt that teachers like herself did all they could to protect the students while they were on school property. She feared for their safety, however, once the students were off school grounds. Even within the school, the teacher, explained, some officials did little to create an environment of tolerance and mutual respect for the students. As a result, the bias-motivated acts committed against them often went unreported, whether they took place in the school or within their communities.  My constituent's appeal for help on behalf of her young students amplifies the need to send a strong message of mutual tolerance and respect to our youngsters. Nearly two-thirds of these crimes are committed by our nation's youth and young adults. In many ways, reinforcing the strength of our diverse nation must begin with our youth.  As these stories illustrate, the perpetrators of hate crimes have no respect for boundaries. They are neither confined to any one region of the country, nor any one age group. The perpetrators of these crimes target individuals not because of what the victims have, or what they have done, but for who they are. Hate crimes are not like other crimes of violence. Their impact is pervasive.  Opponents of hate crimes legislation argue that these crimes are no different from any other crime; that they should be treated like other crimes of violence. Research by the American Psychological Association, APA, suggest otherwise. According to the APA, hate crime victims and their communities are often left with psychological wounds that run deeper and take significantly longer to heal than the wounds of victims of non-bias related crimes.  Much like victims of non-bias related crimes, victims of hate crimes are likely to exhibit symptoms of depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, high levels of anger, and a decreased sense of control. Unlike victims of non-bias related crimes, however, hate crime victims experience psychological after-effects at a much higher level. According to the APA, hate crime victims need ``as much as five years to overcome the emotional distress of the incident,'' compared with ``victims of non-bias crimes who experience a drop off in crime-related psychological problems within two years of the crime.'' The financial costs for mental health and medical treatment following an attack only add to the psychological stress of the victim.  Hate crimes pose a very real threat to the social health of the community. Individuals who live in communities where hate crimes have occurred often experience an increased sense of fear and intimidation. They also tend to feel a heightened sense of vulnerability and are much less likely to report such crimes should they occur again, for fear of retaliation. Hate crimes also breed mistrust within the community. Members of the victimized groups are likely to believe that law enforcement agencies are biased against their group and, that when needed, the law enforcement community will not respond.  In essence, hate crimes have been shown to produce deep psychological wounds in the victim. They engender a sense of disunity and division within the community, which undermines the basic tenets on which this nation was founded. As a country that prides itself on its diversity, our nation cannot continue to withstand these acts of hatred and intolerance. No individual or group should be targeted for violence and no such act of violence should go unpunished.  No American should have to live in fear because of his or her perceived race, sexual orientation, ethnicity or disability. No American should be afraid to walk down the street for fear of a gender-motivated attack. No American should be deterred by intimidation from living in the home of his or her choice. And certainly, no American should be deterred from reporting a hate-based crime because they are afraid that the police lack the will or the resources necessary to protect them.  This legislation is not only overdue, it is necessary for the safety and well being of millions of Americans. It is necessary for our National unity.  Certainly, none of us in this body would condone an act of brutality based on an individual's race, religion, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity or gender. None of us would be willing to send the message that today, basic civil rights protections do not extend to every American, but only to a few and under certain circumstances.  By introducing this legislation today, we are sending a signal that we are unwilling to turn a blind eye to this epidemic of hate that threatens to envelop our Nation. I urge my colleagues to join in this message by supporting the enactment of ``The Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act of 2001.''                                 ______                                       By
