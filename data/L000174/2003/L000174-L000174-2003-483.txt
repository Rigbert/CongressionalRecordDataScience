President, the Senate has confirmed 127 judges nominated by President Bush, including 100 in the 17 months in which Democrats comprised the Senate majority. Twenty-seven have now been confirmed in the other 12 months in which Republicans have controlled the confirmation process under President Bush. This total of 127 judges confirmed for President Bush is more confirmations than the Republicans allowed President Clinton in all of 1995, 1996 and 1997--the 3 full years of his last term. In those 3 years, the Republican leadership in the Senate allowed only 111 judicial nominees to be confirmed, which included only 18 circuit court judges. We have already exceeded that total by 14 percent and the circuit court total by 33 percent before Memorial Day and with 7 months remaining this year.  The fact is that when Democrats became the Senate majority in the summer of 2001, we inherited 110 judicial vacancies. Over the next 17 months, despite constant criticism from the administration, the Senate proceeded to confirm 100 of President Bush's nominees, including several who were divisive and controversial, several who had mixed peer review ratings from the ABA and at least one who had been rated not qualified. Despite the additional 40 vacancies that arose, we reduced judicial vacancies to 60, a level below that termed ``full employment'' by Senator Hatch. Since the beginning of this year, in spite of the Republicans' fixation on the President's most controversial nominations, we have worked hard to reduce judicial vacancies even further. As of today, the number of judicial vacancies has been reduced to 44 and is the lowest it has been in 13 years. That is lower than at any time during the entire 8 years of the Clinton administration. We have already reduced judicial vacancies from 110 to 44, in 2 years. We have reduced the vacancy rate from 12.8 percent to 5.1 percent, the lowest it has been in the last two decades. With some cooperation from the administration think of the additional progress we could be making.  If the Senate did not confirm another judicial nominee all year and simply adjourned today, we would have treated President Bush more fairly and would have acted on more of his judicial nominees than Republicans did for President Clinton in 1995 to 1997. In addition, the 44 vacancies on the Federal courts around the country are significantly lower than the 80 vacancies Republicans left at the end of 1997. Of course, the Senate is not adjourning for the year and Chairman Hatch continues to hold hearings for Bush judicial nominees at a rate of between two and four times as many as he did for President Clinton's.  Unfortunately, far too many of this President's nominees raise serious concerns about whether they will be fair judges to all parties on all issues. Those types of nominees should not be rushed through the process. I invite the President to work with us and to nominate more mainstream individuals with proven records and bipartisan support.                          ____________________
