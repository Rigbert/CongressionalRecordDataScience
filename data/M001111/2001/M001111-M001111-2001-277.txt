 Stevens, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mr. Breaux) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation:                            S. Con. Res. 47       Whereas the United States has been actively engaged as a      member of the International Olympic Committee (in this      resolution referred to as the ``IOC''), which was formed in      1894 to implement the goals of modern Olympism;       Whereas the Olympic Charter for the IOC contains      fundamental principles of modern Olympism, including--       (1) ``Olympism is a philosophy of life, exalting and      combining in a balanced whole the qualities of body, will and      mind. Blending sport with culture and education, Olympism      seeks to create a way of life based on the joy found in      effort, the educational value of good example and respect for      universal fundamental ethical principles'';       (2) ``The goal of Olympism is to place everywhere sport at      the service of the harmonious development of man, with a view      to encouraging the establishment of a peaceful society      concerned with the preservation of human dignity.'';       (3) ``The goal of the Olympic Movement is to contribute to      building a peaceful and better world by educating youth      through sport practised without discrimination of any kind      and in the Olympic spirit, which requires mutual      understanding with a spirit of friendship, solidarity and      fair play''; and       (4) ``The activity of the Olympic movement . . . reaches      its peak with the bringing together of athletes of the world      at the great sports festival, the Olympic Games'';       Whereas the IOC has adopted a Code of Ethics that      recognizes the dignity of the individual as one of its      primary guarantees;       Whereas to safeguard the dignity of participants, the IOC's      rules require nondiscrimination on ``the basis of race, sex      ethnic origin, religion, philosophical or political opinion,      marital status or other grounds'';       Whereas the IOC's Code of Ethics specifically prohibits any      ``practice constituting any form of physical or mental      injury'' and ``all forms of harassment against participants,      be it physical, mental, professional or sexual'';       Whereas an integral part of the IOC's Olympic Charter, Code      of Ethics, and rules requires the following of strict      guidelines in selecting a host city for an Olympic Games;       Whereas included in the IOC's rules are comprehensive and      precise selection criteria and methods by which to assess a      candidate's application;       Whereas the IOC's Evaluations Commission evaluates and      compares, among the candidates, 11 different areas of site      analysis, including government support and public opinion,      critical infrastructure availability, finance, security, and      experience;       Whereas the IOC has made environmental conservation the      third pillar of Olympism, with the other pillars being sport      and culture;       Whereas the IOC requires host cities to conduct an      environmental impact statement, consult with environmental      organizations, and implement an environmental action plan for      the Olympic Games;       Whereas a primary goal of the IOC is world peace and      understanding, and, in pursuit of the goal, the IOC strives      to maintain a separation of sports from international      politics;       Whereas the IOC's Olympic Charter, Code of Ethics, and      rules consistently address the IOC's quest to separate      politics and sports;       Whereas Rule 9 of the IOC's Olympic Charter states that      ``the Olympic Games are competitions between athletes in      individual or team events and not between countries'';       Whereas new members of the IOC take an oath upon membership      that avers in part ``to comply with the Code of Ethics, to      keep myself free from any political or commercial      influence'';       Whereas the IOC's Code of Ethics states that ``the Olympic      parties shall neither give nor accept instructions to vote or      intervene in a given manner with the organs of the IOC'';       Whereas the IOC is involved in humanitarian affairs through      its involvement with the United Nations High Commissioner for      Refugees, the United Nations Development Programme,      International Labour Organization, and the International      Committee of the Red Cross; and       Whereas following the issuance of the Report of the Special      Bid Oversight Commission, the ``Mitchell Commission'', both      the United States Olympic Committee and the IOC ratified a      number of reforms regarding the selection of Olympic Games      host cities: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives      concurring), That Congress--       (1) recognizes the IOC for the Committee's--       (A) work to bring about understanding of individuals and      different cultures;       (B) focus on protecting the civil rights of its      participants;       (C) rules of intolerance against discriminatory acts; and       (D) goal of promoting world peace through sports;       (2) encourages members of the IOC from the United States to      abide by all rules of the IOC when considering and voting for      host cities for future Olympic Games;       (3) recognizes that any government action designating a      preference or displeasure with any Olympic Games candidate      host city is inconsistent with the IOC's Olympic Charter,      Code of Ethics, and rules; and       (4) endorses the concept of the Olympic Games being a      competition between athletes in individual or team events and      not between countries.
