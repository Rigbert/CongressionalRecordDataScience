Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I wish to state that, as I listened to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Coburn) and his desire to try to protect life, I think that his amendment and the words of his amendment, in fact, do not do that. So there is not a disagreement with the objective, but rather the means to get there.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from California (Mr. Waxman).
