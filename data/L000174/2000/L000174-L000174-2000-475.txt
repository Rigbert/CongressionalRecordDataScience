President, I hope today we will close the chapter of what has not been the greatest light and the greatest time of the Senate--close this chapter of 4 years of delay and harassment of this wonderful man and confirm him today.  Mr. President, how much time remains for the Senator from Vermont?  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). There are 33 minutes remaining.
