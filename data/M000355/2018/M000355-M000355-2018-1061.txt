 President, look, this is a big test for the Senate. There is broad bipartisan agreement that we need to quit doing Omnibus appropriations bills. Chairman Shelby and Senator Leahy have gotten not only the committee in a good place, but Senator Alexander has handled this bill in such a way that we have had broad cooperation in getting it across the floor so as to get it into conference and actually make a law--the three appropriations bills.  There is no doubt about it--I can't find many people on this side of the aisle who approve of the previous administration's waters of the United States regulation. It is on its way to the ash heap of history right now under this administration.  This is not about waters of the United States or about whether we are for it or against it; this is about whether we want to get away from annual Omnibus appropriations bills, and this is the first test here. We have a minibus consisting of three bills, and we have had widespread cooperation to get it across the floor. This amendment needs to be tabled because this is not the right place to offer it.  I will be joining the senior Senator from Tennessee, the chairman of the Energy and Water Development Subcommittee, in tabling this amendment. Make no mistake about it--it is not because I support the waters of the United States but because that is being taken care of, and we want to have regular order and the passage of appropriations bills this year.         Amendment No. 3021, as Modified, to Amendment No. 2911  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I call up Lee amendment No. 3021, as modified, to Alexander amendment No. 2911.
