I did mention the Hartford Courier newspaper that has been aggressive. I knew the Senator was aware of this and actively concerned because his State of Connecticut, which probably is suffering, is in the top three or four States in the United States with problems.  I suggest there is a fourth leg of the stool and that is for trial lawyers to get this work out.
