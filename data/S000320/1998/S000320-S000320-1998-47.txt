 President, I rise today to honor Mr. Ernest A. Young on the occasion of his retirement from the Department of the Army. Throughout his 40 years of Federal Service, culminating in his current position as Deputy to the Commanding General, U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command, Mr. Young has distinguished himself time and time again as an individual of the utmost integrity, capability, and foresight.  Mr. Young began his career as an Army civilian employee in 1958, as a technical program specialist. He held managerial positions for various missile programs, including the very successful HAWK missile. Twenty-three years later, in September 1981, he was appointed to the Senior Executive Service where he held several key command and staff positions with the U.S. Army Missile Command.  Mr. Young continued to rise through the ranks, and in June 1993, he was the first civilian to be selected as the Deputy to the Commanding General of the U.S. Army Missile Command (MICOM). In this position, Mr. Young was responsible for achieving all of the command's missions. Due in large part to his leadership, MICOM maintained a high state of readiness by adhering to procurement schedules and successfully executing weapons development programs despite the enormous challenge posed by shrinking annual defense budgets. Mr. Young's dedication to efficiency was recognized as MICOM became the first major subordinate command of the Army Materiel Command to be designated as a Reinvention Laboratory. Though faced with funding shortages, his skills also enabled him to implement several human resource initiatives that obviated the need for a reduction in force during his tenure as Deputy to the MICOM Commander.  Mr. Young, however, may best be remembered for his personal attention to the implementation of the 1995 Base Realignment and Closure decision to consolidate the U.S. Army Aviation and Troop Command (ATCOM) with MICOM at Redstone Arsenal. The fact that 55 percent of ATCOM's aviation managerial workforce successfully moved to Redstone serves as a testament to Mr. Young's leadership and professionalism during this transition.  Since the formation of the Aviation and Missile Command, Mr. Young has continued in his role as Deputy to the Commanding General. While the AMCOM formally merged the various aspects of aviation and missile program management into a single commodity command, Mr. Young diligentlyworked to integrate the aviation and missile cultures. He continued to work closely with the Commanding General to ensure the uninterrupted accomplishment of the procurement, readiness, and materiel development missions and functions of the command.  In addition to Mr. Young's exemplary career, his frequent participation in seminars and workshops designed for senior government executives demonstrated his continual desire to better himself and improve his technical and managerial capabilities. Moreover, Mr. Young's involvement in such noteworthy associations as the American Society of Military Comptrollers, American Institute of Physics, Society of Logistics Engineers, the American Society for Public Administration and Rotary Club, exemplify his steadfast commitment to professional improvement and civic duty.  Mr. President, for 40 years, Ernest Young has been an asset to the U.S. Army, Alabama, and the nation. On behalf of the United States Senate and a grateful nation, I thank Mr. Young for his dedicated service as he closes one chapter in his life and begins another.                          ____________________
