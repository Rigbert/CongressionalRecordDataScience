 Chairman, it seems to me that we are missing a fundamental point here. To talk about opening up Japan for American products is something that we all agree on. That means products are being manufactured in the United States, employing American workers and sold in Japan. That is what we want. That is not what OPIC is about. OPIC is giving the largest, most profitable corporations in America help in setting up factories abroad.
