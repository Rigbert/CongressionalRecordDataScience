President, I am proud to be a co-sponsor of the Dodd-Kennedy child-care amendment to the Republican leader's welfare bill. This amendment backs up the work requirements in this bill with the child care assistance necessary to meet them.  Caring for our children is not an issue that affects only the poor--all working parents need child care. As we debate the issue of how we are going to change the dynamic of the welfare system, it is absolutely crucial that we do all we can to protect children.  We are trying to agree on the best way to get welfare parents, generally single mothers, into jobs and how to keep them there. A single mother should not be forced to choose between properly caring for her children and going to work. And if parents are not working, they cannot support their families. If my wife and I wanted to see a movie, but were unable to find a babysitter for our three children when they were young, then we did not see the movie. How can we expect parents to work when there is no one to care for their children? We need to be realistic in our effort to reform the welfare system.  Welfare reform is not only about adults--it is about children who live in poor families.
