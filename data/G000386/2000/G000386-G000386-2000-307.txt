 President, today I am introducing legislation on behalf of myself and the senior Senator from Nevada, Mr. Reid, to clarify that water and sewage service laterals are included in the definition of contributions in aid of construction (CIAC). The bill clarifies current law by specifically stating that ``customer service fees'' are CIAC. It maintains current treatment of service charges for stopping and starting service (not CIAC). Because this is a clarification of current law, the effective date for the bill is as if included in the original legislation, which is section 1613(a) of the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996.  The need for this legislation is brought about because the Department of Treasury has issued proposed regulations to provide guidance on the definition of CIAC. Despite the fact that Congress specifically removed language concerning ``customer services fees'' in its amendment in 1996, the Department added the language back into the proposed regulation specifying that such fees are not CIAC. They then defined the term very broadly to include service laterals, which traditionally and under the most common state law treatment would be considered CIAC.  The Senator from Nevada and I, along with many of our colleagues here in this chamber, worked hard over the course of a number of years to restore the pre-1986 Act tax treatment for water and sewage CIAC. In 1996, we succeeded in passing our legislation. It was identical to pre-1986 law with three exceptions. Two of the changes were made in response to a Treasury Department request. The third removed the language dealing with ``service connection fees'' primarily because of potential confusion resulting from the ambiguity of the term. The sponsors of the legislation were concerned that the IRS would use this ambiguity to exclude a portion of what the state regulators consider CIAC.  As part of our efforts, we developed a revenue raiser in cooperation with the industry to make up any revenue loss due to our legislation, including the three changes. This revenue raiser extended the life, and changed the method, for depreciating water utility property from 20 year accelerated to 25-year straight-line depreciation. As a consequence of this sacrifice by the industry, our CIAC change made a net $274 million contribution toward deficit reduction.  It is my belief that the final revenue estimate done by the Joint Committee on Taxation on the restoration of CIAC included all property treated as CIAC by the industry regulators including specifically service laterals. In an October 11, 1995 letter to me, the Joint Committee on Taxation provided revenue estimates for the CIAC legislation. A footnote in this letter states, ``These estimates have been revisited to reflect more recent data.'' The industry had only recently supplied the committee with comprehensive data, which reflected total CIAC in the industry including service laterals.  I urge my fellow Senators to join with us in supporting this clarification of current law.                                 ______                                       By
