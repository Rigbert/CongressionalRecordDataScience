Madam Speaker, the most important task we face today is helping Americans get back to work. People stop me all over metro Atlanta and tell me how long they've been looking for work, how many applications they have filled out, how many resumes they have sent.  And with the unemployment rate for Iraq and Afghanistan veterans over 12 percent, Senator Tester's amendment is a good start. It is a necessary start. These are people who want to work, who need to work. They don't want a handout; they want a job.  These men and women put on that uniform to serve and protect our country. We can and must do more to honor their service. It is simply the right and good thing to do.  Now, I must say, Madam Speaker, that I strongly object to the Republican effort to stain a bipartisan bill with a partisan poison pill, making it more difficult for America's seniors to get private health insurance and Medicaid. It is not right, it is not fair, and it is not just.
