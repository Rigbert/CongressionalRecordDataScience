Speaker, as co-chairman of the Congressional Fire Service Institute I rise today to echo the sentiments of many of my colleagues in expressing my thanks and appreciation for all the firefighters who have worked so hard in battling the wildland fires in Florida.  The magnitude of the fires and the destruction they have caused is almost incomprehensible. In the last two months more than 500,000 acres in 67 counties have been burned by 200 separate fires. At least 367 homes and more than 33 businesses have been destroyed. Estimates are that it may take over 100 years for some of the burned acreage to return to normal. In short, Mr. Speaker, it has been a devastating disaster.  Thankfully, no lives have been lost. However, 95 people, mostly firefighters, have been injured. Many of the firefighters who are on the front lines are not even from Florida. Approximately 7000 first responders from 46 states have volunteered their time, effort and talent to help the people of Florida. From Maryland alone, over 200 firefighters left their homes and loved ones to battle fires that were threatening land they did not own and to protect people they have never met.  For anyone not familiar with the fire service it may sound amazing that firefighters from across the country would drop everything to help the people of Florida. However, it does not surprise me at all. In fire companies across the country firefighters do just that, day in and day out. They do not do it for money and they do not do it for fame. They do it because, Mr. Speaker, they are committed to bettering their community and serving their fellow citizens.  Mr. Speaker, in acknowledging their service, I would like to include in the Record a complete listing of all the Maryland firefighters who volunteered to battle the Florida wildfires.
