President, I rise today to recognize the 100th anniversary of CNA Insurance Co., whose headquarters are located in the city of Chicago in my home State of Illinois.  CNA is one of the Nation's largest insurance companies. It employs over 20,000 people nationwide, 6,000 of whom live and work in Illinois. It has offices in more than 100 cities and is represented by nearly 80,000 independent insurance agents across the country.  CNA has always prided itself on being an innovator in the insurance industry. When women began to enter the work force in the early 1900's, CNA was among the first to offer them accident and health coverage. CNA also met the concerns of farmers by developing a new product specifically tailored to their accident and health needs. CNA was one of the first companies to offer worker's compensation coverage and was one of the first to provide retirement income annuities for senior citizens before the establishment of Social Security.  CNA has also played a behind-the-scenes role in some of our Nation's most memorable events. CNA insured Presidential candidates Adlai Stevenson and Dwight Eisenhower against accidents during their campaigns in 1952 and insured President John F. Kennedy's inaugural festivities. It also insured the Beatles' 1965 Shea Stadium performance for the Ed Sullivan Show and the Apollo 16 astronauts' 1972 flight to the moon.  Mr. President, I ask to have printed in the Record a more detailed history of CNA that was recently prepared by the company and I would like to congratulate CNA for 100 years of insuring America. I hope that during the next 100 years, CNA continues its record of success and remains a leader in the insurance industry.  The material follows:           A Tribute to CNA in Celebration of Its Centennial                  CNA Stands for Commitment, 1897-1997                              introduction       CNA, one of the country's largest commercial insurance      groups, is celebrating one hundred years of commitment and      service to the American people both at home and abroad. Since      1897, whenever America has sought a sense of security, CNA      has been there, anticipating that need and forging its      reputation as an industry innovator. Railroad workers,      teachers, movie stars, athletes, even U.S. Presidents have      depended on CNA's protection against both expected risks and      unforeseen dangers.       Since its modest beginnings in Detroit, Michigan, with      $100,000 in capital stock and a $60,000 surplus, CNA has      become one of the largest property/casualty insurers in the      nation, with over $60 billion in assets. Originally operating      out of a two-room office with 15 employees, CNA today      occupies some 400 office sites in over 100 cities and employs      over 20,000 people nationwide. Now headquartered in Chicago,      CNA directly employs more than 6,000 people in Illinois      alone. Almost 80,000 agents currently represent CNA      throughout the United States, testament to the company's      successful alliance with independent agents.       CNA's exemplary accomplishment--a century culminating in      financial stability and preeminence in the industry--attests      to its history of astute leadership, integrity and commitment      to quality service.                              the founding       Collins Hubbard, CNA's founder, set the course of      perceptive leadership that has guided CNA to the top of the      insurance industry. Calling together several of his      colleagues, Hubbard proposed a company that would insure      America's working class against unexpected disasters. The      Continental Assurance Company of North America, as CNA was      then known, provided coverage with an innovative twist: both      accident and health insurance, at a time when most of its      contemporaries offered only accident coverage.       Focusing on railroad workers as its initial customer base,      CNA became the largest insurer in Michigan within two years      of its founding. Despite its rapid growth, the fledgling      company faced intense competition from other insurance      companies. In light of this, the company underwent two major      changes. First, it changed its name to the more forceful and      representative, Continental Casualty Company. Then, in      September 1900, the company merged with Metropolitan Accident      Company, a Chicago insurer, and moved its headquarters to      Chicago. This strategy catapulted the combined companies to      fifth among the nation's accident insurers.                     cna becomes an industry leader       Early in the 20th century, CNA distinguished itself as a      leader in the insurance industry by demonstrating the      capacity for discerning new markets and developing innovative      products. When women began to enter the work force, CNA was      among the first to provide them with accident and health      coverage. As agricultural production expanded, CNA devised      new products specifically geared to farmers' accident and      health concerns.       CNA reinforced its position at the forefront of the      industry in 1910 by expanding beyond accident and health into      different lines of insurance such as liability, auto      insurance and burglary. In 1911, the company entered the life      insurance field by forming the Continental Assurance Company.      In 1915, CNA began offering workers' compensation coverage as      factories employed more people to increase output for the      World War I effort.       Policies combining multiple lines of insurance proved      successful, particularly as automobiles--and accidents      involving automobiles--became commonplace. Motorist coverage      insured both the driver and any persons injured or property      damage.       The growth of an affluent American middle-class meant      increased incidents of theft. Property owners' concerns were      met by CNA's wide range of burglary insurance--protecting      against bank robberies, home break-ins and safe deposit box      theft.                        groups and associations       By the early 1920s, the flourishing company was operating      in every state and territory of the United States, as well as      every province in Canada. That decade also marked the      beginning of CNA's pioneering relationship with associations,      a relationship that has lasted until the present day and has      played a significant role in CNA's rise to the upper echelon      of insurance companies.       CNA is credited with the first teachers association group      policy, written for the Cleveland Teachers Association in      1921. CNA insured the American Society of Civil engineers in      1945, becoming the first insurer to successfully install a      group plan for a nationwide association. Teaming up with the      American Camping Association in the 1950s, CNA initiated an      educational campaign to promote camp safety and insure      campers. Camp insurance led to the formation of ``PONY,''      Protect Our Nation's Youth, a youth program offering medical      expense reimbursement from kindergarten through college.       CNA has also demonstrated unwavering commitment to the      nation's retirement-age population. In the 1930s, before      compulsory Social Security, the company was among the first      to offer retirement income annuities. by 1955, CNA had      developed the first group health plan for those over 65.      Originally conceived as a group medical insurance plan for      retired teachers associations, the plan evolved into ``Golden      65'', a policy offered directly to the individual. After the      implementation of Medicare in the summer of 1965, CNA      redesigned Golden 65 to complement the Medicare plan, while      other insurers exited the over-65 health insurance field.                    Dependability In Times of Crisis       Dependability in times of crisis is a CNA hallmark. The      company refused to exit the field of polio insurance at a      time when the nation was literally crippled by the rampant,      dreaded disease. CNA introduced its polio coverage the year      of the worse polio outbreak in two decades. It continued to      provide comprehensive and affordable polio coverage for the      duration of the epidemic.       The company's willingness to take on the challenge of even      the most unusual coverage request has marked its true      American spirit--bold, enterprising and innovative. Where      other companies see uninsurable risks, CNA sees      possibiities--a company trait that has ensured its success      and longevity in the insurance business. CNA has staunchly      stood behind Americans in all manner of pursuits and      ventures, these past 100 years.       CNA insured presidential hopefuls Adlai Stevenson and      Dwight Eisenhower against accidents during their campaign      trips in 1952. When John F. Kennedy was inaugurated as the      nation's 35th president, CNA provided liability coverage for      the ceremonial activities. In 1965, President Lyndon B.      Johnson asked CNA to write the bond for the train that stood      waiting in case emergency evacuation was necessary during      Martin Luther King's civil rights protest march to      Montgomery, Alabama. The 1968 Democratic Convention in      Chicago was covered by CNA's liability insurance.       A special CNA reinsurance policy covered the cancellation      or postponement of the 1965 Shea Stadium performance of the      Beatles for the Ed Sullivan show. The Apollo 16 astronauts      were insured in case of accidental death on their 1972 flight      to the moon.       Little League teams around the country have enjoyed CNA      protection since 1948, as have Indianapolis 500 drivers, pit      crews and race officials. The American athletes competing in      the 1952 Helsinki Olympic games were insured by CNA. Water      events at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics were covered by MOAC,      CNA's marine unit.                       CNA Cares About Community       CNA's commitment to its employees, its clients, and the      American people extends far beyond insurance. The company      encourages and subsidizes both employees and CNA leadership      in community projects. In the 1920's, the company sought to      enrich the lives of its employees through its Continental      Welfare Association which offered disability pensions, life      insurance and retirement pensions.       Later, during World War II, the employees reached out to      help in the war effort. CNA employees organized their own      chapter of the Red Cross, calling it the Continental Red      Cross. By the midpoint of the war, Continental employees had      invested $232,418 in war bonds.       Today, in more peaceful times, CNA and its employees have      dedicated time and resources toward the education of the      nation's youth. In the early 1980's, CNA sponsored Illinois'      first math contest. With the Chicago Urban League, the      Chicago Board of Education, and the Illinois Council of      Teachers of Mathematics CNA developed MATHCOUNTS, a model      math tutorial program. The program quickly garnered      nationwide attention. By 1984, MATHCOUNTS had evolved into      the country's first nationwide math contest boasting as      cosponsors the National Society of Professional Engineers,      the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, the National      Aeronautics and Space     Administration, and the U.S. Department of Education.       CNA's investment in the nation's future--its children--is      evident in CNA's involvement with the Leadership for Quality      Education, a coalition of business and civil leaders working      to improve the Chicago school system. OUt of this, CNA      created Project Participate, providing paid time off,      resources and training to employees wishing to run for      Chicago's Local School Councils. CNA has also adopted      Chicago's Mark Skinner School as part of the Chicago Board of      Education's Adopt-A-School Program.                               Conclusion       CNA stands for a century of commitment, stability and      financial strength. Entering the final years of the 10th      century, the company prepared for the 21st century in typical      CNA fashion--it acquired the Continental Insurance Company in      1995. This merger, the most significant property/casualty      insurance merger in the last 25 years, expanded CNA's scope--     elevating its presence worldwide, adding new specialty      operations and pooling the considerable talent and resources      of both companies.       As the new millennium approaches, unfathomable leaps in      technology, social transformations and economic upheaval are      as much a source of apprehension today as in 1897. CNA saw      the birth of a new century that brought with it several wars,      a severe economic depression, fantastic advances in modes of      travel and communication, social change and natural      disasters. It has met the challenges of the past 100 years      and stands poised for another century, confident of its      continued success based on its core values: commitment,      stability and financial strength.                          ____________________
