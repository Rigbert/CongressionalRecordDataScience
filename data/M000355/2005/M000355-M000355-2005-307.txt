 President, today, we will begin a period for the transaction of morning business for up to 1 hour. At approximately 10:45 a.m., we will resume consideration of the Department of Defense authorization bill. There are a number of pending amendments that were offered either on Friday or yesterday, and we expect to begin to schedule votes in relation to those amendments and any additional amendments that will be offered during today's session. Therefore, we expect rollcall votes throughout the day. We will complete work on the Defense bill either today or tomorrow.  This week, we will also consider any available appropriations conference reports that arrive from the House.
