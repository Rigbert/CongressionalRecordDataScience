Madam Chair, I rise today to offer an amendment to H.R. 803, which would ensure vital funding for workforce training programs utilized by Alaska Natives, Native Americans, and Native Hawaiians.  H.R. 803, as reported, contains a provision which establishes a 1 percent cap on the amount that each State can designate for Native employment and training grants out of their total funding allotment.  My amendment would instead require that each State provide exactly 1 percent for each program. This change is important because H.R. 803, as it currently stands, gives States the discretion to drastically reduce or virtually eliminate Native work-training funds.  Alaska Native, American Indian, and Native Hawaiian populations often rank at the bottom of labor-related categories like income, education, and unemployment rate. Since 1998, America's Native peoples have relied crucially on funding from the Workforce Investment Act to provide the necessary resources to educate their workforce to help reverse these trends. My amendment would guarantee that tribal funding continues.  I urge a ``yes'' vote on the amendment and reserve the balance of my time.
