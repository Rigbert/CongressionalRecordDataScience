Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to introduce a bill to expand Alaska Native contracting of Federal land management functions and activities and, promote hiring of Alaska Natives by the federal government within the State of Alaska.  This bill was developed in response to my request to the Alaska Federal of Natives at their retreat in August of 1998. Pursuant to the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, tribes are authorized to enter into contracts with the Department of the Interior to directly administer programs previously administered by that agency. Congress strongly advocated this change to allow tribes to provide direct and improved services to their members.  The bill entitled ``Alaska Federal Lands Management Demonstration Project'' would direct the Secretary of the Interior to enter into a demonstration project in fiscal years 2000 and 2001 with no less than six eligible Alaska Native tribes or tribal organizations to manage a conservation unit or other public land unit within the closest proximity of that tribal organization.  The bill further directs the Secretary to fully fund these demonstration projects in the same manner he would have funded the programs if they were still being managed by the Department of the Interior.  It has always been my strong belief that Alaska Natives can manage conservation units or national park systems units as well or even better than the federal government. Alaska Natives have demonstrated their reliance of the land, the conservation of its bounty and great respect for the cautious management of its resources to preserve for future generations. I believe that Alaska Natives should be given the opportunity to manage federal conservation units that are in close proximity to their own lands.  The Alaska regional non-profits worked long and hard to carefully draft a bill which would have the support of the Alaska Federation of Natives and all of the Alaska regional non-profits. I believe it is time that we authorize Alaska Native entities to manage federal conservation units in the manner consistent with lands that they have carefully preserved and utilized for thousands of years. This bill does exactly that.                          ____________________
