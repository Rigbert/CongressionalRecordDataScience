Speaker, this is the article I referred to in my one-minute speech this morning.                            (From USA Today)Millions Forgo Foreclosure Reviews (Homeowners Don't Have Much Time To                         Ask for Accuracy Checks)                           (By Julie Schmit)       Millions of homeowners who were in foreclosure in 2009 or      2010 could miss a chance to have their cases reviewed for      errors--and possible compensation--if they don't act by      Monday.       That's the deadline for eligible homeowners to request a      free review required by a settlement last year between      federal bank regulators and 14 mortgage servicers and their      affiliates. The deadline has been extended three times due to      poor response from homeowners.       More than 4 million notices were mailed a year ago      informing homeowners of their right to a review, but only      356,000 had asked for one by Dec. 13, according to the Office      of the Comptroller of the Currency.       Compensation could range from hundreds of dollars to more      than $100,000, the OCC has said. It is overseeing the      settlement with the Federal Reserve.       Requests must be submitted at      independentforeclosurereview.com or be postmarked no later      than Monday, the OCC says. Answers to questions can be found      on the website or by calling 888-952-9105.       ``The (response) numbers are not terribly impressive,''      says Bruce Mirken of the Greenlining Institute, a consumer      advocacy group.       Greenlining, like other consumer groups, says borrowers may      still not be aware of the review opportunity.       Notification materials--including the 4 million letters--     may have been ignored because they were written in legal      jargon, were hard to read and looked too much like those used      in foreclosure scams, says James Can, a senior policy fellow      with the Opportunity Agenda, a non-partisan think tank. A      Government Accountability Office report in June echoed those      concerns.       The settlement followed a federal probe in which regulators      found significant weaknesses in foreclosure processes,      including improper foreclosure document preparation.       To meet regulators' deadlines, the GAO noted that servicers      had just 60 days to develop outreach materials. That didn't      leave time to test them with focus groups, one servicer      representative told the GAO.       About 95% of the letters were successfully delivered, the      OCC has said.       The reviews are intended to address a wide range of      foreclosure errors, including excessive fees, wrongly denied      loan modifications, misapplied payments or wrongful      foreclosures. Borrower restitution will vary by case and      financial harm, the OCC says. It's provided no cost estimate      to servicers. No one has yet received restitution, OCC      spokesman William Grassano says.       The requested reviews are in addition to 159,000 reviews      being done, as part of the same settlement, by consultants      hired by the servicers, Grassano says.       The Monday deadline should be lifted and review requests      should be allowed as needed, the community groups say,      especially since more recent outreach efforts have been more      consumer friendly.       The reviews are separate from a $25 billion settlement,      reached between five servicers and, state and federal      officials, that's also meant to address past foreclosure      abuses.                          ____________________
