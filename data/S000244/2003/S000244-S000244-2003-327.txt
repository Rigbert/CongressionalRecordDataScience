Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support House Resolution 180, honoring corrections officers and employees for the good work they do each and every day. This resolution passed the Committee on the Judiciary unanimously, and it is an appropriate expression of congressional support for this critical aspect of our criminal justice system.  These men and women work each day to protect society from the real threat of criminal activity. They risk their lives ensuring that we are safe. They maintain peace and order in a dangerous place, while at the same time ensuring the needs of one of the most difficult groups in society are addressed. It is not often that we get the opportunity to thank them for the good work they do.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in fully supporting this resolution.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
