Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of the citizens of Atlanta to mourn the loss and celebrate the life of Brandon Searcy. Brandon Searcy was just 8 years old. He was the victim of a senseless and hideous crime.  Mr. Speaker, what kind of world do we live in when an 8-year-old child is stalked and preyed upon, when it is no longer safe for a child to walk a block to a school bus stop?  Brandon Searcy was a special child, a gifted child. He was the light and the joy of his mother Kimala Searcy. He loved school and he loved the Lord, and he was dedicated to both.  Brandon was a member of the First Norman Grove Baptist Church in Scottsdale, GA. He often took notes during the pastor's sermons, and he and sister, Algerica, would sing with joy their favorite song, ``Shake the Devil Off.''  Brandon was a second grade student at Cleveland Avenue Elementary School where he excelled as an honor student on the principal's list. He loved to play baseball and his ambition was to go to college and then become a professional baseball player.  Mr. Speaker, Brandon Searcy's favorite passage from the Bible was the 23d Psalm. It reads in part, ``Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.''  Brandon Searcy, Mr. Speaker, will surely dwell in the house of the Lord forever. He will be remembered and he will be missed by all who knew him and many who never had the good fortune. God bless Brandon Searcy.                          ____________________
