 Speaker, for the benefit of my colleagues I would like to have printed in the Record this statement by Matthew Dole, a high school student from St. Johnsbury, VT. He was speaking at my recent town meeting on issues facing young people.       My name is Matthew Dole. I face censorship every day as I      watch movies, try to read a book or even read the newspaper.      All people have beliefs on what should be censored, but those      should not infringe on others' choices. If you are to ban      books, please do it [right], but don't force your opinions      upon others.       Proponents of censorship base their argument on the First      Amendment. They interpret their Freedom of Speech as freedom      to ban books. The opponents also use the First Amendment as a      major right, not to be infringed upon. They have the freedom      of choice, choice to read or watch whatever they want. They      say that the proponents do not have the right to physically      remove the books from our libraries and school shelves.      People against censorship see it as large government once      again challenging the individual, as was done in 1919 with      Prohibition, later repealed. They ask for more local control,      at the most local in fact--individual decision.       In this, the era of political correctness, people challenge      books on today's standards. They do not historicize texts,      meaning they don't consider the time or circumstances under      which it was written. I have with me today three books that      have been banned. The first one is Mark Twain's, ``The      Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.'' To historicize this book,      it was written in 1884, as Twain lived in Mississippi, and he      had previously fought as a Confederate in the Civil War. It      was banned for racism, and the reason for that was the      circumstances under which it was written. The second book is      ``Catcher in the Rye.'' This was banned for sexual scenes. I      read this last year as a sophomore in high school as part of      a Classic American Literature section. The third, and last,      book is Margaret Mitchell's ``Gone With the Wind.'' This book      was again banned for racism, and the reason [is that] if it      hadn't had racism in it, it wouldn't have been historically      correct. It is a book about the Confederate South, once      again; and it was also banned for one word.       As I've said, violence, racism and sex--three touchy,      controversial subjects, are the most common reasons for book      banning. Will banning the books make these issues disappear?      I say, ``No.'' They may, however,     help educate people on these issues. What we must do instead      is educate our children early. We can teach them to have      opinions, and teach them why they can't read that book, or      why they shouldn't read that book. As time passes, they will      be able to handle the issues, before being offended. Also,      they will be able to personally ban books, TV with the V-chip      and movies with the rating system.       There's no ``cut and dried'' solution to this. If a case in      book banning or any other censorship were to reach the      Supreme Court, they can interpret the First Amendment. Or if      two-thirds of each House vote in Congress, they could rewrite      the First Amendment more specifically. And on a more local      level, if two-thirds of all state legislatures wanted to,      they could call an actual Convention and rewrite it      themselves       Thank you for inviting me, and I hope something can be done      on this issue.       Congressman Sanders: Thank you very much, Matthew. Matthew,      let me ask you a question, because you have dealt with a very      sensitive and controversial issue. So, here's my question: if      at town meeting, or better yet a school board meeting, a      parent gets up and says, ``I read this book. It is vulgar, it      has filthy words in it, it has ideas that I don't want my      daughter to see; I want that book out of the library.''      You're a member of the school board--how do you respond to      that?       Answer: Tell her that we can ban the book, in a sense, ban      by putting it in, maybe, a section, like an adult section or      a high school section. This happened at my old school, as a      matter of fact, and they did not remove it from the library,      and just put it in a separate section. What happened, was a      5th grader was basically in the high school section, reading      this book. And I would ask them to educate . . . their kids,      and I would ask the teachers also need to educate their kids      on why they shouldn't read that book at that age.       Congressman Sanders: In your judgment, what is the danger      of somebody defining a book and saying, ``This book is      terrible, I want it out.'' What are the long-term      repercussions of that approach?       Answer: With these books that I've brought--these are      classics, these are used in teaching. If we lose these books,      we lose a valuable tool in teaching our youth.       Congressman Sanders: So what you're saying is that what may      be vulgar for one person may be a work of art and a classic      for somebody else.       Answer: That's right.                          ____________________
