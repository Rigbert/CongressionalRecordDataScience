As to your point about the whole financial system's becoming unreachable and so concentrated, whatever happens here, the ordinary American family and the ordinary American community will benefit by whatever Congress does.  As I listen to what is being talked about in this Chamber and over in the Senate, one of my biggest worries is that very big institutions on Wall Street are going to be bailed out or are going to be propped up by the American taxpayer.  My question is: What does the American taxpayer get for that? Our Federal Housing Administration is literally going to become the insurance company for Wall Street. When these big Wall Street firms get all of these homes, how does the average American get in on this equation?  I'm putting in the Record tonight an article that was in The Observer. It talks about an effort to allow homeowners who are losing their homes at the local level to work with their local governments and local housing authorities to transfer those homes, perhaps, to them. Then in a lease-back provision, they would be able to pay that locality back for that home.                   [From the Observer, July 13, 2008]    Credit crunch: Emergency Scheme To Help Cash-Strapped Homeowners                  (By Gaby Hinsliff and Jamie Elliott)       Homeowners struggling to meet their mortgage payments would      be able to sell their homes to the local authority and rent      them back as tenants under radical proposals being considered      by the government to prevent the misery of repossession.       Emergency measures to allow families to keep a roof over      their heads are being drawn up as the scale of repossessions      proceedings becomes increasingly apparent. In Newcastle upon      Tyne alone, the newly nationalised Northern Rock is      monopolising at least one day a week in the county court to      pursue defaulting borrowers.       The latest rescue package reflects growing fears about the      seriousness of the crisis, with some analysts predicting that      house prices could fall by 35 per cent. Ministers are worried      about the 13 per cent of fixed-rate borrowers whose cheap      deals expire this year, some of whom may by then be in      negative equity and therefore unable to switch to a new fixed      rate with another lender.       Caroline Flint, the Housing Minister, told The Observer      yesterday: `I am looking at what more we can do with our      colleagues in local authorities--what they can do as well as      actually building [homes], and what support they could give      to people who might be feeling under pressure on mortgages.'       Asked to confirm that she was considering rent-back      schemes, enabling homeowners to become council tenants in      their original houses rather than be repossessed, she said:      `We are looking at that. I have to be certain that the      choices I make do actually help to limit the damage; and,      importantly, is it a short-term fix or a long-term impact?'       The scheme be expensive. Councils would need central      government funds to buy the houses. But it could save on the      long-term costs of rehousing homeless families and allow      councils to increase their housing stock at relatively low      prices.       Flint also suggested the Bank of England could increase the      size of its 50bn fund designed to stimulate      mortgage lending, admitting she was `disappointed' that the      cash that has been pumped in so far had not led to cheaper      home loans. `No doubt our colleagues in the Bank and the      Monetary Policy Committee will also be looking at the issue      in terms of whether any extra has to be provided,' she added.       She has suggested that country landowners could be freed to      build cheap houses for their workers on their own land, in a      return to the system of `tied cottages'.       `It's recognising that sense of community and how everybody      has a part to play,' she said.       Debt advice experts warned yesterday that, despite the      Chancellor's calls for leniency from lenders, Northern Rock      was now aggressively pursuing defaulting borrowers as part of      its efforts to repay the 25bn rescue package it      received from the government. Chris Jary, director of Action      for Debt in Durham, said: `There used to be a small group of      sub-prime lenders who you knew would always go straight to      court. But recently it's Northern Rock who have become more      aggressive, taking legal action as soon as they can.'       House repossessions at Northern Rock are running at twice      the rate they were before the bank was nationalised in      February.  Rather than Wall Street's making all the money in their bond houses, why don't we use the bonding power of our cities and of our housing authorities to help move some of that money back down rather than move the money out, back up again to Wall Street?
