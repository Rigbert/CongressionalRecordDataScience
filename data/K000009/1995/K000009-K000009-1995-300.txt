But the workers from Medina, NY, do not always let us know they have lost their jobs and their production has been outsourced. I think it is very hard to get this information. We collect some of it, but there are just hundreds and hundreds of small companies, some of them employing under 50 people around our country, that have shut down.  I am hoping if those citizens of our country who are listening who have been really put out of a job this past year, in fact some of them have had to go down to Mexico and train their replacement worker, I hope you will call our offices. I hope you will let us know who you are. We will be your voice here. We need to be your voice here. You do not have voices from Wall Street placed in high positions. You do not have people in some of the major financial instruments of this government who are your voice.  We can be your voice, if you will let us know who you are. Some of you who are in union shops, you are organized, you know how to get to us. Many of you are in nonunion shops, 85 percent of you. We need to know who you are. We will be your voice here in the Congress of the United States.
