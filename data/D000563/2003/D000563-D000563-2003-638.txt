The question it raises is whether it is improper or has an appearance of impropriety.  I say on its face there is an appearance of impropriety, that one company, without competitive bidding, would end up with a $7 billion contract. Is the Senator from California saying that if Halliburton is that good, that this is the only company in America that can possibly bid on it, Halliburton will have its chance?  The Department of Defense is going to say to all the companies in America that might provide the services, you have your chance to compete with Halliburton. If it is that good, Halliburton can win this contract fair and square on the up and up and eliminate any appearance of impropriety. Is that what the Senator from California is trying to achieve?
