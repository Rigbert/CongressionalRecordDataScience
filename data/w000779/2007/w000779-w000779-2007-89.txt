President, I talked with our colleague about health care, and I know he has an interest in a bipartisan effort. If the Senate begins with the children's health insurance program and we make it clear this is not some kind of Trojan horse for a Government-run health plan, but something that secures the needs for children, I think we can do this in a bipartisan way and then, in effect, segue into another bipartisan effort to fix health care that would get all Americans under the tent for quality affordable coverage.  Senator Bennett and I have brought before the Senate a proposal, particularly on the basis of the hearing in the Senate Budget Committee 2 weeks ago, that we think can bring the Senate together, go where no Congress has been able to go since 1945, when Harry Truman made an effort to do it, and that is a rational system so that all Americans have quality affordable coverage.  I yield the floor.
