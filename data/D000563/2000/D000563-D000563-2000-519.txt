I am happy to cosponsor it. It is truly bipartisan legislation which is of benefit not only to the farmers in our State of Illinois but to our Nation.  We understand, as most people do in Washington, the benefits of ethanol when it comes to reducing air pollution. We also understand the dangers of MTBE. Where it is used in other States, it has contaminated water supplies.  We are in the process of working with the Environmental Protection Agency to discuss the future of ethanol and hope it will remain strong.  I ask my colleague from Illinois--and I again congratulate him for his leadership in this area--if he can tell me whether his legislation on the elimination of MTBE is done on a phaseout basis or whether it is done to a date certain?
