President, I ask unanimous consent that Chris Landberg, a detailee from the State Department to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, be granted floor privileges for the duration of the consideration of any legislation related to Ukraine, including S. 2124, Support for the Sovereignty, Integrity, Democracy, and Economic Stability of Ukraine Act of 2014. The original request comes from my colleague standing here, Chairman Bob Menendez from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
