Speaker, I rise today to recognize Janusz Borzuchowski of Bialystok, Poland, who helped keep the flame of liberty alive in one of this country's most important allies since the birth of the American Revolution.  As the 2016 election cycle roars into our television sets and permeates our consciousness, I am pleased to be able to report from time to time on the sometimes secret heroes whose lives we can all celebrate in the most bipartisan fashion.  Many of their stories we find in our civil and human rights movements, on our factory floors, in our military and police, in our hospitals, and myriad other places--all bearing the stamp: MADE IN THE USA.  However, it is also important to remember those around the world who, while not sharing our sacred citizenship, do share our values--often at the greatest risk and greatest potential cost to themselves.  Janusz Borzuchowski was not quite six years old when his father, Lieutenant Tadeusz Borzuchowski, was taken from their home by a Soviet Union then allied with Hitler's Germany. He, along with thousands of others of Poland's intelligencia, was murdered on Stalin's orders in Katyn Forest.  As a young man, Janusz Borzuchowski became a civil engineer and well-known outdoorsman, teaching at the local university and marrying a woman with whom he deeply fell in love, Halina Dworakowska, who herself returned to Poland very young after being born in Kazakhstan, where her parents had been sent into exile by the Soviet regime.  As the Polish motto, ``For Our Freedom--and Yours,'' slowly resurrected itself from behind the Iron Curtain, Janusz went on to be a key clandestine figure in the Solidarity movement in Eastern Poland. Working out of Bialystok, he was in charge of collecting money to support the cause--distributing in the process beautiful clandestine postage stamps for secret sale among liberty's partisans--and secretly running the region's printing press from one of his apartments.  At the same time, his sister Agnieszka, who passed away three years ago, was a fabled physician in the Medical University of Bialystok who hid Solidarity movement fugitives from Communist authorities--disguising them as patients in her hospital ward for infectious diseases. She was also the premier and pioneering figure in the largest city in northeastern Poland in the fight against HIV/AIDS. Just last year, Bialystok named a local park after Agnieszka in recognition of her vast following of well-wishers and her many medical, social, and political contributions to Poland.  Agnieszka's passing was followed last year by that of Janusz's oldest daughter, Dorota, an architect in Warsaw who was very well known for her designing of the interiors of some of the most famous gambling casinos in Poland's capital. His other daughter, Polish American Congress Washington Director Dr. Barbara Borzuchowski Andersen, is one of the Polish American community advocates best known for her work with both Congress and the White House.  Unfortunately Janusz--a devoted husband, father, brother and advocate for liberty--is himself now facing major health problems. I cannot think of a better tribute to him now than to salute him: ``W imie Boga za Nasza i Wasza Wolnosc''--thanking God, for our freedom, yours, and that of people around the world.                          ____________________
