Speaker, I urge support for the motion.  This bill resembles one that I introduced in April. It will resolve the sole remaining issueraised in the annual audit of Library financial operations by giving the Library statutory authority to operate its gift revolving funds.  The bill creates three revolving funds, one to support the Library's audio-visual duplication and delivery services; a second to support its gift shop, decimal cataloging and photo duplication services; and a third to support ``FEDLINK,'' the program that acquires library materials for other agencies, and the Federal Research Division, which conducts research for other agencies.  Enactment of this measure will result in significant savings to the Library and its customers by improving financial management of these programs. The Library estimates that FEDLINK's agency customers will collectively save over $1.3 million annually through administrative efficiencies and increased vendor discounts.  In addition, the bill adds the vice-chair of the Joint Committee on the Library to the trust fund board, to ensure representation from both Houses. Finally, to facilitate the work of the Library's trust fund board, the bill adjusts its quorum requirement. It also permits the board chairman to request that members whose terms have expired continue to serve for up to a year, or until their successors are qualified, whichever comes first.  Mr. Speaker, this is a good-housekeeping bill that will save money for the Library and its customers while resolving auditors' concerns. I urge an ``aye'' vote.
