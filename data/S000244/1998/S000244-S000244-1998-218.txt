Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a dedicated public servant. For more than two decades, Ron Dellums has provided an example of tireless service to his constituents. The House of Representatives has been a fortunate beneficiary of Ron Dellums' experience and talents, and among both his constituents and colleagues, his contributions will be greatly missed.  Mr. Dellums made his mark as a staunch defender of human and civil rights. He never failed to remember the social concerns of the people who entrusted him with his office. Yet, Mr. Dellums also displayed a commitment to fiscal responsibility, devoting much of his career to reducing military spending.  Mr. Dellums was elected to the House of Representatives in 1970. He served a term as Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee beginning in 1993, allowing him to more effectively pursue his goal of a leaner post-Cold War military. He developed a reputation as a thoughtful legislator who advocated collegial debate on even the most divisive issues.  Although we have differed on many policy matters, I believe Ron Dellums to be an honorable legislator and a valuable colleague. Hehas served this body with integrity and dedication. I join my colleagues on both sides of the aisle today in bidding him farewell.                          ____________________
