Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H. Con. Res. 449, a bill to celebrate the life of Ray Charles.  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from California, my friend, for yielding me this time, the place where Ray Charles spent many wonderful and great years. I also want to thank the gentleman from the State of Georgia, my friend, for bringing this resolution forth.  This native of Georgia, son of America, citizen of the world, was born to sing. He was born to make music. Whether Gospel, blues, country, or rock, he had the rare ability to reach the depth of our souls.  After losing his sight at a very young age, Ray Charles perfected his voice, a voice that transcended race, color, and class. Through songs like ``Georgia on My Mind,'' ``America the Beautiful,'' ``Hit the Road Jack,'' ``What I'd Say,'' ``Spirit in the Dark,'' and ``I Can't Stop Loving You,'' he spoke to the hearts and souls of millions and became a pivotal figure in modern American and world music.  But, Mr. Speaker, Ray Charles's commitment did not just end with music. He was also committed to equality for all, by providing personal and financial support in the fight for civil rights. Ray Charles dedicated his life to uniting a divided America and bringing the world community a little closer. He was very supportive of education. He gave millions of dollars to Morehouse College in Atlanta.  For more than 60 years, Ray Charles blessed us with his music, and, Mr. Speaker, I believe we will never see his likeness again.  I thank Ray Charles. I thank him for his service. I thank him for giving his heart, his soul, his very being for the benefit of all human kind. Our world, our Nation, is a little bit better because Ray Charles passed this way with his music, with his heart, with his soul.
