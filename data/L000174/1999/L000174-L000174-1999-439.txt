President, we are living in a time of mega-mergers, and they are coming from all directions. Chrysler and Daimler-Benz automobile companies finalized their merger last year. In the computer world, AOL completed its purchase of Netscape just a few months ago. And in the largest corporate merger ever, Exxon Corporation announced its plan to acquire Mobil at a price tag of over $75 billion, thus creating the world's biggest private oil company, Exxon Mobil Corporation.  While these mega-mergers have cut a swath across a number of industries, the consolidations that continue to raise the most questions in my mind are those that involve incumbent monopolies. For example, the mergers among Regional Bell Operating Companies, which continue to have a virtual stranglehold on the local telephone loop, pose a great threat to healthy competition in the telecommunications industry.  Indeed, incumbent telephone companies still control more than 99% of the local residential telephone markets.  As I said last Congress, and it is still the case today, at my farm in Middlesex and at my home here in Virginia, I have only one choice for dial-tone and local telephone service. That ``choice'' is the Bell operating company or no service at all.  The Telecommunications Act of 1996 passed with the promise of bringing competition to benefit American consumers. However, this promise has yet to materialize.  Since passage of the Telecommunications Act, Southwestern Bell has merged with PacTel into SBC Corporation, Bell Atlantic has merged into NYNEX, and AT has acquired IBM's Global Network, just to name a few. Just last week it was reported that U.S. West reached an agreement to merge with the telecommunications company Global Crossing.  The U.S. Justice Department didn't spend years dividing up Ma Bell just to see it grow back together again under the guise of the 1996 Telecommunications Act.  I am very concerned that the concentration of ownership in the telecommunications industry is proceeding faster than the growth of competition. Old monopolies are simply regrouping and getting bigger and bigger.  Before all the pieces of Ma Bell are put together again, Congress should revisit the Telecommunications Act. To ensure competition between Bell Operating Companies and long distance and other companies, as contemplated by passage of this law, we need clearer guidelines and better incentives. Specifically, we should ensure that Bell Operating Companies do not gain more concentrated control over huge percentages of the telephone access lines of this country through mergers, but only through robust competition.  Today I am reintroducing antitrust legislation that will bar future mergers between Bell Operating Companies or GTE, unless the federal requirements for opening the local loop to competition have been satisfied in at least half of the access lines in each State.  The bill provides that a ``large local telephone company'' may not merge with another large local telephone company unless the Attorney General finds that the merger will promote competition for telephone exchange services and exchange access services. Also, before a merger can take place, the Federal Communications Commission must find that each large local telephone company has for at least one-half of the access lines in each State served by such carrier, of which as least one-half are residential access lines, fully implemented the requirements of sections 251 and 252 of the Communications Act of 1934.  The bill requires that each large local telephone company that wishes to merge with another must file an application with the Attorney General and the FCC. A review of these applications will be subject to the same time limits set under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976.  The bill also provides that nothing in this Act shall be construed to modify, impair, or supersede the applicability of the antitrust laws of the United States, or any authority of the Federal Communications Commission, or anyauthority of the States with respect to mergers and acquisitions of large local telephone companies.  The bill is effective on enactment and has no retroactive effect. It is enforceable by the Attorney General in federal district courts.  This bill has the potential to make the 1996 Telecommunications Act finally live up to some of its promises.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1121       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Antitrust Improvements Act      of 1999''.     SEC. 2. PURPOSE       The purpose of this Act is to enhance the authority of the      Attorney General to prevent certain mergers and acquisitions      that would unreasonably limit competition in the      telecommunications industry in any case in which certain      Federal requirements that would enhance competition are not      met.     SEC. 3. RESTRAINT OF TRADE.       The Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 12 et seq.) is amended--       (1) by redesignating section 27 (as designated by section 2      of Public Law 96-493) as section 29; and       (2) by inserting after section 27 (as added by the Curt      Flood Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-297)) the following new      section:       ``Sec. 28. (a) In this section, the term `large local      telephone company' means a local telephone company that, as      of the date of a proposed merger or acquisition covered by      this section, serves more than 5 percent of the telephone      access lines in the United States.       ``(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a large      local telephone company, including any affiliate of such a      company, shall not merge with or acquire a controlling      interest in another large local telephone company unless--       ``(1) the Attorney General finds that the proposed merger      or acquisition will promote competition for telephone      exchange services and exchange access services; and       ``(2) The Federal Communication Commission finds that each      large local telephone company that is a party to the proposed      merger or acquisition, with respect to at least \1/2\ of the      access lines in each State served by that company, of which      at least \1/2\ are residential access lines, has fully      implemented the requirements of sections 251 and 252 of the      Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 251, 252), including      the regulations of the Commission and of the States that      implemented those requirements.       ``(c) Not later than 10 days after the Attorney General      makes a finding described in subsection (b)(1), the Attorney      General shall submit to the Committee on the Judiciary of the      Senate and the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of      Representatives a report on the finding, including an      analysis of the effect of the merger or acquisition on      competition in the United States telecommunications industry.       ``(d)(1) Each large local telephone company or affiliate of      a large local telephone company proposing the merge with or      acquire a controlling interest in another large local      telephone company shall file an application under this      section with respect to the merger or acquisition with both      the Attorney General and the Federal Communication Commission      on the same day.       ``(2) The Attorney General and the Federal Communication      Commission shall issue a decision regarding the application      within the time period applicable to review of mergers under      section 7A.       ``(e)(1) The district courts of the United States are      vested with jurisdiction to prevent and restrain any mergers      or acquisitions described in subsection (d) that are      inconsistent with a finding under paragraph (1) or (2) of      subsection (b).       ``(2) The Attorney General may institute proceedings in any      district court of the United States in the district in which      the defendant resides or is found or has an agent and that      court shall order such injunctive, and other relief, as may      be appropriate if--       ``(A) the Attorney General makes a finding that a proposed      merger or acquisition covered by an application under      subsection (d) does not meet the condition specified in      subsection (b)(1); or       ``(B) The Federal Communications Commission makes a finding      that 1 or more of the parties to the proposed merger or      acquisition do not meet the requirements specified in      subsection (b)(2).''.     SEC. 4 PRESERVATION OF EXISTING AUTHORITIES.       (1) In General.--Nothing in this Act or the amendment made      by section 3(2) shall be construed to modify, impair, or      supersede the applicability of the antitrust laws, or any      authority of the Federal Communication Commission under the      Communication Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 151 et. seq.), with      respect to mergers, acquisitions, and affiliations of large      local exchange carriers.       (b) Antitrust Laws Defined.--In this section, the term      ``antitrust laws'' has the meaning given that term in the      first section of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 12).     SEC 5. APPLICABILITY       This Act and the amendment made by section 3(2) shall apply      to a merger or acquisition of a controlling interest of a      large local telephone company (as that term is defined in      section 27 of the Clayton Act, as added by such section      3(2)), occurring on or after the date of the enactment of      this Act.                                 ______                                       By
