  As I mentioned yesterday, Democrats' draft does not even come close to restoring the kinds of customary due process rights and protections that past impeachment inquiries included, either for President Trump or for their own Republican colleagues in the minority.  Here is what their resolution announced today. This is basically what it says: ``No due process now . . . but maybe some later . . . if we feel like it.'' It says: ``No due process now . . . but maybe some later . . . if we feel like it.'' This is not a fair way to treat any American, and it certainly is no way to conduct something as grave as an impeachment process, which seeks to overturn the American people's choice in a democratic election.  I hope the House of Representatives sees the light and steps away from their unfair and arbitrary process.                          ____________________
