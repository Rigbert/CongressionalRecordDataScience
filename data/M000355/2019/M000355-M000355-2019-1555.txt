 President, I ask unanimous consent that all postcloture time on the Truncale nomination expire at 10:45 a.m., Tuesday, May 14. I further ask unanimous consent that, if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.
