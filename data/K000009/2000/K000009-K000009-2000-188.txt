Chairman, I thank the gentleman very much for his openness and leadership on this, and also the chairman of the subcommittee for his fine work on clean coal and other alternative fuels over the past years.  Mr. Chairman, the articles I referred to above are as follows:                [From the New York Times, June 14, 2000]                   In Gas Prices, Misery and Mystery                  costs in midwest exceed $2 a gallon                            (By Pam Belluck)       Chicago, June 13.--Gasoline is so expensive in the Midwest      that a retired railroad worker in Cleveland says he had to      cancel his annual summer drive to visit his daughter in San      Francisco.       A volunteer agency that delivers meals to shut-ins in      Milwaukee cannot afford to pay its drivers enough to fill      their tanks.       A florist in Urbana, Ill., is talking about raising what he      charges to deliver roses and carnations.       And in suburban Chicago, Kathy Stachnik says she now      considers putting gas in her blue 1997 Honda Accord an ``evil      necessity.''       ``Whenever I stand at the pumps these days, I'm just      furious,'' said Ms. Stachnik, 38, as she bought 10 gallons of      gas at an Amoco in Arlington Heights for $2.25 a gallon. ``I      know that something fishy is going on with these prices.''       Gasoline prices in the Midwest have risen sharply in recent      weeks, jumping as much as 50 cents a gallon and far      outstripping increases in the rest of the country. In Chicago      and Milwaukee, drivers are paying more than $2 a gallon, the      first time prices have ever soared that high in the United      States, analysts says.       In recent days, the federal government has been trying to      determine why the prices in the Midwest have risen so      steeply. The Environmental Protection Agency and the Energy      Department met with oil refiners on Monday in Washington. And      the Clinton administration and the House Judiciary Committee      have asked the Federal Trade Commission to look into whether      the increases involve price gouging or collusion.       ``We don't have good explanations,'' said Robert      Perciasepe, the environmental agency's assistant      administrator for air and pollution programs. ``We're not      seeing this anywhere else in the country.''       Gas prices increased across the country in the last few      weeks as the summer driving season began. Gasoline      inventories are being depleted, and new requirements for      cleaner burning gasoline became effective on June 1. But the      spikes in the Midwest are especially steep.       On Friday, the most recent day for which figures are      available, the average prices of self-serve regular gasoline      in Chicago was $2.13 a gallon, up from $1.37 a gallon in      January, according to Trilby Lundberg, an analyst who      compiles the Lundberg Survey of gas station prices. By      comparison, prices on Long Island averaged $1.67 a gallon      last week, up from $1.39 in January. And prices in Los      Angeles averaged $1.56 a gallon in June, up from $1.29 in      January.       Industry representatives say the price increases in the      Midwest are a result of several factors.       The most significant, they say, is the new federal      requirement for cleaner-burning gasoline, known as RFG-2. In      the Midwest, unlike in other regions, the additive oil      refiners use to make their gasoline comply with the      regulations is ethanol. Because ethanol evaporates quickly it      requires a special formulation of gasoline, said Edward H.      Murphy, general manager for downstream operations at the      American Petroleum Institute an industry group.       ``It's more difficult to produce that gasoline,'' Mr.      Murphy said, ``As a result, production is significantly      lower,''       Another factor, industry officials say, was the rupture in      March of a Texas pipeline that Midwest refineries depended on      for their supply. The pipeline was repaired two weeks later,      but it is still operating at only 80 percent capacity.       A third factor is a court ruling that the Unocal      Corporation can collect royalties on a particular type of      cleaner-burning fuel. That has prompted smaller refineries to      curtail RFG-2 production to avoid paying royalties to Unocal,      industry analysts say.       ``In a situation where supplies are tight, and you have      relatively inelastic demand for gasoline, the price increase      you need that occurs in the market is disproportionately      large,'' said Mr. Murphy, who said some refineries are      carting in the fuel they need by barge from Nova Scotia or      the Gulf states. ``If the price of lemons goes up, you move      to limes. If the price of coffee goes up, you move to tea.      But with gasoline, consumers don't adjust very quickly in a      very short term. Obviously you don't go out and trade in your      brand new Ford Excursion for a Toyota Camry.''       Officials at the Environmental Protection Agency and the      Energy Department acknowledge that all these factors play a      role in increasing gas prices somewhat. But they say none is      sufficient to account for the precipitous price jumps in      cities like Chicago and Milwaukee.       ``All of these may have some impact but they don't seem to      explain the size of the disparity,'' Mr. Perciasepe said. For      example, he said the cost of producing cleaner gasoline with      ethanol should lead to only about a 5 cent to 8 cent increase      in gas prices. ``Whether people are taking advantage of some      of these situations is something that we hope to be able to      understand better.''       A senior official at the Energy Department said that      although the supply of oil was tight in the Midwest, ``we      weren't persuaded by the arguments of the refiners. Generally      speaking, all of the large suppliers say they have adequate      supplies to serve the demand.''       The official added, ``It has the administration very      concerned, obviously,''       Sam Stratman, a spokesman for the House Judiciary Committee      and its chairman, Representative Henry J. Hyde, Republican of      Illinois, said that oil companies had years to prepare for      the increased costs of the RFG-2 regulations.       ``This is a complicated issue,'' Mr. Stratman said. ``It      deals with issues of supply and demand and regulatory changes      mandated by E.P.A., and you wonder, have these changes given      oil companies a chance to gouge consumers?''       Of course, Americans still have the lowest gas prices in      the world. The Organization of petroleum Exporting Countries,      which controls nearly half of the global oil supply, will      meet next week to decide on whether to increase production.       Although the prices in Chicago and Milwaukee are the      highest on record, they are still lower than gas prices were      at their peak in March 1981, when the national average price      of a gallon of gasoline was $2.67, if adjusted for inflation,      Ms. Lundberg said.       That is hardly comforting to beleaguered drivers across the      Midwest these days.       ``It's outrageous,'' said Colleen Posinger, 44, of      Streamwood, Ill. ``I'm really upset about the gas prices,      because we told our 1-year-old daughter that we'd drive to      South Dakota this summer. The vacation was already planned,      so I guess we'll just have to take the crunch.''       Others, like Adam Matavovszky, the retired railroad worker      in Cleveland, decided they could not afford their vacations.       In Milwaukee, Goodwill industries which delivers meals to      the elderly and also takes disabled people to workshops and      training programs, has been hit by $23,000 in extra fuel      costs this year, said Roger Sherman, vice president for human      services. He said the organization had asked for emergency      assistance from the Milwaukee County Department of Aging and      might have to cut back on transportation.       ``We are running 150 percent over budget,'' Mr. Sherman      said, ``We have not kept up with the rising gasoline      prices.''                                  ____                 [From the Toledo Blade, June 13, 2000]                    EPA Can't Find Reason for Hikes       Washington.--Federal officials met for two hours with      refiners yesterday, and the EPA's top air pollution official      said he heard ``no good explanation'' for soaring gasoline      prices in Midwest cities, in which new requirements require      cleaner-burning gas.       The Environmental Protection Agency and Energy Department      said inspectors were sent to the Milwaukee and Chicago areas      to investigate price increases in recent weeks of 30 to 50      cents a gallon. They focused on refining and distribution,      one official said.       At the White House, spokesman Joe Lockhart said the Midwest      price increases ``seem to be out of whack,'' and any evidence      of price gouging that investigators find will be turned over      to the Federal Trade Commission for further investigation.       Officials from eight major oil refineries sat in on the EPA      and Energy Department meeting, and further sessions were held      later with individual companies.       ``We see no good explanation for why the [high] prices      exist. . . . We think the prices are unfair and      inappropriate,'' Robert Perciasepe, the EPA's assistant      administrator for air and pollution programs, said.       He said that while gasoline supplies are lower than normal,      ``there are adequate supplies'' to keep prices in check. The      additional cost of the cleaner-burning gasoline, called      reformulated gasoline, costs only 5 to 8 cents a gallon more      to produce, Mr. Perciasepe said.       The Energy Department released data that showed prices of      reformulated gas were on average 9 cents a gallon higher as      of June 5 than conventional gas nationwide, but 23 cents      higher in the Midwest. The newly blended gas was required      beginning this month in areas with severely polluted air.       Mr. Perciasepe and Melanie Kenderdine, a senior DOE      official who attended the meeting, would not characterize      explanations given by industry officials except to say the      two sides has a general discussion about supply and      distribution problems.       ``We're suspicious of gouging,'' Dave Cohen of the EPA      said.       Urvan Sternfels, president of the National Petrochemical      and Refiners Association, said some of the price increases in      the Midwest stem from unexpected problems refiners had with      meeting the new, higher vapor-pressure requirements for the      cleaner gas. Corn-based ethanol, used widely in the region as      a fuel additive, reduces vapor pressure and complicates fuel      blending, he said.       The Renewable Fuels Association, which represents the      ethanol industry blamed the refiners for not building      adequate stocks of reformulated gasoline and the EPA for      ``failure to make appropriate regulatory changes that would      reduce the cost of producing RFG in Chicago and Milwaukee.''       Gas prices have increased for five consecutive weeks      nationwide with the beginning of the heavy summer driving      season, but they soared in some parts of the Midwest--     especially Illinois and Wisconsin.       But EPA officials said they are puzzled as to why the price      difference between conventional and the cleaner-burning gas      is as wide as it has been in the Midwest. ``We do not believe      that the cleaner-burning gasoline is causing the major price      increases,'' Mr. Perciasepe said.       According to the Energy Department, the average price of      regular-grade gas in areas requiring reformulated gas      nationwide was $1.63 a gallon on June 5, or 9 cents a gallon      more than the average price of gas sold in other parts of the      country that not require reformulated gas.       The average price for the cleaner gas was $1.84 a gallon in      the Midwest, a 23-cent difference from conventional gas;      $1.56 a gallon on the East Coast, a 9-cent difference; $1.61      on the West Coast, only a 5-cent difference; and $1.48 a      gallon on the Gulf Coast, a difference of 2\1/2\ cents,      according to the DOE's Energy Information Administration.       Environmental groups have questioned the soaring prices.       ``The oil companies have known for five years that they      would have to sell the cleaner-burning gasoline by June 1.      Why didn't the industry plan for known supply needs,'' asked      Frank O'Donnell of the Clean Air Trust, an environmental      advocacy group.                                  ____                   [From Toledo Blade, June 9, 2000]               Gasoline Price Surge Shocks Toledo Drivers       Alex Alvarado filled up his gas tank just in time      yesterday, saving big bucks. Most were not so lucky.       By lunchtime, gasoline prices around Toledo had surged to      $1.86 or more for regular-grade gasoline and more than $2 for      premium gasoline--an unexpected price jump at many stations      of more than 30 cents per gallon.       A 30-cent-per-gallon increase costs someone with an 18-     gallon tank an extra $5.40 each fill-up.       ``It's ridiculous,'' Mr. Alvarado said as he topped off his      tank with the last of the gasoline that cost $1.549 for      regular grade at the     Clark station on Eleanor Avenue at Lewis Avenue. Several      yards away, a gas station clerk was posting the new prices.       The next customer would pay $1.859 per gallon of regular      grade at the same pump.       ``It's price-fixing,'' Mr. Alvarado of Toledo grumbled.      ``I'm lucky I just made it in here before they changed.''       Some drivers took their frustrations out on the clerks      working at the stations.       Regina Chiles, assistant manager at the Speedway on Dixie      Highway off I-75 said as she tacked up the new numbers on her      outside sign. ``You'd think they'd be a bit more appreciative      that we were still a bit cheaper, but instead they just yell      at us because prices are going up.''       An informal survey by The Blade found that gas prices      around the Toledo area spiked by midday from $1.549 to $1.859      for regular-grade gasoline and $1.729 to $2.07--or more--for      premium gasoline.       Just two weeks ago, the Kroger gas station at Jackman and      Laskey roads was selling gas at $1.419 to $1.619 per gallon.      Yesterday, prices at the same pumps had climbed to $1.879 to      $2.079 per gallon.       If you think it was bad in northwest Ohio, Michigan has      been dealing with similar prices for a week.       Yesterday at the Total stations in Adrian on North and      South Main streets, the price of regular was $1.94 per gallon      and premium was $2.16 at the Speedway on South Main.       There may be several reasons for the increases, industry      experts said.       A demand for environmentally-friendlier gasoline in bulk      markets such as Chicago and Milwaukee have forced up gas      prices because of the more complicated, expensive refining      process, Tom Kloza, publisher of Oil News and Prices, in      Rockville, Md., said.       And because motorists continue to fuel up in those cities--     even with the higher prices--suppliers know they can raise      prices at pumps in other areas throughout the Midwest, he      said.       ``We reached the whining state. We reached it a few weeks      ago,'' Mr. Kloza said. ``But we haven't reached the stage      when we change our behavior.''       Chris Kelley of the Washington-based American Petroleum      Institute agreed.       ``Everyone loves to drive their gas-guzzling SUVs,'' he      said. Economic prosperity globally means people are consuming      more petroleum-based products world-wide, he added.       Add to that the high price of crude oil now--nearly $30 a      barrel compared to $18 this time last year--and consumers      will feel the pinch at the pump, he said.       U.S. Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D., Toledo), said she has tried      several times this year to pass amendments that would release      some of the strategic petroleum reserves to ease the gas      crunch.       She said Republicans have defeated the measures. She said      the government should promote efforts to develop nonpetroleum      fuel sources.       In West Toledo before lunchtime, Earl Price waited several      cars deep to take advantage of some of the lower prices at      the Shell station at Secor Road and Monroe Street.       The gas there ranged between $1.559 and $1.739 per gallon,      while across the intersection, BP's prices were $1.879 to      $2.119 per gallon.       ``I'm driving around here comparing gas prices and the      lines at the stations,'' said Mr. Price, who installs pools      and works with a moving company. He said he drives 100 miles      daily on his 1978 pickup, which gets eight miles a gallon.       Behind him, Pam Green, a hospital technician, chuckled.       ``You have to laugh,'' she said. ``I'm sitting here using      up all my gas waiting in line to buy gas.''       But with gasoline 30 cents or so cheaper per gallon at some      stations, ``it adds up,'' she said. ``I'll wait.''       It adds up even quicker for those who buy in great      quantities, although Julian Highsmith, Toledo's commissioner      of facility and fleet operations, said prices are a bit more      stable than they are at the pump.       The city buys its fuel in bulk from suppliers and gets a      price estimate each week from the Ohio Petroleum Index      System. It has fluctuated, Mr. Highsmith said, between 80      cents per gallon and the current $1.08, the highest so far      this year.       ``It goes up and down, but our costs have been a little      more constant than what you've been seeing at the pump,'' he      said.
