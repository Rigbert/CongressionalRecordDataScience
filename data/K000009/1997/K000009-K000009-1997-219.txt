Chairman, the base bill that this substitute would replace essentially, as Mr. Rohrabacher, who has led such a good fight on this and so many Members who have supported him, calls for a massive change in the way that we protect the secrecy of those who file patents in our country.  Now, to me, to move from a system that basically says when you file a patent your ideas can be protected for up to 17 years, up to the point that that patent is granted, and if the review office takes longer than 2 years, if it takes 4 years or 5 years for whatever reason, that your ideas are protected, why would we want to take away the property rights of our inventors by saying after 18 months, and where did the 18-month magic come from anyway, that after that point their ideas could be made available to whomever might want them?  To go from 17 years to 18 months to me is a massive change in the way the current system functions. I have never had an inventor in my district come up to me and ask for this change, so I wonder who it is that is proposing the change that is in the base bill.  I want to compliment Mr. Rohrabacher for helping to expose this issue in detail so that we can better protect our inventors' technologies in this country.  From the inventors I have talked to, they have some pretty big problems, once they involve themselves in this whole idea of patenting their inventions. Number one is the cost. The fact that a really small person does have to put a lot forward in the first place just to patent their idea.  If you are a big company, that does not affect you as much. You have great wholeness in the system. You have the ability to float. But for the small people that are out there in their garages and their basements where wonderful ideas have come from, it is much more difficult for them to do that even in the existing system.  Once they do, one of the challenges they have as an inventor is that big companies, if they try to commercialize the technology, often try to buy their idea out before it is even applied in the manufacturing sector, because an inventor does not control the manufacturing process. They are not into the commercialization side. Under the current system, it is even difficult for many of these inventors to get someone to buy their idea.  Also we have a situation under the current system where inventors find that their ideas are counterfeited. In fact, we have had dumping of computer terminals that have come over from China and other places.  I wish the committee would have given a little more attention to the real problems that inventors are having out there, trying to work in this current system. But they have never complained to me about the protections they receive in this country for their property rights. They have never complained about the time period.  They are complaining to me now. The Ohio State Bar Association is very aware of what this bill does and has made its views known to us. And many, many other inventors throughout the State of Ohio.  But I say to myself, what could have propelled this committee into proposing this kind of change? I looked down the list of multinational corporations that want this particular right. They already function on the international front. They are the very same firms that try to buy out these small inventors and do not permit them to commercialize their technology, if they do not have deep pockets. They are the very same interests that are able to float in their little boats in international waters when the average inventor is not. They are the very ones that have no problems with existing fees. And it just seems to me that they got the red carpet rolled out for them when they went before the respective institutions of this House.  On the other hand, the small inventors of my community have not been afforded the opportunity to come before the committee. The small inventors of my community have not been allowed to come before the Committee on Small Business.  I heard one of the Members, the gentleman from Maryland [Mr. Bartlett], say that the hearings would be held next week. My friends, the horse is already out of the barn. Next week? This bill is being heard today. So it seems to me that we have a responsibility to represent the majority of inventors in this country, most of whom do not have deep pockets.  Our job is not just to represent the multinationals who have lots of good ideas and they have a great ability to float their boats, but they are not the only ones out there in the ocean.  I would certainly say to those who would want to bend over backwards to other countries who do not give us market access, we have a $50 to $60 billion trade deficit with Japan, a $40 billion trade deficit with China, and it is growing. The situation we have with Mexico is abominable post-NAFTA. A lot of these other countries are going to be advantaged through this agreement. Why?                              {time}  1615  Why are we doing this to our inventors when in fact our country has 10 times more intellectual property breakthrough technologies than any other country in the world? We protect these property rights. It is inherent in the Constitution of this Nation. Why would we want to do this to the people of our Nation?  Now, let us take a look at the burden of proof and the fact that people say here, well, they can sue. If people do not like this new bill, H.R. 400, and they fail to vote for the Rohrabacher substitute, well, gosh, we will give them a chance to go to court.  A lot of these inventors out there do not have the money. They worry about paying their maintenance fees under the existing system, under the existing system. So why force them into cases where the burden is on them to prove that what they are doing in OK? Under the current system, it is.  Why place that burden on them? Why force them to go into these reexamination procedures? Why would we want to do that to our own people?  Frankly, for a lot of these nations or companies that function offshore, my own view is unless they give us market access, why give them anything? Why give them any advantage into this Nation's most precious seed corn, which is our patented inventors' property rights?  The whole idea of corporatizing the patent office, it is interesting that the people who work over there do not want this to happen. They are civil servants. They objectively can review, regardless of what type of inventor comes in there with an invention.  None of us really understand the gentleman's proposal of what this guasi-government corporation or new entity, this PTO, what that is going to be. We have not had a chance to fully digest what that means down the road. How objective will these examiners be allowed to be? What will the CEO of that corporation, what rights will that individual have over those individual decisions? How objective and judiciallike will those decisions be able to be?  It seems to me there are a lot of issues in H.R. 400 that no Member here, including the people on the committee, can fully appreciate. Why do we not have an opportunity to clean this bill up? Let us adopt the Rohrabacher substitute, let us keep the system clean, the way it is, and then work through some of the issues that are of deep concern to Members here who want to represent not just those with deep pockets, but small inventors around our country who are really creating the future of us.  It was mentioned earlier there are some people concerned about jobs in our country and our trade policy who have engaged in this debate. Certainly we have, because we understand what it is like to negotiate against a country that uses every kind of barrier to disallow our product into their market.  But the inventions, the ideas, the intellectual property is the heart of our system. To allow them into the door when we have all sorts of other problems out there and we do not fully appreciate the long-term consequences of what is being proposed here, is a very dangerous position in which to place our country for the next century.  There is no question that patents are the primary source of job creation in this country. It goes to the heart of how we develop as an economy. When I see people like Nobel Laureates opposing the changes in H.R. 400, and I see the gentleman from California [Mr. Rohrabacher] and our own minority leader, the gentleman from Missouri [Mr. Gephardt], and the gentleman from Maryland [Mr. Hoyer], and others in this body, the gentleman from California [Mr. Hunter], people on both sides of the aisle who have respect for members of the committee, but feel that we have not had our concerns solved, we have no choice but to wholeheartedly support the Rohrabacher substitute.  So I want to urge the membership, please, that if they have not read the bill, if they have not followed this debate, to support the Rohrabacher substitute. Do not fix a system that is not broken. Let us work hard, as this Congress progresses, in order to fix the current system if there are problems, but do not completely turn it upside down and take away the property rights of our inventors, especially the small inventors whose canoes are very small to row in the oceans of the international marketplace.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
