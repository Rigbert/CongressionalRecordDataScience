  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:    THE SPECTER-GRASSLEY INTERIM FINDINGS ON THE INVESTIGATION INTO  POTENTIAL ABUSE OF AUTHORITY AT THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION                                Overview       These findings follow the Judiciary Committee's December 5,      2006, hearing that examined allegations that the Securities      and Exchange Commission (SEC) abused its authority in      handling its now-closed investigation of suspicious trading      by the hedge fund Pequot Capital Management (``Pequot'' or      ``PCM''). We submit these preliminary findings based upon the      evidence received by both Committees to date because we      believe it is important to share with the full Senate.       Between July 2006 and the end of the 109th Congress, the      Senate Judiciary and Finance Committees conducted a joint      investigation into allegations raised by former SEC employee      Gary Aguirre. Mr. Aguirre contends that his efforts to      investigate potentially massive insider trading violations by      Pequot were thwarted by his superiors when his investigation      increasingly focused on current Morgan Stanley Chief      Executive Officer John Mack. Mr. Aguirre also alleges that      his insistence on taking Mr. Mack's testimony met resistance      within the SEC and ultimately led to his firing. In      addressing these allegations, we have focused on the internal      processes of the SEC. We have not attempted to decide the      merits of the underlying Pequot insider trading investigation      and, at this juncture, take no position on whether Pequot or      Mack violated any securities laws.       To date, Committee investigators have received and reviewed      over 9,000 pages of documents and interviewed nineteen (19)      key witnesses over the course of twenty-four (24) interviews.      The Judiciary Committee also held a series of three (3)      public hearings regarding this matter--most recently on      December 5--when the Committee heard detailed sworn testimony      from current and former SEC employees involved in the Pequot      investigation.       Based on our review of this evidence we have serious      concerns. As discussed further below, our primary concerns      involve: (1) the SEC's mishandling of the Pequot      investigation before, during, and after Aguirre's firing; (2)      the circumstances under which Aguirre was terminated; and (3)      the manner in which the SEC's Inspector General's office      handled Aguirre's allegations after he was fired. Viewing      these concerns as a whole, we believe a troubling picture      emerges. At best the picture shows extraordinarily lax      enforcement by the SEC. At worse, the picture is colored with      overtones of a possible cover-up. Either way, we believe the      SEC must take corrective and preventative action to ensure      that future investigations, internal and external, do not      follow the same path as the Pequot matter.                                Findings      The SEC's Investigation of Pequot was Plagued with Problems     The SEC Failed To Act on the GE/Heller Trades for Years       The alleged insider trading occurred in July 2001 when      Pequot CEO Arthur Samberg began purchasing large quantities      of Heller Financial stock while also shorting General      Electric (``GE'') stock a few weeks before the public      announcement that GE would purchase Heller. On January 30,      2002, the NYSE ``highlighted'' some of these trades for the      SEC as a matter that warranted further scrutiny and      surveillance. But it appears that the SEC did next to nothing      to investigate these trades until after Aguirre joined the      Commission over 2 years later on September 7, 2004. In fact,      it is clear to us that Aguirre was the driving force behind      the investigation of the GE-Heller trades that had otherwise      remained dormant at SEC since 2002.     The Circumstances Surrounding the Investigation of John Mack          as the Potential Tipper Are Highly Suspect       The evidence shows that Aguirre's immediate supervisors,      Branch Chief Robert Hanson and Assistant Director Mark      Kreitman, initially were enthusiastic about investigating      Pequot and Mr. Mack as the possible supplier of inside      information to Pequot. Indeed, after Aguirre developed a      plausible theory connecting Mack to the trades, Hanson wrote      on June 3, 2005, in an email that ``Mack is another bad guy      (in my view)'' (Attachment 1). And on June 14, 2005 Aguirre's      supervisors Hanson and Kreitman authorized him to speak with      federal prosecutors concerning the trades. Six days later on      June 20, 2005, in response to a more comprehensive analysis      of his theory regarding Mack, Hanson wrote: ``Okay Gary      you've given me the bug. I'm starting to think about the case      during my non work hours'' (Attachment 2).       What is troubling is how this enthusiasm waned after public      reports on June 23, 2005, that Morgan Stanley was considering      hiring Mack as its new CEO. Specifically, we are concerned      about the circumstances leading to the decision by Aguirre's      supervisors to delay taking Mack's testimony. The Judiciary      Committee received sworn testimony from Aguirre that he was      told in a face-to-face meeting with his immediate supervisor,      Hanson, that he could not take Mack's testimony because of      his ``powerful political contacts.'' While Hanson denied to      the SEC/IG and to the Committees that he ever said that, we      question his denial because of conflicting contemporaneous      emails. For example, Hanson admitted to a very similar      statement when he wrote to Aguirre on August 24, 2005, ``Most      importantly the political clout I mentioned to you was a      reason to keep Paul [Berger] and possibly Linda [Thomsen] in      the loop on the testimony'' (Attachment 3, emphasis added).      He also used the term ``juice'' when referring to Mack's      attorneys (Attachment 4). Another witness testified before      the Judiciary Committee that Hanson referred to Mack's      ``prominence'' as a reason for not taking his testimony      (Attachment 5).       To be sure, Hanson's supervisor, Mark Kreitman, also      referred to John Mack's ``prominence.'' Speaking about former      U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White's contact with SEC Enforcement      Director Linda Thomsen regarding the Pequot investigation,      Kreitman told the Inspector General's Office, ``White is very      prestigious and it isn't uncommon for someone prominent to      have someone intervene on their behalf'' (Attachment 6).      Kreitman's supervisor, Associate Director Paul Berger, also      brought up the issue of prominence, when asked whether he      could remember examples of witnesses other than John Mack for      whom he required a staff attorney to prepare a memorandum to      justify the taking of investigative testimony (Attachment 7).       We also have reason to question Hanson's credibility given      certain inconsistent statements that he gave to the Judiciary      Committee during its December hearing. Specifically, we find      it difficult to reconcile Hanson's submitted written      statement to the Committee concluding that it was ``highly      suspect and illogical'' to link Mack as the tipper with his      prior writings that ``Mack is another bad guy (in my view)''      (Attachment 8). Moreover, it bears noting that despite      Hanson's statement that Aguirre's theory was ``highly suspect      and illogical'' the SEC ultimately took Mack's testimony on      August 1, 2006. Furthermore, we are troubled by Hanson's      failure to recall a key investment that Mack entered into      with the help of Pequot prior to his alleged passing of      inside information to Pequot CEO Samberg regarding the GE-     Heller transaction. Hanson's failure to recall this      transaction at the hearing raises doubt as to whether      Aguirre's theory regarding Mack was ever taken seriously by      his supervisors at the SEC.       Moreover, we question the rationale advanced by Aguirre's      supervisors in not taking Mack's testimony: to get ``their      ducks in a row.'' While reasonable minds may disagree on an      appropriate investigative strategy, the SEC's rationale for      delaying the taking of Mack's testimony runs contrary to what      insider trading experts have told us and contrary to what      others within the SEC believed at the time. According to Mr.      Hilton Foster, an experienced former SEC investigator with      knowledge of the Pequot matter: ``as the SEC expert on      insider trading, if people had asked me, `when do you take      his testimony,' I would have said take it yesterday.'' In      addition, Joseph Cella, Chief of the SEC's Market      Surveillance Division, told Committee investigators, ``it      seemed to me that it was a reasonable thing to do to bring      Mack in and have him testify,'' and ``in my mind there was no      down side[.]''       The explanation offered by Aguirre's supervisors that      without direct evidence that Mack had knowledge of the GE      transaction--what Aguirre's supervisors referred to      as proving Mack went ``over the wall'' (Attachment 3)--the      deposition would consist simply of a denial by Mack is not      at all convincing. Indeed, although the SEC apparently      never found such direct evidence, the SEC did manage to      question Mack for over 4 hours when it finally took his      testimony on August 1, 2006, after the statute of      limitations had expired. And although Aguirre's      supervisors advance the rationale that taking Mack's      testimony in the summer of 2005 would have been merely      premature, this notion is contradicted by the staff      attorney who took the lead in the investigation after      Aguirre was fired. In particular, shortly before taking      Mack's deposition in August 2006, that attorney wrote      explicitly in a July 19, 2006, email that the rationale      for taking Mack's testimony was not a matter of being      ``premature'' but rather an issue of establishing the      necessary ``prerequisite'' of when Mack had obtained      inside information (Attachment 8).       The purpose of taking investigative testimony is not to      confront a witness with accusations of wrongdoing, as      Aguirre's supervisors seem to believe. Rather it is to gather      information that helps to either confirm or rule-out working      theories, which by their nature must be speculative at the      beginning of the investigation. One SEC witness who wishes to      remain anonymous told the Committees' investigators that SEC      training personnel teach new attorneys that:     it was important to immediately ``nail down'' the stories of      any individuals who possibly had been involved in the      suspicious trades so that the person could not adjust their      story to account for any information we later uncovered. This      also served to assist the direction of the investigation      because it allowed us to immediately identify whether or not      any subsequent evidence supported the individual's initial      statement thereby giving us a strong indication of whether      the initial statement appeared to be true and what, if any,      additional investigation needed to be conducted (such as the      need for more in-depth testimony if we found contradictions).       Although the SEC finally took Mack's testimony in August      2006, we are concerned about the circumstances under which it      was done. Mack's testimony was taken five days after the      statute of limitations expired, and only a few months after      we initiated our inquiry into this matter. We question why      the SEC failed to take this obvious step earlier. The      evidence suggests that his testimony was taken primarily to      deflect public criticism for not having taken it much      earlier. It took the SEC over a year to ask John Mack about      his communications with Arthur Samberg and Pequot's trading      in Heller and GE. By contrast, it took Mary Jo White only two      days to do so. On the Sunday after Morgan Stanley's Board of      Directors hired her and her firm, Debevoise & Plimpton, to      look into Mack's potential exposure in the Pequot      investigation, she quickly obtained documents and questioned      Mack about specific emails with Arthur Samberg. The SEC      should have been at least as curious about Mack's answers as      Mary Jo White was.     The Problems With the Pequot Case Are Amplified by the          Testimony of Other SEC Employees       Our concerns are further heightened by the testimony of one      key SEC employee who raised issues with the manner in which      the Pequot investigation was handled. Specifically, the      Judiciary Committee received compelling sworn testimony from      SEC Market Surveillance Branch Chief Eric Ribelin who sought      recusal from the Pequot investigation shortly after Aguirre's      termination because, as he alleged at the time, ``something      smells rotten.'' Ribelin also explained to the Judiciary      Committee that he believed Aguirre's supervisors, especially      Associate Director Paul Berger, failed to ``support the      aggressiveness and tenacity of [Aguirre]'' (Attachment 5).      This is significant testimony from a witness who felt it was      his duty to come forward and testify. As such, we trust that      Commissioners at the SEC will take every step to ensure that      no retaliation against Ribelin will occur.           The SEC's Termination of Aguirre is Highly Suspect       The documents and testimony adduced by the Committees show      that Aguirre, a probationary employee while at the SEC, was a      smart, hardworking, aggressive attorney who was passionately      dedicated to the Pequot investigation. These positive      attributes were noted in a June 1, 2005 ``Performance Plan      and Evaluation'' prepared by Kreitman which give Aguirre an      ``acceptable'' rating for numerous work criteria, and then      followed by a more detailed ``Merit Pay'' evaluation written      by Hanson on June 29, 2005, which noted Aguirre's ``unmatched      dedication'' to the Pequot investigation and ``contributions      of high quality.'' These evaluations were submitted to the      SEC's Compensation Committee which later approved Hanson's      recommendation (among others) on July 18, 2005.       Despite these favorable reviews, Aguirre's supervisors      (Kreitman, Hanson and Berger) wrote a so-called      ``supplemental evaluation'' on August 1 that spoke negatively      of Aguirre. Aguirre's supervisors never shared this      evaluation with Aguirre and indeed admitted that they are      ``fairly rare''. In fact, during the December 5, 2006      hearing, current SEC supervisors could not recall other      instances where a supplemental evaluation was prepared for an      employee. We are skeptical of the supervisors' explanations      regarding the creation of this document. According to Hanson      and Kreitman, their initial positive evaluations covered only      the period ending April 30, 2005, thus suggesting that the      evaluation was accurate with respect to performance up to      that date. But these same supervisors also testified that the      initial evaluations were perhaps too generous, thus      suggesting that there were performance issues that should      have been addressed in the initial evaluation and Merit Pay      recommendation.       Rather than taking them at face value, we have attempted to      assess the credibility of the negative statements Aguirre's      supervisors made about him in his re-evaluation, in his      notice of termination, in interviews with the SEC/IG, in      interviews with Committee staff, and in their hearing      testimony. In doing so, we have noted the considerable      lack of contemporaneous documents corroborating the      concerns they raised.       For example, the IG's closing memo cites his supervisors'      concerns about subpoenas that Aguirre issued allegedly in      violation of law. While his supervisors now claim that this      was a significant error, which seriously undermined their      confidence in Aguirre, they have produced no documents to the      Committees suggesting that they viewed it that way at the      time. Another example is Hanson's allegation that Aguirre      behaved ``unprofessionally'' while taking the testimony of      Arthur Samberg. This allegation is based on second-hand      knowledge, as Hanson did not actually attend the testimony.      Moreover, the SEC has not produced records to the Committees      suggesting that Hanson or any of his other supervisors were      concerned at the time about the way Aguirre took the Samberg      testimony. In fact, Hilton Foster told the Committees that he      planned to use a portion of the transcript as a model for how      to take testimony in his training of new SEC attorneys. A      third former SEC employee told staff that the testimony of      current SEC supervisors at the December 5, 2006 hearing      concerning the reasons for terminating Aguirre were not      consistent with that employee's experience with Aguirre.       Aside from these inconsistencies, the greater concern is      with the timing of Aguirre's re-evaluation. Aguirre's      supervisors prepared the re-evaluation on August 1 after the      Compensation Committee (on which Berger sat) had already      approved the merit pay increase for Aguirre and most      significantly, 5 days after Aguirre sent Berger an email      saying that he believed the Pequot investigation of Mack was      being halted because of Mack's political power.       Finally, there are questions about Paul Berger's outside      employment with the law firm of Debevoise & Plimpton--the      private firm that represented John Mack's prospective      employer during the time that Berger allegedly vetoed efforts      to take Mack's testimony. Although Berger testified recently      before the Judiciary Committee that he ``first approached      Debevoise in January of 2006'' (at which time he recused      himself from the Pequot investigation and all other matters      in which Debevoise had entered an appearance), Committee      investigators identified a September 8, 2005, email      suggesting that a contact was made on behalf of Berger      through an intermediary who was also seeking employment with      the same firm at the time. While we have found no proof of      actual quid pro quo for Berger's employment in exchange for      the favorable treatment of Mack, the SEC should take steps to      avoid the appearance of impropriety of the sort that this      email seems to suggest. This is especially true given that      this contact on Berger's behalf occurred just days after      Aguirre was fired and months before Berger recused himself      from the Pequot matter.   The Follow-Up SEC Inspector General's Investigation Was Seriously                                  Flawed       We are deeply troubled by what appears to us to be a      cursory investigation of Aguirre's allegations by the SEC's      Office of Inspector General, headed by Walter Stachnik.      Subsequent to SEC Chairman Cox's September 7, 2005, referral      of Aguirre's allegations to the IG, Stachnik failed to      interview Aguirre or any of the other SEC employees mentioned      in Aguirre's letter to Chairman Cox. The testimony of one      such witness, Eric Ribelin, saw the light of day only through      our investigation. Moreover, our concerns were further      enhanced when the IG's investigators repeatedly told our      staff that in investigating Aguirre's allegations of improper     motivation for his termination, ``we don't second guess      management decisions . . . we don't second guess why      employees are terminated.'' (Attachment 9). Such statements      are fundamentally incompatible with the mission and purpose      of the Office of Inspector General. This may explain why the      IG spoke only to Aguirre's supervisors, accepted everything      they said at face value, and reviewed only documents      identified by those supervisors. However, it is certainly not      a recipe for an independent and thorough investigation.       Furthermore, the IG initially attempted to take punitive      action against Aguirre by seeking enforcement of a subpoena      for documents in his possession--including confidential      communications with Congress. We are pleased that the scope      of the subpoena was subsequently narrowed to exclude      communications with Congress. Nevertheless, Stachnik's      continued insistence that his first investigation was      ``professional,'' and his refusal to answer the Committee's      questions about the subpoena at the instruction of the      Justice Department are similarly troubling. The SEC's IG is      supposed to provide employees an alternate, objective, open-     minded avenue for reporting abuse of authority or other      misconduct. At no time, before or after his termination, was      Aguirre able to obtain at the SEC an objective and thorough      consideration of his concerns. It is unfortunate that he had      to reach out to our Committees to obtain such a review.                               Conclusion       The handling of the Pequot investigation, the basis for and      the timing of Aguirre's termination, and the woefully      inadequate IG investigation of serious allegations of abuse      of authority, present a very troubling picture. Based upon      the evidence we have reviewed to date, the SEC's handling of      the Pequot investigation shows either inexplicably lax      enforcement or possibly a willful cover-up. Either way, the      SEC must review this matter and take appropriate corrective      measures. Anything less will undermine public confidence in      our capital markets. We owe it to the public to ensure that      securities enforcement is rigorous and unbiased.       As such, we hope the SEC will consider re-opening its      investigation into the Pequot matter given our findings.      While the statute of limitations has run on criminal      penalties and civil penalties related to the underlying      trades, we understand that other remedies, such as      disgorgement, may still be pursued. There also may be      reasonable cause for the SEC or the Department of Justice to      investigate whether any testimony given in the underlying      Pequot investigation was false. We urge the SEC to take      Aguirre's allegations seriously and seek to improve the      management and operations of the Commission based on lessons      learned from this controversy. We anticipate transmitting      more detailed findings, conclusions and recommendations to      the Senate during the 110th Congress after we conclude our      assessment of the evidence adduced to date.

Mack moved from Morgan      Stanley, adviser in Heller acquisition, to CSFB, also adviser      in Heller, in late July 2001, the month of acquisition. The      are hundreds of Pequot e-mails referring to Mack, including a      dozen in July 2001. See e-mail below between Samberg and his      son referring to Mack (``It's nice to have friends in high      places . . .:)'' Is there something to this perverse logic:      Mack is the only person in the world who would have as much      to loose as Samberg if we could prove that he provided      material-nonpublic info to Samberg.

[From the Wall Street Journal, June 3, 2005]         John Mack To Join Pequot Hedge Fund in Chairman's Role                  (By Gregory Zuckerman and Ann Davis)       In the latest example of a prominent financial figure      entering the hedge-fund world, former Wall Street heavy-     hitter John Mack is joining Pequot Capital Management Inc. as      chairman.       Mr. Mack, 60 years old, was co-chief executive of Credit      Suisse Group and CEO of that bank's Credit Suisse First      Boston until last year, and previously was president of Wall      Street firm Morgan Stanley. He will work with Pequot's      founder, Art Samberg, to help lead the firm into new markets,      recruit money managers and help guide the Westport, Conn.,      firm. Hedge funds are lightly regulated investing pools,      traditionally for the wealthy and institutions.       [John Mack] Mr. Samberg, 64, an investor with a well-     regarded record, will remain chief executive of Pequot, which      manages about $6.5 billion, effectively running the firm day-     to-day. (Meanwhile, a British financial regulator, Gay Huey      Evans is joining a hedge fund run by Citigroup.)       Speculation about where Mr. Mack would land after he was      replaced last year at CSFB has been something of a parlor      game on Wall Street. Various companies put out feelers,     including Goldman Sachs Group Inc., and he was approached as      a possible candidate to run mortgage giant Fannie Mae, among      other positions, according to people close to the matter.      Some expected Mr. Mack, who is active in politics, to seek an      office or ambassadorship.       But like many Wall Street traders and analysts lately, Mr.      Mack is heading for the hedge-fund world, where assets are      growing and the rewards can be lucrative. Hedge funds      generally charge a management fee and a percentage of the      firm's investment gains, meaning that stellar results bring      big paydays. In addition to a salary, Mr. Mack will receive      equity in Pequot, according to the firm.       Mr. Mack wouldn't address details of other possible job      offers but said in an interview that he was attracted to      Pequot because he and Mr. Samberg have been friends for more      than a decade, starting when Mr. Mack gave some money to Mr.      Samberg to invest. Mr. Mack also said he was eager to help      the firm push into new investment areas.       [Arthur Samberg] ``Many people who have called me for a job      want me to fix something, but I'd like to focus my job on      building,'' Mr. Mack said.       For Pequot, the hiring of Mr. Mack is part of a change in      recent years from traditional hedge-fund strategies, such as      buying and selling U.S. and European shares. Returns for some      hedge-funds have fallen, amid concern by some that too many      savvy ``hedge funds were seeking the same opportunities in      the market.       Hedge funds lost less than 1 percent this year through      April--results that topped the returns of the market though      they pale in comparison to the double-digit gains hedge funds      scored in recent years. Pequot's various hedge funds are up      about 3 percent in 2005, according to investors. But Mr.      Samberg predicts that the growth of the hedge-fund business      will lead to a shakeout that forces as many as 30 percent of      existing hedge funds to throw in the towel, even as      institutions continue to up their investments in so-called      alternative investments. At the same time, the market is      neither cheap nor especially expensive, presenting few      obvious opportunities. That is why Pequot has been looking      elsewhere lately, starting hedge funds focused on emerging      markets, parts of the debt world and other strategies.       As reported in The Wall Street Journal, Pequot recently      formed a joint venture with Singapore-based Pangaea Capital      Management to invest in distressed assets in Asia, including      real estate.       Mr. Mack's move effectively blunts speculation that he      might join a new investment-banking boutique with some      recently departed top Morgan Stanley executives. A group of      former Morgan alumni waged a loud campaign for the ouster of      Morgan CEO Philip Purcell this spring, after a management      shakeup and several executive departures. Mr. Mack, who      clashed with Mr. Purcell before he left the firm in 2001, has      kept a studied distance from the dissidents.

Mr. Mack, who      clashed with Mr. Purcell before he left the firm in 2001, has      kept a studied distance from the dissidents.       Mr. Mack will be asked to tap into his wide-ranging      contacts to find new investment ideas around the globe, as      well as coach Pequot's investment team. Mr. Mack is expected      to help smooth the way for Pequot fund managers by      introducing them to company executives.       ``I see an opportunity to build something really great here      and John will be a big part of that,'' Mr. Samberg said.       Mr. Samberg's previous alliance with a high-powered partner      ended when Pequot co-founder Dan Benton quit the firm in      2001, taking about $7 billion of investor money with him to      his new firm, Andor Capital Management LLC. Mr. Samberg says      he is confident his new partnership with Mr. Mack will work,      in part because of his close relationship with Mr. Mack. In      recent months, Mr. Mack has been using spare space in      Pequot's New York office, weighing his options.       The move to bring in an established Wall Street executive      like Mr. Mack could signal that Pequot, like some other      hedge-fund firms lately, might be interested at some point in      selling itself, or part of the firm, to a mainstream Wall      Street firm or even going public through. a stock offering,      although Mr. Samberg says he has no plans to do so.     J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. recently purchased a majority stake      in big hedge-fund firm New York-based Highbridge Capital      Management., and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. has purchased      20 percent of Ospraie Management LP, a New York hedge fund.       Merrill Lynch & Co. agreed to provide $300 million in      capital for a venture with Pequot to place money with 15 to      30 new fund managers. Pequot is expected to offer the      managers research and administrative support--part of a trend      of hedge funds providing services also offered by investment      banks., blurring the lines between the two.                                  ____     To: '[email protected]' [[email protected]     From: Samberg, Art     Re: John Mack.     Date: 07/12/2001.       Spoke to him last night and commented on how up he sounded.      He said he was close to something, but I didn't know it would      be today. Sounds like the perfect opportunity for him.     From: Joe Samberg.
