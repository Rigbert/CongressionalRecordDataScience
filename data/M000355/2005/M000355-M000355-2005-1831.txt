 President, some of us were just at a luncheon where I had a chance to speak with the current Secretary of State who is anxious to get back to tinkering with his cars. So he will note that objection with some regret.  As I indicated, we anticipated an objection. Senator Reid had indicated there would be a problem on that side for any amount of debate we would have today or tomorrow, so therefore I ask that on Tuesday, January 25, at a time determined by the majority leader, after consultation with the Democratic leader, the Senate proceed to executive session for the consideration of the Rice nomination; provided further that during Tuesday's session there be 9 hours of debate equally divided between the two leaders or their designees.  I further ask consent that when the Senate resumes the nomination on Wednesday, January 26, there be an additional 40 minutes of closing remarks equally divided between the two leaders or their designees.  Finally, I ask that following that debate, the Senate proceed to a vote on the confirmation of the nomination with no intervening action or debate, and that after the vote the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.
