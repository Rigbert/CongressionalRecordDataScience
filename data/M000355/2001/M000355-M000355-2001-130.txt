 President, occasionally, that massive soft money machine, the New York Times, runs something accurate about campaign finance. Such as the op-ed I authoredwhich appeared in the April 1 edition. The focus of the piece is the tremendous harm enactment of the McCain-Feingold bill would do to our democracy, by severely weakening the two great political parties.  I ask unanimous consent that my op-ed be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [From the New York Time, Apr. 1, 2001]                        In Defense of Soft Money                          (By Mitch McConnell)       Washington--It now appears that among the legacies of the      Bill Clinton presidency will be a ``reform'' of a campaign      financing that devastate the national political parties. The      1996 Clinton campaign's courting of illegal foreign      contributions for the Democratic National Committee and the      Clintons' use of the Lincoln Bedroom to entertain      contributors, followed by Mr. Clinton's pardons for criminals      championed by big donors to the Democrats, have cast a pall      over national party committees. And all of this propelled the      prohibition of soft money--donations made to political      parties and not subject to federal contributions limits--to      the top of the reform agenda.  Earlier, the centerpiece of reform efforts had been limits on candidates' own spending. In 1997 Senators John McCain and Russ Feingold dropped these spending limits from their reform bill, along with bans on political action committees and on ``bunding''--when individuals and groups collect multiple contributions.  Hard money, in Washington parlance, is the funds and activities targeted to electing specific candidates to federal office. These funds are already subject to severe contribution limits, set in 1974 and never adjusted for inflation, and to requirements for disclosing the names of donors and the amounts they gave. The national parties themselves also raise money, which they need for issue advocacy, for helping state and local candidates, for paying overhead expenses like the costs of computers and lawyers (to comply with the array of election laws), and for get-out-the-vote efforts that benefit all of a party's nominees on Election Day. This ``nonfederal'' money is subject to regulations in the States. But because it has often been used in ways that do help federal candidates, it has come to be called ``soft money.''  The Republican and Democratic National Committees, and the Republican and Democratic senatorial and congressional committees, are national in scope. Gubernational and state legislative elections are among the highest priorities of the national parties, so they help candidates in those races accordingly--with funds governed under the relevant state laws and spent in consultation with state party committees. But federal candidates are a focus of the national committees, too. And with campaigns for federal offices starved for hard money by the antiquated 1974 limits, the national parties have become increasingly resourceful in utilizing soft money to fill the void in federal elections.       In recent years, the parties have used soft money to run      ads defending their nominees from attacks by special interest      groups and to help challengers compete against well-financed      incumbents. Help from the parties often provides the only      chance nonincumbent and nonmillionaire candidates have to be      competitive in Congressional elections.       The McCain-Feingold bill now working its way through      Congress would prohibit the national committees from raising      or spending any soft money--that is, any money not covered by      federal contribution limits--at any time for any purpose. It      would also federalize campaign-related spending by state      parties in even-numbered years, thus forcing even the state      parties to rely on far more scarce hard money, with results      that are likely to be devastating.       Even if only one federal candidate were on the ballot in a      state where the chief voter interest was in the governor's      race, a mayoral contest or control of the state legislature,      all party voter registration and turnout activities in that      state within 120 days of the election would be subject to the      severe limits on contributions set by Congress--and therefore      underfunded and diminished. Special-interest group issue ads      would go unanswered by the parties. Challengers, historically      shunned by political action committees but boosted by      parties, would be on their own. Incumbents and selffunded      millionaire candidates would flourish.       Speculation rages over which party would get the greater      advantage from the ban on soft money. Many Republicans,      believing that liberal-leaning news outlets will favor      Democrats and noting that much of the political activity of      the biggest Democratic ally, the A.F.L.-C.I.O., is largely      unimpeded by McCain-Feingold's provisions, fear Democrats may      be the greatest beneficiary. Conversely, there is concern      among some Democrats that forcing the parties to rely solely      on the limited and relatively puny hard-money contributions      may benefit Republicans.       One result of McCain-Feingold is certain: America loses.      The parties are vital institutions in our democracy,      smoothing ideological edges and promoting citizen      participation. The two major parties are the big tents where      multitudes of individuals and groups with narrow agendas      converge to promote candidates and broad philosophies about      the role of government in our society.       If special interests cannot give to parties as they have,      they will use their money to influence elections in other      ways: placing unlimited, unregulated and undisclosed issue      advertisements; ;mounting their own get-out-the-vote efforts;      forming their own action groups. Unrestrained by the      balancing effect of parties, which bring multiple interests      together, America's politics are likely to fragment.      ``Virtual'' parties will be able to proliferate--shadowy      groups with innocuous-sounding names like the Group in Favor      of Republican Majorities or the Citizens for Democratics in      2012 that will hold potentially enormous sway in a post-     McCain-Feingold world where the parties are diminished for      lack of money.       Under McCain-Feingold, the power of special interests will      not be deterred or diminished. Their speech, political      activity and right to ``petition the government for a redress      of grievances'' (that is, to lobby) are protected by the      First Amendment. Political spending will not reduced; it just      will not flow through the parties.       Do we really want the two-party system, which has served us      so well, to be weakened in favor of greater power for wealthy      candidates and single-issue group? McCain-Feingold will not      take any money out of politics. It just takes the parties out      of politics.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it's a little late, but hopefully not too late, that the Washington Post runs a page one story exploring the McCain-Feingold's destructive impact on vital democratic institutions: the two great political parties.  I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Washington Post, Apr. 1, 2001]           Campaign Bill Could Shift Power Away From Parties                  (By Ruth Marcus and Juliet Eilperin)       If the campaign finance bill nearing final passage by the      Senate becomes law, it could dramatically alter the practice      of modern politics, curtailing the influence of political      parties and potentially enhancing the power of outside groups      that would not be subject to strict contribution and      disclosure rules.       Campaign consultants and senior lawmakers said the biggest      immediate impact would be the slashing of the budgets of the      Democratic and Republican parties, which together raised      nearly half a billion dollars in the last election in ``soft      money,'' the unlimited contributions from corporations,      unions and wealthy individuals that would be banned under the      Senate bill.       That money, accounting for one-third of Republican Party      committees' funds and nearly half the budget of Democratic      Party committees, financed get-out-the-vote drives,      television ads praising or attacking specific candidates, and      basic administrative costs.       Although the parties would suffer under the new system,      political experts say, the beneficiaries could be independent      groups that have proliferated in recent years to press      their agendas on gun control, the environment, abortion      and other issues.       The bill, sponsored by Senators John McCain (R-Ariz.) and      Russell Feingold (D-Wis.), puts significant new restrictions      on such groups. Corporations, labor and ideological groups on      the left and right would not be able to use their own soft      money to run issue advertisements that name candidates within      60 days of a general election or 30 days of a primary. The      use of such advertising, often indistinguishable from      ordinary campaign commercials, has skyrocketed in recent      elections.       However, unlike the political parties, outside groups could      still collect unlimited checks from any source. They could      also run whatever ads they wanted up to the deadline and      after that could engage in other forms of political activity,      such as telephone banks and mailings.       In addition, the legislation would not end all issue      advertising, even close to an election. For example, wealthy      individual donors--who cannot constitutionally be stopped      from spending their own money--are not covered. Moreover, the      restrictions on outside groups are the part of the      legislation most likely to be thrown out by a court.       ``The world under McCain-Feingold is a world where the      loudest voices in the process are third-party groups.''      Republican election lawyer Benjamin Ginsberg Said. ``My fear      is that the parties will just wither and essentially people      will be motivated to get out to vote by the groups which      champion the issues they care about.''       A top democratic operative offered a similar assessment.      ``The fear here is all you're doing is opening up a very      large, underground flow of money in national politics,'' said      David Plouffe, who headed the House     Democrats' campaign operation in the last election.       But Fred Wertheimer of Democracy 21, which is lobbying for      the bill, said there would be ``far less leakage'' of soft      money to outside groups than some anticipate, especially from      corporations. ``People are missing the fact that a large      number of soft-money donors are tired of being hit up and      tired of facing the equivalent of political extortion,'' he      said.       If the Senate approves it Monday, the McCain-Feingold bill      will still have numerous hurdles to surmount. It must pass      the House, which has voted for similar measures, but now--     with campaign overhaul far closer to reality--Republican      leaders are vowing opposition. It must also be signed by      President Bush, who disagrees with a number of provisions but      has indicated that he cannot be counted on to veto the bill.      And perhaps most important, it must survive the      constitutional challenge that will immediately be mounted in      the courts.       Nonetheless, the prospect of Senate approval brings the      bill a huge step closer to reality. As its most ardent foe,      Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), said last week: ``There is      nobody to come to the rescue. This train is moving down the      track.''       That momentum has left elected officials, political      strategists and election lawyers of both parties trying to      predict what life would be like under the new regime--and      whether Republicans or Democrats would be better off. Both      sides insisted that the measure would benefit their opponents      but also acknowledged that the ultimate winners and losers      would not be clear for some time.       Experts disagreed about whether the measure would help      challengers or incumbents. Many said the bill would help      incumbents because parties would not have the same ability to      mount extensive advertising campaigns on behalf of      challengers and because it allows incumbents to raise      additional money against challenges by millionaire      candidates. But others said challengers would be helped by      the increase in the limits on direct contributions to      candidates and parties known as ``hard money.'' The limit on      how much an individual can give to a single candidate would      double to $2,000.       Some effects of the bill were not disputed. Because it      raises the overall amount of hard money that individuals can      contribute in an election cycle from $25,000 to $37,500,      Washington lobbyists are already wincing at the effect on      their bank accounts. Because many lobbyists give the maximum      allowed for a married couple, that would mean the total      amount they and a spouse could give would grow $25,000, to      $75,000 an election.       In addition, parties would have to dramatically change      their operations, which have become dependent on using a      combination of soft and hard dollars to do everything from      paying the light bill to running ads.       ``What we are doing is destroying the party system in      America,'' said House Democratic Caucus Chairman Martin Frost      (Tex.). ``The political parties would be neutered, and third-     party groups would run the show.''       ``We both lose,'' McConnell said. ``This is mutual assured      destruction of the political parties.''       Some campaign finance experts said such concerns were      overstated, nothing that the parties took in nearly $720      million in hard money in the last election and would be able      to raise even more under McCain-Feingold, which slightly      increases the individual contribution limits to political      parties, from $20,000 to $25,000.       ``I do not think that a ban on soft money will cripple the      parties,'' said Colby College political scientist Anthony      Corrado. ``The parties now raise twice as much hard money as      they were raising 10 years ago, and the parties were very      active in the late `80 and early `90 in election campaigns      without really any reliance on soft money.''       Because Republicans have built up a larger base of small      donors and therefore vastly out raise Democrats in hard-money      contributions operatives on both sides agreed that, at least      in the short term, the Democrats would be at a significant      disadvantage. During the last campaign, Republicans and      Democrats raised equivalent amounts of soft money, but      Republicans took in $447 million in hard money to the      Democrats' $270 million.       ``The best example of why Republicans will do better than      Democrats is to look at the Bush campaign last year,''      Democratic National Committee spokeswoman Jerry Backus said,      citing the more than $100 million the Bush primary campaign      raised in hard money.       Democrats also voiced concern that they would be targeted      in the waning days of the campaign by well-funded independent      Republican groups.       ``We have established interest groups that have been very      effective on our behalf,'' a Democratic strategist said.      ``What we have never had are the instant groups that spring      up for the specific immediate purposes of influencing      elections and that are encouraged to form under this bill. .      . . Democrats are going to be shuffling around dramatically      more limited resources and not able to provide air cover for      their members against those attacks.''       Yet Republicans say democrats would be helped because they      would benefit from continued heavy union spending and because      wealthy Democrats would simply write checks to outside      groups.       Two academics who are sympathetic to McCain-Feingold said      the Democrats' shortfall in hard money would be offset by the      greater number of advocacy group ads supporting Democrats.      ``The experience of the last two elections suggest that      neither Democrats nor Republicans would be disproportionately      harmed,'' said Kenneth Goldstein and Jonathan Krasno.      ``Indeed, neither party stands to gain or lose much against      their counterparts.''       Michael S. Berman, a veteran Democratic political      strategist, said any predictions are foolhardy. ``Of one      thing I'm certain,'' Berman said. ``Whatever we think the      effect will be, whoever we think it will help, we will be      wrong, because we've always been wrong.''  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the courts have repeatedly struck down issue advocacy restrictions.  I also ask unanimous consent that this list of cases be printed in the Record.
