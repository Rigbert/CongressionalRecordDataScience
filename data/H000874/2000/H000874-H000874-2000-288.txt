Chairman, in support of the amendment. And the reason is the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell), has been a major sponsor of this legislation and has been unable to speak. That is not fair to him as one of the major sponsors of this legislation. It is the way the rule runs, and I would hope the Chairman would allow us the 5 minutes to do that.
