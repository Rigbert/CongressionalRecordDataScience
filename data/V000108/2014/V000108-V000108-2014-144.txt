Chairman, I certainly appreciate the gentleman's concern, but would make three points to our colleagues.  The first is that the committee is absolutely aware of the problem that is taking place along the borders of our country.  Both relative to the problem that the gentleman has highlighted, as well as for this Nation's defense, I would point out to my colleagues that, in the underlying bill, we provide $1.356,227 billion for the procurement of 87 UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters, which is an increase of $119.226 million and eight aircraft above the President's request, so there is a recognition by the committee and in the bill that there is a need, and we filled that bill.  I would also point out that, relative to drug interdiction, the committee recommendation is for $944.687 million to deal with this problem; and I would, again, point out the gentleman's concern, that that is an increase of $124 million above the administration's request.  The last point is that the gentleman is taking it out of operation and maintenance, departmentwide.  I spoke in my opening remarks about the increases we have tried to provide to make sure our troops are prepared, maintained, trained, and ready. It is a mistake to take over $35 million away from our troops, who need that money for training.
