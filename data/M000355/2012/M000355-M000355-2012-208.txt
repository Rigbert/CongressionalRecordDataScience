 President, I would like to continue to discuss the student loan issue this morning because the administration's approach to this problem is nothing short of surreal.  I have in my hand a letter that has been signed by the top four Republicans in Congress: Speaker Boehner, Leader Cantor, minority whip Jon Kyl, and myself. It lists no fewer than four good-faith bipartisan proposals to resolve the issue, all of which are based on offsets the President has proposed himself in the past.  Let me say that again: We have recommended to the President four offsets that he, himself, has proposed in the past to achieve what we all want to achieve, which is a 1-year extension of the current student loan interest rates. We sent this letter to the President 5 days ago. Yet we have now learned that in spite of the fact they have a proposal recommending that on a bipartisan basis we accept offsets that they have previously recommended, we have now learned the Vice President will have a group of college presidents over to the White House today to ``reassert the call for Congress to stop the student loan interest rate from doubling.''  Congress has acted. We have given the administration four offsets they previously proposed. We are waiting for a response so we can solve this problem. Why doesn't the Vice President simply pick up the phone, choose one of the proposals we laid out in our letter, and then announce at the meeting the problem has been resolved? That way he will give these folks some good news to bring back to their campuses instead of just asking them to be props in this elaborate farce the White House political team cooked up on this issue. It is an elaborate farce. This can be solved very easily with offsets the administration itself has recommended.
