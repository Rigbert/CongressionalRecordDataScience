President, if the Senator will yield, I would like to say on behalf of those who didn't support the bankruptcy bill that, in all fairness, I think it was a spirited and a very positive debate, during the course of the debate for over 2 weeks. But that really boiled down to about 6 or 7 days. We entertained 30 amendments to the bankruptcy bill. Not one amendment went on extraordinarily long. Members took a limited amount of time, expressed themselves, debated quickly and thoroughly, and voted.  I hope that we can continue to follow that model. I think, as I have said, we got perilously close to debate in the U.S. Senate, which hardly ever happens around here. I hope that we can continue along those lines in the future.  I thank the Senator from Kentucky for yielding.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, if I could just say to my friend, I couldn't agree more. I think the debate was handled very nicely. Members got an opportunity to have their say, to get their votes, and the Senate has done itself proud. In spite of the mixed views about the outcome, the Senate did itself proud with the first two bills this year, and I hope it is a good recipe for the future.                          ____________________
