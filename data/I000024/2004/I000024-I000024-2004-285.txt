Why not plan to do that?  Now I have been told we cannot lock in time agreements on a tabling motion, so I will withhold.  Let me be sure we all understand: In my State of Oklahoma, it perhaps makes no difference. We are one of the 20 States that has mandatory seatbelt laws. In fact, it could be argued we could be benefited by this because if other States do not comply and are punished, then that amount of money could go to the States that already comply. So I could actually benefit.  My problem has always been, as the distinguished Senator from Virginia knows, it is a mandate. I would prefer not to do it this way.  I know the Senator's heart is right. I know there is another great person who served in here by the name of John Chafee who felt as strongly about this as the distinguished Senator from Virginia.
