 We had, at the end of last Congress, a tremendous bipartisan vote--406 19--on repealing straight up the antitrust immunity of the insurance industry.  The American people, no matter where they are on the Affordable Care Act, agree on one thing: insurance companies should not be able to get together and collude to either exclude people from coverage or drive up prices. Yet they do. They have an exemption under a law from the 1940s.  Now, what the gentleman is offering sounds pretty good, but it won't get us there because 90 percent of the antitrust cases are private, and almost every single one of those cases is a class action. So if you preclude class actions, you can pretend you're being tough with the insurance industry while you can wink and nod and say, hey, don't worry about it because there really won't be any litigation under this; and you're still going to be able to skate, and you're still going to be able to collude, and you're still going to be able to drive up prices.  Think of the context in what we're doing. We're talking about IPAB today, but they've already voted to repeal the entire Affordable Care Act. That means no more restrictions on rescissions--the dirty little practice where you've been paying your premium for years and you get sick and the insurance company says, sorry, we're not going to renew your policy. That's been outlawed.                              {time}  1100  They're going to do away with the prohibitions on age discrimination. They're going to do away with the prohibitions on preexisting conditions. So now we're going to have an insurance industry that is, essentially, free from antitrust law, that can take away your policy when you get sick, that can discriminate against you because you're old, can discriminate against you because you're sick or you have been sick, and it would take away the protections and the review of excessive rate increases.  So if we were doing a straight-up, take away their antitrust immunity, make them play by the same rules as every other business in America, except for professional sports, who are exempt from antitrust law, that would be fine. But let's not have this phony fig leaf so you can wink and nod to the insurance industry and say, ``Hey, don't worry about it; it won't have any impact,'' but we can say to consumers we're with them.
