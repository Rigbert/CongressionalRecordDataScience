 President, I wish to mark an important milestone: the 18th anniversary of the founding of the Burmese National League for Democracy, NLD. As the world knows well, the NLD is the legitimate leadership of the country of Burma, as the party was elected overwhelmingly by the Burmese people in 1990.  Sadly, the 18th anniversary for the NLD is not a time for rejoicing. The NLD remains firmly under the boot of the Burmese ruling junta, the State Peace and Development Council, SPDC. Many of its leaders are imprisoned, including Nobel Laureate and democracy advocate Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, and NLD vice chairman, U Tin Oo. Thirteen elected NLD members of Parliament and over 400 party members currently serve in prison. Other NLD members have endured torture and have been killed as the SPDC continues to wage a campaign of harassment, intimidation--and worse--against party members and supporters.  In a testament to the courage and determination of its leadership, and despite these great hardships, the NLD remains unbowed. It continues to pursue nonviolent political change in Burma. I am proud to say that the Senate stands squarely alongside the NLD in its efforts. I am hopeful that the United Nations, U.N., Security Council will as well. Due to the determined efforts of many countries, including the United States, Burma is slated to be on the Council's agenda for the first time ever. It will then be time for member states to stand up and be counted in support of a nonpunitive resolution on Burma.  It should be noted that U.N. Under Secretary General Ibrahim Gambari's trip to Rangoon earlier this year was a complete failure. Mr. Gambari should not make a second trip to Burma unless and until the U.N. Security Council has considered and passed a resolution that, among other things, details the threats the SPDC poses to the people of Burma and the entire region. Such action would be a clear message to the SPDC that when it comes to Burma, the world is not satisfied with the status quo.  Similarly, I would encourage all relevant bureaus at the State Department and the National Security Council--particularly those relating to African affairs--to remain engaged and focused on this issue. The task of promoting democracy and reconciliation in Burma should not be left only to the East Asian and Pacific Affairs and the Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor bureaus at the State Department. With three African nations currently sitting on the U.N. Security Council, our African affairs specialists need to more actively engage in building support for such a resolution. Ghana has already demonstrated its solidarity with the cause of freedom. The Republic of Congo and Tanzania need to follow suit.  Finally, on this, the 18th anniversary of the founding of NLD, I call upon the Burmese military regime to release Suu Kyi and all political prisoners. Only then can discussions on a meaningful reconciliation process--one that includes the full and unfettered participation of the NLD and ethnic minorities--proceed.  I ask unanimous consent that a Boston Globe Editorial on Burma be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Boston Globe, Sept. 26, 2006]                          An Agenda for Burma       Having placed the case of Burma's military junta on the      formal agenda of the Security Council earlier this month, the      United Nations now has an opportunity to show that it can be      something more than an impatient debating club. If in the      waning days of his tenure UN Secretary General Kofi Annan      exercises the right combination of firmness and finesse with      Burma's military dictators, he can help protect human rights,      democracy, and regional security in Asia.       Unlike the coercive measures contemplated to cope with      Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons or genocide in Darfur, the      UN is not being asked to dispatch armed peacekeepers to Burma      to impose risky economic sanctions on the narco-dictatorship      there. Rather, moral suasian and diplomatic pressure are the      means for dealing with the junta's violations of human rights      and its threats to regional peace and security--threats      manifest in the export of heroin, methamphetamine, HIV/AIDS,      and the hundreds of thousands of refugees who have fled the      military's brutal assaults on ethnic minorities.       Annan must be careful, however, in the way he exerts the      UN's soft power. Last May, he sent UN undersecretary-general      for political affairs, Ibrahim Gambari, to Burma, where he      met with Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi as well as      junta leaders. At the time, Gambari said he thought the junta      bosses were ``ready to turn a new page.'' But Gambari and      Annan looked gullible soon after, when the junta extended Suu      Kyi's house arrest for another year and intensified its      campaign of ethnic cleansing, rape, and murder in the region      inhabited by 2 million people of the Karen ethnic group.       Annan shouldn't allow Gambari to undertake a return trip to      Burma without a Security Council resolution that spells out      clear and reasonable demands for the true turning of a new      page. That should include the release of all 1,100 political      prisoners in Burma, including Suu Kyi and fellow leaders of      the National League for Democracy, the party that won 82      percent of Parliamentary seats in a 1990 election that the      junta has refused to honor ever since.       The NLD, which commemorates the anniversary of its 1988      founding on Sept. 27, must be invited along with other      parties and representatives of Burma's ethnic nationalities      to participate in a genuine political dialogue. The      resolution Gambari takes to Burma should specify that such a      dialogue means working out terms for an agreement on a return      to democracy. That resolution should also require the junta      to end its attacks on ethnic minorities and to permit      international aid organizations to have unimpeded access to      all those in need within Burma. Nearly all the people of      Burma need the world's help.                          ____________________
