Speaker, I rise to congratulate Rev. Jonathan Leslie Weaver on his thirtieth pastoral anniversary with the Greater Mt. Nebo African Methodist Episcopal Church in Bowie, Maryland. Throughout the past three decades, Rev. Weaver has been ministering to a growing community of worshippers in Bowie and the greater Washington metro area. I've been honored to know him, to call him a friend, and to work closely with him to strengthen our communities in Maryland's Fifth District.  Since 1988, Rev. Weaver has overseen both the expansion of his church and a plethora of charitable endeavors through more than fifty ministries serving its members and the wider community. These have included programs to prevent domestic violence, to empower families through economic literacy, and to combat hunger. Under his guidance, Greater Mt. Nebo A.M.E. Church members have participated in Christmas in April, Tools for School, and other social service projects. Rev. Weaver has also carried his ministry across the ocean, visiting Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Benin to engage in mission projects there for more than a quarter century.  As National President of the Collective Empowerment Group, Rev. Weaver has helped build a network of churches across seven states and the District of Columbia that host financial literacy seminars, educational programs, health care screenings, and homeownership clinics. The Collective Empowerment Group also partners with banks and local businesses to facilitate wider access to economic opportunities for those living in their communities. I have participated in a number of Collective Empowerment Group programs, and I can attest to the wonderful work the organization performs to help families reach for the American Dream.  Rev. Weaver holds degrees from Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri; St. Mary's Seminary in Baltimore, Maryland; and Harvard Business School in Cambridge, Massachusetts. When he arrived at Greater Mt. Nebo A.M.E., the church had 100 members; today, he has overseen its growth to more than 1,600 members. It is a testament to his vision, his inspiration, and his faith. Rev. Weaver also has overseen the construction of the community's present church building as well as its Christian Academy school and Family Life and Wellness Intergenerational Center assisted-living facility.  I hope all my colleagues will join me in congratulating Rev. Weaver and his wife, Pamela Lynn Weaver--who have two daughters and four grandchildren--on reaching this milestone. I thank them both for their work and spiritual guidance to so many in Maryland's Fifth District and for their friendship over the years.                          ____________________
