President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous consent that the Injunction of Secrecy be removed from the following convention transmitted to the Senate on May 1, 1998, by the President of the United States: Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions (Treaty Document No. 105-43). I further ask that the convention be considered as having been read the first time; that it be referred with accompanying papers to the Committee on Foreign Relations and ordered to be printed; and that the President's message be printed in the Record.
