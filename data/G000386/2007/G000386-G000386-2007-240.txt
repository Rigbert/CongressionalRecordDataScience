 President, once again, as a leader of our party on the Finance Committee, I come to the floor to discuss one of the important tax issues that must come before Congress. That is the alternative minimum tax. I am sure many have noticed that the alternative minimum tax is frequently the subject of my many speeches. They may be wondering how long I intend to keep talking about it. The simple answer is I intend to keep talking about it--meaning the alternative minimum tax--until this Congress actually takes some action. Instead of taking action, this Congress has done absolutely nothing. The problem continues to get worse for millions of Americans who will be caught by the alternative minimum tax and are now being caught. It is this ``now being caught'' that I wish to emphasize, because when I speak about those now being caught by this alternative minimum tax, I am referring to those families who make estimated tax payments and who will be making their second payment for this quarter this Friday.  Last year, 2006, 4 million families were hit by the alternative minimum tax. This was 4 million too many. Of course, it is considerably better than what we know for the year we are in right now, when 23 million Americans, mostly middle class, will be hit by the alternative minimum tax. The reason we are experiencing this large increase this year is that in each of the last 6 years, Congress has passed legislation that temporarily increased the amount of income exempt from the alternative minimum tax. These temporary exemption increases have prevented millions of middle-class Americans from falling prey to the alternative minimum tax until now. While I have always fought for these temporary exemptions, I believe the alternative minimum tax ought to be permanently repealed because it was never meant to hit the middle class--and it is hitting the middle class--and because the class of people it was intended to hit, the superwealthy, are finding ways of getting around what was thought to be a bright-light idea in 1969. It is hitting maybe a few hundred people, finding that superrich class not even paying the tax. So it isn't serving the purpose it was intended to serve, and it will hit middle-class Americans who were never intended to be hit by it by 23 million this year.  One reason I have previously given for permanent repeal is it may be difficult for Congress to revisit the alternative minimum tax on a temporary basis every year, as we have for each of the last 6 years. From January 1 of this year until now, when the second quarterly payment is going to be made, proves me right, because nothing has been done. So the new Congress has yet to undertake any meaningful action on the alternative minimum tax. Several proposals have been tossed around by the other body, meaning the House of Representatives. I have discussed a few of them in my earlier speeches. I generally find these proposals lacking but completely agree with my colleagues that something needs to be done, at least I seem to agree. Despite assurances that the alternative minimum relief is an important issue, nothing has actually been put forward as a serious legislative solution.  This chart I am going to put up reflects how the alternative minimum tax has been handled by this Congress so far. It is kind of a smoke-and-mirrors example that I use because we have had numerous proposals talked about, but that is all, just talk. An academic discussion is not in any way a serious substitute for real action this Congress ought to take, as tomorrow people making their quarterly payments will attest to.  I have also come to realize the best way to learn about new proposals that deal with the alternative minimum tax is not to check for the new legislation in the Congressional Record but to check the daily newspaper. In the course of reading the Washington Post last Friday, I came across another trial balloon--I emphasize ``trial balloon''--for a new idea about the alternative minimum tax that was printed in the business section of the newspaper. A lot of people were out of town on Friday, so I ask unanimous consent that the article entitled ``Democrats Seek Formula to Blunt Alternative Minimum Tax'' be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Washington Post, June 8, 2007] Democrats Seek Formula To Blunt AMT; One Plan Would Impose Surtax of                        4.3% on Richest Households                          (By Lori Montgomery)       House Democrats looking to spare millions of middle-class      families from the expensive bite of the alternative minimum      tax are considering adding a surcharge of 4 percent or more      to the tax bills of the nation's wealthiest households.       Under one version of the proposal, about 1 million families      would be hit with a 4.3 percent surtax on income over      $500,000, which     would raise enough money to permit Congress to abolish the      alternative minimum tax for millions of households earning      less than $250,000 a year, according to Democratic aides and      others familiar with the plan.       Rep. Richard E. Neal (D-Mass.), chairman of the House      subcommittee with primary responsibility for the AMT, said      that option would also lower AMT bills for families making      $250,000 to $500,000. And it would pay for reductions under      the regular income tax for married couples, children and the      working poor.       All told, the proposal would lower taxes for as many as 90      million households, and Neal said it has broad support among      House leaders and Democrats on the tax-writing House Ways and      Means Committee. ``Everybody's on board,'' he said.       Neal has yet to release details of the plan, however, and      others inside and outside the committee say major pieces of      it are still in flux. Some Democrats say Neal's plan      stretches the definition of the middle class too far,      providing AMT relief to too many wealthy households. They      argue that the cutoff for families to be spared from the AMT      should be lower, at $200,000, $150,000 or even $75,000.       ``There is consensus to make sure that we have some      responsible tax policy that will also treat taxpayers fairly.      No one ever expected to be caught in the AMT making 75      grand,'' said Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Calif.), a Ways and      Means Committee member whose Los Angeles district is      populated by working poor. ``We're trying to come up with a      fix that does right by the great majority of Americans who      fall into the middle class.''       The debate has focused attention on a different surtax      proposed by the Tax Policy Center, a joint project of the      Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution. That plan      would eliminate the AMT and replace it with a 4 percent      surcharge on income over $200,000 for families and $100,000      for singles, cutting taxes for 22 million households and      raising them for more than 3 million.       ``Our plan is as simple as can be. And only 2 percent of      the whole population would have to pay it,'' said Leonard E.      Burman, director of the Tax Policy Center. The plan has the      added benefit of abolishing the complicated AMT at all income      levels, Burman said, an approach some lawmakers find      attractive.       On the other hand, fewer families' taxes would be cut,      diminishing the ability of Democrats to capitalize on the      plan politically. Since they took control of Congress in      January, Democrats have made repealing or scaling back the      AMT a top priority in hope of establishing tax-cutting      credentials and seizing the issue from Republicans for the      2008 campaign.       The alternative minimum tax is a parallel tax structure      created in 1969 to nab 155 super-rich tax filers who had been      able to wipe out their tax bills using loopholes and      deductions. Under AMT rules, taxpayers must calculate their      taxes twice--once using normal deductions and tax rates and      once using special AMT deductions and rates--and pay the      higher figure.       Because the AMT was not indexed for inflation, its reach      has expanded annually, delivering a significant tax increase      this spring to an estimated 4 million households. The AMT      would have spread even more rapidly after President Bush's      tax cuts reduced taxpayers' normal bills, but Congress      enacted yearly ``patches'' to restrain its growth. The most      recent patch expired in December, and unless Congress acts,      the tax is projected to strike more than 23 million      households next spring, many of them earning as little as      $50,000 a year.       House Democrats want legislation to spare those households      while also lowering the bills of many current AMT payers. But      they face numerous obstacles. In the Senate, Finance      Committee Chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.) favors AMT repeal but      considers it too ambitious for this year. Baucus has said      another year-long patch is more likely.       In the House, some Democrats argue that more time is needed      to explain the issue to the public. The vast majority of      households have yet to pay the AMT and may not fully      appreciate the value of eliminating the tax, while the      wealthy are sure to feel the bite of a new surtax.       ``I don't think there's enough of an understanding right      now that you've got this tidal tax wave about to hit      everybody,'' said Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), a Ways and      Means Committee member who is also chairman of the Democratic      Congressional Campaign Committee. ``From a political      perspective, we need to lay the groundwork.''       Before the Memorial Day break, Ways and Means Committee      Chairman Charles B. Rangel (D-N.Y.) said he hoped to announce      an AMT proposal as soon as Congress returned to Washington.      But his timetable has slipped to late June, Democratic aides      said, with the issue set to go before the full House sometime      in July.       Republicans generally oppose new taxes on the wealthy,      saying they disproportionately affect small businesses, but      are waiting to hear more before deciding whether to work with      Democrats or offer their own plan to abolish the AMT.       ``House Democrats are going to have to find their sea legs      on this issue fast,'' said Rep. Phil English (R-Pa.), the      senior Republican on the Ways and Means tax subcommittee.      ``Folks seem to be launching a lot of trial balloons, and      it's all very festive. But I don't have enough really to      react to yet.''
