President, I believe we have now completed our business today. When the Senate completes its business today, it will stand in adjournment under the provisions of H. Con. Res. 235 until the hour of 12 noon on Monday, January 24, 2000, for the opening of the second session of the 106th Congress.  I ask unanimous consent that following the quorum call and the routine housekeeping matters, the Journal of the proceedings be approved to date, the morning hour be deemed to have expired, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and the Senate then begin a period for the transaction of routine morning business until 2 p.m., with Members permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each.
