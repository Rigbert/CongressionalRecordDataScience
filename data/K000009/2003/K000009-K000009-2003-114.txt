The focus of this article is looking at the United States and our role in the Middle East and Central Asia. Though I cannot read the entire editorial tonight, I thought it had some excellent observations that are important for the American people to hear. It is often helpful to have a country from the outside looking at us, rather than us looking out at the world.  Mr. Siddiqui writes that a superpower like the United States would find it somewhat easy to defeat an incidental power like Iraq, but to do so not only for its publicly stated reasons, fighting terrorism, liberating Iraq and triggering a domino effect of democratization of the Middle East.  But, he observes, the real American agenda is now only becoming clearer. The conquest of Iraq, he says, is enabling a new Pax Americana, the exertion of American power. That goes well beyond control of oil, though that surely remains a central enterprise.  He points out that America is pulling out of traditional bases of allies like Saudi Arabia and Turkey, and probably doing so because of the rising conservative backlash in those countries to our very presence. He mentions that U.S. relations with Egypt have been placed upon the back burner; Egypt, of course, being the most populace Islamic and Arab country.  It is no accident that the three nations, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Egypt, are the region's most populous, but that America's newest partners are some of the most thinly populated, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman and the United Arab Emirates, all as well tightly controlled monarchies.  People are a problem for America, he observes in the Arab and Muslim world. They are bristling with anti-Americanism, principally over the Israeli-Palestinian dispute, which remains unresolved.  He points out that the pullout just announced by the Bush administration of 10,000 U.S. troops from a Saudi air base was long overdue, but it so embarrassed the ruling House of Saud, which had to place it very far away from public view at a remote base in the desert.  I would point out in a way I was very disappointed that the Bush administration announced this current withdrawal so quickly, because Osama bin Laden has been given a victory. Osama bin Laden on 9-11 said to us that he wanted the infidels out of Saudi Arabia, and, among others, he was referring to U.S. troops based on Saudi soil. Why did we have to give him that victory? I think that helps to ripen terrorism globally.  The article goes on to say that the kingdom with the world's largest oil reserves, Saudi Arabia, and the highest output, will lose clout as America now controls the second largest reserves in the world in Iraq. And he states that America now has a vise grip on the region with 14 new post-9-11 bases, from eastern Europe, through Iraq, the Persian Gulf, Pakistan and Afghanistan, to the two Central Asian republics of Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan.                              {time}  2000  The singular feature of all those new allies, he says, is that they are weak states. Most are undemocratic, if not repressive. So America is replicating its failed model of using unrepresentative regimes to suppress people, but doing it on new turf. He says this short-term gain, therefore, of victory in Iraq may come at the expense of long-term pain and rising terrorism, as he sees America determined to install its own puppet regime in Baghdad with the majority Shiites being shunted aside.  He then comments on the Bush administration quietly cozying up to a most notorious terrorist group, the leftist Mujahideen-e-Khalq in Iraq, and he questions why would the Bush administration even want to do that, a terrorist group that killed Americans when we were having difficulties in Iran.  Taken together, he says, these American moves bear an uncanny resemblance to the British colonial enterprise of nearly a century ago which is still being paid by the people there. As America confronts this new world in the Middle East and Central Asia, it is worth reading Mr. Siddiqui's very perceptive comments.                          ____________________
