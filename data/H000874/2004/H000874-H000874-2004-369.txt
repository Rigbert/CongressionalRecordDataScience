 Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I really anticipate next week's process to resemble years past. I do not want to presuppose what the Committee on Rules would do, but I would think that we would likely have an extended general debate in the neighborhood of 4 or 5 hours.                              {time}  1430  In addition, the Committee on Rules could and will likely make in ordermultiple substitutes, and assuming that they are legitimate budget resolutions, and we will have a very vigorous debate.
