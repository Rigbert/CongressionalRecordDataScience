President, there is an easy way out of this. Let's don't make it complicated. Let's go ahead. He will have an amendment to this bill, have a vote on that. I will record myself as voting no. It will pass. I am sure it will pass. Everybody agrees, as far as Judge Bryant and Rosa Parks are concerned, that we want this to happen today. But I will object to that in terms of UCing it. I want to have a vote, and I will be recorded no. That solves the problem.
