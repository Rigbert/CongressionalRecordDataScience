 Bill Paxton. Mayor Paxton has been a vital partner of mine in our efforts to bring economic development to the Paducah region, improve the quality of life for its residents, and represent their interests in public service. Paducah could not ask for a finer mayor than Bill Paxton.  Now it's my sad duty to report to my colleagues that after 12 years in office, Mayor Paxton is retiring. And although Kentuckians will miss his steady hand at the helm of leadership, no one can say Bill Paxton has not given more than his share of dedication and commitment to the people of his city. And we all certainly wish him the very best as he leaves the mayor's office and moves on to his next endeavors, where I am sure he will find much success just as he has in public service.  It would take too long for me to describe everything we've worked on together over the years, but I'll mention a few. For several years we worked together to bring economic growth to downtown Paducah with a new riverfront marina development. After a long road marked by the occasional setback, the Paducah Riverfront and Marina groundbreaking ceremony took place last month. The new riverfront will spur job creation and serve as a public space for all of Paducah's residents to enjoy.  For years, Mayor Paxton has been indispensable on a host of issues affecting the Paducah gaseous diffusion plant and its hard-working employees.  Bill has also been crucial in efforts to create the Paducah River Discovery Center, improve the Paducah Area Transit System, and upgrade local law-enforcement and safety resources such as the Public Safety Mobile Data System, which allows police and other emergency personnel to share and coordinate information.  And I can't forget Bill's leading role in designating the National Quilt Museum, located two blocks from the Ohio River in downtown Paducah, as the National Quilt Museum of the United States. As one of the most popular tourist attractions in the Bluegrass State, it regularly brings over 100,000 visitors yearly from all 50 States and 40 countries.  One of Bill's biggest successes over the last 12 years is the Lower Town revitalization project. Lower Town, a Paducah neighborhood that is rich with history but had become dilapidated with neglect, became the focus of renewal for city government under the mayor's vision.  Revitalization efforts focused on creating an awareness of Lower Town as a cultural center for the arts and an accessible retail environment friendly to local businesses. Now, a decade later, this project has been successful, yielding much renovation of local historic buildings and new construction, luring more than 75 new artists and businesses to Lower Town, and bringing over $30 million in private investment in the area.  Bill was born and raised in Paducah. Prior to serving three terms as mayor, he was elected to Paducah's city commission in 1998. It was a family tradition, as his father, William F. Paxton Jr., had also served on the city commission. As a private citizen, Bill worked for 30 years in the banking industry. Bill is also one of the few mayors in Kentucky to serve two terms as head of the League of Cities, proving his talents are appreciated not just in Paducah but across Kentucky.  I have been pleased to get to know both Bill and his wife, Lucy, over the years and am proud to call them close friends. I am sure that Lucy; their two children, Christina Paxton Cassetty and William F. Paxton IV; and many other beloved friends and family members join me and Elaine in saying we are proud of Bill Paxton's record of accomplishment as mayor, and we wish him the best in his well-earned retirement. He is one of Kentucky's most distinguished citizens and public servants.                          ____________________
