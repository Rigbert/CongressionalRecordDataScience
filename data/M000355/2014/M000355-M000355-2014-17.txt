 President, I rise today to honor the life of Mr. Jeff E. Caudill--a veteran and tireless public servant who passed away last month at the age of 84.  Jeff was born in a log cabin in Viper, KY, on January 20, 1930. In order to help support himself and his family, he began work in the coal mines with his father and brothers at the age of 14.  Without a formal education past the seventh grade, Jeff decided to join the U.S. Army, where he proudly served his country for 22 years throughout both the Korean and Vietnam wars.  After his retirement from the military, Jeff moved back to Kentucky where he continued his service to the community in other ways. Throughout London, KY, he is known as ``Santa Jeff.'' Jeff was afforded this nickname in part because his white beard gave him the ability to play the part during the Christmas season, but also because he could be counted on to serve his community in all seasons.  Jeff was known to organize clothing and food drives, make hospital visits to the sick and elderly, and captain the Honor Guard at military funerals. Whatever he could do to better the lives of others, you could count on Jeff to deliver.  Jeff Caudill's life of service to his country, community, and family set a shining example for us all to follow. Therefore, I ask that my U.S. Senate colleagues join me in honoring this exemplary citizen.  The London-area publication the Sentinel-Echo recently published an article detailing the life of Mr. Caudill. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Sentinel-Echo, Nov. 17, 2014]                            Remembering Jeff                           (By Nita Johnson)       One of the founding members of the Laurel-London Optimist      Club and ``Santa Jeff'' died suddenly at his home Friday      morning.       Jeff Caudill, best known for his efforts in founding the      local Optimist Club and for his many years of portraying      Santa Claus in the annual Christmas parade, had ongoing      health problems. In recent years, he had suffered two strokes      and a heart attack as well as kidney failure. His wife      Shirley said Caudill had breakfast Friday morning and was      planning his usual daily activities when he had ``a massive      heart attack'' that ended his life.       Caudill, 84, was instrumental in establishing the Laurel-     London Optimist Club. For many years, he hosted a Halloween      party at his home, giving away bicycles and cooking for      children of all ages--the predecessor of the current Optimist      Club Halloween party held each year. He served as president      of the local organization several times including twice as      the Honor Club and again as vice president. He served as Lt.      Governor for the Kentucky-West Virginia region and was named      Optimist of the Year both locally and throughout the      district. He was presented with a Lifetime Achievement Award      in 2008 for his years of dedicated service to the Optimist      Club.       Caudill was also known throughout the community as ``Santa      Jeff'', posing with children at Walmart for yearly Christmas      pictures. He was hand-picked by former London-Laurel County      Chamber of Commerce executive director Randy Smith to portray      Santa Claus in the Christmas parade--a job that Caudill      thrived on each year. One year, however, Caudill was      hospitalized and was on life support and could not fulfill      his Santa duties.       ``The day of the parade, he had big tears running down his      face,'' his wife said. ``That's the only Christmas parade he      ever missed, once even putting on his Santa suit 10 days      after having surgery.''       In fact, Caudill had just had his Santa suit dry cleaned in      preparation for this year's Christmas parade. His bag was      already half-full of candy canes that he always gave out to      children.       ``He was one of 16 children. They didn't have Christmas,''      Shirley said. ``He didn't get candy or clothes or toys.      That's why he worked so hard to make sure other children had      a Christmas.''       Caudill spent 22 years in the U.S. Army, 14 of which were      overseas. He served in Korea in 1947 before going to Japan a      year later. He was wounded during a battle but continued to      serve his country, moving his family to various military      posts across the world. After discharge, Caudill was      considered 100 percent disabled, but he continued to honor      military heroes through the Disabled American Veterans      organization where he served on the Color Guard and      participated in military funeral tributes.       Funeral arrangements for Jeff Caudill were pending at      London Funeral Home at press time Friday. Burial will be held      at Camp Nelson in Jessamine County. The family asks that in      lieu of flowers, donations be made to the Jeff Caudill      Optimist Scholarship fund to assist local students in their      college costs.                          ____________________
