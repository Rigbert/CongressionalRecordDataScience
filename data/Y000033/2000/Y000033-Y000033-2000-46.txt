Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, this is not about the whistleblowers. These were people that divulged information; they were not the whistleblowers, and this constant smoke screen actually disturbs me, because nobody read the report.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Brady), who also sat on the committee that had these oversight hearings.
