President, I am pleased to introduce the Fair and Independent Judiciary Act of 2006 because ensuring a fair and independent judiciary is critical to the system of checks and balances established in our Constitution. This legislation seeks to preserve the public confidence that our Federal courts enjoy, and that our courts need to adequately fulfill their constitutional role in our system. Revelations that judges and justices are receiving gifts from parties that may appear before them or have a financial interest in a litigating party undermine the public's trust.  For the past 4 years, editorial boards across the country have called our attention to the appearance of impropriety that occurs when Federal judges accept gifts and attend lavish private seminars sponsored by well-heeled corporations. I have proposed similar legislation in previous Congresses to address the problem of private judicial seminars. Last year, despite my ongoing concerns about reports of judicial activities that undermine public confidence, I withheld these provisions from a judicial pay raise bill. I had hoped that the Federal judiciary would engage in self-regulation on these timely and substantive ethical issues. Unfortunately, recent press reports show continued appearances of impropriety, even by a member of the Supreme Court. This legislation does not prohibit judges and justices from attending educational seminars. Instead, it simply requires them to learn and disclose the private sponsors of the seminars and make that information public. Then, they would be allowed to attend the seminars, but at the court's expense, instead of having special interests pick up their tabs.  Another issue that threatens to undermine confidence in our judicial impartiality was highlighted at the recent hearings for Judge Alito. Some judges fail to monitor their financial holdings so that they can properly recuse themselves from cases where there may be a conflict of interest. One way to be sure that the recusal laws Congress enacted are being followed by all Federal judges is to allow more transparency of a judge's financial conflicts. This legislation contains a provision to improve the public's access to the recusal lists that all judges keep within their chambers or clerks' offices.  Because the public's trust is at stake, it is important to require that private seminar providers fully disclose the litigation interests of their sponsors and to improve access to judicial conflicts. The American people deserve a Federal judiciary that is beyond reproach--in appearance, and otherwise. The Fair and Independent Judiciary Act seeks to ensure continued public confidence in our Federal courts. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows.                                S. 2202         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives      of the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
