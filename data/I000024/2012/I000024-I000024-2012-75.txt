So we have 35 Members of the Senate who have stated they would object if it is brought up before the Senate this year.  So with these items I referenced included as a part of the Record, I would like to say that something isn't going to happen this year. It could be they want to bring it up, and that is up to the leader. If he desires to do so, of course, he could do it. If it does come up, it will take a lot of time from other business that this body should address.  With that, I would only say there are some 35 Members--and many more I might suggest--who would vote against it should it come up.  I have used my time, and I yield the floor.
