Chairman, I do not vote for the supplemental bills very often, and I give great credit to the new chairman of the Committee on Appropriations, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Young) and to our new Speaker, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hastert). Several weeks ago they began to figure out how they are going to get the votes to pass this bill, and they sort of looked at, I guess, the list of folks who have traditionally opposed these bills, and they called a meeting, and they said: Why? And I said: Well, my reasons are real easy; three of them:  One, they are not usually emergency supplementals; ought to be regular order, they ought to go the regular process. Two, they are never paid for; and, three, there is usually so much pork in some of those bills that it makes us sick, and I said, ``O for three; that's why I vote against them,'' and, to the credit of the chairman of the committee they are really batting three for three. It is paid for, theywhittled out some of the stuff that was in there that really was not an emergency, could be taken care of, and there was not a single bridge or armory or anything in there that someone might be able to call pork.  For those reasons I am voting for this bill this afternoon, and I would not only encourage my colleagues to vote for this bill, but also send a warning to our friends on the other side of this building. As I understand it, their bill is already larger; as I understand it, their bill is not paid for; and third, we can start hearing those words ``su wee'' for the pork that some of the Members on that side of the body have put in this bill that has got to be taken out, and I hope that our passage of the bill this afternoon proves our point: Batting three for three; not even Sammy Sosa can do as well.
