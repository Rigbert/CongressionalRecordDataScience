 One of the things I appreciate about so many colleagues on this side of the aisle is that they said: Well, if we are not going to hear from these providers, like the hospitals, in the committee, we are going to go out to the country and listen to them. I have had townhall meetings throughout rural Oregon, as my colleague Senator Merkley has had. The rural hospitals, which are the economic engines of so many rural communities, are opposed to this legislation.
