The Senator is correct. After that debate, I sent a letter to the two major farm organizations in Illinois, the Illinois Farm Bureau and the Farmers Union. I said: You don't have to name names, but can you give me an example of somebody who lost a family farm because of the estate tax? They could not come up with one in my State.  I readily concede that there are sacrifices that have to be made to pay the estate tax. But the doom and gloom stories we hear from them are stories you have heard over and over. With the Senator's amendment, if they were worried about family farms or family businesses, they would have jumped all over his amendment. But it is not; it is about the people who are at the highest end of the spectrum, who have an appreciation of stock, or the appreciation of some capital asset and they finally face taxation for the first time. That isn't unfair. Families and businesses across America pay their fair share of taxes. Why do we want to exempt the wealthiest in our society at the expense of tax benefits that would help with the cost of health insurance, care for the cost of college education, and deal with prescription drugs? Those are the areas I think, frankly, in which the vast majority of Americans would applaud us for dealing with the problems they face.
