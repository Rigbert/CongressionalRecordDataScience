 The Senate will also begin debate on the motions to instruct conferees with respect to the deficit reduction bill. Members are reminded that we will have stacked votes on Wednesday morning and they should plan their schedules accordingly. We have a lot of work to finish this week and we will need the cooperation and patience of all Members to complete our work before Christmas.                          ____________________
