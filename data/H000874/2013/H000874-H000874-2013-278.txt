 The Editorial Board of USA Today was scathing yesterday in its assessment of where the blame for this sequester should lie, and I quote:       No Members of Congress should be surprised at the havoc      wrought by the sequester. After all, they caused it, and      Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood repeatedly warned them      about its sentences.  But flight delays are just the tip of the iceberg visible above the water line for most Americans. As time goes on without a big, balanced deficit solution to replace the sequester, more of that iceberg will surface. More Americans will be negatively affected.  While I want to end these delays for passengers in Maryland and across the country, I will oppose this bill because it fails to address the whole impact of the sequester.  Let me share just a handful of examples of how the sequester will affect Americans:  Education: Head Start--70,000 children will be kicked out of Head Start. Nothing in this bill deals with them.                              {time}  1110  Furloughs to cause delays in processing retirement disability claims. Nothing in this bill deals with them.  Nutrition for Vulnerable Populations--4 million fewer Meals on Wheels for seniors; 600,000 people dropped off WIC. Nothing in here for them.  Housing--125,000 fewer HUD rental assistance vouchers. Nothing in here for them.  Unemployment Insurance--emergency unemployment insurance cut 11 percent for 2 million out-of-work Americans. Nothing in here for them.  FDA--2,100 fewer food safety inspections, an 18 percent cut; longer waits to approve new drugs. Nothing in here for them. Nothing in here for them.  Defense and Homeland Security--furloughs equivalent to 1,000 fewer Federal agents, FBI, Border, et cetera, on the job; one-third of combat air units are grounded. Nothing in here for them.
