 President, I wish to congratulate the European Union for its decision yesterday to begin membership talks with six countries, five of them in Central and Eastern Europe.  Mr. President, as anyone who has followed my numerous statements on NATO enlargement knows, I have frequently criticized the European Union for not moving speedily enough toward its own stated goal of enlargement. The EU's announcement that it will begin talks early next year with Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Poland, and Slovenia is welcome for several reasons.  First of all, it recognizes that these are the countries that have already made the most progress in meeting the EU's demanding economic and political qualifications. Five other prospective candidates--Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, and Slovakia--now realize that they have more work to do.  Second, the naming of five Central and East European countries for the next round of EU enlargement in itself will add to the emerging European security architecture, along with the other web of ties connected with EU membership.  Third, the naming of Cyprus to the list of prime candidates for EU membership should help to move the parties on that island to a final, equitable solution that eliminates the division of the country, which has persisted for twenty-three years.  I do not underestimate the complexity of accession negotiations as the European Union concurrently moves toward ``an ever closer union.'' Nonetheless, I hope that the talks with the six prime candidates will move speedily so that they can join the European Union before the end of this century.  Again, I congratulate the European Union on the step it has taken.                          ____________________
