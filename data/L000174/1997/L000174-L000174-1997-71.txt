President, this has been an extraordinary week in Washington with the first State visit by the Chinese leadership since 1989. While President Jiang Zemin's visit has resulted in important agreements on economic, environmental and security issues between our two nations, it has not resulted in the hoped for progress on human rights issues in China.  Yesterday, I spoke about Ngawang Choephel, a Tibetan scholar and documentary filmmaker who was a Fulbright scholar at Middlebury College in Vermont. In 1995 he had gone to Tibet to document traditional Tibetan music and dance when he was detained by Chinese authorities and then sentenced to 18 years in prison for allegedly spying on behalf of the Dalai Lama. No evidence to support these claims has ever been produced, despite my persistent inquiries. Nor have the Chinese authorities provided any information about Mr. Choephel's whereabouts or health status over the past two years. I have raised these concerns with President Jiang directly, emphasizing to him that Mr. Choephel's release from prison would be a meaningful step in the right direction on human rights issues. Yesterday and today in meetings with the Chinese President, I raised this human rights issue, again.  The gulf between our two countries can most clearly be seen on the issue of human rights. This week demonstrates the distance between our two countries in another way as the Senate considers President Clinton's nomination of Bill Lann Lee to be the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Civil Rights Division at the U.S. Department of Justice. When confirmed, Bill Lee will be the principal law enforcement officer of the Federal Government to ensure the civil rights and equal treatment of all Americans. He will also be the first Asian-American to hold this post and exercise such authority.  A meaningful step the Senate should take without delay is to confirm Bill Lee, a Chinese-American whose life story and life's work are quintessentially American. At the same time we are urging the Chinese Government to improve their human rights' record, we should demonstrate through action and not just words our own commitment to human rights and civil rights by proceeding without further delay on this important nomination.  Mr. Lee was born in Harlem to Chinese immigrant parents. His parents ran a laundry in New York. He went on to graduate from Yale College magna cum laude and then Columbia Law School. He testified last week that his childhood experiences, which included hearing racial slurs directed at his parents and his father's inability to rent an apartment after returning from volunteering for military service in World War II, greatly influenced his decision to dedicate his life to civil rights work. Mr. Lee's efforts over the years have ensured Americans of all races and creeds opportunities to advance in their careers, remain in their homes and raise healthy children.  Since July, Senator Kennedy and I repeatedly urged the committee to hold a hearing on Mr. Lee's nomination before the Columbus Day recess in order to give this important nomination an opportunity to be considered by the Senate this year. Unfortunately that hearing only took place last week. Chairman Hatch has consistently indicated his commitment to getting this nomination considered before adjournment.  At the hearing, Mr. Lee answered hours of questions. The Republican members of the committee and the majority leader also submitted pages of written questions to him, which have also been answered. All members of the committee have met or had the opportunity to meet with the nominee personally. Unfortunately there was no business meeting of the Judiciary Committee this week. I have asked the chairman to report this nomination to the Senate without delay and hope that he will do so.  Bill Lee is a nominee who has impressed everyone with whom he has met. He is a man of integrity who has practiced mainstream civil rights law for 23 years. He is a practical problem solver, as attested to in tributes from opposing counsel and people from both political parties.  Chairman Hatch has clearly indicated that he views Bill Lee as imminently qualified for the Assistant Attorney General position at Department of Justice. At Mr. Lee's nominationhearing last Wednesday, Senator Hatch referred to Bill Lee's ``long and distinguished career'' and noted his ``commitment to improving the lives of many Americans who have felt the sting of invidious discrimination.'' These comments are encouraging.  Senator Hatch has been stalwart in moving a number of top Justice Department nominees through the committee promptly. As examples, I point to the nomination of Eric Holder to be the Deputy Attorney General, Ray Fisher to be the Associate Attorney General, and Joel Klein to be the Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division.  In connection with the confirmation of Assistant Attorney General Klein, Senator Hatch said:  ``I believe it is neither fair nor wise to hold a nominee hostage because of such concerns, especially one as competent and decent as Joel Klein. In my view, sound public policy is best served by bringing this nominee up for a vote, permitting the Justice Department to proceed with a confirmed chief of the Antitrust Division, and for us in Congress to move forward and work with the Department and other involved agencies in the formulation and implementation of telecommunications policies.''  ``There are times when I disagree with the President, but I have to say when he does a good job and when he does nominate good people . . . then I will support the President.  ``I will do what I can to show support for him and to encourage him to continue to pick the highest quality people for these positions.''  Adhering to that policy should lead us to a prompt and favorable vote on Mr. Lee.  At the recent nomination hearing of Ray Fisher, Senator Hatch assured the administration that ``nominees for the Department of Justice will continue to receive thorough and prompt consideration by the committee.'' I am hopeful that Senator Hatch will apply this same standard to Mr. Lee's nomination.  I look forward to the vote on Bill Lee, a stellar nominee to head the Office of Civil Rights at Department of Justice. Mr. Lee's recent decision to recuse himself from any involvement in the Proposition 209 case further reflects his integrity and forthrightness on these sorts of matters.  Bill Lee's story is a true American saga. Raised by immigrants, in one generation he has risen to the top of his profession and is now being considered to head the Nation's civil rights division. Let us make sure the story ends the way it should--with the confirmation of Mr. Lee as Assistant Attorney General before we adjourn this session.                          ____________________
