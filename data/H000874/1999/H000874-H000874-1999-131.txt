We threw the dice in 1981 and said we are going to balance the budget; we are going to cut $750 billion in taxes. And lo and behold we thought we were going to cut spending. But what happened? For 12 years Presidents Reagan and Bush suggested that we increase spending. And they asked for more spending over those 12 years than the Congress appropriated. We quadrupled the national debt and we pushed down our kids and their generation and the generations to come.  The point of this special order is to say, let us not do it again. Let us not gamble on that surplus existing. Let us take it prudently and apply it to reduction of debt, saving of Social Security, stabilizing and ensuring Medicare, and investing in our national defense and other domestic priorities, to the extent that we can, so that the next generation of Americans to come will say, ``That was a fiscally responsible generation, and, as a result, our economy continued to grow, to create jobs and opportunities for our young people and good times for our families.''  The gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Taylor) talked about families, many of whom serve in the military. We need to take care of them before we take care of those who have so much.  Madam Speaker, I hope, we all hope, that tomorrow, or whenever that tax bill is brought to the floor, that we look the American public in the eye and tell them honestly, ``We will manage your money so that your debt will be reduced, your economy will remain strong, and the fiscal management of America will continue to be responsible.''                          ____________________
