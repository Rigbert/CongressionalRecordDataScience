Mr. Speaker, I want to compliment the gentleman and the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy], for this legislation.  I strongly support H.R. 3219. I can suggest as one who has lived, worked and loved with the American natives in Alaska, I have watched the present program in housing not work. We have had housings in Alaska that were under Government control that had such audacity as to say you could not put a storm porch in Nome, AK, on federally built housing because it did not meet their code or did not meet their design.  I do not know how many have been to Nome, AK, but the wind blows about 84 miles an hour off the Bering Sea. It is an example to take into consideration of the native people up there and their needs or their designees and what should or should not be done.  I think there is another example of what we can do with the diminishing dollars we have and get a better result of what we are trying to accomplish. That is provide housing to the American natives. I hope some of you have an opportunity to go into some of the areas with the American natives and see some of the poor housing that does exist today. Many of you have seen pictures on TV about the Third World countries. We have housing actually under Government control, probably some of the most deplorable housing that exists in the United States today on not only the reservations but off the reservations such as in Alaska and the Alaska Natives.                              {time}  1245  The need is well and overwhelming. I think this legislation, in fact I know this legislation, is an improvement, and I hope that it will solve many of the housing problems that the American natives have faced over the years. It is wrong in our Nation when we have a trust responsibility to American natives that they have not had the flexibility that this bill provides, so I want to compliment the authors and the people that have worked on this legislation, as I do think they have addressed the issues very well in this legislation. And this will work; we will have much better housing.
