Grace Nash passed from this life to be with her Savior on Friday, March 16, 2007 at the age of 52 years.  A native of Jamaica, Grace Nash graduated from the University of Findlay in 1978. She settled in Bowling Green, Ohio and dedicated her career to elder advocacy. She was the activities director for the Wood County Committee on Aging for 22 years until her retirement, when she took on the challenge as executive coordinator of the Ohio Association of Senior Centers. Grace was talented, giving, and truly invested in the lives of the older adults she served and the younger adults she mentored. Her tenure with the Wood County Committee on Aging was marked by a dynamism and professionalism which was unmatched.  Spirituality was woven into the very fibers of Grace's life, and she was the administrator of her congregation, New Life Pentecostals of Toledo Church. Her pastor described her perfectly: Grace ``was passionate, she was a dreamer, she had lots of energy, and she was very spiritual. The people who knew her called her Amazing Grace.'' Indeed she was. With quiet dignity, a ready smile and a helping hand, Grace embodied her name.  Grace Elizabeth Nash leaves a legacy to all whose lives she touched, and many who did not have the privilege of knowing her. Among the people who were so privileged, she will be missed. We extend our heartfelt condolences to them, and especially her brother, sisters, nieces and nephews. May they find comfort in their memories and the gift of Grace's life.                          ____________________
