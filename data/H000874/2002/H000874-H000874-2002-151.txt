Speaker, since last year's terrorist and anthrax attacks, Capitol Police officers have faced extraordinary challenges. For months after the attacks, most worked twelve-hour shifts, six days a week, to assure that Congress could continue its work. Such grueling shifts were required even with help from the District of Columbia National Guard, whose members stood watch with our Police for five months. The Guard has resumed its normal duties, and the twelve-hour shifts have eased, but Capitol Police still confront extraordinary challenges.  Unfortunately for Congress, its staff and visitors, Capitol Police also confront extraordinary opportunities--to seek employment elsewhere. As trained law-enforcement professionals, Capitol Police officers are always in demand by other law-enforcement agencies. However, in these times of heightened security, overall demand for trained personnel has never been higher. As a result, the Capitol Police are losing officers at an alarming rate. As of June 1, the Capitol Police had already lost 78 officersto other law-enforcement agencies in fiscal 2002, and had three more such separations pending. This is more than twice the number lost on average to other agencies during the last three years. If this rate continues, the Capitol Police will by September 30 have lost 122 officers to other agencies. This does not include retirements and separations for other reasons. This tremendous attrition comes as Capitol Police strive to increase manpower to recommended levels.  One federal agency in particular, the new Transportation Security Agency, is attracting trained officers from the Capitol Police and elsewhere to serve as sky marshals and other airport-security officers. TSA is offering compensation that can surpass the pay of the average Capitol Police officer by more than 80 percent. An 80 percent pay raise is tough for anyone to refuse.  There is no doubt that TSA's work is vital. But the security of the Capitol complex is also vital. Congress has a responsibility to take every reasonable step to ensure that the Capitol Police can attract and retain the people needed to make the Capitol safe, so today, the distinguished chairman of the House Administration Committee (Mr. Ney) and I have introduced the Capitol Police Retention, Recruitment and Authorization Act. In addition to sundry authorization matters, the Act proposes a number of reasonable steps to reduce Capitol Police attrition and encourage recruitment.  First, the bill would schedule 5 percent pay raises for each of the next five years for officers through the rank of captain. Raises for higher-ranking officers would be discretionary with the Capitol Police Board. This provision would give officers who may be considering leaving the prospect of regular increases for the foreseeable future. The bill would also increase from six to eight hours the amount of annual leave earned per pay period by all officers with at least three years' service.  Second, as a matter of fundamental fairness, the bill would authorize the Board to make whole officers adversely affected during the recent months of sustained overtime by the limits on Sunday, holiday and other premium pay. This provision will restore to the officer roughly $350,000 that they earned but could not receive due to those limits. The bill authorizes extra pay for officers in specialty assignments as determined by the Board, and lets the Board hire experienced officers and employees at salaries above the minimum for a particular position, as needed.  Third, the bill also provides important new benefits for officers. It authorizes establishment of a tuition-reimbursement program for officers taking courses on their own time leading toward a degree in law-enforcement field, and authorizes bonuses upon completion of such degrees. This will give officers ongoing opportunities for professional improvement, which should lead to more rapid advancement. For Congress, it will create a more educated and better Capitol Police force.  To help provide manpower needed to avoid the punishing overtime of recent months, the bill authorizes bonuses for officers and employees who successfully recruit others to join the force, encouraging the entire agency to become recruiters. It allows the Board to employ retired federal law-enforcement officers without reduction to their annuities, and temporarily extends the mandatory retirement age from 57 to 59, but only through fiscal 2004, by which the Police intend to reach full strength.  Finally, the bill recognizes that as important as these tangible benefits are, there are other, less tangible aspects that can make a job more interesting, and help persuade veterans to remain and others to seek it. The bill encourages the Chief of Police to deploy officers in innovative ways that maximize their opportunities to rotate among the various posts and duties, be cross-trained for specialty assignments, and generally to utilize fully the skills and talents of individuals. This will do much to enhance the appeal and satisfaction of the job, and make retention and recruitment easier. If done smartly, it will also make the Capitol, and those who visit and work here, much more secure.  I urge my colleagues to support this important measure.                          ____________________
