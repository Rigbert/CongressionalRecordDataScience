Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds.  I include in the Record three letters in support. The National ElectricalContractors Association has a letter of support. The National Taxpayers Union has a letter of support, as well as the National Association of Manufacturers.                                               National Electrical                                      Contractors Association,                                      Bethesda, MD, July 18, 2017.     Hon. Paul Ryan,     House of Representatives,     Washington, DC.       Dear Speaker Ryan: On behalf of the National Electrical      Contractors Association (NECA), I am writing in strong      support of H.R. 2883, Promoting Cross-Border Energy      Infrastructure Act which would establish a more uniform and      transparent approval process for the construction,      connection, operation, or maintenance of oil or natural gas      pipelines or electric transmission facilities for the import      or export of oil, natural gas, or electricity. NECA also      supports H.R. 2910, Promoting Interagency Coordination for      Review of Natural Gas Pipelines Act, which would help address      the need to modernize the nation's natural gas pipeline      infrastructure by promoting more timely and efficient reviews      by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). NECA      believes these critical pieces of legislation will facilitate      construction projects along the United States' borders and      encourage energy independence.       NECA is the nationally recognized voice of the $130 billion      electrical construction industry that brings power, light,      and communication technology to buildings and communities      across the U.S. NECA's national office and its 119 local      chapters are dedicated to enhancing the industry through      continuing education, labor relations, safety codes,      standards development, and government relations. NECA is      committed to advocating for a comprehensive energy policy      that addresses all available opportunities for energy      exploration and independence.       By establishing a more concrete process for the approval of      construction projects to import oil, natural gas, and      electricity, this legislation would create more jobs in the      construction industry while working towards America's energy      independence. Construction along the U.S. border to import      oil, natural gas, and electricity will greatly enhance our      nation's energy security and promote energy independence. It      is clear Congress plays a critical role in streamlining the      approval process and enacting policies that support approval      and construction of energy infrastructure projects. The      benefits of these projects are clear: job creation, energy      security, energy independence, and economic growth; such      construction is in the national interest. NECA strongly      endorses H.R. 2883 and H.R. 2910 and believes that these      bills will deliver many benefits to our nation.           Sincerely,                                      Marco A. Giamberardino, MPA,     Executive Director, Government Affairs.                                  ____                                     National Taypayers Union,                                    Washington, DC, July 18, 2017.                  National Taxpayers Union Vote Alert       NTU urges all Representatives to vote ``YES'' on the      following bills that would reduce regulatory burdens and      promote economic growth.       H.R. 806, ``Ozone Standards Implementation Act of 2017'':      This legislation would extend the timeframe for compliance      with the 2008 and 2015 ozone standards and put in place      process reforms going forward. The bungled 2008/2015      revisions have created an implementation headache for many      states, now tasked with simultaneously working to enact dual      standards. The costs are high for states and localities--     regardless of whether they achieve attainment. Nonattainment      means lost funds for highways and other essential      infrastructure projects. On the other hand, reaching      attainment could require limits on new construction and      manufacturing production, expensive retrofitting, and      oppressive new rules. Either way, jobs and investment will go      elsewhere without the more feasible, predictable reforms in      H.R. 806.       H.R. 2883, ``Promoting Cross-Border Energy Infrastructure      Act'': This legislation would streamline the archaic cross-     border permitting process for energy facilities that stretch      across the borders we share with Mexico and Canada. The      current Presidential Permit regime is far from clear and can      leave projects in regulatory limbo for years on end. Creating      a consolidated and standardized approval process would      increase the Congressional accountability provided for in      Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution, granting Congress      the authority to ``regulate Commerce with foreign Nations,''      while eliminating costly regulatory hurdles that stand      between consumers and low-cost energy options.       H.R. 2910, ``Promoting Interagency Coordination for Review      of Natural Gas Pipelines Act'': This legislation would      facilitate the timely review of natural gas pipeline      permitting by clearly designating the Federal Energy      Regulatory Commission as the lead agency responsible for      interstate natural gas pipeline site permitting. This, along      with other measures to increase efficiency such as providing      for concurrent reviews and commonsense timetables, would help      avoid duplication and other unnecessary delays. In addition,      H.R. 2910 would increase transparency in the permitting      process through more public disclosure, as well as create new      opportunities for public input.       In general, markets crave certainty in order to anticipate      where resources should be allocated. This is doubly true for      the giant infrastructure and manufacturing projects these      bills address. Planning, personnel, and capital all depend on      a transparent, predictable, consistent regulatory process.      Together, these reforms would result in increased investment      in our energy infrastructure, spurring job-growth in an      essential and lucrative sector of our economy, and enhancing      low-cost energy options for consumers.       Roll call votes on H.R. 806, H.R. 2883, and H.R. 2910 will      be included in our annual Rating of Congress and a ``YES''      vote will be considered the pro-taxpayer position.       If you have any questions, please contact NTU Federal      Affairs Manager.                                  ____                                              National Association                                             of Manufacturers,                                                    July 19, 2017.       Dear Representatives: The National Association of      Manufacturers (NAM), the largest manufacturing association in      the United States representing manufacturers in every      industrial sector and in all 50 states, urges you to support      H.R. 2910, the Promoting Interagency Coordination for Review      of Natural Gas Pipelines Act, introduced by Rep. Bill Flores      (R-TX).       Domestic natural gas has transformed the U.S. economy, made      our companies more competitive, created jobs and put money      back in the pockets of working Americans. Manufacturers use      natural gas as a fuel for direct process uses, such as      drying, melting, process cooling, machine drive and      refrigeration; as a fuel for direct non-process uses in      manufacturing establishments, such as heating, ventilation,      HVAC and lighting; as a fuel for indirect purposes, such as      boilers used to produce electricity and steam; and as a      feedstock in refining, chemicals and primary metals sectors.      Over the next decade, total demand for natural gas is      projected to increase by 40 percent. Domestic manufacturing      is poised to be a key driver of this growth. Consequently,      major investments in new pipeline infrastructure are required      to ensure manufacturers have a steady, reliable stream of      natural gas.       Unfortunately, permitting these infrastructure projects      remains a lengthy process. Permitting should follow a      comprehensive process that ensures timely and predictable      decision-making, but federal and state permitting agencies      can create roadblocks and delays when coordination is      inadequate. Strengthening the Federal Energy Regulatory      Commission's (FERC's) coordination of interagency processes      is critical to the permitting of natural gas infrastructure      and ensuring manufacturers have access to this affordable      resource.       H.R. 2910 would reinforce FERC's role as the lead agency      for siting interstate natural gas pipelines by directing FERC      to identify and invite all agencies considering an aspect of      an application to establish a schedule for concurrent      reviews, and to impose deadlines for final decisions. H.R.      2910 would ensure projects undergo a robust agency review      while completing that review in a timely and predictable      manner.       The NAM's Key Vote Advisory Committee has indicated that      votes on H.R. 2910, including procedural motions, may be      considered for designation as Key Manufacturing Votes in the      115th Congress.       Thank you for your consideration.           Sincerely,                                                Aric Newhouse,                                            Senior Vice President,                                  Policy and Government Relations.
