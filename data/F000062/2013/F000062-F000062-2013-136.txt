 President, I rise today to introduce the Asia-South Pacific Trade Preferences Act of 2013, a bill to promote economic growth, democracy, and political stability in some of the world's poorest countries.  This legislation will provide duty-free and quota-free benefits for garments and other products similar to those afforded to beneficiary countries under the African Growth and Opportunity Act, AGOA.  The countries covered by this legislation are 13 Least Developed Countries, LDCs, as defined by the United Nations and the U.S. State Department, which are not covered by any current U.S. trade preference program: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, Kiribati, Laos, Maldives, Nepal, Samoa, Solomon Islands, East Timor, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.  These countries are among the poorest in the world with the bulk of their citizens living on less than $1 a day.  Despite this widespread poverty, their exports are subject to some of the highest U.S. tariffs, averaging around 16 percent.  In fact, these developing countries pay a disproportionate share of U.S. tariffs.  Bangladesh, for example, is the 9th largest contributor of U.S. tariffs even though it is the 46th largest source of U.S. imports.  Cambodia is the 12th largest contributor of U.S. tariffs but ranks as the 60th largest source of U.S. imports.  So, in essence, these two developing countries pay more in U.S. tariffs than many European countries. How is that fair or consistent with our values?  Unfortunately, the United States is the only developed nation that has not provided an enhanced trade preference program to the beneficiary countries in this bill.  Indeed, we maintain duty preference programs for Haiti, the countries of sub-Saharan African and other developing countries and rightly so. These programs are critical components of our efforts to provide hope for millions of people struggling with poverty.  But it makes no sense to exclude other countries at the same level of economic development. We should not hesitate to correct this inequity.  This is not about pitting one developing country against the other. Rather, it is a simple matter of fairness andensuring that we help all of those in need.  In fact, this effort goes hand in hand with my long-standing support for a strong and effective foreign aid budget for the United States as an essential tool in helping lift these countries out of poverty and put them on the path to economic prosperity and political stability.  Especially in these difficult fiscal times, however, humanitarian and development assistance should not be the sum total of our efforts.  Make no mistake: these programs help stabilize poor and war-torn countries, save lives, and lay the foundation for future prosperity.  Yet, the key for sustained growth, jobs, and rising standards of living will be the ability of each of these countries to create vital export industries to compete in a free and open global marketplace.  It is clear that the textile and apparel industries in many of the Asia-South Pacific countries in this bill are those industries that hold out the best hope for export growth.  We should help these countries help themselves by opening the U.S. market to their exports as we have done for other developing countries in the past.  By doing so, we will demonstrate the best of American values: reaching out to neighbors in need and helping them to stand on their own two feet.  We will also help ourselves.  First, as these countries become more prosperous, we will see new opportunities for our own exports in their growing markets.  This, in turn, will create jobs and economic growth in our own country.  But if we maintain high tariffs on imports from the Asia-South Pacific countries, those opportunities will likely go to the European Union and other developed countries that already have trade preference programs for these countries.  We should not put ourselves at such a disadvantage.  Second, as the Asia-South Pacific countries become more stable politically, we will help protect U.S. national security interests by preventing failed states which could become breeding grounds for terror.  There is no doubt in my mind that the cost of lowering tariffs on the imports of textile and apparel products from the Asia-South Pacific countries is far less than any military intervention.  We will also help ourselves by securing partners in the fight against global threats such as terrorism, climate change, the HIV/AIDS pandemic, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  U.S. leadership is essential in those efforts. But they require a global, multilateral response. As these countries grow, they can assume a larger role and contribute more effectively.  When it comes to our national security, every bit of assistance helps.  Finally, at a time of economic uncertainty, by eliminating tariffs on imports from the Asia-South Pacific countries, this bill will help lower prices for the American consumers and provide them with more options.  It will also help the 3 million American workers whose jobs depend on apparel imports.  There is no doubt in my mind that the Asia-South Pacific Trade Preferences Act is a win-win for the U.S. and the Asia-South Pacific countries.  Now, let me address some of the concerns that may be raised about this bill.  First, many of the Asia-South Pacific countries have struggled in the past with corruption, a lack of democracy, human rights abuses, and the absence of rule of law.  Some may ask: why reward these countries with a trade preference program?  Make no mistake. These countries will not automatically receive the trade benefits provided by this legislation.  This legislation has been drafted to ensure that the benefits are granted on a performance-driven basis.  That is, to be eligible, a beneficiary country must demonstrate that it is making continual progress toward establishing rule of law, political pluralism, the right to due process, and a market-based economy that protects private property rights.  So, this legislation would help promote democracy, human rights, and the rule of law while sustaining vital export industries and creating employment opportunities.  The beneficiary countries have a clear incentive to stay on the right path or they will lose the benefits of this bill.  If we ignore any problems, we will sustain the status quo and our efforts will fail.  Finally, whenever we discuss the creation of a new trade preference program, understandable concerns are raised about the impact on domestic manufacturers.  If this bill becomes law, however, the impact on U.S. jobs will be minimal.  Currently, the beneficiary countries under this legislation account for only 4 percent of U.S. textile and apparel imports, compared to 24 percent for China, and 72 percent for the rest of the world.  These countries will continue to be small players in the U.S. market, but the benefits of this legislation will have a major impact on their export economies.  By passing this legislation we will have an opportunity to change lives, protect our national security interests, and help the American consumer. We should seize this opportunity.  I respectfully ask for the support of all my colleagues for this important initiative.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.                          ____________________
