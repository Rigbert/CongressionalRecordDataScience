 President, on behalf of the majority leader, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session to consider the following nominations on the Executive Calendar: Calendar Nos. 77, 82-89, 94-97, 113, 114, and all nominations placed on the Secretary's desk in the Navy and Coast Guard.  I further ask unanimous consent that the nominations be confirmed, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table, any statements relating to the nominations appear at the appropriate place in the Record, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and that the Senate then return to legislative session.
