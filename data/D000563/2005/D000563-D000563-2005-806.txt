President, last week, we marked National Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Awareness Day. Today, I rise to join Senators Johnson, Murkowski, Murray and Dodd as we introduce legislation to address the prevention and treatment of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Disorders.  I have met with many families in Illinois who have made real for me the challenges, the frustrations and the hope that come with a fetal alcohol syndrome disorder. Vivian Botka brought a picture that her 22-year-old daughter Kristy had colored with crayons. Kristy requires around-the-clock care. Walt Teichen and his family are working to build an independent living home for young adults affected by fetal alcohol syndrome. They want to establish a home for young people such as their son Kevin, who craves independence from his parents yet needs the support and vigilance of adults who understand his limitations.  Last year, then-Minority Leader Tom Daschle proposed the most ambitious, comprehensive plan in America's history to advance FASD research, treatment, and prevention. I am honored to join my colleagues as we introduce this legislation because, as Senator Daschle says, it is easier to raise a healthy child than heal a broken adult. It is more compassionate and, in the end, more cost-effective to prevent FASD and help families living with it than it is to ignore it.  To decrease the occurrence of mental retardation and birth defects, we must address their most preventable cause--alcohol use during pregnancy. FASD affects an estimated 40,000 infants each year. That is 1 out of every 100 birthsin the United States. The mental, physical and neurobehavioral effects of FASD include deformities in major organs, slow development, learning difficulties, low IQs, and problems with coordination, memory, attention, and judgment.  We can make a difference in the lives of affected families in Illinois and throughout this country. We can prevent fetal alcohol syndrome disorders. Please join me in supporting the Advancing FASD Prevention and Treatment Act.                          ____________________[Pages S10184-S10185]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                    FETAL ALCOHOL SYNDROME DISORDERS
