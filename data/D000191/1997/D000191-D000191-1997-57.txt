  Mr. DeFAZIO. Madam Speaker, we have got the great bipartisan budget deal, a balanced budget with generous tax cuts. If it seems too good to be true, do you know what? It is.  This is not a new day in Washington, DC. This is business as usual. Cutting up a fat hog, made wildly optimistic assumptions about the economy and revenues, cut social programs a little. Do not take a penny out of the Pentagon and give a host of generous tax cuts slanted toward the most wealthy in America and the largest corporations. A deal written behind closed doors announced last night; no written copies available to Members of Congress, nothing available for review, but it will be voted on tomorrow night, just to be certain that no one knows the details before the details leak out and it begins to stink like the Potomac in August.                          ____________________
