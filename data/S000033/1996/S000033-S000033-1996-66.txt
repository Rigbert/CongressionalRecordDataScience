 Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to do two things. First, I would like to enter a colloquy with the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Regula], and then I am going to offer an amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to enter into a colloquy with Mr. Regula regarding an issue that is very important to the State of Vermont and others interested in conservation and sustainable agriculture. Unfortunately, this bill does not provide funding for the Marsh-Billing National Historic Park that is located in Woodstock, VT. The planned opening for this park is 1998, and the administration's budget included $340,000 in startup funding.  My understanding is that the gentleman would support funding for this historic park should the Senate include funds specifically for this purpose.
