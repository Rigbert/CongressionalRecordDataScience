 President, today I am pleased to join with Senators Specter and Feingold in introducing the Equal Justice for U.S. Service Members Act. The act would eliminate an inequity in current law by allowing all court-martialed U.S. service-members who face dismissal, discharge or confinement for a year or more to petition the U.S. Supreme Court for discretionary review through a writ of certiorari.  The bill is a simple one, and would do the following: It would allow a writ of certiorari to be filed in any case in which the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces has denied review; and it would allow a writ of certiorari to be filed in any case in which the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces has denied a petition for extraordinary relief.  All persons convicted of a crime in U.S. civilian courts today, including illegal aliens, and regardless of the crime they may have committed, have an absolute right to petition the U.S. Supreme Court for discretionary review if they lose in the court of appeals. By contrast, however, our men and women in uniform do not share this same right as their civilian counterparts. Our military personnel can apply to our highest court on direct appeal for a writ of certiorari only if the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces actually conducts a review of their case, or grants a petition for extraordinary relief. That happens only about 10 percent of the time.  In other words, the other 90 percent of the time, our U.S. servicemembers are precluded from ever seeking or obtaining direct review from the highest court of the country that they fight and die for.  A disparity not only exists between our civilian and military court systems. A similar disparity exists even within our military court system itself. The Government routinely hasthe opportunity to petition the Supreme Court for review of adverse court-martial rulings in any case where the charges are severe enough to make a punitive discharge possible. But our military personnel do not share these same rights to petition the Supreme Court as their opponents, even on the other side of the same case.  That is wrong, and this inequity was recently noted by the American Bar Association. At its annual meeting in August 2006, the ABA House of Delegates passed a resolution calling on Congress to fix this long-standing ``disparity in our laws governing procedural due process.''  That is perhaps reason enough to fix this problem, but I also must note that this existing disparity has only become more acute now that Congress has enacted the Military Commission Act. Section 950g(d) of that law, which Congress passed last September, gives the Supreme Court the ability to review by writ of certiorari any final judgment issued by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, in an appeal filed by terrorists and war criminals who get convicted by U.S. military commissions.  So the worst of the worst at Guantanamo will have a right to petition our Supreme Court to hear their case. Yet unless we act, those same Supreme Court doors will continue to be closed to almost all of our U.S. service personnel who would seek direct review in their own highest Court. Even service-members who apprehended those same terrorists, or served in judgment on their military commissions, or who guard them at Guantanamo, will continue to be treated as second-class citizens, deprived of the opportunity to seek Supreme Court review if they ever need it themselves.  Our U.S. service personnel regularly place their lives on the line in defense of American rights. It is simply unacceptable for us to continue to routinely deprive our men and women in uniform of one of those basic rights, the ability to petition their Nation's highest court for direct relief, that is given to all convicted persons in our civilian courts, that is given to their prosecutorial adversaries in our military courts, and that we have now given even to the terrorists we expect to prosecute as war criminals in our upcoming military commission process.  It is time to give equal justice to our U.S. servicemembers. That is what this act does.  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.  I ask unanimous consent the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2052       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
