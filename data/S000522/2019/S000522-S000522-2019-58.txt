Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from Puerto Rico (Miss Gonzalez-Colon).  Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico. Mr. Speaker, I think this is a very important bill, and I am proud to support H.R. 1837, the United States-Israel Cooperation Enhancement and Regional Security Act, that will make our bilateral security and economic cooperation stronger and more stable than ever before.  On September 14 of 2016, the U.S. and Israel signed a memorandum of understanding ensuring $33 billion of military and strategic support over a 10-year period.                              {time}  1630  It reaffirmed the importance of continuing annual U.S. military assistance to Israel, our cooperative missile defense programs, in addition to other shared economic and technology interests.  The bill before us codifies that assistance for the next 10 years, while providing us with the flexibility to increase that support should Israel be under an imminent threat of a military attack.  It strengthens Israel's qualitative military edge and advances our collaboration on a range of issues, such as cybersecurity and space exploration, as well as authorizing $12 million for the U.S.-Israel Energy Center and, through USAID, advances our common goals of promoting agriculture, education, and trade with other countries around the world.  As our strongest and most capable ally in a turbulent region, Israel is an essential U.S. strategic partner.  Israel is also a target for hostile actors who call for her destruction. Just 2 months ago, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hamas terrorist groups launched over 600 rockets and mortars at Israeli civilian targets, killing four and wounding eight. May was Israel's deadliest month in almost 2 years.  In addition to the threat coming from these terrorist groups, Israel faces a threat of a resurgent Iran, whose militias and proxies, from Iraq to Syria to Lebanon, continue to grow in numbers, weapons, and strength.  Just recently, Chairman Deutch and I heard firsthand from Prime Minister Netanyahu some of these complex and serious existential challenges that seek to undermine our strategic ally.  Mr. Speaker, it is now more important than ever that the United States stand with the democratic Jewish State of Israel and what she represents, which is freedom, democracy, and equality in that region. For that, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill.
