 President, I rise to state my strong support for the Federal Judgeship Act of 2009.  I am an original cosponsor of this bill, and I think it is a critical bill for good government.  The bill would create new judgeships in circuit and district courts where they are badly needed.  In the U.S. Courts of Appeals, it would create 9 new permanent and 3 new temporary judgeships.  In the U.S. District Courts, it would create 38 new permanent and 13 new temporary judgeships.  When caseloads get too heavy, the quality of justice in our Nation suffers.  Victims of crime are forced to endure long periods of waiting for justice to be done. Citizens are unable to resolve their civil disputes promptly; plaintiffs face long delays in getting damages or restitution for harms they have suffered. Morale plummets for judges and other court staff.  I have seen this in my own state, where judges in three of the four Federal districts are overwhelmed with case filings.  Let me tell you about one district in particular.  In the Eastern District of California, each Federal judge carried a caseload last year of over 1,000 weighted filings.  The Judicial Conference of the U.S. recommends that Congress create a new judgeship anytime a district reaches a caseload of 430 cases per judge. But in the Eastern District, the number exceeds 1,000.  The situation has become so dire that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has stepped in. Last summer, the Chief Judge of the Ninth Circuit sent a letter asking every judge in the Circuit to volunteer to hear approximately 25 cases from the Eastern District to try to get the caseload down.  The court has literally brought in Federal judges from all over the country to help deal with the crushing workload. District judges from Alaska, Alabama, and Washington State, as well as from Los Angeles and Oakland, handled hundreds of cases in Sacramento and Fresno last year. A senior Ninth Circuit judge from Los Angeles handled hundreds more.  The help is welcome but it is not nearly enough. You see, the problem in the Eastern District is not a temporary one.  The Eastern District is home to Sacramento, Fresno, and the Central Valley. In 2008, the District included 18 of California's 25 fastest growing counties.  The District is also home to 19 of California's State and Federal prisons and to 100,000 of the State's 167,000 prisoners. Since Congress last created a new permanent judgeship in the District in 1978, prisoner filings have skyrocketed 700 percent.  The result is that the judges are severely overworked and justice for everyone is delayed. Civil litigants in the District are facing delays of approximately 42 months--that's 3-and-a-half years--from filing to verdict.  The situation, put simply, is unacceptable.  In 1992, Congress did authorize a 10 year temporary judgeship for the District, but that judgeship expired and despite repeated efforts by Chairman Leahy, Senator Boxer, and myself, it has not been renewed.  In the meantime, for the last 12 years, every time the Judicial Conference has surveyed the U.S. Courts it has said that the Eastern District needs more judges, but new judgeships have not been created.  The Federal Judgeship Act of 2009 that Chairman Leahy has introduced today would finally provide a solution. It would authorize four new permanent judgeships and one new temporary judgeship in the Eastern District.  This would almost double the number of judges in the District by changing from 6 to 11 judges and would substantially reduce the caseload and delays.  This is a necessary solution to a real problem.  But the Eastern District is only one example. There are plenty of others. As I said, the Judicial Conference recommends that Congress create a new judgeship whenever there are 430 weighted filings per U.S. District Judge. But according to the 2009 survey of the courts, in the Northern District of California, the judges are handling 624 weighted filings per judge; in the Central District of California, it is 551 per judge; in the Middle District of Florida, it is 569 per judge; in the Southern District of Florida, it is 549 per judge; in the Southern District of Indiana, it is 594 per judge; in the District of Minnesota, it is 743 per judge; in the Eastern District of Texas, it is 674 per judge; in the Southern District of Texas, it is 543 per judge; and in the Western District of Texas, it is 650 per judge.  So this is a problem in courts across the country; and it is up to Congress to craft a solution.  The last time Congress passed a comprehensive bill to create new judgeships was in 1990. Since that time, case filings across the country in the federal appeals courts have increased by approximately 45 percent, and filings in the district courts have increased by 27 percent.  The current situation in the courts is not sustainable.  Neither the Eastern District of California nor any other Court should be forced to rely on temporary visits from colleagues who generously offer their help. Districts should have enough judges to handle their caseloads on their own.  This Federal Judgeship Act of 2009 is based on recommendations made by the Judicial Conference after an extensive review of case filings and caseload trends in every federal circuit and district court across the country.  It is time for Congress to act and give the federal courts the resources they need to ensure a fail and timely trial for every civil and criminal litigant.  I strongly urge my colleagues to support this bill.                          ____________________
