President, both the distinguished senior Senator from Pennsylvania and I have been tied up much of today in a matter involving wiretapping of Americans and other issues. We will be going back to that. I know the Senator from Pennsylvania is returning to the committee.  I am going to ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Illinois be able to have the floor for up to 30 minutes following me.  Before I make that request, if I may have the attention of the Senator from Pennsylvania or the Senator from Tennessee, I am going to make the request that the Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin--we are all at the same hearing--that the Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, who has a position different to that of mine and the Senator from Pennsylvania, that he be recognized for up to 30 minutes once I complete my comments, unless, of course, either of the leaders object.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). Is there objection?
