 Throughout its 200 years, this southcentral Kentucky community has developed a rich heritage, and its weekend of celebrations this September is well deserved.  Edmonton was founded in 1818 and named after Edmund Rogers, who owned the land and laid out the town. The community became the seat of Metcalfe County at its formation in 1860. Today it is home to more than 1,500 Kentuckians, and Edmonton displays many of the best rural values and traditions of our Commonwealth.  Following the opening ceremonies of the bicentennial celebrations at city hall, there will be a parade throughout Edmonton, featuring floats carrying schoolchildren. There will be a wide range of events, celebrating the city's history and its promise for the future. From beard contests to antique car shows and from bicentennial skits to historical tours, there is something for everyone to enjoy.  The celebration will also feature a local talent showcase and a performance by a hometown band, ``The Kentucky Headhunters.'' After the show, attendees can watch a fireworks show to provide a fitting end of the bicentennial celebration.  I would like to join Mayor Howard Garrett and everyone in Edmonton in celebrating this occasion, and I would like to ask my Senate colleagues to help me commemorate this bicentennial anniversary.                          ____________________
