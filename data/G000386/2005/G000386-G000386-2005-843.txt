 President, I rise in strong opposition to the Schumer amendment which would make debts incurred in connection with violations of the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act nondischargeable in bankruptcy. This amendment has been a poison pill to enactment of the bankruptcy bill and must be defeated.  On two previous occasions, CRS performed research for us and told us that FACE debts had never been discharged in bankruptcy. Just recently, I asked CRS to perform an updated search on reported decisions considering the dischargeability of liability incurred in connection with violence at reproductive health clinics by abortion protesters. CRS confirmed that this amendment is not necessary.
