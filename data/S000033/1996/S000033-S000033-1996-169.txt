 Speaker, for the benefit of my colleagues I would like to have printedin the Record this statement by A.J. Ferriter, a high school student from Thetford, VT, who was speaking at my recent town meeting on issues facing young people.       For the last few months, I've been investigating lobbying      in Vermont, and found, much to my surprise, and delight, a      healthy lobbying system. The Disclosure Act purged many of      the ills affecting lobbying within Vermont, by virtually      stopping all underhand deals, while, at the same time, not      infringing upon our rights as Vermonters and U.S. citizens.       Yet we should not be content; problems still plague our      lobbying system. Fortunately, my investigations have brought      me in contact with district Representatives and state      Senators throughout Vermont, and without leading them on,      each district Representative and state Senator I spoke with      expressed one common concern: lobbying groups using tax      dollars to support themselves. This is not a problem with      profit-making organizations (which is businesses), because      they support themselves. It is a problem among non-profit      organizations . . . whose promoters are given the title,      ``advocate,'' instead of ``lobbyist.''       I am concerned with two issues in the way advocates use tax      dollars. The first is the use of financial support. Although      many groups use their funds properly, many do not. Instead of      using tax dollars to support their cause, the money is used      to support themselves. In other words, this money is given to      these organizations to support more administrative positions,      and more lobbyists. This money was given to aid a public      cause, not to support lobbyists.       Tax dollars paying for lobbyists' salaries is an alarming      issue. Even if the tax dollars are being used properly, ``is      it right,'' in the words of one state Senator, ``to use our      tax dollars against us?'' I do not believe it is. Take for      instance, community mental health, a group whose objectives I      support. Hypothetically, though, let's say I don't. If I      don't, then I am not going to want my money supporting their      programs; and if I speak out against them, they will just use      the money I pay the state in taxes to further support      lobbyists to speak out against me. So the more I speak out,      the more money I am eventually giving to lobbyists I'm      speaking out against. This is not encouraging.       Now, I'm not saying I am completely adverse to advocates,      and forcing them to have the same nominal status as      lobbyists. If they did, they might not receive the necessary      funds they need to stay alive and support the crucial issues      that they promote. Yet, if these human service, non-profit      groups were forced to have the same status as lobbyists who      represent profit-making organizations, then our tax dollars      would no longer be used to support their lobbyists.       I say, use our money to support their policies, but find      donations or something else to support your lobbyists. I      cannot stop the government from spending my money on programs      I'm not in favor of, but I should be able to stop the      practice of giving my money to support lobbyists, whether I      agree with their views or not. I believe a line must be drawn      somewhere. Thank you.       Congressman Sanders: Thank you very much, A.J. That's an      interesting presentation, and it's an issue that's being      dealt with in Congress, and in Montpelier as well. Let me ask      you a question: if I represent the tobacco industry--we heard      a presentation earlier about the problems of young people      smoking--and I represent the large cigarette companies that      have billions of dollars in resources, and I hire some of the      most sophisticated lobbyists in the country to knock on the      doors of members of Congress, or in the statehouses      throughout this country. I have plenty of money to do that,      okay?       Answer. All right.       Congressman Sanders: And I don't get any taxpayer dollars      to do that--I do that privately, all with the company's own      money. Then on the other hand, we have a group of young      people, say, who are concerned about the problems of smoking;      they also want to lobby. One has billions of dollars in      resources, the other side has very little money. How would      you deal with that issue, so that both sides have a short at      having their voices heard?       Answer. Would it be all right if you . . . rephrase your      question? I kind of got lost in there.       Congressman Sanders: Okay. Here's the problem that I want      to throw at you: He represents (he doesn't really) but let's      say hypothetically he's the head of a large tobacco company--     Philip Morris--and he has billions of dollars in resources.      He wants the U.S. Congress to not do anything to limit the      ability of the tobacco companies to make a lot of money. We      have another group of young people, who are concerned about      the impact of smoking on the health of their friends. They      also want to get involved in the political process. They      certainly don't have the resources--how do you deal with that      issue?       Answer. I mean, that's obviously a concern, that I feel is      valid. But I feel like if the young students are going up      [against] a tobacco giant here, they have to have some way of      being able to gain support throughout their communities. I      don't know if it would be sending letters out; I don't know      if it's public speaking. I'm not sure what it would be, but      it has to be something--obviously, they can't do it through      money, and . . . you bring up a good argument to my case. But      the thing is, the tobacco industries do have the money, and      it's a basic right to be able to lobby for what you want; and      so we cannot restrict that.       For these students, though, like I said . . . one of the      problems, I think, with lobbying is that a lot of it is not      made public. With some of the public hearings we've got      happening in Montpelier, there will be, let's say, an issue      on tobacco. And what will happen is that there will be a      lobbyist within the room so that he can tell his friends to      garner support for the lobbyists, and show up at the public      meeting. And the meeting is only 24 or 48 hours later, so      that way people don't advocate tobacco don't have the time to      just pick up their stuff and find an argument to oppose the      tobacco arguments.       Congressman Sanders: You make a good, an interesting point.      A lot of members of Congress and the legislature feel      resentful when publicly supported institutions then come and      lobby them, and that's the point that you're making. The      other side of the story is, that groups that do not need      public support--like the tobacco industry, or the chemical      companies--they have huge amounts of resources to lobby, and      in many ways therefore have an unfair advantage in terms of      people from the other point of view. So those are the two      sides of that argument.       Answer. Yeah, like I said . . . in the speech, we have to      support their cause, but I don't feel like--if I don't agree      with what these youngsters are saying, I don't want to have      my money going to support their lobbyists. Fine, the cause--I      can't control that, but control the lobbyists.                          ____________________
