 Madam Speaker, I agree with the gentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler) that this is a complicated bill, and it is an unusual procedure that we are bringing this matter before the House of Representatives tonight. However, if we do not deal with this issue, by the time we get around to having hearings and markups and debates and perhaps a conference committee this woman will have died, and that is why I think it shows the compassion of this House of Representatives and those who are supporting this bill to allow a Federal court to view whether or not this woman's civil rights, secured by the Constitution and laws of the United States, have been violated. I think she is entitled to have that kind of a Federal review before a final decision is made on whether to allow her to starve to death or to die of dehydration, and that is why we are here tonight.  It shows that the Congress can be compassionate, and it shows that we can deal with issues promptly, rather than saying oops, maybe something could have been done in the Federal court in a review of her Federal civil rights, but it is too late because she passed away.  Please pass the bill.  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
