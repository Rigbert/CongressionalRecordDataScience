 Madam Speaker, we have spent about an hour and a half today talking about how bad this problem is. The two previous bills were passed unanimously by voice vote.  There seem to be two arguments against the current bill. One is that the net might be too broad. That has been responded emphatically by putting a ``knowingly'' standard in so that somebody who is innocent will not be caught up if an advertisement for sex trafficking appears without their knowledge.  The second is the philosophical debate on mandatory minimum sentences. I think there are some crimes where there ought to be a mandatory minimum sentence. I know many of my colleagues sincerely disagree with that, but believe me, advertising kids--minor kids--for sex should be something that puts you in jail for some time.  I am glad this bill allows for life sentences in case of egregious offenses, but I think that even in ones that might be less than egregious, spending some time in jail will show this country and maybe others who may be tempted to get involved in this horrific business that if you are caught, you are going to spend some time.  Madam Speaker, I urge Members to support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
