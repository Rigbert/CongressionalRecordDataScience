President, I rise today to introduce the Reasonable Search Standards Act. This act prohibits racial or other discriminatory profiling by Customs Service personnel. Representative John Lewis from Georgia has introduced similar legislation in the House.  Two years ago, I requested a GAO study of the U.S. Customs Service's procedures for conducting inspections of airport passengers. The need for this study grew out of an investigation report by Renee Ferguson of WMAQ-TV in Chicago and several complaints from African-American women in my home state of Illinois who were strip-searched at O'Hare Airport for suspicion of carrying drugs. No drugs were found and the women felt that they had been singled out for these highly intrusive searches because of their race. These women, approximately 100 of them, have filed a class action suit in Chicago.  The purpose of the GAO study was to review Customs' policies and procedures for conducting personal searches of airport passengers and to determine the internal controls in place to ensure that airline passengers are not inappropriately targeted or subjected to personal searches.  Approximately 140 million passengers entered the United States on international flights during fiscal years 1997 and 1998. Because there is no data available on the gender, race and citizenship of this traveling population, GAO was not able to determine whether specific groups of passengers are disproportionately selected to be searched.  However, once passengers are selected for searches, GAO was able to evaluate the likelihood that people with various race and gender characteristics would be subjected to searches that are more personally intrusive, such as strip-searches and x-rays, rather than simply being frisked or patted down.  The GAO study revealed some very troubling patterns in the searches conducted by U.S. Customs Service inspectors.  GAO found disturbing disparities in the likelihood that passengers from certain populations groups, having been selected for some form of search, would be subjected to the more intrusive searches including strip-searches or x-ray searches. Moreover, that increased likelihood of being intrusively searched did not always correspond to an increased likelihood of actual carrying contraband.  Because of the intrusive nature of strip-searches and x-ray searches, it is important that the Customs Service avoid any discriminatory bias in forcing passengers to undergo these searches.  GAO found that African-American women were much more likely to be strip-searched than most other passengers. This disproportionate treatment was not justified by the rate at which these women were found to be carrying contraband. Certain other groups also experienced a greater likelihood of being strip-searched relative to their likelihood of being found carrying contraband.  Specifically, African-American women were nearly 3 times as likely as African-American men to be strip-searched, even though they were only half as likely to be found carrying contraband. Hispanic-American and Asian-American women were also nearly 3 times as likely as Hispanic-American and Asian-American men to be strip-searched, even though they were 20 percent less likely to be found carrying contraband.  In addition, African-American women were 73 percent more likely than White-American women to be strip-searched in 1998 and nearly 3 times as likely to be strip-searched in 1997, despite only a 42 percent higher likelihood of being found carrying contraband. Moreover, among non-citizens, White men and women were more likely to be strip-searched than Black and Hispanic men and women, despite lower rates of being found carrying contraband.  As with strip-searches, x-rays are personally intrusive and it is of particular concern that the Customs Service avoid any discriminatory bias in requiring x-ray searches of passengers suspected of carrying contraband.  GAO found that African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans were much more likely to be x-rayed than other passengers. This disproportionate treatment was not justified by the rate at which these passengers were found to be carrying contraband.  Specifically, GAO found that African-American women were nearly 9 times as likely as White-American women to be x-rayed even though they were half as likely to be carrying contraband. African-American men were nearly 9 times as likely as White-American men to be x-rayed, even though they were no more likely than White-American men to be carrying contraband. Moreover, Hispanic-American women and men were nearly 4 times as likely as White-American women and men to be x-rayed, even though they were only a little more than half as likely to be carrying contraband. And among non-citizens, Black women and men were more than 4 times as likely as White women and men to be x-rayed, even though Black women were only half as likely and Black men were no more likely to be found carrying contraband.  For these reasons, I am introducing the Reasonable Search Standards Act. This bill is a direct response to the concerns raised by the GAO report. The bill prohibits Customs Service personnel from selecting passengers for searches based in whole or in part on the passenger's actual or perceived race, religion, gender, national origin, or sexual orientation.  To ensure that a sound reason exists for selecting someone to be searched, the bill requires Customs Service personnel to document the reasons for searching a passenger before the passenger is searched. The only exception to this requirement is when the Customs official suspects that the passenger is carrying a weapon.  The bill also requires all Customs Service personnel to undergo periodic training on the procedures for searching passengers, with a particular emphasis on the prohibition on profiling. The training shall include a review of the reasons given for searches, the results of the searches and the effectiveness of the criteria used by Customs to select passengers for searches.  Finally, the bill calls for an annual study and report on detentions and searches of individuals by Customs Service personnel. The report shall include the number of searches conducted by Customs Service personnel, the race and gender of travelers subjected to the searches, the type of searches conducted--including pat down searches and intrusive non-routine searches--and the results of these searches.  With this proposed legislation, I call on the Congress of the United States to act, to make a commitment giving all persons entering and leaving our borders, regardless of gender, race, color,religion, or ethnic background, the right to be treated fairly.  Lyndon B. Johnson once said, ``I am a free man, an American, a United States Senator, and a Democrat, in that order.'' I am also all of these, in that order.  As a man, I am saddened that, in this new millennium, women and minorities are disproportionately selected for intrusive searches at our nation's borders.  As an American, I am deeply troubled by the thought that any citizen, or non-citizen, might be detained and stripped or x-rayed because of their gender or the color of their skin.  As a United States Senator, I am proposing legislation to prohibit racial or other inappropriate profiling and establish statutory procedures to track and prevent disproportionate search rates. This approval reflects our nation's basic posture of common sense and common justice.  I implore my colleagues to examine this issue from the viewpoint of the nation and its entire people. In the immortal words of John F. Kennedy, ``The rights of every man are diminished when the rights of one man are threatened.''                                 ______                                       (By
