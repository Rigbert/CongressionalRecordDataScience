 President, I want to speak in opposition to the amendment. I think the information the Senator from North Dakota wants, and wants in one document or one report, is a very legitimate bit of information, not just a small bit but a legitimate amount of information that he wants, and it is a reasonable request. I think a lot of it exists in the Department of Commerce and maybe it is just a case of bringing it all together. But that can't be the issue today. The issue today is, if we amend this bill, it goes back to the House, and then we are in a situation where we are not able to operate Government. We can't wait until the month of June to get a conference with the House on this issue. The Secretary of Treasury has made it very clear that he has taken all prudent and legal steps available to him to avoid reaching the statutory debt limit.  I urge everybody to vote against the amendment regardless of the merits.
