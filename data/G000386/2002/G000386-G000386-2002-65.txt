 President, I want to make a few comments about Senator Wellstone's amendment.  Ironically, I agree with Senator Wellstone's amendment, but also agree with some of the points made by my distinguished friends from Oklahoma and Texas.  First of all, I want to be clear that I agree with Senator Wellstone's purpose. As I have said repeatedly in public, companies should have their heartsin America. If they don't have their hearts in America, they ought to get their rear ends out of America. In my mind, this notion applies especially to Government contracts.  Mr. President, when the Finance Committee marked up legislation to shutdown corporate expatriation, I considered adding this Government contracting ban to the tax legislation. However, out of deference to the Governmental Affairs Committee, the committee with jurisdiction over Government contracts, I withheld. So, let's be clear that this matter is not a Finance Committee matter. Chairman Baucus and I moved legislation on this matter out of committee. If Government contracting were within Finance Committee jurisdiction, we would've addressed it.  Now, let me say that my friends from Oklahoma and Texas are correct in one respect. That is, the problem of corporate expatriation springs from our flawed international tax code. It needs to be reformed. I am committed to reform. In the meantime, we need to stop the bleeding of the U.S. tax base and not reward expatriate companies with Government contracts.
