Speaker, I would be glad to yield to my friend, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay), the majority leader, for the purpose of informing us of the schedule for next week.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Maryland for yielding to me.  Mr. Speaker, next week the House will convene on Monday at 12:30 p.m. for morning hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business. We will consider several measures under suspension of the rules. A final list of those bills will be sent to Members' offices by the end of this week. We may also consider one or more motions to go to conference. Any votes called on those measures will be rolled until 6:30 p.m.  On Tuesday and the balance of the week, it is likely that we will consider additional legislation under suspension of the rules. We also expect to consider three bills under a rule: S. 878, the Bankruptcy Judgeship Act; H.R. 5107, the Justice For All Act; and H.R. 10, the 9/11 Commission Implementation Act.  In addition, there are a number of potential conference reports that we are working through, including several appropriations bills, the American Jobs Creation Act, and the Department of Defense Authorization bill. Members should be aware that these conference reports may be brought to the floor at any time next week.  Finally, I would like to note, Mr. Speaker, that we are expecting to consider a second supplemental request for disaster relief sometime next week. We may have additional requests resulting from Hurricane Jeanne, so we are working through these requests and trying to figure out how best to address these needs.  Obviously, we are expecting a very busy week. Members should expect to work some late nights and possibly into Friday evening or Saturday as we resolve these important pieces of legislation.  I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I will be happy to answer any questions he may have.
