Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the passing of a great President and American, President Gerald R. Ford.  As I reflect upon the distinguished life and legacy of President Ford, the first things that come to mind are his honesty, integrity, and ability to make the tough decisions for a nation that was fiercely divided by war and recovering from a scandal at the highest level of government. He served with the best interest of America in mind, never losing sight of his faith, family, and his beloved roots in southwest Michigan.  President Ford was truly a Michigan original, and folks throughout our State saw an ordinary man become extraordinary; yet, he always remained our native son. His upbringing in Michigan molded the man that Gerry Ford became--growing up in an environment that encouraged him to pursue his vision of what America should and could be.  I have the great honor and privilege of representing some of the very same folks in southwest Michigan that President Ford did during his time in Congress.  All our hearts go out to Betty and the Ford children: Mike, Jack, Steve, and Susan during this difficult time.  His legacy continues to grow particularly as we see first hand the partisan divisions which divide our country and this Congress. President Ford was one that always put his country first and his party second.  President Ford was a remarkable man and an outstanding representative of the Wolverine State. Our Nation was blessed to have such a compassionate and steadfast leader and he will forever remain in our memory.  Farewell to our President. Go Blue.                          ____________________
