Chairman, I rise today to offer this amendment en bloc with my colleagues; Mr. Wynn of Maryland, Mr. Baldacci of Maine, and Mr. Sanders of Vermont. I have shared it with my friends on the other side of the aisle, and I believe it has their support.  This issue was recently brought to my attention by Colonel Culhane, chief of Rhode Island's State Police, who told me that State law enforcement agencies would not be eligible to receive any of the funding earmarked for police in cities and towns. Yet, Mr. Speaker, the State police provide many of the small and rural towns in New England, including Vermont and Maine, with critical police protection.  For example, in Exeter, RI, a small town in my district, there is no local police force. When a person dials 911, the State police receive the phone call, and State officers respond. In other towns like Richmond, RI, the local government cannot afford to operate a police force 24-hours a day, and the State police are called upon to fill the void.  Under current law, State police forces are eligible for COPS and prevention grant programs. According to the Justice Department, several State police agencies, including the Maine State Police, have applied for and received COPS funding.  We ought to be consistent in making these funds available for all law enforcement agencies that provide protection to our cities and towns. That is what my amendment would do. My amendment would restore eligibility for those State agencies that perform the same role as the local police departments that are eligible to receive funds under the block grant. It would give State law enforcement agencies a fair shake at getting the funding they deserve.  Although this amendment does not solve the problem completely, I believe it is a step in the right direction, and I hope to continue to work with Mr. McCollum as this bill goes to conference.                          ____________________
