 President, something I thought was ironic here, if you look at S. 240 it starts out and says:       A bill to amend the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, to      establish a filing deadline and [listen to this] to provide      certain safeguards to ensure that the interests of investors      are well protected.  Is that what this bill is really about? I submit that it is not. I hope the Members of the Senate will focus on this amendment because it has a lot of merit to it. It will strengthen this bill. It will strengthen the rights of victims in America, victims of securities fraud. I do commend my colleague from Nevada, Senator Bryan, for his cosponsoring this, and his leadership in this direction.                     [From Newsweek, June 26, 1995]                               Exhibit 1                       Losing Your Right To Sue? Congress may make it hard for you to pursue a case of securities fraud                         (By Jane Bryant Quinn)       Talk about a twist of fate. Rep. Christopher Cox, a      California Republican, wrote a tough, aggressive bill on      securities-law reform, which passed the House of      Representatives in March. If it becomes law, investors who      think they've been defrauded will find it incredibly hard to      bring a class-action lawsuit to recoup their loss.       Just two months after this bill passed, Cox found himself      tagged by just such a suit, brought by some victims of the      noxious First Pension fraud. In a second suit last week,      First Pension's court-appointed receiver charged Cox, among      others, with contributing to the hoax. ``Defamatory and      wildly false,'' Cox fumes.       First Pension handled the paperwork for tax-deferred      retirement accounts. It also sold clients fraudulent real-     estate investments and secretly tapped their accounts for      cash. The company is in receivership, its principals in jail      and its customers out $136 million. To recover some money,      investors are going after the supporting players. That      includes Cox and his former law firm, Latham & Watkins. Cox's      job was to set up a company that could have absorbed the      purported mortgage investments. The lawsuits allege that he      knew, or recklessly failed to find out, that the mortgages      weren't sound. Says Cox, ``I did not know. First Pension      concealed the fraud.''       So is Cox the innocent victim of scorched-earth lawyering?      Or is he an enabler who deserves to be called to account? The      courts will decide this specific case. But the issue      encapsules the conflicts that swirl around securities-law      reform.       The objective of reform is to staunch what companies claim      is a flood of frivolous lawsuits. Greedy lawyers, they say,      sue on flimsy grounds. The companies pay as the cheapest way      out. But the Cox bill and another bill before the Senate      would stifle honest lawsuits, too. Among other things, they:       Preserve a Supreme Court decision that sharply limits the      time for bringing a securities suit. Formerly, you had three      years to sue in federal court, starting from when the fraud      was discovered. In 1991, the court cut that back to just one      year but in no event more than three years after the date you      bought. So if a crook can deceive you long enough, you lose      the protection of these laws. Most of First Pension's      investors have been caught in that trap, says San Diego      attorney Michael Aguirre. The scam began more than a decade      ago but investors just recently found it out. So they can't      sue for securities fraud, either in federal or state court.      Aguirre is suing for common-law fraud, but says that it's not      an easy fit.       Preserve another Supreme Court decision that lets some of      the people who helped with a fraud escape liability for the      loss. It's the lawyers/accountants/consultants self-     protection clause (although those who are central to the      fraud remain on the hook). This rule would have limited the      sums recovered by those who bought bad bonds from the      notorious Charles Keating, chief of the Lincoln S & L.      Keating's company went broke and he went to jail. His duped      investors got most of their money back, says San Diego lawyer      Bill Lerach, but only because they successfully sued the      minions who helped him operate. (I do think, however, that      marginal players shouldn't have to foot the entire bill. Some      sort of proportional payment is fair, as the proposals      suggest.)       Make it harder to sue a company that grievously misleads      investors. Under current law, it's OK for execs to make good-     faith business predictions, even if their guess is wrong.      They're liable only for deliberate fibs. But because they      worry about lawsuits, they may suppress even reasonable      forecasts that might help investors make a decision about the      stock. Hence, this proposal, which makes it safer for      managers to talk. But like so much else in these slipshod      bills, it goes too far. A shady promoter could safely say      almost anything. You'd call it a lie; he'd say it was      innocent optimism. To win a lawsuit you'd have to prove that      the speaker intended to deceive--which is pretty tough to do.      Cox's bill (but not the bill in the Senate) could protect      even a deliberate lie.       Put investors and their lawyers at risk of owing the      defendants' legal fees if they lose their case. Cox scoffs at      the thought that judges would actually order individuals to      pay. ``The lawyer would pay'' and adds the cost to your fee,      he says. But the mere threat of owing a corporation's costs      will scare people off--and scare all but the best-funded      lawyers, too. Sen. Richard Bryan has a better idea. He      proposes a screening process that would test the merits of a      suit. If the screener thought it was frivolous--and you      brought it and lost--then you'd risk paying all the costs.      Ditto on the other side, if the company refused to settle      what looked like a meritorious claim.       Some reasonable, Bryan-like compromises need to be reached      because Congress (especially the House) is throwing a bomb at      a problem that just needs a switchblade. There's not even a      litigation explosion, says James Newman, publisher of      Securities Class Action Alert in Cresskill, N.J. The number      of lawsuits is up, but that's because more are filed in each      dispute. The number of companies sued remains in a constant      range. There were only 140 in 1993, he says.       Another myth is the oft-heard claim that ``vulture      lawyers'' automatically sue if a company's stock falls by 10      percent in a single day. Baruch Lev, a professor at the      University of California, Berkeley, tested a version of this      idea for the three years ending in 1990. Of 589 companies      whose stock price dropped by more than 20 percent in the five      days around the time of a disappointing earnings report, only      20 were hauled into court. And rarely on the strength of the      price drop alone, says Jonathan Cuneo, general counsel of the      National Association of Securities and Commercial Law      Attorneys. In many of these cases, he says, ``executives are      telling the public that everything is going to be great while      they're bailing out and selling their own stock.''       There's some good stuff in these bills, especially in the      Senate version. They stop lawyers from paying a bounty to      people who find them clients, block stockholders who sue for      a living and try to discourage frivolous suits. But they      overreach. In a nation of laws, you're disenfranchised if you      lose your day in court.
