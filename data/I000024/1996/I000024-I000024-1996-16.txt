In a revocation action, brought on an emergency basis, the airman or other certificate holder loses the use of the certificate immediately without any intermediary review or by any kind of an impartial party. The result is that the airman is grounded. In most cases, that is an airman who worked for some airline, and that is his or her only method of making a living.  Simply put, I believe the FAA unfairly uses this emergency power to prematurely revoke certificates when the circumstances do not support such drastic action. A more reasonable approach where safety is not an issue would be to adjudicate the revocation on a nonemergency basis, allowing the certificate holder continued use of his certificate.  Do not misunderstand: In no way do I want to suggest that the FAA should not have emergency revocation powers. I believe it is critical to safety that the FAA have the ability to ground unsafe airmen. However, I also believe that the FAA must be judicious in its use of the extraordinary power. A review of recent emergency cases clearly demonstrates a pattern whereby the FAA uses their emergency powers as standard procedure rather than extraordinary measures. Perhaps the most visible case has been that of Bob Hoover.  Now, Mr. President, I have flown in a lot of air shows over the last 40 years, and I can tell you right now the one person that you ask anyone who has a background like mine, ``Who is the hero within the industry,'' it has been Hoover. He is getting up in years but isas sharp as he ever was. Something happened to him. He is probably the most highly regarded and accomplished aerobatic pilot today. In 1992, his medical certificate was revoked based on alleged questions regarding his physical condition. After getting a clean bill of health from four separate sets of doctors over the continuing objections of the Federal air surgeon, who never examined Bob personally, his medical certificate was reinstated only after the Administrator, David Hinson, intervened.  I say at this point, I have been a strong supporter of Administrator David Hinson. I have often said that he is probably the very best appointment that President Clinton has made since he has been President. I also say there is not a lot of competition for that title.  He already has more serious problems coming. His current medical certificate expires this coming Monday, September 30, 1996. Unlike most airmen, like myself, when mine expires I go down, take a physical that lasts approximately 30 minutes, and it is reinstated at that time, something that happens every 12 months.  Bob Hoover's experience is one of many. I have several other examples of pilots who had licenses revoked on an emergency basis, such as Ted Stewart, who has been an American Airlines pilot--who I know personally--has been an American Airlines pilot for 12 years and is presently a Boeing 767 captain. Until January 1995, Mr. Stewart had no complaints registered against him or his flying. In January 1995, the FAA suspended Mr. Stewart's examining authority as part of a larger FAA effort to respond to a problem of falsifying records.  Now, there was never any indication that Mr. Stewart was involved in that, but, nonetheless, that was part of the investigation. He was exonerated by the full NTSB, National Transportation Safety Board, in July 1995. In June 1996, he received a second revocation. One of the charges in the second revocation involved falsification of records for a flight instructor certificate with a multiengined rating and his air transport pilot, ATP, certificate dating back to 1979.  Like most, I have questioned how an alleged 17\1/2\-year-old violation could constitute an emergency, especially since he has not been cited for any cause in the intervening years. Nonetheless, the FAA vigorously pursued this action. On August 30, 1996, the NTSB issued its decision in this second revocation and found in favor of Mr. Stewart.  A couple of comments in Mr. Stewart's decision bear closer examination. First, the board notes that ``the Administrator's loss in the earlier case appears to have prompted further investigation of the respondent * * *'' I found this rather troubling, that an impartial third party appears to be suggesting that the FAA has a vendetta against Ted Stewart, which is further emphasized with the footnote in which the board notes:       [We,] of course, [are] not authorized to review the      Administrator's exercise of his power to take emergency      certificate action . . . We are constrained to register in      this matter, however, our opinion that where, as here, no      legitimate reason is cited or appears for not      consolidating all alleged violations into one proceeding,      subjecting an airman in the space of a year to two      emergency revocations, and thus to the financial and other      burdens associated with an additional 60-day grounding,      without prior notice and hearing, constitutes an abuse and      unprincipled discharge of an extraordinary power.  Mr. President, I obviously cannot read the minds of the NTSB, but I believe a reasonable person would conclude from these comments that the board believes, as I do, that there is an abuse of emergency revocation powers by the FAA.  This is borne out further by the fact that, since 1989, emergency cases as a total of all enforcement actions heard by the NTSB have more than doubled. In 1989, the NTSB heard 1,107 enforcement cases. Of those, 66 were emergency revocation cases, or 5.96 percent. In 1995, the NTSB heard 509 total enforcement cases, and of those 160 were emergency revocation cases or 31.43 percent. I believe it is clear that the FAA has begun to use an exceptional power as a standard practice.  In response, I am proposing legislation which would establish a procedure whereby the FAA must show just cause for bringing an emergency revocation action against an airman.  Not surprisingly, Mr. President, the FAA opposes this language. But they also oppose the changes to the civil penalties program where they served as judge, jury, and executioner in civil penalty actions against airmen. Fortunately, we were able to change that just a couple of years ago so that airmen can now appeal a civil penalty case to the NTSB. This has worked very well because the NTSB has a clear understanding of the issues.  My proposal allows an airman, within 48 hours of receiving an emergency revocation order, to request a hearing before the NTSB on the emergency nature of the revocation--not whether or not the revocation was justified, but the emergency nature of the revocation. The NTSB then has 48 hours to hear the arguments and decide if a true emergency exists. During this time, the emergency revocation remains in effect. In other words, the airman loses use of his certificate for 4 days. However, should the NTSB decide an emergency does not exist, then the certificate would be returned to the airman and he could continue to use it while the FAA pursued their revocation case against him in a normal manner. If the NTSB decides that an emergency does exist, then the emergency revocation remains in effect and the airman cannot use his certificate until the case is adjudicated.  This bill is supported by virtually all of the major aviation groups, such as the Air Transport Association, the Allied Pilots Association, the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, the Experimental Aircraft Association, the NTSB Bar Association, and many others.  My intention in introducing this bill today is to get it out so that interested groups can look at it and work with me to make changes, if that is necessary. I am pleased that Senator McCain, who is the chairman of the Aviation Subcommittee of Commerce, has agreed to hold a hearing on this in the 105th Congress. In the intervening time, I will be working to make sure this issue is fully vetted, and it is my hope that we will be able to address this issue very early in the 105th Congress.                                 ______                                       By
