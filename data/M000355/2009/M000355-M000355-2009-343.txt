 President, I rise today to pay tribute to Nicky Hayden, a native of Owensboro, KY., who has followed his passion and is an inspiration for all Kentuckians.  Hayden is among the world's elite in Grand Prix motorcycle racing. Driving at speeds of up to 200 miles per hour, with his knees sometimes only inches off of the ground, Hayden has won countless races all over the world  Nicky's racing career has led him to win the Moto Grand Prix Championship in 2006, the AMA Superbike Championship in 2002, and the AMA Supersport 600 Championship in 1999.  Nicky's parents, Earl and Rose Hayden, could not be more proud of what their son has already accomplished since he began racing at a very young age.  An article in the June 2009 edition of Kentucky Living magazine chronicled Nicky's career, highlighting his exciting and successful career, his extensive travel schedule, and his love of his home State and town. I ask unanimous consent to have the full article printed in the Congressional Record.  Mr. President, I further ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the achievements of Nicky Hayden and I wish him continued success throughout his career.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                   [From Kentucky Living, June 2009]                     Nicky Hayden, the Kentucky Kid                           (By Gary P. West)       When fans call you The Kentucky Kid and you race throughout      the world on a motorcycle at speeds in excess of 200 miles      per hour, you better believe you have to be good, real good.       That's what 28-year-old Nicky Hayden from Owensboro does,      and as a professional motorcycle racer, who started out in      the sport long before he was big enough for his feet to touch      the ground while seated, he has become one of the biggest      names in the sport.       Nicky was back home in Owensboro, or OWB as he calls it,      taking the name from the local airport, on a summer break      from an 18-race schedule that begins in March and ends in      November.       ``I travel 11 months a year,'' he says. ``But I love coming      home to my family. Family's important to me. Growing up here      with my two brothers and two sisters, I have everything I      want. My mom was from a big farm family, 11 brothers and      sisters, so my family has always been close. I don't want to      live in Monaco or anywhere else like that.''       Nicky's parents, Earl and Rose, once upon a time, enjoyed      the thrill of going fast on motorcycles themselves. Earl      raced often and won on dirt tracks, while Rose competed      successfully in ``powder puff' leagues, but when their family      began to expand, they turned to introducing their three sons      to the sport.       While older brother Tommy and younger brother Roger have      had successful professional riding stints, it's Nicky who has      risen to world-class status winning the MotoGP or Grand Prix,      the sport's most elite level of motorcycle racing. As the      World Champion in 2006, he has picked up several other      accolades that might be expected for a handsome bachelor who      hangs out with jetsetters throughout Europe and the United      States.       Nicky often finds himself far removed from his Owensboro      home in order to race against riders from Italy, Spain,      Portugal, Australia, and other countries throughout the      world. But it's his return visits to Kentucky and his family      and friends that help him keep his Daviess County values.       Swerving through curves, routinely leaning his motorcycle      so far on its sides that the friction from the asphalt eats      into his knee pucks, Hayden and his cycle appear to defy the      law of gravity. Riding on the edge of traction, the slightest      loss of concentration and his race is over.       Motorcycle racing, considered by many to be a daredevil      sport, has gained its popularity on dirt tracks throughout      America over the years. But with the strong influence of his      parents, one question begs to be asked. Considering      Owensboro's reputation as a hotbed for stock car racing how      did the Hayden family stay focused on motorcycles?       With Owensboro names like Waltrip, Green, and Mayfield, all      established NASCAR stars, it seems like it would have been      easier to catch on with automobile racing.       But Hayden's star was growing at a much earlier age than it      takes to get a ride in a car at Daytona.       By the age of 17, and still in high school at Owensboro      Catholic, he was racing factory Honda RC45 superbikes and      winning. In 2002, at the age of 21, he won the Daytona 200      while becoming the youngest ever to win an AMA Superbike      Championship. He was years removed from the days when his      parents would hold his bike in place for the start of a race      because he was too small to touch the ground.       Soon after, Honda tapped The Kentucky Kid to join what many      in the business consider the elite team in MotoGP racing,      Repsol Honda. Earning rookie-of-the-year honors on the      circuit his first year, his racing togs began to take on more      sponsors than an Indy car. A jewelry line, clothing,      sunglasses, tires, energy drink, watches, and, of course,      Repsol, an oil and gas company operating in more than 30      countries, cover almost every inch of his protective racing      ware.       With his boyish good looks and success as an international      motorcycle racer, it was of little surprise when Hayden was      listed among People magazine's 50 Hottest Bachelors in 2005.       That was followed by appearances on the Today Show, Jay      Leno's Tonight Show, and a two-hour documentary on MTV      appropriately called The Kentucky Kid, which chronicled his      2006 championship season. ``It gave us good exposure in a      market we hadn't been in,'' says Nicky.       Rubbing elbows and shaking hands with the likes of Michael      Jordan, Brad Pitt, and Tom Cruise, and seeing your picture on      a full-page Honda ad and in USA Today, further points out the      two worlds Nicky lives in.       It did not come, however, without some difficulties and      second-guessing. Family closeness made Nicky's travels      throughout the world difficult at times, especially that      first year in MotoGP competition.       ``It was another world to me,'' recalls Nicky. ``I was      learning the bike, my team, the hectic travel schedule, and      everything that went with it. My two brothers and I always      trained, practiced, and rode together and then the next year      I was out there by myself.''       With Nicky and his family growing up on Rose's home-cooked      meals, the sudden change in culinary choices as he traveled      presented some problems.       ``Oh, yeah, food was definitely an issue,'' his voice      rising to emphasize the point. ``It's not much fun being on      an airplane with food poisoning. There have been several      nights I have gone to bed hungry, and when I was in China I      lived on watermelon for a while.''  ``At the races I stay in      a motor home at the track,'' he says.       One of the perks of racing at this level is that a motor      home is delivered to each of his European races. It also      includes an English-speaking satellite television that he      says helped to overcome his loneliness.       The entire setting is thousands of miles removed from his      Daviess County home, and thousands of thoughts about those      days when he couldn't wait to finish high school and race      motorcycles. It was his only thought.       ``I did just enough in school to get by'' to keep my grades      up so my parents would let     me race. I'm not proud of it, but I was so involved with      racing it's about all I could think of,'' he says.       The brothers would fly out to races all over the U.S. and      then catch the red-eye flights back in order to get back to      school. It was difficult to stay focused on academics. In his      junior year of high school, he had signed a six-figure      contract and was driving a new truck. It was easy to see why      the 17-year-old was not fully committed to school. In his      words, the library and any required research were not a      priority.       Racing motorcycles all over the world, Nicky has lost count      of the number of countries he's visited. Not only is MotoGP      racing fast on the track, but off as well. Nicky and his      Repsol Honda teammate Dani Pedrosa, from Spain, travel with a      sizeable entourage, finishing one race and immediately      heading to another, much like a circus breaking down the Big      Top and moving on to the next gig.       ``We have about 75 people that go everywhere with us,''      Nicky says. ``We have our own chef who prepares all of the      food for the team. Then there are the mechanics, agents,      trainers, engineers, tire, and hospitality people. It's a lot      of people.''       Make no mistake about it, MotoGP racing is big business.      The custom Honda motorcycle, according to Nicky, cost in      excess of a million dollars to build. The titanium and carbon      racing machine is so aerodynamically designed with the very      latest in technology that every piece, including the nuts and      bolts, is custom-made. For sure this is not an assembly-line      product. Weighing 325 pounds and sporting somewhere around      250hp, this mechanized piece of art can blast from 0 to 60 in      less than three seconds.       Sponsors pay big bucks to have their names associated with      The Kentucky Kid. With it comes a certain amount of pressure      to excel. Following his world championship 2006 season, Nicky      finished eighth in points. And at the end of the 2008 season,      the result was the same, eighth.       ``After being a world champion, I put pressure on myself,''      he says. ``I hope my best years are ahead of me. This is a      good age in this sport for riders.''       When listening to Nicky talk about his racing future, it      takes awhile before he says what he wants to do when his      riding days are over.       Somehow, the subject just doesn't easily come up unless      someone else asks about it.       ``I really don't have a plan B,'' he says. ``I know I want      to race well into my 30s.''       For sure Nicky doesn't have to look very far to see the      personal devastation this daredevil sport can dish out or how      quickly it could end. Back home in Owensboro last July, Nicky      was enjoying several days of a summer break far from MotoGP.      Also there were Tommy and Roger, who both ride on the AMA      Superbike Tour. But they were home not because they      necessarily wanted to be. They were recovering. Roger, who      rides a factory bike for Kawasaki, had crashed several weeks      earlier in Alabama, breaking his pelvis and vertebrae. A week      later, Tommy, a rider for Suzuki, took a hard tumble in      California, breaking bones in his back and puncturing a lung.       ``It was crazy,'' says Nicky. ``The next week I went down      in Portugal but was not seriously injured.''       For the most part Hayden has avoided serious injury. In      August 2004, however, while training in Italy near Milan, he      broke his right collarbone. Following surgery that involved      inserting a plate, he was back racing in a few weeks.       Tragedy did strike the Hayden family. In May of 2007,      Nicky's second cousin, 10-year-old Ethan Gillim, died as a      result of a motorcycle accident in a race in Paducah. Ethan      had started racing when he was 4, and in six years attained      18 national dirt track titles.       The Hayden's all three brothers are professionally      represented by a management company, International Racers,      out of Irvine, California. At the level Nicky is racing, the      company has a full-time agent who accompanies him during the      season in order to maximize the promotional opportunities for      their star client.       A season of MotoGP consists of 18 races held in 16      different countries, and in 2008 two of these races were held      in the United States, in Laguna Seca, California, and      Indianapolis, Indiana. Throughout Europe, the sport has      almost a cult-like following. Televised races attract in      excess of 300 million viewers for each event, and another      200,000 frequently show up to see the races live.       ``For sure the U.S. market hasn't been tapped,'' Nicky      says. ``I know there is an effort now being made to do it.''       To help promote that market, just before last year's      Indianapolis 500, Nicky blasted two laps around the 2\1/2\-     mile track, giving car race fans a sampling of what was to      come later in September with the 14th round of the 2008      MotoGP.       What will help increase the visibility in this country,      perhaps, is for more American riders to achieve success.      Currently there are only four, including Hayden, on a      circuit dominated by foreign riders and sponsors.       As they should be, all of the Hayden's have been well-     compensated for their successes. Many Americans may be      surprised to learn that Valentino Rossi, considered to be the      best motorcycle racer in the world, earns a reported $30      million a year.       At the end of 2008's season, a new twist emerged with some      big changes. For some time Nicky and Honda had been at odds,      first about the way the manufacturer set his bike up and then      it was a tire issue. They wanted Bridgestone tires and Nicky      likes Michelin.       Soon the split became too much to overcome and now The      Kentucky Kid rides for Ducati, an Italian bike company. He      and Australian Casey Stoner are Ducati's featured riders,      with Nicky kicking off the 2009 season on his 100th GP race      with a new bike, a new team, and a new color.       As Nicky updates his fans on a video on his Web site,      www.NickyHayden.com, ``Honestly, I think red is a good color      for me. I think it could be a good look and anything up front      looks good. I mean, I could be up there in pink polka dots if      you're winning races, I think you could pull it off.''       With Nicky now on a Ducati, Tommy a Suzuki, and Roger a      Kawasaki, the three have always been there for each other.      All have achieved success in one form or another. The goal,      of course, is to be good enough and fast enough to get a      podium. In motorcycle racing terms that means first, second,      or third. All three have had their share, but like any      competitive athlete they want more.                          ____________________
