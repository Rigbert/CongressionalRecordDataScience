Speaker, the once mighty party that helped found the Nation now embarrasses itself on station after station. This party of Jefferson, born of ideas, lofty and grand, have been reduced to whining about a book and a man. This party that helped through the Great Depression now fumes and fusses in session after session.  This great party that brought us victory in wars today fights about a book which is not in the stores.  While the American people look to us for inspiration, the party whines on and on about an imaginary publication. The party that for a long this Congress led now acts as if it has gone completely brain dead.  It is sad, Mr. Speaker, but it is easy to see why this once great party is now in the minority.                          ____________________
