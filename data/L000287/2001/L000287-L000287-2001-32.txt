Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me.  Mr. Speaker, the Republican tax bill is not the way to go. It is going to take the country down the wrong road. What if we are wrong? The Republican tax bill is based on a 10-year forecast that we know probably will not happen. In fact, the people who made the forecast have said that it is not going to come true. According to them, there is only a 10 percent chance that their forecast will be correct.  We cannot afford to be wrong on this one. We are locking ourselves into a 10-year plan when we are not even sure that the money would be there.  The gentleman from New York (Mr. Rangel), does he know what this would be like? It would be like counting the chickens before the eggs hatch. That would not be fair for the American people. What if we are wrong? What if the surplus does not happen?  The administration, the Republicans, somebody is not telling the whole truth. They are not telling us the whole story. They need to be honest with the American people, honest about the true costs of the tax bill, honest about what will happen if the surplus does not materialize, honest about what will happen to Social Security, honest about Medicare and other priorities.  We have an obligation, a mission, and a mandate to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. The Republicans are playing with the numbers. It is deceptive, it is a sham, and it is a shame. We should be paying down the debt, saving Social Security and Medicare, taking care of the basic needs of all of our people.  The Republican bill is not right for America. It is not fair and it is not just. We should vote down this bill. We should do it for the American people. We have an obligation to vote it down.
