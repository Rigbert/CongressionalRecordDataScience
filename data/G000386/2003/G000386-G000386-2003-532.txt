 President, my amendment takes urgently needed steps to end Medicare's discrimination against rural States.  Doctors and hospitals in rural America provide some of the lowest cost, highest quality care in the country. Academics, researchers, and policy people know this, but Medicare does not know it.  This amendment changes that by fixing unfair payment formulas once and for all. Doctors, hospitals, home health agencies, and ambulances in rural communities can count on payment fairness from this day forward by adopting this amendment.  My fairness amendment is paid for by changes in other parts of the Medicare Program, and it is not offset by other parts of the tax provisions of this bill.  My amendment is a dose of commonsense medicine for Medicare in rural America.  One final word to cancer patients in Iowa and across the country regarding the AWP offset. I am going to work in conference and directly with the Secretary of HHS to ensure that seniors and their caregivers have adequate payment for, and continued access to, important cancer therapies.
