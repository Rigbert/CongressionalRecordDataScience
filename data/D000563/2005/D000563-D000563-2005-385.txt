President, my Amendment No. 2415 would inject a dose of accountability and responsibility into America's efforts to rebuild the gulf coast and Iraq.  It will bar from all reconstruction efforts, both at home and in Iraq, all firms found--over the last 5 years--to have overcharged or improperly billed the government by more than $10 million on one or more occasions.  It will also bar from all reconstruction efforts--both at home and in Iraq--all firms that have overcharged or defrauded the Government of more than $10 million over the last 5 years.  It will also bar from all reconstruction efforts--both at home and in Iraq--all firms that have been suspended or debarred from competing for federal contracts.  It includes a national security waiver for those instances where dealing with such firms may serve the national interest.
