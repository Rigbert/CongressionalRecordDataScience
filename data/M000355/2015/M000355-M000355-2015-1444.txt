 Now that the Senate has passed the antitrafficking bill and the Lynch confirmation vote has been scheduled for later today, it is my intention to turn to the Iran legislation.  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that at 3 p.m. today the Senate agree to the motion to proceed to H.R. 1191, as under the previous order, with debate only during today's session of the Senate following the offering of a substitute amendment by Senator Corker or his designee, as under the previous order.  I further ask that following leader remarks on Tuesday, April 28, 2015, Senator Corker be recognized to offer an amendment to the pending substitute.
