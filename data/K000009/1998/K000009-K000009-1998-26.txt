Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hinojosa). I know that the pain and suffering that is being borne by farm families in that region of the country is particularly acute, and we want to commend the gentleman from Texas for his leadership and for his willingness to come down here today and help us on that measure.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the very distinguished ranking member of the House Committee on Agriculture, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Stenholm).
