CAPITO. I yield to the gentleman from Oregon.  Mr. DeFAZIO. I think there is a misunderstanding.  They can serve on the board. It's just that if a proposal comes up that directly affects their previous employer and they have been on the board less than 2 years, they would have to sit out that particular vote. They can serve and vote on any and every other procedure, but just not on that particular thing. It's a very restrictive conflict of interest rule.
