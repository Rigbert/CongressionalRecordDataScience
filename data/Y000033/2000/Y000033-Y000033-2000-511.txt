Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time, and I want to join with the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar) in paying tribute to the chairman of the committee. He certainly has shown his effectiveness in getting this bill through the process.  I suppose it is difficult in an election year for Members to vote against projects that might show up in their districts sometime between now and the election. In fact, I would say to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Shuster), that I probably would like to have some of the money in my own district. But, I am hoping, for a number of reasons, that we are not going to pass the bill this year.  I would like to say this. I know that the authorizing committee sometimes wonders where I stand. I believe that the funds that go into a trust fund for a specific purpose should be protected and should be used by that trust fund only for those purposes. By the same token, I am strongly of the opinion that the trust fund or the authorizing legislation should not be able to mandate other spending. We have a difficult enough time in keeping our spending numbers down as low as we can without mandating more spending. This bill mandates certain amounts of spending.  Every time we create a new entitlement, every time we create a new mandated spending program, we are taking every Member of this Congress a little more out of the process of what the Constitution guarantees as our responsibility and our jurisdiction. That process is to make appropriations decisions for the United States Government.  This bill guarantees an appropriation of $10.5 billion for the FAA for fiscal year 2001. The bill earmarks $6.2 billion of that amount for capital programs, which are desirable, especially in election years.                              {time}  1145  That leaves only $4.3 billion for the FAA's operating budget. The FAA requested $6.6 billion for that appropriation. So what we are talking about here is funding for the people that, frankly, run the safety operations of the FAA.  This is an expensive bill. Over the past 3 years, we have appropriated $28 billion for the FAA. Under this bill, we could be forced to provide $40 billion. That is $12 billion more.  I know that, in the budget process, all of this spending is going to go down as Federal expenditures. They will be scored. And those revenues will, therefore, not be available to reduce the Federal debt, to provide tax relief, or to address other budget initiatives.  In fact, this bill is a tax bill. This bill increases certain airport taxes. I am not sure that this Congress wants to be on record as increasing taxes.  Next year, a new President and a new Congress would have this much less money to put into new initiatives to provide for the safety of those who use airports and who fly in our airways.  Funding for airport construction grants under this bill will rise from $1.9 billion to $3.2 billion. And if that is not enough, as I said, the bill provides additional airport taxes, which would increase spending by another $700 million a year. So airport spending is going to approximately double overnight. I am not sure how wise it is to double a budget overnight.  Now, the electronics and software companies also like this bill. And I have no problem with them. I am not opposed to them. Those who pour concrete and build buildings and runways are going to like this bill. But I am concerned about the people who actually run the system, who provide the safety, who control the airplanes, who inspect the airplanes. I am concerned that their budget has been reduced dramatically because of this legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I have no illusions over what is going to happen here. Because when this bill was before the House before it went to conference, there was no doubt that the House strongly supported it. But I thought it was important to make the case today that this is just one more step toward more mandated spending, one more entitlement type program that takes Congress out of the mix and requires money to be spent in ways that Congress may or may not approve.
