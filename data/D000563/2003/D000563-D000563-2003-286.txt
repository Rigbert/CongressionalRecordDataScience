It is rare of him to argue that the social programs in Russia and China should be emulated here in the United States.  It is interesting he would start with the British because they certainly have a much grander view when it comes to government responsibility on health care. If we were to guarantee the same type of health care protection to Americans as the British, not only for retirees but for the people, perhaps we could follow their logic in saying we may have failed over the last 10 or 15 years with their private savings accounts but people were not hurt that badly.  In the United States, if the experiment which the Senator has suggested with Social Security benefits tries and fails, we will have a generation or two of retirees on the hook, people who will not have what they anticipated they would have at the time of retirement. Then where does the burden fall? It falls on their children, first, to try to take care of their parents, and ultimately on the rest of the taxpayers.  This noble experiment, unfortunately, still has this big gap in it--$2 trillion--which the Republicans, suggesting privatization of Social Security, cannot come up with. Until they do, we are going to have to cut benefits. Cutting benefits is certainly not the answer to providing any kind of security for our retirees.
