 I hope I can answer it. Remember, I have tried to conduct the work of the Finance Committee in a very transparent way and with open communication with everybody. So there will not be anything about this conference committee, except the specific negotiations, that will be kept from anybody.  Last night there were some--well, yesterday over the course of the afternoon and evening there were three informal meetings, and they are going to continue this morning, probably in just a few minutes. There have not been any decisions made yet, but the normal give and take that has to be done before settling down to serious negotiation is done and out of the way.  What I can best inform you about is that at the trail end of our visiting yesterday the Speaker of the House came to our meeting and he informed all conferees that he had instructed the House of Representatives that they would stay in session into the weekend until this conference report was adopted. That does not mean we have to be in on the weekend.  There has to be a realization that there has to be a slot of give and take. There is good spirit about the conference at this point, and we will just have to work our way through it. That is all I can tell the Senator. I will be glad to keep him informed anytime he wants to ask, and even if he does not ask, I know I have a responsibility to keep him informed, and I will try to do that.                          ____________________
