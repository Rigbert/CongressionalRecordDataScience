 This is amazing to me.  This is the result, apparently, of a lawsuit filed by the Direct Marketing Association, U.S. Security, Chartered Benefit Services, Global Contact Services, and in InfoCision Management Corporation challenging the Federal Trade Commission's authority to implement the wishes of millions ofAmericans who have gone on the Federal Trade Commission's web site and signed up to say to telemarketers they don't want to be called.  I would like to read into the Record a statement of FTC Chairman Timothy Muris. He said:       Late last year, the Federal Commission issued rules      creating the National Do Not Call Registry under the      Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act. On      February 13, 2003 the Congress passed the Do Not Call      Implementation Act, which authorized the FTC to collect fees      from sellers and telmarketers to ``implement and enforce the      provisions relating to the `do-not-call' registry.'' The      President signed this bill on March 11, 2003. Moreover, on      February 20, 2003, the President signed the Omnibus      Appropriations Act, which authorizes the FTC to ``implement      and enforce the do-not-call provisions of the Telemarketing      Sales Rule.''       Despite this clear legislative direction, the U.S. District      Court for the Western District of Oklahoma has ruled that the      FTC exceeded its authority in creating the National Do Not      Call Registry.       This decision is clearly incorrect. We will seek every      recourse to give American consumers a choice to stop unwanted      telemarketing calls.  This registry is due to go into effect in a week. A Federal judge has essentially prevented it from going into effect. In a week, tens of millions of Americans who have registered their names not to be called by telemarketers are going to find out that it is all a myth. They are going to get called in any event. I think they are going to be very angry.  I also believe this decision strikes a blow against the basic privacy interests of millions of Americans. Presently, these people are subjected to unwanted marketing calls to their homes at all times of the day, including the dinner hour. The FTC's Registry will give Americans who want to avoid these unsolicited sales pitches an option to stop their telephone from ringing.  As I mentioned, tens of millions of Americans have registered more than 50 million phone numbers for this program. Ultimately, the Federal Trade Commission expects 60 percent of the Nation's households with approximately 60 million home phone lines to sign on to the registry. This registry is crucial because it puts consumers in charge of the number of telemarketing calls they receive. Telemarketers who disregard the Registry could be fined up to $11,000 per call.  The district court today ruled that the Do Not Call Registry is ``invalid''--that is the word the judge used in his decision--because it was created without congressional authority.  This conclusion I find surprising since Congress passed H.R. 395, the Do-Not-Call Implementation Act on February 13th of this year. The legislation clearly authorizes the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Communications Commission to collect fees sufficient to implement the Registry. And the Appropriations Committee granted $18 million for the program.  I also note that the FTC's rule came after the most extensive deliberations. The FTC announced its plan to proceed with the Registry on December 18, 2002, after receiving 64,000 comments. The overwhelming majority of these comments favored the creation of the Registry. Millions of Americans were promised protection from annoying, unwanted telemarketing calls starting October 1. They are truly going to be outraged by this.  There are two ways of going about this. The first is to let the FTC appeal the case, which they have just said they are going to be in the process of doing. The other is to perhaps unanimously adopt and pass legislation which clearly authorizes, specifically authorizes--and in bold letters authorizes so that no Federal judge can misunderstand it--and get this done as quickly as we can. I have asked my Judiciary counsel to prepare this legislation. We will be submitting it before the end of the day.  I would like to invite all of my colleagues to join as cosponsors. Then, hopefully, we will be able to move this through very quickly, particularly in view of the fact that we believed we did authorize it earlier, the President did sign it earlier this year, and we believed it was a concluded issue.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the judgment of the Western District Court of Oklahoma which finds that the portion of the final amended rule that pertains to the National Do Not Call Registry is invalid.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:    In The United States District Court for the Western District of                                 Oklahoma   u.s. security, et al., Plaintiffs, vs. federal trade commission,                                defendant                       no. civ-03-122-w--judgment       Pursuant to the Order filed this date, the Court finds that      judgment should be and is hereby entered as a matter of law      in favor of the plaintiffs, U.S. Security, Chartered Benefit      Services, Inc., Global Contact Services, Inc., InfoCision      Management Corporation and Direct Marketing Association,      Incorporated, on the plaintiffs' claims that that portion of      the Final Amended Rule that pertains to the national do-not-     call registry is invalid. The Court further finds that      judgment should be and is hereby entered as a matter of law      in favor of the defendant, Federal Trade Commission, on all      remaining claims asserted by the plaintiffs.       Dated at Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, this 23rd, day of      September, 2003.       Lee R. West, United States District Judge.
