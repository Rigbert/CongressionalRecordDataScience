Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2595) to restore the operation of the Native American Veteran Housing Loan Program during fiscal year 2003 to the scope of that program as in effect on September 30, 2002.  The Clerk read as follows:                               H.R. 2595       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. OPERATION OF NATIVE AMERICAN VETERAN HOUSING LOAN                    PROGRAM.       (a) Restoration for Fiscal Year 2003 to Fiscal Year 2002      Level.--In carrying out the pilot program provided by      subchapter V of chapter 37 of title 38, United States Code,      under which the Secretary of Veterans Affairs is authorized      to make direct housing loans to Native American veterans, the      Secretary shall during fiscal year 2003 carry out that      program without regard to the proviso under the heading      ``Native American Veteran Housing Loan Program Account'' in      title I of the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing      and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies      Appropriations Act, 2003 (division K of Public Law 108-7; 117      Stat. 476), and such proviso shall be treated as being of no      force or effect.       (b) Savings Provision.--Any action taken by the Secretary      of Veterans Affairs before the enactment of this Act that is      inconsistent with the proviso referred to in subsection (a)      is hereby ratified with respect to such inconsistency.
