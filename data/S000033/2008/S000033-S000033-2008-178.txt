 One of the reasons for this is the virtual lack of regulation when it comes to interest rates. For example, credit card companies are able to raise interest rates at any time for any reason, and recently that is exactly what, for example, the Bank of America has done. According to a recent Business Week article:       Bank of America sent letters notifying some responsible      card holders that it would more than double their rates to as      high as 28 percent, without giving an explanation for the      increase. Fine print at the end of the letter advised calling      a 800 number for the reason, but consumers who called said      they were unable to get a clear answer. What is striking is      how arbitrary the Bank of America rate increases appear,      credit industry experts say.  This is unacceptable. Lenders should not be able to raise interest rates at any time for any reason.  There are Biblical references to what can be described as usury; that when people are down and in need of money, there is a strong moral objection to charging them sky-high interest rates.  In the ``Divine Comedy'' by Dante, there is reserved a special place for people who charge usurious interest rates, the inner ring of the Seventh Circle of Hell.  I don't wish this on the credit card companies or the mortgage lenders, but this is what I do say. In this country today, especially as interest rates go down from the Fed, it is an outrage that millions of our fellow Americans are paying 25 percent or 30 percent interest rates, and our amendment would begin to address this issue. The time is long overdue for us to move in that direction. I ask at the appropriate time for the support of my colleagues.                          ____________________
