 President, if the Senator will yield for a moment, I am anxious to do that. I sincerely hope she does not amend her amendment. I will, in time, at an appropriate time, explain why I hope that is not the case. I am of the view that if Senators listen to this debate or this discussion, I think it is very, very difficult to make a case why the exception being sought should be granted. I will yield the floor back to the Senator, have her make her case, and I am prepared and anxious to speak to her amendment.
