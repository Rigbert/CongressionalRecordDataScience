Speaker, I would add my comments and wishes to the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. Mollohan) as everyone else has. I think it is a mark of the gentleman that, this evening, he is here protecting the interest of, not only the people of his congressional district, his State, but all of those in the United States of America who want a good paying decent job for themselves and their families. I think we all owe the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. Mollohan) a debt of gratitude on that.  One of the earlier speakers, in his comments said this is not going to create one new job. I would remind all of our colleagues that we are here tonight because we have lost 11,000 jobs since July 1, 1997. There is no end in sight. Those jobs were lost, not because of inefficiency, but because of illegally traded steel that we as a government, the executive branch and legislative branch, did not stop.  Those 11,000 individuals with spouses and children do not have a job tonight. We owe them this loan guarantee.
