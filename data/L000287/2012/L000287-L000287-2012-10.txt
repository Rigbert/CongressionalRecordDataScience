Madam Speaker, for more than 30 years, Monica Pearson has been a voice of WSB-TV, the Atlanta ABC station. She is a sensitive, caring individual, and one of the most loved and admired television anchors in the Nation. You can always see her out in Metro Atlanta somewhere, serving and sharing, giving back to the community of people who have supported her for many, many years.  When Monica delivers the news, people believe it because they believe in her, and they know she believes in them. She didn't just read the news, but as a member of a community she tried to discover the truth, and we trusted what she said. Though she may be leaving the airwaves, she is not retiring from her involvement in our city, our State, and our Nation.  I wish Monica and her husband, John, the very best. We love her. She's been good for our city, for our State, and for our Nation.                          ____________________
