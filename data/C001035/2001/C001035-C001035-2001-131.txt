President, I commend the Senator from Rhode Island for his work on this issue. He has been a long-time, strong advocate for improving libraries in our Nation's schools. I was pleased to work with him in refining parts of this amendment to make sure that it did not take funds away from the important reading programs.  I thank the Senator from Rhode Island for his efforts and pledge my support for the amendment.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be added as a cosponsor.
