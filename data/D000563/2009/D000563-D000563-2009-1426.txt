President, Senator Grassley and I do not see eye to eye on this issue, and I wish to state for the record why this section was included in the appropriations bill.  First, it is hard for me to follow his argument that because the Finance Committee created a permissive arrangement where the Internal Revenue Service could enter into contracts with private companies to collect IRS debts, it somehow takes away the authority of the Appropriations Committee to even address this issue. It is a permissive statute. It does not require the IRS to sign up a private company. When the IRS does exercise the right under that statute, it involves Federal expenditures, appropriations.  My provision in this bill is not tax language. My provision in this bill says: None of the funds in this bill may be used to enter into, renew, extend, administer, implement, enforce or provide oversight of such a contract. We go directly to the spending aspects.
