I am not sure, but I think your rule dealt with more than appropriations conference reports. I may not be correct on that.  But in any event, the rule that will be offered Monday night, hopefully by unanimous consent, will be a rule that will say that a point of order will lie to a conference report from the appropriations conference which has added a project that was not listed in either the House consideration or the Senate consideration, and that point of order would have 10 minutes of debate on either side, 10 minutes for those in opposition to allowing the conference committee report to be considered, and 10 minutes for the proponents of the conference committee report being considered, effectively adding a third to the hour.                              {time}  1700  So it would be an hour and 20 minutes of debate rather than just an hour.  Obviously if the point of order is sustained, then the conference committee with the add-on or add-ons would be referred back to the conference committee.
