 Mr. President, I am going to be brief this morning. I know my colleague from Colorado has been waiting. The Democratic leader of the Y2K effort, Senator Dodd, has also been waiting. I will be brief to begin.  It is just a couple of hundred days to the new millennium. It seems to this Member of the Senate that how this body handles this legislation will say a great deal about our Nation's ability to keep our strong technology-oriented economy prospering in the next century.  I believe that failure to pass this responsible legislation would be like sticking a monkey wrench in the high-tech engine that is driving our economic prosperity. There is no question that there are going to be problems early next year stemming from the Y2K matter. What is going to happen, however, is that the frivolous lawsuits will compound those problems.  The sponsors of this legislation--the chairman of the committee, the Democratic leader of the Y2K effort, Senator Dodd, and myself and others who have been intensively involved--believe that with this bill our Nation will be in a better position to be on line rather than waiting in line for a courtroom date when the problems occur.  We have heard my chairman, Senator Hollings, and others talk about the matter of changing jurisprudence in our country. Senator Hollings specifically, who I respect so much, talked about how 200 years of case law and jurisprudence is being changed.  This is a very narrow bill. Senator Dodd and I insisted that there be a sunset date on this legislation. We believe,and all the evidence points to the fact, that we are going to see the problems stemming from Y2K trailing off 1 to 3 years into the new century. We have put a tight 36-month sunset date on this legislation.  This is not changing Anglo-American jurisprudence for all time. This is a narrow bill that will apply for 36 months so that we do not have to have, for example, a special session of the Senate early next year to deal with this problem.
