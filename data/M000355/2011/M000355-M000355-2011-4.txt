 President, today I cast my vote against H.R. 2055, the nine-bill appropriations measure. I opposed this package because the process put forward by the majority was woefully inadequate given the seriousness of the issues involved. Valuable legislative time was wasted this year on political messaging votes; time that could have been more properly devoted to the nuts and bolts of legislating. The full Senate, for example, was denied the opportunity to consider the Defense Appropriations bill at a time when our men and women in uniform are facing looming uncertainty over out-year funding.  Despite my overall opposition to this measure, I would note that there are several provisions that I am in favor of in this package. As always, I support funding for the brave members of our military and for our veterans. Indeed, I voted for the Senate version of the Military Construction/VA appropriations bill earlier this year and just a few days ago voted for the final version of the Defense Authorization bill. Among the other provisions I support are policy riders such as those that encourage a culture of life and that rein in government overreach.  In closing, it is unfortunate that the majority continues to operate as it has. I am hopeful that the majority's efforts in this regard do not presage further legislative shortcuts on matters of national importance in the second session of this Congress.                          ____________________
