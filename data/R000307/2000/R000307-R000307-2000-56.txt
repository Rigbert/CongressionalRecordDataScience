President, late in the afternoon of this coming Thursday, the U.S. Marine Corps will conduct a retirement ceremony at the Marine Corps War Memorial in Arlington, VA.  It would not be too surprising for all who know the honoree, if those legendary marines raising the flag atop Mt. Suribachi at the Iwo Jima Memorial and ensconced in statuary history might actually plant the flag, come to attention and give a proud salute to Gen. Charles E. Wilhelm. Now retired after 35 years of service and the former commander of the U.S. Southern Command, Charles Wilhelm has been the epitome of dedication, professionalism, and pride. Simply put, he has been a marine's marine. In paying tribute to General Wilhelm, my remarks are in keeping with the appreciation, admiration, and thanks of my colleagues in the Senate, more especially the chairman and members of the Armed Services Committee, all those privileged to serve on committees of jurisdiction dealing with our national defense and foreign policy and former marines who serve in the Congress. I think Charles Wilhelm was destined to serve in our Nation's sea service and become an outstanding marine in that he was born of the shores of Albemarle Sound in historic Edenton, NC. He graduated from Florida State University and later earned a master of science degree from Salve Regina College in Newport, RI. He was commissioned a second lieutenant in 1964 and saw two tours of service in Vietnam where in the full component of command positions, he served with distinction: as a rifle platoon commander; company commander; and senior advisor to a Vietnamese Army battalion.  For his heroism under fire, he was awarded the Silver Star Medal, Bronze Star Medal with Combat V, Navy Commendation Medal with Combat V, and the Army Commendation Medal with Combat V. General Wilhelm's other personal decorations include the Defense Service Medal with Oak Leaf Cluster, the Distinguished Service Medal, Defense Meritorious Service Medal, the Navy Commendation Medal, and Combat Action Ribbon. The last thing that Charley Wilhelm would want or stand for would be for some Senator like myself to stand on the Senate floor and list the rest of all ofthe assignments and tours and accomplishments that make up his outstanding career. But, since I am on the Senate floor and relatively safe, I hope, from the well known and respected iron will of the general, a marine, who with respect and admiration and a great deal of circumspect care--certainly not in his presence--was called ``Kaiser Wilhelm,'' I'm going to give it a try. I do so because of the immense respect this man has within the ranks of all the services, U.S. and international, whohave served under his command.  General Wilhelm's service was universal in scope and outstanding in performance: inspector-instructor to the 4th Reconnaissance Battalion, a Reserve unit in Gulfport, Mississippi; Deputy Provost Marshal, U.S. Naval Forces Philippines; operations officer and executive officer, 1st Battalion, 1st Marines, Camp Pendleton, California; staff officer for Logistics, Plans and Policy Branch, Installations and Logistics Department, Headquarters Marine Corps; J-3, Headquarters, U.S. European Command. Then in August of 1998, while assigned as the Assistant Chief of Staff for Operations of the Second Marine Expeditionary Force, Charles Wilhelm was promoted to brigadier general and assigned as the Director of Operations, Headquarters Marine Corps. Two years later, he was chosen to serve as Deputy Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Policy and Missions within the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low Intensity Conflict.  This experience served him well, when, as commanding general of the 1st Marine Division, General Wilhelm served as Commander, Marine Forces Somalia as part of Operation Restore Hope. I might add a personal observation at this point in stating with Charles Wilhelm, the United States has a respected resource with regard to the difficult but necessary challenge our military has in meeting vital national security interests and balancing those interests with the many, if not overwhelming, peacekeeping and humanitarian missions we find ourselves involved in today.  It goes without saying that in the past members of our military have been sent into peacekeeping missions where there was no peace to be kept. When that happens, why peacekeepers become targets and tragedy results. Gen. Charles Wilhelm knows the difference and we should take heed. He went on to serve in a series of command positions to include: Commanding General, Marine Corps Combat Development Command; Commander, U.S. Marine Corps Forces, Atlantic; Commander, U.S. Marine Corps Forces, South; Commanding General, Second Marine Expeditionary Force; Commanding General, Marine Strike Force Atlantic.  General Wilhelm assumed duties at U.S. Southern Command in September, in 1997 where he served until his retirement just a few weeks ago. As commander of the U.S. Southern Command, General Wilhelm devoted his enormous personal energy--and boy does he have that--his visionary leadership and his remarkable diplomatic skills to achieving vital national security objectives and strengthening democratic institutions and governance--and thereby individual freedom and economic opportunity--throughout the Southern Hemisphere.  General Wilhelm's personal decorations are testimony to his valor and bravery. He is indeed recognized within the U.S. Marine Corps as a warrior among warriors. But, he is also part military and political theorist, diplomat, and humanitarian. He enhanced civilian control of military institutions throughout Latin America; he improved multilateral relations among the 32 nations--that is 32 nations and 12.5 million square miles stretching from Antarctica to the Florida Keys.  Concurrently, General Wilhelm oversaw the integration of the Caribbean into the command's theater, supervised the implementation of the 1977 Panama Canal treaties--no small feat--he energized United States Interagency efforts to counter the flow of illegal narcotics into the United States and finally, sought and obtained congressional support for the U.S. assistance plan for Colombia's counter drug program. While doing all of this in his 3 year stint, he restructured his command's architecture and theater engagement strategy to position the command to meet the challenges of the 21st century. I am tempted to say that in the midst of all this he rested on the 7th day but in fact he did not.  As chairman of the Emerging Threats Subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee--that is the subcommittee of jurisdiction over virtually all of the missions within the Southern Command--I want the record to show that the general accomplished his goals at precisely the same time the Southern Command suffered tremendous budget and infrastructure challenges. That is the nicest way I can put it. He always said he did not have problems; he had challenges. That was due to U.S. involvement in the Balkans and the drawdown of the tremendous budget and essential infrastructure support to the general's mission and the mission of the Southern Command.  I do not know how, quite frankly, he accomplished his tasks. I might add, from my personal standpoint, in terms of our immediate and pressing challenges with regard to refugees, more than in the Balkans, the problems and challenges of immigration, drugs, terrorism, trade, the commonality of interests within our own hemisphere, and our domestic energy supply--we now get roughly 17 to 18 percent of our energy supply from Venezuela; there are real problems in Venezuela--our vital national interests, General Wilhelm has tried his very best to alert the Pentagon, the administration, and the Congress to these concerns and suggest rational and reasonable policy options. His advice is sound, based upon years of experience and hard, hard work. The value and worth of his policy recommendations, I will predict, and his cornerstone efforts to build on that success will be proven correct.  Carol Rosenberg of the Miami Herald newspaper recently captured what I am trying to say in an article that accurately describes the successes General Wilhelm has achieved and the character of the man as well.  Ms. Rosenberg simply put it this way:       A Black Hawk helicopter landed in the center of a crude      baseball diamond on a recent morning, delivering a four-star      U.S. Marine general bearing baseballs and money.       Chopper blades were still kicking dust when hundreds of      residents crowded around, some sporting American League style      uniforms donated by a California bike shop owner--  At the request of the general.       Then a nine-man Nicaraguan band pulled out sheet music and      played The Star Spangled Banner for the general.  According to the article, he said:       This is why I love this job. I've never heard it played any      better.  His career stretches back to Vietnam, as noted by Ms. Rosenberg. She went on to point out in her article the general has been part military strategist and diplomat. She outlined his leadership, as I said before, in the tremendous U.S. humanitarian efforts after Hurricane Mitch and other medical and disaster recovery missions demonstrating the United States bid to be a good neighbor and an ally in the Americas and the example of a civilian-controlled military to the emerging democracies.  In the article, Ms. Rosenberg also pointed out that last month General Wilhelm paid a last visit to Managua, Nicaragua, and stood proudly as the Nicaragua Army chief, General Javier Carrion, draped him with a blue and white sash, the army's highest honor in Nicaragua, for ``building respectful relations'' between the two countries.  For a decade, our Nation was allied with the Nicaraguan Army's adversary, i.e. the Contras, in a 10-year-old civil war. According to veteran observers, only 2 years ago, the tension and suspicion was still so thick between the two countries that you could cut it. Last month, through the efforts of one man, General Wilhelm received a medal for building respect between the two nations.  I ask unanimous consent that the article by Carol Rosenberg in the Miami Herald be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [From the Miami Herald, Sept. 3, 2000]                Southcom General Bows Out After 37 Years          politics, strategy--and a dash of baseball diplomacy                          (By Carol Rosenberg)       Boaco, Nicaragua--A Black Hawk helicopter landed in the      center of a crude baseball diamond on a recent morning,      delivering     a four-star U.S. Marine general bearing baseballs and money.       Chopper blades were still kicking up dust when hundreds of      curious residents crowded around, some sporting American      League-style uniforms donated by a California bike shop      owner. Then, a nine-man Nicaraguan band pulled out sheet      music and played The Star Spangled Banner for the general and      his entourage--colonels and bodyguards, fixers and escort      officers.       ``This is why I love this job. I've never heard it played      better,'' confided Gen. Charles Wilhelm, whose 37-year Marine      career stretches back to Vietnam.       Part military strategist, part diplomat, Wilhelm, 59      retires this week from a three-year tour of duty as chief of      the Southern Command, the Pentagon's Miami-based nerve center      for Latin America and the Caribbean, staffed by about 1,000      service members and civilians.       Southcom, as it is called, is in charge of U.S. military      activities across 12.5 million square miles stretching from      Antarctica to the Florida Keys. Based in Panama for decades,      it evolved out of U.S. construction of the Panama Canal and      moved to Miami in 1997, as Wilhelm took charge. The move was      part of a phased withdrawal to prepare for this past New      Year's retreat from the Canal Zone.       Among its most high-profile missions: the 1989 seizure of      Panamanian strongman Manuel Noriega. Southcom also directed      U.S. support for the Nicaraguan contras in the 1980s and has      for years sent doctors and other military experts for joint-     training missions in Latin America.       Now is a pivotal time: Congress has just approved $1.3      billion in U.S. aid for Plan Colombia--an ambitious campaign      to fight the drug trade in the nation that supplies the bulk      of the cocaine distributed in the United States. The effort--     the United States' most ambitious military activity in the      Americas in years--provides for 60 helicopters, 500 U.S.      troops, and 300 civilian contractors.       And Wilhelm, an architect by virtue of his position at      Southcom, is one of its greatest champions.       Yet, as the recent dabble in baseball diplomacy shows, the      job of Southcom's commander in chief is a curious blend of      politics and strategy. A California congressman had asked      Southcom to rebuild the baseball diamond, damaged by      flooding, at the request of a constituent who had once played      baseball in the area.       But after crunching numbers back in Doral, Wilhelm      concluded the cost of Operation Field of Dreams would be too      high: $250,000 to move in heavy equipment, as unreasonable      1.25 percent of his discretionary budget. So, instead, he      brought three-dozen baseballs, a $300 donation, and gave      townspeople a first-hand look at U.S. helicopter technology,      carefully monitored by U.S. Army flight crews watching to      make sure nobody made off with a removable part.       And he added the baseball diamond to a Southcom ``to-do''      list, just in case future relief efforts bring the necessary      equipment and U.S. forces back to Boaco.       The last August visit illustrated how much Southcom has      changed since Wilhelm inherited the command. Now entrenched      in Miami, Southcom today is leaner than its huge outpost in      Panama of the 1990s, and with a curious mosaic of military      relations.       Thanks to U.S. humanitarian efforts after Hurricane Mitch,      it has the best relationship in years with Nicaragua and a      patchwork of mini bases for drug hunting and humanitarian      relief missions in the Caribbean and Central America. U.S.      troops that before Wilhelm's arrival swelled to 11,000-plus      in Southcom's 12.5 million square miles of territory--most at      sprawling bases in Panama--have been largely reassigned to      the continental United States.       Now Southcom has a permanent presence of 2,479 soldiers,      sailors and air force personnel, most in Puerto Rico, and      relies on periodic training exercises of reservists and      National Guard members to carry out a key part of the      command's activities--medical and disaster recovery missions      offered to host countries by embassies. They demonstrate      Washington's bid to be a good neighbor in the Americas and      illustrate the grandeur of a civilian-controlled military, a      good example for emerging democracies.       On the down side, Washington has been unable so far to      persuade Venezuela to permit flights over the country for      U.S. drug-hunting operations--a significant blind spot in the      hemispheric war on narcotrafficking. U.S. aircraft patrolling      the skies over Latin America now have to fly around      Venezuela, adding as much as 90 minutes to their missions in      their pursuit of drug runners, mostly from Colombia.       Nor has U.S. diplomacy convinced Panama to accept a      permanent military presence, for drug operations or any other      U.S. activities. The last U.S. forces departed on New Year's      Eve and sentiments are not yet ripe for a return of U.S.      military personnel.       In Haiti, successive exercises and training programs by      Southcom have not been able to meaningfully enhance the rule      of law, and U.S. drug interdiction monitors, who see it as a      trans-shipment spot, have not been able to enlist local      authorities there as allies in their anti-drug campaign.      Cooperation by foreign police and militaries is key to the      U.S. war on drug trafficking. But drug monitors say they have      not found partners in Port-au-Prince, whose security forces      are still in chaos, to make seizures and arrests when they      detect drug smugglers.                             No funding yet       And Wilhelm has yet to win congressional funding to      permanently base Southcom in Miami, now in an industrial park      not far from the airport, a $40 million measure. Wilhelm's      tenure ends Friday with a change-of-command ceremony presided      over by Defense Secretary William Cohen. If Congress confirms      President Clinton's choice of Marine Lt. Gen. Peter Pace in      time, it will be only the second time in history that a      Marine will head Southcom, a job traditionally held by the      Army. Wilhelm will wind up his Marine career by moving back      to suburban Washington, D.C. under mandatory retirement,      which only could have been averted by promotion to the Joint      Chiefs of Staff--or a transfer to another four-star post--for      example, overseeing military operations in Europe or the      Persian Gulf.       But, Wilhelm said, he aspires to re-emerge in civilian life      as a player in Latin America--perhaps as a troubleshooter,      capitalizing on his civilian and military contacts throughout      the Americas. He espouses a fascination with the region.       ``It interests me for a lot of very good reasons--and      they're not all altruistic,'' he said in a recent interview.       ``I see our future prosperity in the Americas, not in the      Far East . . .  Forty-six percent of our exports flow within      the Americas, 28 percent to the FAR East and 26 percent to      Europe and I see that balance shifting even more to the      Americas at least over the first 25 years of this century. So      I think the future prosperity of the United States is      inextricably linked to the Americas.''       Last month's two-day trip to Nicaragua and Honduras--     Wilhelm's last on the road aside from Wednesday's trip to      Colombia with President Clinton--gave a glimpse into the      hemisphere-hopping style of work he seems to relish.       In Tegucigalpa, he met President Carlos Flores and then      choppered to Honduras' Soto Cano Air Base, where the U.S. has      its only permanent military outpost in the region. With a      single landing strip stocked with Chinook and Black Hawk      helicopters, it is home to about 600 Air Force and Army      personnel who mostly support disaster relief and drug      operations. There he took part in a promotion ceremony, and      gave U.S. soldiers and airmen a pep talk.       ``When I call, you haul--no whimpering or whining. That's      what service is all about,'' said Wilhelm.                             ``respectful''       In Managua, he stood surrounded by dozens of local      reporters and camera crews as Nicaraguan Army Chief Gen.      Javier Carrion draped him in a blue and white sash--the      army's highest honor--``for building respectful relations''      between the armies.       Army Col. Charles Jacoby, Wilhelm's executive officer, was      in awe.       In early 1998, Jacoby came to Managua as head of a mission      to negotiate the return of an old B-26 aircraft that crashed      in the jungle after flying missions from a clandestine CIA      airfield for the ill-fated Bay of Pigs invasion. The tension      and suspicion was so thick, you could cut it.       Months later, Hurricane Mitch cut a swath of destruction      through Central America. Wilhelm sent thousands of U.S.      forces to rebuild bridges and schools, clinics and roads--a      goodwill gesture that broke the ice in chilly relations with      the Nicaraguan Army. For a decade, Washington had allied with      the army's adversary, the contras, in a decade-long civil war      that ended in 1990.       ``To see him standing here today getting an award is just      unbelievable,'' Jacoby said moments before a Nicaraguan      officer served champagne.
