 President, I come to the floor to report to my colleagues some sad news. A brave Kentucky law-enforcement officer has fallen in the line of duty. Officer Mark A. Taulbee of the Hodgenville, KY, police department was killed on Sunday, September 16, when his police vehicle crashed during the pursuit of a suspect.  Officer Taulbee had been with the Hodgenville Police Department for 13 months. Prior to that, he had been a deputy with the Butler County Sheriff's Department for 3 years. He is survived by his wife Elizabeth and two children, Audra and Austin.  Officer Taulbee upheld a great tradition of service and sacrifice that is observed by the many men and women in local, State, and national law enforcement across America. Our country owes them a debt of gratitude for putting their lives on the line to protect us and our communities.  Tragically, Officer Taulbee is the first and only Hodgenville police officer ever lost in the performance of his duty. Across America, 84 law enforcement officers have fallen in the line of duty in 2012. That includes two from the Commonwealth of Kentucky, out of a total of approximately 7,800 sworn law enforcement officers statewide.  I know my Senate colleagues will join me in sending my deepest sympathies to Officer Taulbee's family and his colleagues at the Hodgenville Police Department. We have the deepest admiration and respect for police officers in every community across America.  We recognize theirs is both an honorable job and a dangerous one. They bravely risk their lives for ours, and America appreciates everything they do. We cannot be grateful enough for them and their families.  Mr. President, a recent article appeared on the Web site of television news station WAVE-3 of Louisville paying tribute to Officer Taulbee and noting the loss felt by his fellow officers. I ask unanimous consent that said article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                    [From WAVE3.com, Sept. 18, 2012]           Hodgenville Police Chief Remembers Fallen Officer       Hodgenville, KY (WAVE).--Services have been set for a      Hodgenville police officer who died in the line of duty.       Officer Mark Taulbee, 44, had been a long-time law-     enforcement officer in eastern Kentucky before moving to      Hodgenville a little more than a year ago.       Despite being at the department a short time, the chief      said Officer Taulbee had a lasting impact on the police      force.       ``Just like family. It's really hard,'' said Hodgenville      Police Chief Steve Johnson. ``We're very tight, and it's been      a shock to all of us.''       The police department of five now prepares to say goodbye      to one of its own.       ``I am thinking this is the only officer we've ever lost in      the line of duty,'' Johnson said.       A makeshift memorial of crosses can be found where the      crash happened.       Taulbee was chasing a suspect around 3:00 Saturday morning.       In the midst of the case, another call came into 911. ``A      lady said a police car had wrecked in front of her house and      the officer was laying outside the vehicle,'' Johnson said.       Taulbee was rushed to a hospital. ``His wife was working at      Hardin Memorial Hospital when he arrived. She's an X-ray      technician,'' Johnson said.       It's believed that's the last time she saw him. He was then      rushed to University of Louisville Hospital.       ``My understanding was that he was on his way to surgery or      to X-rays and his heart stopped. They did CPR but were unable      to bring him back,'' Johnson said.       Johnson said his phone has been ringing non-stop with calls      from across the country, offering support.       ``Hopkinsville and Elizabethtown are going to send officers      over to work the city so all my units can go to his funeral.      I guess that's what's hitting us so hard. It's the suddenness      of it. It's just hard,'' Johnson said.       Services for Officer Taulbee will be held at the      Hodgenville Civic Center. Visitation is set for Thursday from      3 to 8 p.m. and Friday 9 a.m. to noon. The funeral will begin      at noon on Friday.       The officer leaves behind a wife, a 20-year-old daughter      and a 16-year-old son.                          ____________________
