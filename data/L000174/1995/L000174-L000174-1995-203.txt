President, I will vote for this continuing resolution because we should not shut down the government. Defeating this resolution would force millions of Americans to bear the weight of political intransigence. That is neither fair nor prudent.  However, I oppose the practice of delaying appropriations bills, and then propping the country up on a temporary set of crutches without firm Congressional direction. In many cases, the crutches are inadequate. I am most concerned about the way the Low Income Home Energy Assistant Program was treated by this measure. This Resolution essentially means that Vermont LIHEAP families, many who only earn $7,200/year, will not get any help to keep warm in October. While this Congress goes back and forth about budget numbers in warm conference rooms and well-appointed offices, some Vermonters will be seeing their breath in the air of their homes.  In their third effort to kill LIHEAP this year, the House Republicans have rationalized that LIHEAP funds are expended equally all year round, as if just as much money is spent in August as is spent in November. Therefore, the Continuing Resolution makes about 16 percent of the money available on October 1, 1995. In fact, in past years States have received 60 percent of the money in the first quarter which has amounted to $900 million, or $3.2 million for Vermont.  Under the extreme limitations of this Continuing Resolution, Vermont receives only about $500,000 and the net effect is that LIHEAP families will not receive October assistance. I welcome the LIHEAP opponents to come to Vermont in late October when the leaves are off the trees, the ground is freezing under the corn field stubble, and a cold Canadian wind blows under a slate gray sky. People will be cold.  I have been working with the White House and other members of Congress to get the Republicans to accept a six month schedule so that 30 percent of money is available at a reasonable time of year. They have rejected that proposal, and forced us to accept this proposal by delaying the final consideration of the Resolution. I am disappointed by this approach to LIHEAP, disappointed by the political tactics involved in passing the resolution, and disappointed that we do not have our appropriations bills finished. None-the-less, I am forced to support this resolution because of the circumstances.                          ____________________
