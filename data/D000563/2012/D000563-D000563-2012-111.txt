President, let me thank Senator Kerry, Senator McCain, Senator Lugar, and so many others who have brought this matter to the floor.  It was 22 years ago when an historic event took place on the floor of this Senate which changed the United States of America. It was 22 years ago when we passed the Americans with Disabilities Act, and we said a disability should not disqualify you orlimit you in terms of your opportunity as an American.  Some people thought: This is obvious, everyone knows. But what was also obvious was there was discrimination taking place all across this great land. We removed that barrier to discrimination. And in passing the Americans with Disabilities Act, we stepped forward as a Nation.  Was there fear and concern? Of course. I can recall going to Green County in rural Illinois and walking in Carrollton into City Hall, and they said: Does this mean we have to build a new restroom for the disabled?
