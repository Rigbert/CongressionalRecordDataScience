 President, I rise today to pay tribute to Mr. Jack Warner, the former Chairman and CEO of Gulf States Paper Corporation. I recognize him for the contributions that he and his wife, Elizabeth, have made to Tuscaloosa and the surrounding community.  A man of strong character and a wealth of old-fashioned common sense, Jack Warner has persevered and triumphed no matter what the challenge; through wars, labor strikes, and tough financial and personal circumstances. Through it all, he has remained steadfast in his beliefs and a pioneer from which others might draw inspiration. He has made tough business decisions over the years, and through it all has kept Gulf States Paper privately owned, a challenging endeavor when so many other companies have felt the pressure to go public. His gritty determination has led to financial success, which has helped him to pursue his many philanthropic interests and also allowed him to give back to the Tuscaloosa community.  It was through many obstacles and achievements that Jack Warner developed the strong character and firm convictions that are with him today. A graduate of Culver Military Academy in Culver, Indiana in 1936, he moved on to college at Washington & Lee University to pursue a degree in business administration. Following graduation, he promptly enlisted in the U.S. Army to perform what he saw as his duty to serve the country. As a commissioned officer with the Mars Task Force in the Burma theater of operations, he served the United States in exemplary fashion. Assigned in the Army's last horse-mounted unit, his calvary outfit was sent to India to pack supplies along the Burma trail. Once there, Jack Warner's unit was confronted with difficulties and obstacles which would have taken the spirit out of most men. Jack persevered, however, and his regiment ended up making a significant contribution to the War effort. This short episode in the life of Mr. Warner encapsulates his great spirit and will. He has always demonstrated persistence through adversity, and a commitment to get the job done right.  Perhaps it is this quality which has led to the astonishing success of JackWarner's business endeavors. During his tenure as President and Chairman of the Board of Gulf States Paper Corporation, the company experienced enormous growth. The business which has become synonymous with his name today enjoys a very healthy portfolio. This success has paved the way for many other business ventures and activities for Jack. He is the past director of the American Paper Institute, the past chairman and three-term president of the Alabama Chamber of Commerce, the past two-term president of the Greater Tuscaloosa Chamber of Commerce, a Director of the First Alabama Bank of Tuscaloosa, a past director of the Alabama Great Southern Railroad Company, a past director of the First National Bank of Tuscaloosa, just to name a few. He is truly a fixture in the Tuscaloosa business community.  Jack Warner has not taken his tremendous business success for granted. In fact, he has used his position in the community to become actively involved in the growth and development of Tuscaloosa. Through his efforts, he has made a tremendous impact on Tuscaloosa and the surrounding area. His numerous civic activities attest to his unyielding commitment towards improving the community in which he lives. A few of his current civic activities include membership in the Mount Vernon Advisory Committee, the Decorative Arts Trust Board of Governors, active Director of the University Club of Tuscaloosa, Commodore of the North River Yacht Club, as well as Elder in the First Presbyterian Church of Tuscaloosa. His former activities include a term as the Chairman of the Alabama Council on Economic Education, President of the YMCA of Metropolitan Tuscaloosa, President of the Druid City Hospital Foundation, as well as a member of the National Board of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. He has received numerous honors and awards for his efforts, including the Distinguished Achievement Award from the President's Cabinet at the University of Alabama, the Frances G. Summersell Award from the University of Alabama, the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Alabama State Council on the Arts, the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Greater Tuscaloosa Chamber of Commerce, the Lifetime Preservation Achievement Award from the Tuscaloosa County Preservation Society, and induction into the Alabama Business Hall of Fame.  Jack Warner has truly been an integral part in all aspects of the Tuscaloosa community. It is with great pleasure that I recognize his efforts and rise in tribute to all that he has done for Tuscaloosa and the state of Alabama. His commitment and sense of civic duty is greatly appreciated.                          ____________________
