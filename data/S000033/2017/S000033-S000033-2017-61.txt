 President, this is a very simple and straightforward amendment. It would establish a 60-vote budget point of order to prevent the top 1 percent of Americans, people who are doing phenomenally well, from receiving any future tax cuts.  At a time of massive income and wealth inequality in this country, when the very rich are becoming richer while most Americans are seeing a decline in their standard of living, this is not the time to give tax breaks to people who don't need them.  I urge a ``yes'' vote on the Sanders-Wyden amendment.
