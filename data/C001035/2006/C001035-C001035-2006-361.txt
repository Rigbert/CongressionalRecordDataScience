President, I am pleased to join my colleague, Senator Olympia Snowe, in introducing legislation that will modify the borders of the Aroostook County Empowerment Zone to include the entire county so that the benefits of Empowerment Zone designation can be fully realized in northern Maine.  The Department of Agriculture's Empowerment Zone program addresses a comprehensive range of community challenges, including many that have traditionally received little Federal assistance, reflecting the fact that rural problems do not come in standardized packages but can vary widely from one place to another. The Empowerment Zone program represents a long-term partnership between the Federal Government and rural communities so that communities have enough time to implement projects to build the capacity to sustain their development beyond the term of the partnership. An Empowerment Zone designation gives designated regions potential access to millions of dollars in Federal grants for social services and community redevelopment as well as tax relief.  Aroostook County is the largest county east of the Mississippi River. Yet, despite the impressive character and work ethic of its citizens, the county has fallen on hard times. The 2000 Census indicated a 15-percent loss in population since 1990. Loring Air Force Base, which was closed in 1994, also caused an immediate out-migration of 8,500 people and a further out-migration of families and businesses that depended on Loring for their customer base.  In response to these developments, the Northern Maine Development Commission and other economic development organizations, the private business sector, and community leaders in Aroostook have joined forces to stabilize, diversify, and grow the area's economy. They have attracted some new industries and jobs. As a native of Aroostook County, I can attest to the strong community support that will ensure a successful partnership with the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  Designating this region of the United States as an Empowerment Zone will help ensure its future economic prosperity. However, the restriction that the Empowerment Zone be limited to 1,000 square miles prevents all of Aroostook's small rural communities from benefiting from this tremendous program. Aroostook covers some 6,672 square miles but has a population of only 74,000. Including all of the county in the Empowerment Zone will guarantee that parts of the county will not be left behind as economic prosperity returns to the area. It does little good to have a company move from one community to another within the county simply to take advantage of Empowerment Zone benefits.  Senator Snowe and I introduced this legislation during the 108th Congress. In fact, we were successful in getting this legislation passed in the Senate by attaching it to the fiscal year 2004 Agriculture Appropriations bill. Unfortunately, this language was removed during conference negotiations with the House. Senator Snowe and I remain committed to bringing the benefits of the Empowerment Zone designation to all of Aroostook County's residents and will work to pass this legislation in both Chambers during this Congress.                                 ______                                       By
