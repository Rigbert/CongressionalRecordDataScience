 President, I rise to reintroduce private relief legislation in the 116th Congress on behalf of Ruben Mkoian and Asmik Karapetian. The Mkoian family has been living in Fresno, California, for over 20 years. I continue to believe this family deserves Congress' special consideration for such an extraordinary form of relief as a private bill.  The Mkoian family is originally from Armenia. They decided to leave Armenia for the United States in the early 1990s, following several incidents in which the family experienced harassment, vandalism and threats to their well-being.  In Armenia, Ruben worked as a police sergeant on vehicle licensing. At one point, he was offered a bribe to register stolen vehicles, which he refused and reported to his superior, the police chief. He later learned that a co-worker had registered the vehicles at the request of the same chief.  After Ruben reported the bribe offer to illegally register vehicles and said he'd call the police, his family store was vandalized and he received threatening phone calls telling him to keep quiet. A bottle of gasoline was thrown into his family's residence, burning it to the ground. In April 1992, several men entered the family store and assaulted Ruben, hospitalizing him for 22 days.  Ruben, Asmik, and their son Arthur, who was 3 years old at the time, left Armenia and entered the United States on visitor visas. They applied for political asylum that same year on thegrounds that they would be subject to physical attacks if returned to Armenia. It took 16 years for their case to be finalized, with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals denying their asylum case in January 2008.  At this time, Ruben and Asmik have exhausted every option to obtain immigration relief in the United States. It would be a terrible shame to remove this family from the United States and to separate them from their son Arsen, who is 20 years old and a U.S. citizen. The Mkoians have worked hard to build a place for their family in California and are an integral part of their community.  The family attends St. Paul Armenian Apostolic Church in Fresno. They do charity work to send medical equipment to Armenia. Ruben works as a driver for Uber. He previously worked as a manager at a car wash in Fresno and as a truck driver for a California trucking company that described him as ``trustworthy,'' ``knowledgeable,'' and an asset to the company. Asmik has worked as a medical assistant the past 6 years at the Fresno Shield Medical Center.  Reflecting their contributions to their community, Representatives George Radanovich (R-CA) and Jim Costa (D-CA) strongly supported this family's ability to remain in the United States. When I first introduced a private bill for the Mkoian family, I received more than 200 letters of support and dozens of calls of support from friends and community members, attesting to the positive impact that this family has had in Fresno, California.  I believe that this case warrants our compassion. I respectfully ask my colleagues to support this private legislation on behalf of the Mkoian family.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 796       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENT STATUS FOR RUBEN MKOIAN AND                    ASMIK KARAPETIAN.

(b) Adjustment of Status.--If Ruben Mkoian or Asmik      Karapetian enters the United States before the filing      deadline specified in subsection (c), Ruben Mkoian or Asmik      Karapetian, as appropriate, shall be considered to have      entered and remained lawfully in the United States and shall      be eligible for adjustment of status under section 245 of the      Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1255) as of the      date of the enactment of this Act.       (c) Application and Payment of Fees.--Subsections (a) and      (b) shall apply only if the application for the issuance of      an immigrant visa or the application for adjustment of status      is filed with appropriate fees not later than two years after      the date of the enactment of this Act.       (d) Reduction of Immigrant Visa Numbers.--Upon granting an      immigrant visa or permanent resident status to Ruben Mkoian      and Asmik Karapetian, the Secretary of State shall instruct      the proper officer to reduce by two, during the current or      next following fiscal year--       (1) the total number of immigrant visas that are made      available to natives of the country of birth of Ruben Mkoian      and Asmik Karapetian under section 203(a) of the Immigration      and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1153(a)); or       (2) if applicable, the total number of immigrant visas that      are made available to natives of the country of birth of      Ruben Mkoian and Asmik Karapetian under section 202(e) of      such Act (8 U.S.C. 1152(e)).
