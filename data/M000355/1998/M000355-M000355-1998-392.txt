 President, I rise today to speak on behalf of my amendment to bring the federal highway bill into compliance with the equal protection clause of the Constitution and with various federal court rulings, including two landmark Supreme Court cases.  The question for the Senate this morning is this: Is it fair, prudent and constitutional for the Federal Government to set-aside a fixed percentage of public highway contracts for a preferred group of citizens--until the year 2004, mind you--based on the immutable traits of race and gender?  Or let me phrase it another way: Should U.S. Senators, all of whom have sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution, reauthorize a law that has been reviewed by the United States Supreme Court and subsequently struck down by a Federal court in Colorado?  Mr. President, I say the answer to this question must be a firm and resounding ``no.''  We must stand up for the Constitution. We must guarantee the equal protection of the laws to every citizen of our country, without regard to race and gender.  We must follow the clear decisions of the Supreme Court, including Adarand and Croson, and the decisions of the court of appeals for the third circuit, the fourth circuit, the fifth circuit, the sixth circuit, the seventh circuit, the ninth circuit, the eleventh circuit and the DC circuit. All of them have struck down race-based programs in the past few years--all of them.  We must take heed of unambiguous rulings of lower courts in Georgia, Connecticut, Ohio, Louisiana, Michigan, and, most importantly, in Colorado.  Let me remind my colleagues that less than 9 months ago the Federal district court in Colorado followed the Supreme Court's lead in Adarand and Croson and ruled--and I quote:       Section 1003(b) of ISTEA and the regulations promulgated      thereunder are unconstitutional.  I do not know when this body will ever have a clearer decision than this one. The administration and the Department of Transportation have tried to obscure this clarity with three or four predictable diversionary tactics.  Diversionary tactic No. 1: Ignore the court decisions. The first diversionary tactic is simply to ignore all the cases I have just cited, claim that Adarand never happened or simply claim that Adarand was wrongly decided or that it is just one decision by one court.  Well, I have quoted Adarand directly and pointed out, with great detail, that Adarand is not an aberration--not an aberration, Mr. President. Again, I quote the Congressional Research Service. The Adarand decision--this is from CRS--``largely conforms to a pattern of federal rulings which have invalidated state and local governmental programs to promote minority contracting--in: Richmond, San Francisco, San Diego, Dade County, Fla., Atlanta, New Orleans, Columbus, Ohio, [the State of] Louisiana, and Michigan, among others--and new challenges continue to be filed [probably as we speak].''  For those who say that Adarand is just not enough for us to go on, let me cite yet another Supreme Court case, Richmond v. Croson from 1989. In that case, the Government decided that minorities were underrepresented in the public construction arena. So the Government enacted a law like ISTEA that said: not less than 30 percent of construction dollars must be allocated to officially preferred--this is officially preferred--minority groups.  And you know what the Supreme Court said about the so-called ``30 percent goal''? The Supreme Court said that this ``goal'' was ``an unyielding racial quota.'' It was a quota, even though the Government plan had a waiver process to supposedly let you out of the quota in certain circumstances.  Let me quote the United States Supreme Court when it applied the ``strict scrutiny'' test to a set-aside that is virtually identical to the DBE that we have been talking about the last 2 days, the DBE set-aside in ISTEA. The Court said:       We, therefore, hold that the city has failed to demonstrate      a compelling interest in apportioning public contracting      opportunities on the basis of race. To accept the city's      claim that past societal discrimination alone can serve as      the basis for rigid racial preferences would be to open the      door to competing claims for `remedial relief' for every      disadvantaged group. The dream of a Nation of equal citizens      in a society where race is irrelevant to personal opportunity      and achievement would be lost in a mosaic of shifting      preferences based on inherently unmeasurable claims of past      wrongs. . . . We think such a result would be contrary to      both the letter and spirit of a constitutional provision      whose central command is equality.  Diversionary tactic No. 2: ``We've changed the law,'' they say, ``by tinkering with the regulations.''  When ignoring the Court fails, then someone suggests and the administration claims that they have simply changed an unconstitutional statute by simply tinkering with the regulations. But let me point out that the DOT has no new regulations. All we have from DOT is a promise to do better. And the Senate is apparently going to turn a blind eye to the equal protection clause of the Constitution and authorize a $17 billion quota on the mere promise--the mere promise--of cleaning up the program.  Does that fact not strike any other Member of this Senate as being a bit odd? I hope it does.  These new regulations are only in the ``proposal'' stage. We do not know what they will end up looking like. We do not know if they will make the program better or worse, constitutional or unconstitutional. Even DOT does not know what the new regs will look like.  For example, my colleagues argued yesterday that the proposed regulations would narrowly tailor the program because they would include an economic cap on DBEs. My colleague from Montana argued yesterday that our problems are solved because the new regulations will exclude the Sultan of Brunei--the wealthiest monarch in the world--from the Disadvantaged Business Program. The sultan will not be anywhere near the DBE program, my good friends argue.  Well, last night I took a close look at the proposed regulations to see what the economic cap would be. And you know what I found? Let me read to you word for word the exact language of the so-called narrowly tailoring economic cap.       You may require the individual whose disadvantage is being      questioned to provide information about his or her personal      net worth.  But the proposed rule goes on to say:       You may require only such information as is necessary to      establish whether the individual's personal worth exceeds      [blank].  They have not decided yet how poor you have to be.  So what is the economic cap? We have no idea. Will there be an economic cap at all? We are told there will be, but it has not been provided yet. DOT apparently does not know. So let me say, I do not know whether the Sultan of Brunei will be excluded or not. The proposed regs do not tell where this narrowly tailored economic cutoff is.  But, Mr. President, even if the cap excludes the sultan--and this is what I hope everybody will remember--even if the cap excludes the sultan, it still will not solve the narrowly tailored problem. You know why? Because even if you solve the ``economic'' problem, you have still not solved the ``race'' problem. The Supreme Court and the district court did not focus on the ``economic,'' but rather the ``race'' issue.  Changing the economic guidelines does not change the fact that the DOT will still presume that all members of certain races are ``socially disadvantaged'' and need preferences. In other words, the proposed regulations do nothing to solve the most serious problem, which is that ISTEA will continue to make presumptions and decisions based on race, without any particular findings of discrimination against particular individuals or even particular groups in the highway contracting area.  So even if the new regs exclude the sultan economically, everyone will be relieved to know that other persons from Brunei will still be ``presumed'' to be socially disadvantaged and get preferences, even though no State DOT agency has ever engaged in a pervasive pattern of discrimination against persons from Brunei or from Tonga or Micronesia or the Maldive Islands. Never heard of such a case, but these people are all, by Government fiat, put into the class for preferential treatment.  In the words of the district court in Adarand:       It [is] difficult to envisage a race-based classification      that is narrowly tailored. By its very nature, such a program      is both underinclusive and overinclusive. This seemingly      contradictory result suggests that the criteria are lacking      in substance as well as in reason.  Or as the Supreme Court held in Croson, a program is unconstitutional where ``a successful black, Hispanic, or Oriental entrepreneur from anywhere in the country enjoys an absolute preference over other citizens based solely on their race. We think it obvious that such a program is not narrowly tailored to remedy the effects of prior discrimination.''  Mr. President, let me conclude this particular point by reminding every Senator that Adarand and Croson are landmark Supreme Court decisions that are now the law of the land. The administration's attempt to comply with the law of the land has been to merely do a little DOT song-and-dance by playing with transportation regulations, not changing any regulations, mind you, but simply proposing them--proposing them.  Mr. President, complying with a landmark Supreme Court case requires much more than a mere ``tinkering'' with the regs.  Professor George LaNoue is a constitutional law expert who has testified in numerous minority contracting cases. Professor LaNoue has explained in great detail how the DOT's proposed regulations fail to bring the DBE program into compliance with the constitution. I ask unanimous consent that a letter from Professor George LaNoue that details the substantial shortcomings of the proposed regulations be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         University of California, Berkeley Institute of            Governmental Studies,                                   Berkeley, CA, October 17, 1997.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: It is being asserted that various      alterations in proposed regulations for Intermodel Surface      Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) solve the      constitutional problems created by the use of race, ethnic,      and gender preferences in awarding of contracts under that      program. That assertion is incorrect for two reasons.       First, the regulatory alterations go only to the issue of      narrow tailoring, not to the constitutional requirement that      a compelling basis of remedying identified discrimination be      established before any for the use of preferences be      considered.       None of the fundamental evidentiary requirements necessary      to support the preferences in this legislation have been      established either by the administration or by Congress.       For example,       1. There has been no determination about whether there has      been any discrimination by any federal agency in the      contemporary procurement process.       2. There has been no determination about whether any state      DOT agency or any other state agency has discriminated in the      award of federal contract dollars.       3. There has been no determination about whether there has      been any underutilization of qualified, willing and able MBE      contractors in federal procurement or federally assisted      procurement as prime contractors or subcontractors. The      federal government has completed no disparity study that      could create the ``proper findings'' the judiciary requires      of governments before they employ race conscious measures.       4. There has been no determination about whether, when MBEs      bid on contracts, they are proportionately successful. No      study of who bids on federal contracts has been released.       As the Eleventh Circuit said unanimously on September 2,      1997 in striking down a preferential procurement program: . .      . if a [race conscious] program is not grounded on a proper      evidentiary basis, than all of the contract measures go down      with the ship, irrespective of any narrow tailoring or      substantial relationship analysis.'' (Engineering Contractors      Association of South Florida v. Metropolitan Dade County,      1997 WL 535626, *7, (11th Cir. (Fla.))).       Second, even if a compelling interest has been established,      the proposed regulations do not meet narrowly tailoring      requirements.       1. There has been no statistical analysis of whether the      particular racial and ethnic groups granted presumptive      eligibility are in fact economically or socially      disadvantaged because of patterns of discrimination in recent      years. The current list of presumptive eligible groups is a      polyglot of designations by racial group (African Americans),      culture (Hispanic), country of origin (Asian Americans) and      lineage (Native Americans). Some of the groups on the      presumptively eligible list have been in this country since      its beginning; some are very recent arrivals. Some are      relatively poor; some are relatively affluent. Some have very      high rates of business formation; some very low. Some have      well-documented histories of discrimination; some are      virtually invisible. These groups have nothing in common at      all.       The district court in the remand of Adarand v. Pena found      that the use of race and ethnic based presumptive eligibility      was unconstitutional because:       ``. . . it [is] difficult to envisage a race based      classification that is narrowly tailored. By it's very      nature, such a program is both underinclusive and      overinclusive. This seemingly contradictory results suggests      that the criteria are lacking in substance as well as in      reason.'' (at 59-60).       2. There has been no post-Adarand evaluation of the      effectiveness of existing federal race neutral programs or      the possibility of creating new ones. The utility of race      neutral programs must be established before race conscious      remedies are employed. The Eleventh Circuit citing Croson      recently said:       ``. . . we flatly reject the County's assertion that      ``given a strong basis in evidence of a race-based problem, a      race-based remedy is necessary.'' That is simply not the law.      If a race-neutral remedy is sufficient to cure a race-based      problem, then a race conscious remedy can never be narrowly      tailored to the problem.'' See, Croson, 488 U.S. at 509).      (Engineering Contractors Association of South Florida v.      Metropolitan Dade County, 1997 WL 535626, *34, (11th Cir.      (Fla.))).       Race conscious measures can only be used as narrowly      tailored remedies for identified discrimination. Race based      means can not be used, as the DOT regulations provide,      whenever an arbitrary set-aside or goal percentage is not      reached in a particular state during a particular period.       3. There has been no fulfillment of the Administration's      promise to create goals specific to various industries. On      May 23, 1996, the Justice Department proposed ``benchmark      limits'' for each industry intended to represent the ``level      of minority contracting that one would reasonably expect to      find in a market absent discrimination or its effects'' and      to control the decision of whether race conscious means were      necessary in federal procurement related to that industry.      (61 Fed. Reg. 26042, 26045, 1996). These benchmark limits      still have not been produced.       The Department apparently thought such benchmark limits      were essential to narrow tailoring and stated:       ``Application of the benchmark limits ensures that any      reliance on race is closely tied to the best available      analysis of the relative capacity of minority firms to      perform the work in question--or what their capacity would be      in the absence of discrimination.'' (61 Fed. Reg. 26042,      26049, 1996)       Given this premise, the failure to develop the benchmark      limits strongly suggests federal goals in ISTEA are not      narrowly tailored.       In short, the record does not support the conclusion that a      compelling basis for the use of Race conscious remedies      exists with regard to the ISTEA program. The proposed      regulations are either irrelevant or incomplete to the major      requirements of narrowly tailoring and they do not begin to      supply a compelling basis for the use of preferences.           Sincerely,                                                George R. La Noue,         Professor of Political Science, Policy Sciences Graduate            Program, University of Maryland Graduate School            Baltimore, Visiting Scholar, IGS, University of            California, Berkeley.  Mr. McCONNELL. Diversionary tactic No. 3, Mr. President: It is said that ``10 percent is a goal, not a quota.''  When all else fails, the final diversionary tactic is to argue that the DBE program is a program with goals, not quotas. In fact, some of my colleagues have gone to great lengths to point out that the 10 percent set-aside is merely a goal with no sanctions whatsoever.  Well, let us look at the DBE manual--right out of the manual. This manual is the DBE law of the land for States that receive ISTEA money. The DBE manual explains that failure to comply with the requirements will result in sanctions. Let me quote:       If the [Federal Highway] Administrator determines that a      State has violated or failed to comply with the Federal laws      or the regulations . . . with respect to a project, he may      withhold payment to the State of Federal funds on account of      such project, withhold approval of further projects in the      State, and take such other action that he deems appropriate      under the circumstances, until compliance or remedial action      has been accomplished by the State to the satisfaction of the      Administrator.  In other words, there are sanctions. These same threats appear in the actual ISTEA contracts and in the Federal transportation regulations.  Now that I have spelled out that the threat of DBE sanctions are serious and real, I am sure my colleagues will respond by saying, ``OK, sure we list sanctions, but we never use them. So 10 percent is still just a goal. It's not a quota.'' The reasoning here is that the Government must punish someone before the ``goal'' becomes a ``quota'' or a ``requirement.''  Well, first, let me say that the threat of losing millions of Federal highway dollars is plenty of incentive for the States to enforce the quota requirement. When the Federal Government is wielding that kind of weapon from on high, it does not have to punish them. A 10 percent quota is still a quota, even if States always comply and no one is formally punished.  Second, if you think the quota is never enforced, just ask two cities in New Mexico. The Senator from New Mexico and I were having a discussion about this issue on the floor just yesterday. Both the city of Rio Rancho and the City of Albuquerque were sued in Federal court over the use of ISTEA's racial quotas. What did the Federal Department of Transportation do? Did it simply call Rio Rancho and Albuquerque and say, ``Hey, don't worry about the whole 10 percent thing. It's just a goal''?  That is not what happened, Mr. President. Both Rio Rancho and Albuquerque had to sue the Department of Transportation and Secretary Slater in Federal court to stop the quota enforcement. In the complaint that the cities filed they said:       The [Department of Transportation] is placing facially      unconstitutional conditions upon the receipt of discretionary      federal funds to which the City would otherwise be entitled      to, and has caused or is likely to cause irreparable injury      for which the City has no adequate remedy at law.  So both Rio Rancho and Albuquerque sought a court judgment that would require the Department of Transportation to justify or eliminate the quotas and pay any and all damages and attorney fees to the cities.  And the Federal judge was perfectly clear in declaring that the race-based programs were unconstitutional. In the words of the judge:       It doesn't really take a first-year law student to say,      City of Rio Rancho, don't do this again. I mean, you're going      to get sued again.  This is from the court case.  Unfortunately, the city of Rio Rancho, like every other city that receives any ISTEA funds, has little choice in the matter. ISTEA requires racial preferences. And if you are going to get out of the quota requirement, you had better be prepared to go through hell, high water, and the Federal courts.  Surely, my colleagues would agree that a true ``goal'' would not require State and local governments to sue the Federal Department of Transportation in Federal court just to get the ``goal'' fixed.  Let's turn to Houston. If Albuquerque and Rio Rancho don't prove that 10 percent is more than just a goal, then let's go from New Mexico over to Houston, TX. Let me share with you some comments included in the ISTEA committee report on the 6-month authorization bill in the House. These comments were part of a very detailed and astute statement made by several Republican House Members.       In April 1996, a Federal court in Texas temporarily      enjoined Houston's METRO transit authority from utilizing      race or gender-based preferences in the selection or award of      construction contracts--making it impossible for Houston to      comply with the federally-approved DBE program.       So, in response to the court's ruling, Houston designed a      race-neutral program to provide assistance to economically      disadvantaged small businesses.  Very similar to what the McConnell amendment would provide, an opportunity for emerging business enterprises.       The US Department of Transportation refused to recognize      this alternative [race-neutral] program and withheld federal      funding from METRO for nearly seventeen months.  Seventeen months without Federal funds, all because Houston was complying with a court order, Mr. President--Houston was complying with a court order prohibiting preferences. I don't know about you, Mr. President, but that sounds like a sanction to me. It sounds like a lot more than mere goals. It sounds like quota enforcement to any rational person listening to what happened.  The point here, Mr. President, is simple arithmetic: Goals plus requirements equal quotas--goals plus requirements equal quotas. The goals in ISTEA are not merely aspirational. The goals have requirements and the real threat of sanctions.  Let me spell out a few human examples about how goals in theory are actually quotas in practice. The first example was mentioned by Senator Gorton yesterday here on the floor, the insightful story about a man named Frank Gurney from Spokane, WA.  We have talked a lot about victims over the course of the last 2 days. Let's talk about some of the victims of this program. Just a couple of months ago, the head of Frank Gurney, Inc. mailed me a copy of yet another letter explaining how he lost yet another job because of the 10 percent quota. The rejection letter stated:       I regret to inform you that although yours was the lowest      guardrail quote that I received for the . . . project . . . I      found it necessary to use the third lowest guardrail quote      [the third lowest guardrail quote] in order to meet the DOT      requirement of 10 percent DBE.  Sorry, you are out of luck, even though you had the lowest bid.  The rejection letter was dated October 27, 1997. So this is still going on. The letters started in 1981, about the time we first authorized the DBE Program, and are still continuing up to and including last year. We know these letters will continue being sent until at least 2004 under this bill, unless my amendment passes, which will be the next time we will have a chance to revisit this law, Mr. President.  I will say a word about Michael Cornelius. If you think the ISTEA quota is only a goal, just ask Michael Cornelius. Mr. Cornelius' firm was denied a Government contract under ISTEA even though his bid was $3 million lower than the nearest competitor. Mr. Cornelius' bid was rejected because the Government felt the bid did not use enough minority- or women-owned contractors. In fact, the Cornelius bid proposed to subcontract 26.5 percent of the work to firms owned by minorities and women. Yet 26.5 percent was not enough in the world of goals.  I listened yesterday to Senator Kennedy's example of women and minorities who, like Frank Gurney and Michael Cornelius, have been the victims of discrimination. I was moved by Senator Kennedy's stories, and with each of the two or three stories of discrimination that Senator Kennedy told, my instinct and my gut response was, ``That's discrimination, and it is wrong.''  But, Mr. President, do you know the difference between my stories and Senator Kennedy's stories? There is a critical difference. In Senator Kennedy's examples, the discrimination was wrong and the discrimination is prohibited by title VII and the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  So the examples of discrimination that were being cited are against the law--now, a law not being contested byanyone, a law supported by virtually everyone I know back in the mid-1960s.  In my examples, the discrimination was wrong but the discrimination is required. In my examples, the discrimination is wrong but the discrimination is required, Mr. President--required by Federal law, not just any Federal law, but the very Federal law that we are about to reauthorize right here in the U.S. Senate.  How can anyone hear these examples and not conclude that what we are doing in ISTEA is dead wrong? It is wrong for the Cornelius family, it is wrong for the Gurney family, it is wrong for the preferred businesses who get the contracts, and, most importantly, it is wrong for our country.  I don't care how many times you tinker with the regulations or how many times you say 10 percent is only a goal, you can't change the fact, Mr. President, that the Federal Government is requiring States and prime contractors to pick and choose subcontractors based on the immutable traits of race and of gender. There is no lawyer in the Senate and no lawyer anywhere in the United States that will ever convince me that this racial program is fair, prudent, or--most importantly--constitutional.  In closing, let me say, regardless of the outcome of this morning's vote, I firmly believe that the principle underlying the 5th and 14th amendments will ultimately carry the day. It obviously will take a while. The principle is the simple yet powerful idea that every American should be seen as equal in the eyes of the law. I firmly believe, as Justice Scalia explained in Adarand, ``Individuals who have been wronged by unlawful racial discrimination should be made whole; but under our Constitution there can be no such thing as either a creditor or debtor race. . . . In the eyes of the government, we are just one race here. It is American.''  The courts and the American people understand this principle. Unfortunately, the Congress may be a bit behind.  Mr. President, I'm greatly appreciative of my colleagues participating in this important debate on both sides. They are well meaning Senators who look at the same set of facts and reach a different conclusion, but the debate has come and gone, the sky has not fallen, the Capitol dome has not caved in. In fact, it is the opposite. I think this debate has been very positive and constructive.  I end this debate as I began by asking one simple question: Should we place the Senate's seal of approval on a law that the Supreme Court has declared presumptively unconstitutional and the lower court has specifically struck down, without the Senate or House holding even one hearing after Adarand to determine if the law is narrowly tailored to remedy specific and persuasive discrimination?  As a Member of this body, my duty and obligation to the Constitution, the courts, and individual citizens compels me to declare no, we should not reauthorize this law. We have had no hearings since Adarand to determine that this program or any of the 160 Federal programs of racial preference that have been identified by CRS have met the strict scrutiny standard. The tactic of the Clinton administration has been to delay, deny, divert, and obfuscate. The American people deserve better.  Mr. President, I close with the words of the Weekly Standard:       It won't do for a democratic country to lurch its way to      colorblindness courtroom by courtroom, without the clear and      resounding public debate an issue of such moment and      principle demands. It won't do . . . to delay the prize of      colorblindness, even for a moment, by silently ignoring the      battle while it's waged. And, most basically, it won't do . .      . to pretend that we don't understand what the Constitution      says.  Mr. President, How much time remains?
