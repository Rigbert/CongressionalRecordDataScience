Speaker, as you know, I am a very proud alumnus of the University of Maryland. For more than a century and a half, the University of Maryland has represented the best of American ideals of public education. Now I am very proud to say that the University of Maryland tradition is in the capable hands of our new President, Dr. Wallace Loh, who was inaugurated this spring.  Wallace Loh came to the United States at the age of 15, alone, without family, with $300 in his pocket, his parents life savings. Wallace Loh was born in Shanghai, China. His father, a diplomat, fled the Communist regime to Lima, Peru when Wallace was a very young man. He grew up in Lima until the age of 15, but it was here in this country that he pursued the education that would ultimately make him one of our most respected academic leaders.  President Loh comes to College Park from the University of Iowa, where he served as Provost and Executive Vice President. He brings to the University of Maryland more than three decades of hard work and accomplishment in higher education. His successful career as a scholar and administrator has taken him to Seattle University, the University of Washington, the University of Colorado-Boulder, Beijing University in China, and more. He also served as a top policy adviser to Governor Gary Locke, who will be our ambassador in China. Gary Locke, of course, was the Governor of Washington State. In that capacity, he led the State's effort to expand access to higher education for low- and middle-income students.  As a leading scholar in the legal field, Dr. Loh has also been elected President of the Association of American Law Schools. Wallace Loh holds a law degree from Yale University, a Ph.D from the University of Michigan, a master's from Cornell University, and a bachelor's from Grinnell College in Iowa.  I believe that the University of Maryland could not have chosen a more qualified leader to take our university into this century. Throughout his diverse career, President Loh has built a strong track record of creating academic excellence at every stop. What an extraordinary background Wallace Loh has for this increasingly integrated world, particularly as it relates to our relations with China, one of theworld's largest nations both in terms of people and its economy.  In his inaugural address, President Loh reflected on Barack Obama's statement that America has reached a ``sputnik moment,'' a moment when our place as a world economic and innovative leader is increasingly challenged. Institutions like the University of Maryland are critical to our continued leadership in the world. As President Loh said, and I quote, ``The American research university--a crowning achievement of American civilization--must respond to this sputnik moment. We are a premier research university''--speaking of the University of Maryland. He went on to say that ``we must also become a premier innovation and entrepreneurial university.''  I have no doubt, Mr. Speaker, that the University of Maryland is well-equipped to fill that role and do its part for our State and our Nation. And I have no doubt that Wallace Loh was exactly the right person to choose to lead the university at this time.  I want to wish Dr. Loh and the university the very best as it works with so many other extraordinary universities and colleges and educational institutions in the United States of America to make sure that we ``make it in America.'' That is to say that we out-educate, we out-build, we out-innovate our competitors so that we can provide the kind of quality of life, the jobs that our people need, a growing economy for the future, for our children.                          ____________________
