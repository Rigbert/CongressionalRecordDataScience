President, I am delighted that the Senate majority leader has decided to take up the nomination of Dale A. Kimball to be a U.S. district judge for the District of Utah. Mr. Kimball has been engaged in the private practice of law for 30 years and is currently the senior partner in the Salt Lake City law firm, Kimball, Parr, Waddoups, Brown & Gee. The ABA unanimously found him to be well-qualified for this appointment.  We received Mr. Kimball's nomination on September 5, 1997. He participated in a confirmation hearing on September 30 and was unanimously reported by the committee on October 9. Now, less than 7 weeks after receiving his nomination, the Senate has confirmed this nominee. Had the Senate not taken a recess last week, I suspect this nominee would have been confirmed in less than 6 weeks. Nonetheless, 7 weeks is a good benchmark against which to consider our progress on other judicial nominations.  I congratulate Mr. Kimball and his family and look forward to his service on the U.S. district court.  I also congratulate Richard C. Casey on his confirmation as a district judge for the Southern District of New York. Mr. Casey is both an accomplished legal practitioner and a true inspiration. He has been associated with, and a partner of the law firm of Brown & Wood in New York City since 1964. Remarkably, he has been practicing law without his eyesight since the early 1980's--a congenital disease stripped him of his ability to see. Dedicated to serving the blind community of New York City, Mr. Casey is a member of the board of directors for organizations such as Guiding Eyes for the Blind, Catholic Guild for the Blind, and Ski for Light.  I congratulate Mr. Casey and his family and anticipate his outstanding service on the U.S. Federal Court.  We have experienced 115 judicial vacancies over the course of this year. These are only the 20th and 21st nominees that the Senate has confirmed. More than 50 additional nominees remain pending in committee and before the Senate. The Senate is not even keeping pace with attrition for since the adjournment of Congress last year, judicial vacancies have increased by almost 50 percent.  Another of the well-qualified nominees who has been delayed far too long is Margaret Morrow. Her nomination has been pending before the Senate for over 16 months. Last year this nomination was unanimously reported by the Judiciary Committee and was left to wither without action for over 3 months. This year, the committee again reported the nomination favorably and it has been pending for another 4 months. There has been no explanation for this delay and no justification. This good woman does not deserve this shameful treatment.  Senator Hatch noted in his recent statement on September 29 that he will continue to support the nomination of Margaret Morrow and that he will vote for her. He said: ``I have found her to be qualified and I will support her. Undoubtedly, there will be some who will not, but she deserved to have her vote on the floor. I have been assured by the majority leader that she will have her vote on the floor. I intend to argue for and on her behalf.''  I have looked forward to that debate since June 12 when she was favorably reported to the Senate for a second time. This is a nomination that has been pending for far too long and that has been stalled here on the floor twice over 2 years without justification.  Meanwhile, the people served by the district court for the Central District of California continue to suffer the effects of this persistent vacancy--cases are not heard, criminal cases are not being tried. This is one of the many vacancies that have persisted for so long that they are classified as judicial emergency vacancies by the Administrative Office of the United States Courts. There are four vacancies in the court for Los Angeles and the Central District of California. Nominees have been favorably reported by the Judiciary Committee for both of the judicial emergency vacancies in this district but both Margaret Morrow and Christina Snyder have been stalled on the Senate calendar.  This is a district court with over 300 cases that have been pending for longer than 3 years and in which the time for disposing of criminal felony cases and the number of cases filed increased over the last year. Judges in this district handle approximately 400 cases a year, including somewhere between 40 and 50 criminal felony cases. Still these judicial vacancies are being perpetuated without basis or cause by a Republican leadership that refuses to vote on these well-qualified nominees.  I am told that last week a Republican Senator announced at a speech before a policy institute that he has a hold on the Morrow nomination. The Senator's press release stated that he had placed a hold on Margaret Morrow's nomination because he wants to ``be able to debate the nomination and seek a recorded vote.'' I too want to debate the nomination of Margaret Morrow and have been seeking Senate consideration of this outstanding nominee for many months. After being on the Senate calendar for a total of 7 months, this nomination has been delayed too long.  I believe all would agree that it is time for the full Senate to debate thisnomination and vote on it. I have inquired about a time agreement but gotten no response. Now that an opponent has finally come forward to identify himself, I look forward to a prompt debate and a vote on this nomination in accordance with the apparent commitment of the majority leader. I look forward to that debate. I ask again, as I have done repeatedly over the last several months, why not now, why not today, why not this week?  I again urge the majority leader to call up the nomination of Margaret Morrow for a vote. She has suffered enough. The people of the Central District of California have been denied this outstanding jurist for long enough. The chairman of the Judiciary Committee said last month that he had the assurance of the majority leader that she will be called up for a vote but neither has said when that will be. I hope that the majority leader will proceed to the consideration of this nomination and that he will support Margaret Morrow to be a district court judge for the Central District of California.
