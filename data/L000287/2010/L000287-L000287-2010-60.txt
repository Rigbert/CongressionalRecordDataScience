Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 1127) expressing concern regarding the suicide plane attack on Internal Revenue Service employees in Austin, Texas.  The Clerk read the title of the resolution.  The text of the resolution is as follows:                              H. Res. 1127       Whereas all Federal employees, and those from the Internal      Revenue Service in particular, have experienced a terrible      tragedy in the suicide plane attack on February 18, 2010;       Whereas Vernon Hunter, who lost his life in the terror      attack, had 48 years of public service, including 20 years of      serving in the United States Army and 2 tours in Vietnam;       Whereas Federal, State, and local officials have cooperated      to respond promptly and professionally to the attack and      provide assistance to Internal Revenue Service victims and      families affected by the crash; and       Whereas Federal employees, from the Armed Forces to the      Internal Revenue Service, serve their Nation with honor and      commitment, and perform public service that benefits the      entire Nation: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That the House of Representatives--       (1) strongly condemns the terror attack perpetrated      deliberately against Federal employees of the Internal      Revenue Service in Austin, Texas;       (2) honors Vernon Hunter, a victim of the crash, Shane      Hill, who suffered severe injuries, and all those who were      injured for their service to our Nation;       (3) commends Internal Revenue Service employees for their      dedication and public service;       (4) recognizes the heroic actions of the first responders,      emergency services personnel, Internal Revenue Service      employees, and citizens on the ground in Austin such as Robin      De Haven whose actions minimized the loss of life; and       (5) rejects any statement or act that deliberately fans the      flames of hatred or expresses sympathy for those who would      attack public servants serving our Nation.
