 President, I will be pleased to join the Chairman of the Legislative Branch Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator Bennett, in presenting to the Senate what I believe is a very good conference agreement on the Fiscal Year 2000 budget.  Under the strong leadership of Chairman Bennett, as well as Mr. Taylor, the House Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman, and Mr. Pastor, the Ranking Democrat on the House Subcommittee, we were able to work our differences in a way that ensures that the essential functions for which appropriations are contained in this bill are able to continue their operations and to carry out their responsibilities efficiently and without any diminution of service.  In all, the recommendations that we are presenting today total just over $2.45 billion, almost $21 million below the Subcommittee's allocation. In reaching compromises on the various issues in the conference, Chairman Bennett was very careful to ensure that the cuts did not unnecessarily impair the programs where those cut were taken. I shared the concerns of the Chairman that these reductions be carefully considered as to their effects, before they were agreed to.  In his statement, Chairman Bennett has already laid out to the Senate the details of the conference agreement, which I will not repeat at this time.  I wish to congratulate the Chairman, Senator Bennett, for his hard work throughout the year on this bill. This was my first year to serve as the Ranking Member of this important Subcommittee, and Senator Bennett could not have been more helpful to me and my staff. It has been a real pleasure to work at his side on this bill and I look forward to continuing to work with him on all matters that are in the jurisdiction of the Legislative Branch Appropriations Subcommittee.  Finally, Mr. President, I thank the staff who have worked so diligently throughout the year in assisting Chairman Bennett and myself--Mary Dewald, who recently left the Committee staff, Edie Stanley, her successor, and Jim English, as well as Chris Kierig of my staff. They, together with Christine Ciccone, the Majority Clerk of the Subcommittee, and Chip Yost of Senator Bennett's staff, have carried out their responsibilities in their usual, highly professional manner. Our staffs work together, as do Chairman Bennett and I, in a non-partisan way so that the decisions that we have made throughout the year have been reached based on objective considerations, rather than partisanship.  Mr. President, I urge adoption of this conference report.                          ____________________
