Because they are divided, they are trying to cobble together some of their hardest-line Members so that they can get them to vote for this supplemental.  And they put on a bill which has had no notice to the American people or to Members of Congress. It is ironic that people are supporting this who demanded that we read the bills. There was no bill to read until this morning.  How sad for the American people. We have a humanitarian crisis that must be addressed without delay, and the way to address it without delay is to give the resources necessary and then pursue the legislative process, not together. It will slow it down, and I predict it will not pass the Senate. I think the gentlemen and ladies on this side of the aisle know that the Senate is not going to pass this bill.  So if you really think we ought to act now, do so in a bipartisan fashion, and then let us debate the legislation before us.  Mr. McCaul just said this is a real crisis. He just said it just minutes ago, Mr. McCaul, the chairman of the committee. This is a real crisis which demands action. The recommendation that has been made to us will undermine action by this body in the face of crisis. We should not pass this legislation. We ought to pass a very simple resource to the crisis now and legislation later.  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''
