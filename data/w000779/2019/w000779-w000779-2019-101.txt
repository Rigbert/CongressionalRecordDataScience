This time, it is Neomi Rao, who is up for a lifetime appointment to the powerful DC Circuit Court of Appeals.  While studying at Yale, Ms. Rao wrote that sexual assault victims were partly to blame for having been assaulted.  She ridiculed feminism and women's rights activists. She attacked groups that promoted multiculturalism and minority rights. She belittled those who fought for LGBTQ rights. She wrote that warnings about what we now identify as climate change are, in effect, fake news. And that's not all.  After these writings came to light, she stuck to the same script as the other Trump nominees have done who found themselves in the same position.  They say: It is all way in the past. I have grown up. I no longer hold those views.  Except in Ms. Rao's case, she cannot plausibly claim the views she put into writing back then would have no bearing on how she would decide cases as a judge today. That is because you can see those extreme views reflected in the work she is doing right now as the head of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs.  This is an office that doesn't get a lot of time in the spotlight, but the individual in charge of that office has more power to shape Federal rules than almost anyone outside the Oval Office.  During Ms. Rao's time as the head of this program, she has taken a buzz saw to protections for women's health, for sexual assault victims on college campuses, for LGBTQ Americans, and for Black and Latino Americans.  Under her watch, the Trump administration has allowed polluting corporations to poison Americans' air and water, propped up dirty powerplants that belch carbon into the skies, and added to the extreme dangers of climate change.  During her nomination hearing, she called--and this was her description--some of what she wrote ``cringeworthy.'' She wrote a letter to the Judiciary Committee saying she was sorry, and that's all well and good, but it doesn't change the fact that she has helped turn those same extreme views--those same extreme views--into Federal policy under President Trump.  To help spell this out, as they say on so many television shows: Go to the tape.  In the long essay titled ``The Feminist Dilemma'' published in the mid-1990s, Ms. Rao laid out her views on a range of issues dealing with women's rights and sexual violence. At the time, our country was waking up to the fact that most sexual assaults are not random acts of violence committed in dark alleyways; they are committed by someone the victim knows.  The term ``date rape'' was relatively new to a lot of people. In this essay she wrote: ``Although I am certainly not arguing that date rape victims ask for it,'' she did exactly that--several times. She put the burden on women to prevent their assaults.  She also described ``The dangerous feminist idealism which teaches women that they are equal.'' That is an exact quote--``dangerous idealism which teaches women that they are equal.''  She went on, ``Women believe falsely that they should be able to go anywhere with anyone.'' That is a quote. ``Women believe falsely that they should be able to go anywhere with anyone.''  Now, as I noted already, Ms. Rao has tried to separate herself during her nomination from those thoughts--what she wrote as a younger person--but she continues to double down on these views and their influence in her current position.  A few years ago, there was an effort to strengthen Federal rules to reduce sexual assaults on campus and compel schools to do a better job of protecting women. With Ms. Rao's help, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and Donald Trump are now rolling those protections back.  Ms. Rao has also taken steps to roll back rules designed to fight wage discrimination and sexual harassment against women in the workplace. She worked to make it harder for women to get no-cost contraception under the Affordable Care Act.  Now I am going to turn to her views on the rights of other groups. LGBTQ Americans, Black, and Latino Americans are just several examples.  Here she has attacked so-called multiculturalists, writing: ``Underneath their touchy-feely talk of tolerance, they seek to undermine American culture.'' When you read that sentence, it seems like she believed the American culture in need of protecting is actually one of intolerance.  Now, she protested that ``homosexuals want to redefine marriage and parenthood,'' to which I say: Anyone like Rao, who defines marriage and parenthood by limiting the definition of love, is just wrong and, frankly, un-American.  She even blasted African-American and Latino fraternities and sororities, arguing they were the ones who didn't understand the true meaning of Dr. King's ``I Have a Dream'' speech.  In a book review, she praised an author for writing:       Perhaps it is time to stop thinking of blacks--and having      them think of themselves--as a category. Let them rise or      fall as individuals.  A nominee for the Federal bench ought to be able to recognize that the design of racism has been to have society and governments at all levels in this country discriminate against African Americans as a category and to prevent individuals and their families from rising from this hardship.  Again, Ms. Rao can try and try and try some more to distance herself from these writings, but she cannot distance herself from the work she does right now in her current job.  Civil rights activists scored a major victory in a recent Supreme Court case, Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs v. The Inclusive Communities Project. The case dealt with what have come to be known as the ``disparate impact'' regulations. The Court held that housing policies that inadvertently discriminate against minorities violate the Fair Housing Act. That type of ``disparate impact'' regulation exists across Federal law. But right now, with Ms. Rao's help, Donald Trump is working to undo these protections. Here I quote from the Washington Post:       The Trump administration is considering a far-reaching      rollback of civil rights law that would dilute Federal rules      against discrimination in education, housing, and other      aspects of American life.  This article continues:       Past Republican administrations have done little to erode      the concept's application, partly out of concern that the      Supreme Court might disagree, or that such changes would be      unpopular and viewed as racist.  Apparently, that is not a big enough concern to stop Ms. Rao and the Trump administration.  Now, briefly, I would like to look at her writings on climate and environmental protection.  She mocked what she called the ``three major environmental bogeymen, the greenhouse effect, the depleting ozone layer, and the dangers of acid rain.''  In an extraordinary twist of logic, she suggested that people who warned about climate change were clinging to a ``dangerous orthodoxy''--her quote--``with no reference to the prevailing scientific doubts.''  Her work at the Trump administration shows no change in perspective.  Fuel economy standards that reduce carbon emissions and save drivers money at the pump have been axed by the Trump administration and Ms. Rao. The Clean Power Plan--gone under with the Trump administration and Neomi Rao. Rules cracking down on mercury pollution, which causes brain damage to kids, weakened by the Trump administration and Ms. Rao. Rules designed to protect workers from exposure to dangerous chemicals on the job--rolled back again by Ms. Rao and the Trump administration. The list can go on.  This nominee's record shows, in my view, that an apology is not enough--even a written one--because the shocking and offensive views she put into words in the past are reflected by her work in the present.  It is all right here in her CV as a Trump official. She is responsible for those policies that lead to more discrimination, that are taking rights and protections away from women, Black Americans, and Latino Americans.  She doesn't even have a long record of legal experience which she can fall back on and cite qualifications. Her qualifications seem to be her extreme views and membership in the far-right Federalist Society--a well-funded outside group that the Trump administration has empowered to fill the judiciary with extreme nominees from well outside the mainstream.  Actions Ms. Rao has been green-lighting have been challenged in court, and rulings against them have made clear that the Trump administration is willing to break the law to get their preferred ideological outcome.  For example, just last week, a Federal judge slammed Ms. Rao's actions to undo efforts to crack down on wage discrimination. The judge said Ms. Rao's decision was arbitrary, it was capricious, and unsupported by any analysis.  Perhaps that is why, during her nomination hearing, she refused to recuse herself from cases involving issues she worked on during the Trump administration.  So here is my bottom line. The Senate has seen this before--Trump nominees with extreme, offensive, and what are essentially incendiary writings from the past. In Ms. Rao's case, there are current examples of how she has not left those views in the past.  When it was Ryan Bounds nominated to the Ninth Circuit, this body--the U.S. Senate--stood up and said no. Mr. Bounds' views were extreme. More importantly, he knew it, and he hid them.  In my view, it is time to take a stand once more in the Senate, where Ms. Rao's views are on display for all to see. I am going to be a no on the nomination of Neomi Rao. I urge my colleagues to join me.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
