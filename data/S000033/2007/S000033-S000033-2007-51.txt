 President, the State of Vermont is proud that one of its residents, Dr. Jerold F. Lucey, recently received the Alfred I. duPont Award for Excellence in Children's Health Care. The award is offered each year to an individual in the health care profession who has made a major contribution to preventing childhood diseases.  Dr. Lucey helped pioneer phototherapy to prevent infant jaundice. He also played an essential role in bringing artificial surfactants from Japan to this country. The surfactants help premature newborns breathe, and since their introduction in the United States just over 15 years ago they have helped reduce infant mortality respiratory distress rate by 90 percent.  In addition, Dr. Lucey has developed the Vermont Oxford Network, which links 700 medical institutions in 25 nations to a network that tracks data on underweight-newborns, managing the data of more than 50,000 infants each year. This collaborative system has enabled advanced research, and the sharing of medical procedures that work, among pediatricians all over the globe.  Jerrold Lucey is Professor of Neonatology at the University of Vermont College of Medicine, where he has taught for more than 50 years. He also was the chief of Newborn Services at Fletcher Allen Health Care medical center in Burlington, VT, and in addition served as editor-in-chief of the journal Pediatrics for 35 years.  We in Vermont are very proud of the work Dr. Jerold F. Lucey has done, both with infants in our State, and for the health of children everywhere.                          ____________________
