 President, I rise to support passage of S.2073, legislation to authorize specific funding for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. I am pleased to join Senator Hatch and others in sponsoring this legislation.  I would also note that this legislation makes the same important change in law that I originally proposed as an amendment during the Judiciary Committee's mark-up of S. 10, legislation concerning juvenile justice issues. My amendment was accepted by Chairman Hatch and agreed to by all members of the Committee.  So, I am particularly happy that the full Senate is today passing this legislation in another form.  It is my hope that the House will also act to pass this bill.
