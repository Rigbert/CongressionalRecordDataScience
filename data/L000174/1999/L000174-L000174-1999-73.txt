President, the recent escape of convicted child murderer Kyle Bell from a private prison transport bus should serve as a wake-up call, to the Congress and to the country. Kyle Bell slipped off a TransCorp America bus on October 13, while the bus was stopped in New Mexico for gas. Apparently, he picked the locks on his handcuffs and leg irons, pushed his way out of a rooftop vent, hid out of sight of the guards who traveled with the bus, and then slipped to the ground as it pulled away. He was wearing his own street clothes and shoes. The TransCorp guards did not notice that Bell was missing until nine hours later, and then delayed in notifying New Mexico authorities. Bell is still at large.  Kyle Bell's escape is not an isolated case. In recent years, there have been several escapes by violent criminals when vans broke down or guards fell asleep on duty. There have also been an alarming number of traffic accidents in which prisoners were seriously injured or killed because drivers were tired, inattentive, or poorly trained.  Privatization of prisons and prisoner transportation services may be cost efficient, but public safety must come first. The Interstate Transportation of Dangerous Criminals Act requires the Attorney General to set minimum standards for private prison transport companies, including standards on employee training and restrictions on the number of hours that employees can be on duty during a given time period. A violation is punishable by a $10,000 fine, plus restitution for the cost of recapturing any violent prisoner who escapes as the result of such violation. This should create a healthy incentive for companies to abide by the regulations and operate responsibly.  I commend Senator Dorgan for his leadership on this legislation and urge its speedy passage.                          ____________________
