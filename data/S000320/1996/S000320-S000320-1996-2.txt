 President, we hope this will be the last day of the 104th Congress, and I would be remiss if I did not take this opportunity to remark about several of my colleagues--friends from both sides of the aisle--for whom today will be their last day as a member of this distinguished institution.  Let me first acknowledge my colleague from Alabama, Senator Howell Heflin. He came to the Senate the same year I came to the House of Representatives: 1979. He had a distinguished record as a lawyer and then as Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court. As Chief Justice, Senator Heflin led the modernization of the judicial system in Alabama.  Throughout his three terms as a member of the Senate, he has served with distinction and honor. His integrity and dedication made him an exemplary Chairman of the Ethics Committee. We also should not forget his service on both the Judiciary and Agricultural Committees. He was very active, as he has been throughout his career, on both of these committees, where he showed his concern for the welfare of the country. Senator Heflin's retirement is indeed a great loss to this body.  There are a number of other colleagues, in addition to Senator Heflin, whom we will miss.  Senator Simpson of Wyoming, who served this side of the aisle as our assistant minority leader, is a man of untold ability, wit and intelligence.  Senator Simon of Illinois is a man of unquestioned integrity.  Senator David Pryor of Arkansas, who was on the floor just a few moments ago, is ending his third term as a Member of the U.S. Senate where he, too, has distinguished himself. A former Congressman and Governor of Arkansas, he concludes a laudable political career.  One of our most senior Senators, Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island, the longtime chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, is recognized as a leader in the area of international relations. He also has made his mark in the field of education. All of us are familiar with the Pell grant and other programs that he has inspired.  We will certainly miss Senator Nunn who brought a very reasoned position to all issues relating to foreign relations and national security. This goes without saying, but I thought he was an outstanding chairman of the Armed Services Committee. I feel fortunate to have had the privilege to serve with him on that committee for 8 years.  Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum, a Republican from Kansas who currently chairs the Labor and Human Resources Committee, is a distinguished Senator in her own right. Just look at her recent leadership to bring about long overdue reforms in the field of health insurance.  Senator Bennett Johnston of Louisiana is the former chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. We are certainly going to miss him. He has had a distinguished career here during his 24 years in the U.S. Senate.  Senator Mark Hatfield of Oregon, the current chairman of the Appropriations Committee on which I now serve, has served with his characteristic civility and integrity. In recent days, he has worked through the night in the negotiations with the White House on the omnibus appropriations bill that we are getting ready to consider in a few hours.  Senator Jim Exon of Nebraska, a former Governor of Nebraska, is a three-term Senator from that state. I had the privilege of serving with him on the Armed Services Committee.  Senator William S. Cohen, a Republican from Maine, a former outstanding Member of the U.S. House of Representatives before he was elected to the Senate. We will miss not only his wit, his intelligence, and his thoughtfulness, but also his writing ability, which at one time or another helped us all.  It has been an honor to serve with Senator Hank Brown, a Republican from Colorado as it was to serve together in the U.S. House of Representatives. What has saddened me, and a number of my colleagues, is he will leave this body with such a bright and promising career after only 6 years.  Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey has served 18 years in the Senate. He has spent days and nights, weeks and months up here, and I think, not in vain, in dealing with a common sense income tax program for all Americans.  Mr. President, we will miss all these people because individually and collectively they have enriched this body. I wish them well in their future endeavors. I yield the floor.                          ____________________
