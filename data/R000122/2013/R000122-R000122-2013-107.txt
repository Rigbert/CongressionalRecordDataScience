President, today I introduce with my colleague, Senator Grassley, the Prescribe-a-Book Act. I thank Senators Stabenow, Cowan, and Blumenthal for joining us as original cosponsors of this bipartisan bill.  Literacy skills are the foundation for success in school and in life. Developing and building these skills begins at home, with parents as the first teachers.  Our legislation would create a federal pediatric early literacy grant initiative based on the long-standing, successful Reach Out and Read program. The program would award grants on a competitive basis to high-quality non-profit entities to train doctors and nurses to discuss with parents the importance of reading aloud to their children and to give books to children at pediatric check-ups from six months to five years of age, with a priority for children from low-income families. It builds on the relationship between parents and medical providers and helps families and communities encourage early literacy skills so children enter school prepared for success in reading.  The pediatric literacy model implemented by Reach Out and Read has consistently demonstrated effectiveness in increasing family engagement and boosting children's reading proficiency. Research published in peer-reviewed, scientific journals has found that parents who have participated in the program are significantly more likely to read to their children and include more children's books in their home, and that children served by the program show an increase of 4-8 points on vocabulary tests. I have seen up-close the positive impact of this program on children and their families when visiting a number of Rhode Island's Reach Out and Read sites.  The Prescribe a Book Act would leverage federal dollars to expand pediatric literacy initiatives so that more young children reap the developmental benefits of having books at home and being read to by their parents. Federal grant funding for Reach Out and Read through the Department of Education helped build a successful public-private partnership that has been matched by tens of millions of dollars from the private sector and state governments. The Prescribe a Book Act would establish a formal authorization for activities modeled on this type of successful partnership.  I urge our colleagues to join us in cosponsoring the Prescribe a Book Act, and to work to include its provisions in the upcoming reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.                                 ______                                       By
