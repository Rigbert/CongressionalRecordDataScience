  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I too rise on the issue of the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act. As my colleague from Oregon just stated, this is a crisis. This is an economic, social and public safety crisis if these funds are not reauthorized. They are now preparing layoff notices for teachers in rural school districts, for deputy sheriffs in search and rescue, for people who maintain our critical road and highway infrastructure in the western and other States across the country.  This Congress must act, and soon, to keep faith with the counties and the school districts where the Federal Government owns a preponderance of the land and has changed forest policies and has dropped their revenues dramatically.                          ____________________
