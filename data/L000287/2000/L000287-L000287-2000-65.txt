Mr. Speaker, I rise today to salute and pay tribute to a great American, Earl T. Shinhoster. A 35 year veteran leader of the NAACP, a devoted husband and father, Earl Shinhoster was my friend and my brother. He had a distinguished career of service to the public and to the community which I serve in particular. Indeed, it is as a result of his tireless work for voter education and to ensure voter participation that many of us are here today.  Earl cared. He really cared. He cared about voter education and voter participation. He cared about human rights and civil rights. He cared about Africa and Africans. He cared about being empowered and empowering others. He cared about equal access and equal opportunity.  He just wanted things to be fair. And, he was always looking for creative ways to break down the barriers that separate us, to make things fair.  Earl Shinhoster was Southeast Regional Director of the NAACP for 17 years and served as Acting Executive Director and CEO of the organization from 1995 to 1996.  Earl was so energetic, so engaging, so dedicated and so committed. His eyes were always on the prize. He will be sorely missed.                          ____________________
