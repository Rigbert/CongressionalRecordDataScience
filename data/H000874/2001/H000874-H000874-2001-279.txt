Speaker, On Monday, Americans throughout our great Nation will pause to honor those men and women who nobly sacrificed their lives to protect the safety and liberty of their fellow citizens.  Originally designated as ``Decoration Day'' to honor Veterans of the Civil War, and first observed on May 30, 1868, or modern Memorial Day now recognizes those one-million, three hundred and twelve-thousand, eight-hundred and ten heroes who died in defense of our Country in one or more of her conflicts: the American Revolution, the War of 1812, the Civil War, the Spanish American War, World War I, World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and the Persian Gulf War.  To the extent that we now enjoy the many rights inherent in a democracy, as well as those freedoms and benefits that we as a self-governing people bestow upon ourselves and our posterity, we owe great thanks to those defenders of democracy who died in war, so that we might live in peace.  We should also take time on this Memorial Day to honor all those Americans who have ever served in our Armed Forces, and to those great Americans who continue to volunteer to defend our Nation to this day. Without their continued commitment, courage and contributions, we would not enjoy the opportunity to be here, in this great land, reveling in the freedom that their noble deeds have allowed us to celebrate.  We should also take time today to reaffirm our commitment to our soldiers and our veterans: all men and women who voluntarily serve their Nation in the Armed Forces have earned the greatest respect, courtesy, and care that we can provide, and we as a Congress should never hesitate to deliver those benefits to our Veterans.  As we welcome this new Memorial Day in America, in peace and democracy, we solemnly acknowledge that the sacrifices of our Veterans have not been in vain, and will never be forgotten.                          ____________________
