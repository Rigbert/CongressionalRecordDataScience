He and I may disagree as to the fact that the Senate left it out. It was left out. We agree on that. The Senate, of course, had it in its bill. We did not.  Am I correct then that there are no plans next week to have on the floor of the House as far as you know a child tax credit bill?  Mr. DeLAY. I cannot say no plans. As the gentleman knows, in this business you never say never.  I am under the impression that the other body has some sort of package that they have put together. If they pass that package today or tomorrow, the Committee on Ways and Means can certainly take it under advisement and make recommendations to the leadership, and that may happen next week. I just cannot tell the gentleman.
