Speaker, I thank the gentleman for making that observation. He is absolutely right. And I want to make the public aware of the fact that we differ from time to time on partisan issues, but if the chairman of this committee, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Young), had not been such a tenacious supporter both of revising and reforming our election apparatus and then funding it, it would not be there.  I want to thank the chairman profusely, because I think he, as he knows, and I think the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hastert), our Speaker, has also been very responsible for this bipartisan accomplishment, and I thank the gentleman for his support. It is an important step. There are a lot of good things in this bill, and I would like to support it.
