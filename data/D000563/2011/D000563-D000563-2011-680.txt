President, there are many issues which come before the Senate, and some are simple and some are complex. The issue I am going to speak to today is one which you are personally aware of, Mr. President, as the Senator from West Virginia, and one that more and more Members are becoming aware of. It is the question of interchange fees or swipe fees.  For those who do not follow this closely, every time we use a credit card or a debit card in the United States of America, the retailer or merchant we do business with pays a fee to the bank that issues the card. The fee is established by the major credit card networks, Visa and MasterCard. They tell the banks how much they will receive each time a customer uses these cards.  What it comes down to is the fee that is being charged, the debit card fee, has become a subject of controversy. Let's go back in history a little bit. I can still remember when people used checks, and some still do but not as frequently. Now we use the plastic form of a checking account. Instead of writing out a check and pushing it through the banking system, and for a few cents watching it be processed, we use a debit card. A debit card draws money directly out of our checking accounts to the merchant we are doing business with.  So the debit card has, in fact, by a large measure, replaced checks--and in many instances replaced cash--as more and more people are using plastic for transactions. So I started hearing from merchants and retailers all around the United States about the fee that was being charged for debit card transactions.  Now, debit card transactions are different from credit card transactions in this respect. When I use my credit card, I am going to be billed each month for what I put on my credit card. There is a collection issue: Will Durbin actually make his monthly payment? Will he make it on time? Is he able to make the payment? And there is a question about whether this is going to be processed.  So there is, I guess, an uncertainty involved in credit card transactions and much less so when it comes to debit card transactions because that money is coming directly out of our checking accounts to the merchant. So in terms of risk, there is greater risk with a credit card than for a debit card. Nevertheless, over the years what we have seen is the swipe fee, or fee charged to a merchant for the use of a debit card, keeps going up, up, and up.  People would say: Well, why don't the merchants and retailers bargain with Visa, MasterCard, and the banks to make sure they do not have to pay an increasingly large fee every time a person uses a debit card?  The answer is they have no power to bargain at all. Not at all. So the retailer, the merchant, ends up accepting the debit card, swiping the debit card, paying for the transaction, and then paying a fee, to the point where one would ask: Well, how much of a fee is it?  The average debit card fee, found by the recent study of the Federal Reserve, is about 40 cents a transaction. Now, 40 cents may not sound like much if someone is buying a television--of course, though, it is going to be a percentage fee--but think about 40 cents if a person standing in front of you in line at the airport is buying a package of bubble gum. That 40 cents is all the profit that retailer could ever expect, and it is going right out the window. In fact, they are losing money on the transaction because of the debit card.  So for years retailers and merchants, restaurants, convenience stores, hotels, charities, universities, went to Visa and MasterCard and said: You cannot keep just raising this fee. It is not fair to us. You are not justifying it in terms of the costs of doing business, and we are paying more and more out of each transaction, even though the cost has not gone up.  Basically, Visa and MasterCard told them: Go take a hike. We are going to charge what we want to charge. Takeit or leave it, buddy. If you do not want to take plastic, that is your business. Try to do business without it. You cannot.  So retailers and merchants were on the losing end of this conversation. So they came to me and said: Is there a way to do a study on this issue and determine what is fair? So a few years ago I joined with Senator Bond of Missouri, and the two of us, on the credit card reform bill, asked for a public Fed study on fee and cost information. Well, it turned out the banking industry did not want any study at all. They killed our amendment for a Fed study and told people--all the people in the Senate, Democrats and Republicans--vote against even a study of the swipe fee, the debit card interchange fee.  So we ended up empty handed. The day came last year when we revisited the issue. This time I came to the floor with an amendment and said: Here is what I would like to do. I would like to give to the Federal Reserve the power to promulgate a rule which says the fee charged for the use of a debit card is going to be reasonable and proportional to the costs incurred by the bank in processing this transaction. We are going to put in a factor for fraud. If there is something they need to add to take care of fraud, add it in. We went a step further. We said this is not going to apply to every bank and credit union that issues a debit card. We are going to exempt the overwhelming majority of community banks and credit unions across America.  There are about 15,000 community banks and credit unions across the United States---15,000. So we said: If your bank or credit union has a valuation of less than $10 billion, you are not covered by this reasonable and proportional law. You are exempt. At the end of the day, it meant that about 100 banks across America were subject to this new law and three credit unions. All the rest are exempt.  So you say: Well, Durbin, if you exempted all of these banks and credit unions, almost 15,000 of them, and you only affected about 100 of them, how can this have any impact? Well, it turns out, of the largest banks in America, three of the big ones--that would be Chase, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America--really comprise nearly half of all the debit card transactions in the country. Some say even more, 60 percent or even more. So by just making this a law that applies to the largest banks, we are affecting the majority of debit card transactions, and we are establishing a reasonable and proportional fee for what the transaction is.  So the retailer and merchant, the person running the mom-and-pop store or the person running a big box store is going to get fair treatment in terms of how much is charged.  So you say to yourself: Well, how much are they charging now? The Federal Reserve estimates they are charging about 40 cents a transaction, and the actual cost to the bank and the credit card company is about 10 cents. They are charging four times as much as they should on each transaction.  How much money is it worth to the banks? The estimates range from $1.3 to $1.7 billion a month--a month. Now, these banks, the big banks that I am addressing with this law, they are not having little collections outside the bank to keep themselves in business. They are bringing in quite a bit of money. They are very profitable, and to say that they should have a reasonable charge for retailers and merchants across America, small businesses and large businesses alike, I do not think is unreasonable. Remember, we exempted the community banks. We exempted the credit unions. It is only the big ones that are going to be affected by this.  Well, one would think I had done the worst thing in the world to these banks and credit card companies. They have unleashed, with the greatest fury they can possibly put together on Wall Street, this attack against the Durbin amendment. They are sending out letters--Chase is--to all of the people who have debit card accounts and credit card accounts saying if this Durbin amendment goes through, we are going to charge extra fees here and extra fees there.  Well, at the end of the day, that is the threat that we always hear from them. The fact is, since they are virtual monopolies in their business, they are increasing their fee charges regularly. People across America know it. Every time we put in a reform, they race to raise their interest rates and race to raise their penalties. They give these ``free'' checking accounts loaded with penalties if you stumble and do not pay on the exact day or whatever it happens to be.  So it has become quite a battle. It is a battle between Visa, MasterCard, and the biggest banks in America versus the retailers and merchants of America. They are both engaged. Now, the retailers and merchants cannot hold a candle to the big banks and credit card companies when it comes to their investment in this fight. But they are trying valiantly, and we are organizing small businesses across the United States--in Illinois, West Virginia, all over the place--to step up and say: Come on. This is an important part of business.  Now, I ran into one of my colleagues on the Senate floor, and she said: What I am worried about is even if you reduce the fee charged to the retailer for using the debit card, how is that going to help the customer? How is that going to translate into anything more than profits for the business?  Well, Mr. President, in your family background, you have been involved in business. If you have a competitor across the street, whether it is a gas station, a drug store, a grocery store, a restaurant, you know your price competition is an important part of whether a person chooses your store over the other store. So when you give the owner of the store a break on the fee that is being charged by the credit card companies and banks, then you give them an opportunity to engage in more price competition.  But what about Walmart? This is the monster of retailers in terms of size, about 10 percent of all of the sales in America. I can tell you, even with Walmart, Target is looking over its shoulder. It is watching the prices of goods and deciding whether it can be competitive. So there is competition at this level.  If we give retailers a break when it comes to the amount they have to pay to the banks and credit card companies, I think it is going to end up in consumer benefits. The consumer organizations, the major ones in this town, support what I have done. They aren't supporting the position of the big banks and credit card companies.  One of the arguments that comes down is interesting. The lion's share of the argument against my amendment is not coming from the people directly affected by it. We are not hearing as much in Washington from those big banks on Wall Street or the credit card companies, and they are the ones most affected by it. Why? They don't have much credibility around here. These are the folks who came filing in for a bailout when they made some pretty bad decisions and got billions of dollars from the Federal Government to bail them out, and then, of course, they turned around and gave bonuses and all sorts of high-level compensation to their officers. So they are not the most popular crowd on Capitol Hill. So they have brought in surrogates to argue their position, and the surrogates, as my colleagues know, are the small banks and small credit unions saying the Durbin amendment is terrible.  The first thing we have to say to them is: You are exempt. You are not covered by the Durbin amendment. If you have $10 billion in assets or less, you are not covered. Still, they argue, at the end of the day, we think this might hurt us.  I have taken an extra step, beyond the law, to try to deal with some of their concerns because I value these community banks and credit unions. I worry they have now become part of the banking industry--in capital letters--instead of what they were traditionally: our neighborhood banks, our small town banks, our local credit unions. They have now become part of this big banking industry thing. I don't think it is healthy for them, and I don't think it is healthy for the economy or for consumers. So what I did was go to the merchants coalition on my side of this issue, the retailers, and ask them to put out a statement of policy when it comes to whether they are going to discriminate on the card that is presented.  Let me be more specific. If you are running a restaurant in Wheeling, WV,and somebody walks through the door and puts a debit card--these are all debit cards--puts a debit card down to pay for the meal, will your restaurant take a close look and say: Oh, that is a community bank with a higher interchange fee than it might be with a card from Chase Bank, for example? That is one of the concerns expressed by the community banks and credit unions. Even though you exempted us, all these retailers could discriminate against us because our swipe fee is higher than it might be coming out of Chase.  We ended up with a letter--an important letter--which I have shared with every one of my colleagues, and it is a letter from the Merchants Payment Coalition, which I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 Merchants Payments Coalition,                                      Washington, DC, May 2, 2011.     Hon. Dick Durbin,     Majority Whip, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Durbin: We understand that some in the      financial services industry are claiming that the Durbin      Amendment exemption from interchange ``swipe fee'' regulation      for financial institutions with assets under $10 billion will      not be effective in practice because merchants will      discriminate against debit cards with higher swipe fees. On      behalf of the undersigned trade associations, and the tens of      thousands of merchants and retail locations we represent, we      are writing to make clear that we have no contractual or      practical ability to treat debit cards issued by small      financial institutions or credit unions differently than      those issued by large institutions. Furthermore, our member      companies are committed to customer service and it is not in      their interest to discriminate against debit cards that so      many customers carry.       Currently, merchants are subject to Visa and MasterCard      network rules that require us to accept all Visa and/or      MasterCard debit, regardless of which bank or credit union      issues the card. This is called the Honor All Cards rule and      we risk the threat of $5,000 per day fines--or higher--if we      break this rule, so we assure you that merchants have no      intention of violating this term of brand acceptance. These      rules also prevent merchants from pricing goods differently      based upon the financial institution that issued the card.       Additionally, even if these rules were not in place,      merchants have no practical ability at the point-of-sale to      distinguish between big bank and small bank cards, nor the      swipe fee rates associated with those cards. Indeed, in many      if not most retail environments, employees never see the face      of the card the customer is using: the customers swipe their      cards themselves.       Lastly, even if merchants could differentiate between card      issuers, there are no market or economic incentives to      discriminate against mid-sized and smaller financial      institutions' cards. If a customer wants to pay with a card,      merchants will let them use that card because the retail      industry is fundamentally all about competing to deliver      value and customer service. If merchants didn't accept the      card, they would risk losing the sale and losing the      customer; a risk very few in the competitive retail industry      are willing to take. Additionally, most consumers only have      one debit card in their wallet. We would absolutely prefer      they pay with that debit card, rather than with a credit      card, because while debit card per transaction rates have      grown exponentially over the past several years, credit card      swipe fees are far higher and continue to be a significantly      more costly burden on businesses of all sizes.       We appreciate the opportunity to set the record straight      regarding the many misrepresentations being made about the      Durbin Amendment, and you have our commitment that the retail      community across the nation will do its part to help ensure      that the exemption of financial institutions with less than      $10 billion in assets from the swipe fee reforms on debit      cards will work in the marketplace.
