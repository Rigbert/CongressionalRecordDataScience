Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIRMAN (Mr. Putnam). All time for general debate has expired.  Pursuant to the rule, the committee amendment in the nature of a substitute printed in the bill shall be considered as an original bill for the purpose of amendment under the 5-minute rule, and shall be considered read.  The text of the committee amendment in the nature of a substitute is as follows:                                H.R. 554       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Personal Responsibility in      Food Consumption Act of 2005''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--       (1) the food and beverage industries are a significant part      of our national economy;       (2) the activities of manufacturers and sellers of foods      and beverages substantially affect interstate and foreign      commerce;       (3) a person's weight gain, obesity, or a health condition      associated with a person's weight gain or obesity is based on      a multitude of factors, including genetic factors and the      lifestyle and physical fitness decisions of individuals, such      that a person's weight gain, obesity, or a health condition      associated with a person's weight gain or obesity cannot be      attributed to the consumption of any specific food or      beverage; and       (4) because fostering a culture of acceptance of personal      responsibility is one of the most important ways to promote a      healthier society, lawsuits seeking to blame individual food      and beverage providers for a person's weight gain, obesity,      or a health condition associated with a person's weight gain      or obesity are not only legally frivolous and economically      damaging, but also harmful to a healthy America.       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to allow Congress      and regulatory agencies to determine appropriate laws, rules,      and regulations to address the problems of weight gain,      obesity, and health conditions associated with weight gain or      obesity.     SEC. 3. PRESERVATION OF SEPARATION OF POWERS.       (a) In General.--A qualified civil liability action may not      be brought in any Federal or State court.       (b) Dismissal of Pending Actions.--A qualified civil      liability action that is pending on the date of the enactment      of this Act shall be dismissed immediately by the court in      which the action was brought or is currently pending.       (c) Discovery.--       (1) Stay.--In any action that is allegedly of the type      described in section 4(5)(B) seeking to impose liability of      any kind based on accumulative acts of consumption of a      qualified product, the obligation of any party or non-party      to make disclosures of any kind under any applicable rule or      order, or to respond to discovery requests of any kind, as      well as all proceedings unrelated to a motion to dismiss,      shall be stayed prior to the time for filing a motion to      dismiss and during the pendency of any such motion, unless      the court finds upon motion of any party that a response to a      particularized discovery request is necessary to preserve      evidence or to prevent undue prejudice to that party.       (2) Responsibility of parties.--During the pendency of any      stay of discovery under paragraph (1), the responsibilities      of the parties with regard to the treatment of all documents,      data compilations (including electronically recorded or      stored data), and tangible objects shall be governed by      applicable Federal or State rules of civil procedure. A party      aggrieved by the failure of an opposing party to comply with      this paragraph shall have the applicable remedies made      available by such applicable rules, provided that no remedy      shall be afforded that conflicts with the terms of paragraph      (1).       (d) Pleadings.--In any action that is allegedly of the type      described in section 4(5)(B) seeking to impose liability of      any kind based on accumulative acts of consumption of a      qualified product, the complaint initiating such action shall      state with particularity--       (1) each element of the cause of action;       (2) the Federal and State statutes or other laws that were      allegedly violated;       (3) the specific facts alleged to constitute the claimed      violation of law; and       (4) the specific facts alleged to have caused the claimed      injury.       (e) Rule of Construction.--No provision of this Act shall      be construed to create a public or private cause of action or      remedy.     SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.
