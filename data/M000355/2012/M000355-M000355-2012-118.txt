 As a teacher and State representative, Dewayne served the people of the Commonwealth, especially those in Whitley and Laurel Counties, with distinction. He also proudly served our country in Iraq as a member of the Kentucky National Guard. Elaine and I send our condolences to his wife Regina, his family, his many friends, and all those at Whitley County High School who knew and loved him.  A Corbin resident, Representative Bunch died at age 50. He is survived by his wife Representative Regina Bunch, and he was the father of three daughters. Though his life was cut short, it was characterized by a dedication to serving others in his community, State, and country. RepresentativeBunch was a member of the Kentucky National Guard for 23 years, where he notably led the Mountain Warriors in Iraq as a first sergeant.  Although he valiantly represented his Nation and State abroad, Representative Bunch also did much of his work from within the community. He was a math and science teacher at Whitley County High School for 17 years, and in 2010, with the support of the citizens of the 82nd District, was elected State Representative. However, after an injury in 2011, Bunch resigned from his post to receive medical treatment. His wife Regina ran for the position and succeeded her husband as the 82nd District's representative.  The loss of Representative Bunch to the members of the Whitley County community is immeasurable, and Dewayne's death has saddened Kentuckians across the State. Members of the State House Republican Caucus said he was committed to serving the public and ran for elected office in order to more fully serve the people of the Corbin community. The Governor of the State of Kentucky, Steve Beshear, acknowledged the loss of Representative Bunch by ordering flags lowered to half-staff.  Hundreds of people came to pay their respects at Representative Bunch's funeral on July 15, held at Highland Park Cemetery in Williamsburg. Military graveside honors were conducted by the Kentucky National Guard. At the funeral, Representative Bunch was posthumously awarded the Kentucky Distinguished Service Medal to commemorate his work on behalf of his community and the State of Kentucky. I am privileged today to recognize Representative Bunch and his legacy of service to the Commonwealth.  Madam President, at this time I ask my colleagues in the U.S. Senate to join me in honoring the life of Representative Dewayne Bunch of Corbin, KY.
