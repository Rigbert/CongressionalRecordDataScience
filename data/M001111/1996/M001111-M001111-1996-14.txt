 Chairman, this bill provides many tools with which we, as a nation, can fight crime and drugs. I would like to highlight one area about which many law enforcement officials of my home State of Washington have expressed growing concern: methamphetamines. The Department of Justice, working with other agencies, has developed a comprehensive approach to battling the use and manufacture of methamphetamines entitled ``National Methamphetamine Strategy'', April 1996. Mr. Chairman, I would like to highlight the managers' support for interagency and Federal, State, and local law enforcement cooperation in combating this growing menace. It is particularly important to involve the Environmental Protection Agency and other appropriate agencies to provide technical and financial assistance to State and local law enforcement as they remove hazardous chemicals and waste developed in clandestine methamphetamine laboratories.
