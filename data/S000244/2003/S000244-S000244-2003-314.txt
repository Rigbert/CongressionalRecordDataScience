Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.  Mr. Speaker, there is a difference between the Court decisions on flag desecration and the Court decisions on burning crosses and painting swastikas on synagogues. On the one hand, the Court has said that flag desecration is protected by the first amendment as free speech or free political expression. The Supreme Court has never struck down an anticross-burning law or a hate crime law that makes it a crime to paint a swastika on a synagogue as political expression protected by the first amendment to the United States Constitution.  That is why we are here debating this constitutional amendment, because there are a lot of us that believe that the Supreme Court was wrong when they decided that desecrating the flag was political expression protected by the first amendment.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Cunningham).
