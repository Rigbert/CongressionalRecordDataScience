President, I rise today to pay tribute to an outstanding public servant in Rhode Island, Barbara F. Weaver, who is retiring from her position as Chief Information Officer for Rhode Island's Office of Library Services after a long and distinguished career.  With an impressive background in libraries and government, Barbara came to Rhode Island as the new Director of the Department of State Library Services in 1991. During her tenure she has made a significant contribution. She is credited with expanding the information role of the Department into the Office of Library and Information Services, and with the creation of that office, she has the distinction of becoming Rhode Island's first Chief Information Officer.  A leader in the library and information management worlds, Barbara has been responsible for coordinating the state's management information systems and coordinating library services to state government and to libraries throughout the state. She is credited with the creation of RI.gov, the state's World Wide web portal, and setting the stage for e-government in Rhode Island. She successfully brought Rhode Island through the y2k phenomenon without incident and has efficiently and effectively been in the forefront of new technologies.  Barbara has also been active nationally as evidenced through her work with organizations like the Chief Officers of State Library Agencies and the National Association of Chief Information Officers. Her vision, initiative and professionalism are indeed noteworthy, and I have been proud to work closely with this outstanding professional on legislative initiatives geared to enhancing literacy, technology and accessibility.  Rhode Islanders have been fortunate to have Barbara Weaver devote nearly a decade of service to our community. She has increased public and government awareness of the value of library services and leaves a lasting legacy of significant achievements which have brought library and information policy boldly into the new century.  I ask my colleagues to join me in commending Barbara Weaver for her professionalism, unwavering commitment, and inspired vision. I am honored to join others in my state in offering praise and admiration of a grateful community for all her great work. We wish her much fulfillment and continued success.                          ____________________
