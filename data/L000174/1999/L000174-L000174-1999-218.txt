President, there are one, two, three, four, five, six, seven judicial nominations on the calendar. I tell the distinguished leader that on this side of the aisle, at least, we are willing to agree to a time certain to vote on all of them--right now. We will be glad to enter into a time agreement to vote on each and every one of them. Obviously, our concern is that they all be considered and we suggest that they be in the order in which they appear on the calendar.
