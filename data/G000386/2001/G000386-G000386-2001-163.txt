 President, I rise today to introduce legislation to re-authorize the Drug Free Communities Act. I am pleased to be joined by my colleagues Senator Biden, Senator Smith, and Senator Daschle in introducing this legislation which will continue for another 5 years the successes that we have found with Drug Free Communities Program. In addition, it builds upon the successes that coalitions have had by encouraging them to establish a coalition mentoring program for nearby communities. Finally, this act will authorize funding for the National Anti-Drug Coalition Institute, which will provide education, training, and technical assistance to leaders of community coalitions.  Substance abuse remains a problem in communities across the country. Substance abuse is the cause of or associated with many of today's problems, but is a preventable behavior. Community anti-drug coalitions are implementing long-term strategies to address the problem of substance abuse in their communities. By bringing together a cross-section of the community to address a common problem, community coalitions are discovering and implementing unique community solutions to reduce and prevent the incidence of substance abuse in their communities. And that idea, that communities are best suited to address their own problems, is the underlying premise that has been proven with the success of the Drug Free Communities program.  There are three key features to the Drug Free Communities Act. First, communities must take the initiative. In order to receive support, a community coalition must demonstrate that there is a long-term commitment to address teen-drug use. It must have a sustainable coalition that includes the involvement of representatives from a wide variety of community activists.  In addition, every coalition must show that it can sustain itself. Community coalitions must be in existence for at least 6 months before applying. They are only eligible to receive support if they can match these donations dollar for dollar with non-Federal funding, up to $100,000 per coalition.  An Advisory Commission, consisting of local community leaders, and State and national experts in the field of substance abuse, has worked closely with the Office of National Drug Control Policy to oversee the successful management and growth of this grant program. Because of this partnership, grants have gone to communities and programs that can make a difference in the lives of our children.  Today, we have better evidence that coalitions are working, that they are making a difference. A recent study sponsored by the Annie E. Casey Foundation documented the difference thateight community coalitions, all of which have received funding through the Drug Free Communities program, from around the country have made in their communities.  In addition to continuing this successful program, this re-authorization legislation adds the possibility for a supplemental grant to the Drug-Free Communities Grant Program. The supplemental grant is available to any coalition that has been in existence for at least 5 years, achieved measurable results in youth substance abuse prevention and treatment, have staff or Coalition members willing to serve as mentors for persons interested in starting or expanding a Coalition in their community, identified demonstrable support from members of the identified community, and have created a detailed plan for mentoring either newly formed or developing Coalitions.  Coalitions receiving the supplemental grant must use these funds to support and encourage the development of new, self-supporting community coalitions focused on the prevention and treatment of substance abuse in the new coalition's community. This supplemental grant can be renewed provided the recipient coalition continues to meet the underlying criteria and has made progress in the development of new coalitions.  Starting a new anti-drug coalition is a difficult exercise, which makes the success of these coalitions I mentioned earlier all the more remarkable. But I also know this from personal experience. For the past 4 years, I have worked with leaders from across my State of Iowa to start and grow the Face It Together Coalition, a State-wide, anti-drug coalition designed to bring together people from all walks of life, business leaders, doctors and nurses, law enforcement, school professionals, members of the media, and so on, to work together toward a common goal: keeping kids drug free.  In working with FIT, it has become clear that by working together, everyone can accomplish more. This is a solid, grass-roots initiative that can work. But it hasn't been an easy process, and it will continue to require the dedication and commitment of all of our board members. One of the biggest challenges that we face has not been finding ideas of what to do, or even finding effective ongoing projects in the State, but identifying and securing funding to support the expansion of our activities. Much can and has been done by volunteers, and through the networking connections that the Board members are able to bring to the table.  In addition, this legislation will authorize $2 million in federal funding for two years for the National Community Anti-Drug Coalition Institute. Modeled after the success we have seen from the National Drug Court Institute, this national non-profit organization will represent, provide technical assistance and training, and have special expertise and broad, national-level experience in community anti-drug coalitions.  The funding for the Institute will be to 1. provide education, training, and technical assistance to key members of community anti-drug coalitions, 2. develop and disseminate evaluation tools, mechanisms, and measures to assess and document coalition performance, and 3. bridge the gap between research and practice by providing community coalitions with practical information based on the most current research on coalition-related issues. The Institute is expected to last for more than 2 years, and to pursue and obtain additional funding from sources other than the Federal Government.  In conclusion, I encourage all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation. It is supported by the Administration. It has the support of communities all across the Nation. The Drug Free Communities Program works. I look forward to working with my colleagues here and in the House to ensure quick passage.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1075       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. EXTENSION OF DRUG-FREE COMMUNITIES SUPPORT                    PROGRAM.       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:       (1) In the next 15 years, the youth population in the      United States will grow by 21 percent, adding 6,500,000 youth      to the population of the United States. Even if drug use      rates remain constant, there will be a huge surge in drug-     related problems, such as academic failure, drug-related      violence, and HIV incidence, simply due to this population      increase.       (2) According to the 1994-1996 National Household Survey,      60 percent of students age 12 to 17 who frequently cut      classes and who reported delinquent behavior in the past 6      months used marijuana 52 days or more in the previous year.       (3) The 2000 Washington Kids Count survey conducted by the      University of Washington reported that students whose peers      have little or no involvement with drinking and drugs have      higher math and reading scores than students whose peers had      low level drinking or drug use.       (4) Substance abuse prevention works. In 1999, only 10      percent of teens saw marijuana users as popular, compared to      17 percent in 1998 and 19 percent in 1997. The rate of past-     month use of any drug among 12 to 17 year olds declined 26      percent between 1997 and 1999. Marijuana use for sixth      through eighth graders is at the lowest point in 5 years, as      is use of cocaine, inhalants, and hallucinogens.       (5) Community Anti-Drug Coalitions throughout the United      States are successfully developing and implementing      comprehensive, long-term strategies to reduce substance abuse      among youth on a sustained basis. For example:       (A) The Boston Coalition brought college and university      presidents together to create the Cooperative Agreement on      Underage Drinking. This agreement represents the first      coordinated effort of Boston's many institutions of higher      education to address issues such as binge drinking, underage      drinking, and changing the norms surrounding alcohol abuse      that exist on college and university campuses.       (B) The Miami Coalition used a three-part strategy to      decrease the percentage of high school seniors who reported      using marijuana at least once during the most recent 30-day      period. The development of a media strategy, the creation of      a network of prevention agencies, and discussions with high      school students about the dangers of marijuana all      contributed to a decrease in the percentage of seniors who      reported using marijuana from more than 22 percent in 1995 to      9 percent in 1997. The Miami Coalition was able to achieve      these results while national rates of marijuana use were      increasing.       (C) The Nashville Prevention Partnership worked with      elementary and middle school children in an attempt to      influence them toward positive life goals and discourage them      from using substances. The Partnership targeted an area in      East Nashville and created after school programs, mentoring      opportunities, attendance initiatives, and safe passages to      and from school. Attendance and test scores increased as a      result of the program.       (D) At a youth-led town meeting sponsored by the Bering      Strait Community Partnership in Nome, Alaska, youth      identified a need for a safe, substance-free space. With help      from a variety of community partners, the Partnership staff      and youth members created the Java Hut, a substance-free      coffeehouse designed for youth. The Java Hut is helping to      change norms in the community by providing a fun, youth-     friendly atmosphere and activities that are not centered      around alcohol or marijuana.       (E) Portland's Regional Drug Initiative (RDI) has promoted      the establishment of drug-free workplaces among the city's      large and small employers. More than 3,000 employers have      attended an RDI training session, and of those, 92 percent      have instituted drug-free workplace policies. As a result,      there has been a 5.5 percent decrease in positive workplace      drug tests.       (F) San Antonio Fighting Back worked to increase the age at      which youth first used illegal substances. Research suggests      that the later the age of first use, the lower the risk that      a young person will become a regular substance abuser. As a      result, the age of first illegal drug use increased from 9.4      years in 1992 to 13.5 years in 1997.       (G) In 1990, multiple data sources confirmed a trend of      increased alcohol use by teenagers in the Troy community.      Using its ``multiple strategies over multiple sectors''      approach, the Troy Coalition worked with parents, physicians,      students, coaches, and others to address this problem from      several angles. As a result, the rate of twelfth grade      students who had consumed alcohol in the past month decreased      from 62.1 percent to 53.3 percent between 1991 and 1998, and      the rate of eighth grade students decreased from 26.3 percent      to 17.4 percent. The Troy Coalition believes that this      decline represents not only a change in behavior on the part      of students, but also a change in the norms of the community.       (H) In 2000, the Coalition for a Drug-Free Greater      Cincinnati surveyed more than 47,000 local seventh through      twelfth graders. The results provided evidence that the      Coalition's initiatives are working. For the first time in a      decade, teen drug use in Greater Cincinnati appears to be      leveling off. The data collected from the survey has served      as a tool to strengthen relationships between     schools and communities, as well as facilitate the growth of      anti-drug coalitions in communities where they had not      existed.       (6) Despite these successes, drug use continues to be a      serious problem facing communities across the United States.      For example:       (A) According to the Pulse Check: Trends in Drug Abuse Mid-     Year 2000 report--       (i) crack and powder cocaine remains the most serious drug      problem;       (ii) marijuana remains the most widely available illicit      drug, and its potency is on the rise;       (iii) treatment sources report an increase in admissions      with marijuana as the primary drug of abuse--and adolescents      outnumber other age groups entering treatment for marijuana;       (iv) 80 percent of Pulse Check sources reported increased      availability of club drugs, with ecstasy (MDMA) and ketamine      the most widely cited club drugs and seven sources reporting      that powder cocaine is being used as a club drug by young      adults;       (v) ecstasy abuse and trafficking is expanding, no longer      confined to the ``rave'' scene;       (vi) the sale and use of club drugs has grown from      nightclubs and raves to high schools, the streets,      neighborhoods, open venues, and younger ages;       (vii) ecstasy users often are unknowingly purchasing      adulterated tablets or some other substance sold as MDMA; and       (viii) along with reports of increased heroin snorting as a      route of administration for initiates, there is also an      increase in injecting initiates and the negative health      consequences associated with injection (for example,      increases in HIV/AIDS and Hepatitis C) suggesting that there      is a generational forgetting of the dangers of injection of      the drug.       (B) The 2000 Parent's Resource Institute for Drug Education      study reported that 23.6 percent of children in the sixth      through twelfth grades used illicit drugs in the past year.      The same study found that monthly usage among this group was      15.3 percent.       (C) According to the 2000 Monitoring the Future study, the      use of ecstasy among eighth graders increased from 1.7      percent in 1999 to 3.1 percent in 2000, among tenth graders      from 4.4 percent to 5.4 percent, and from 5.6 percent to 8.2      percent among twelfth graders.       (D) A 1999 Mellman Group study found that--       (i) 56 percent of the population in the United States      believed that drug use was increasing in 1999;       (ii) 92 percent of the population viewed illegal drug use      as a serious problem in the United States; and       (iii) 73 percent of the population viewed illegal drug use      as a serious problem in their communities.       (7) According to the 2001 report of the National Center on      Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University entitled      ``Shoveling Up: The Impact of Substance Abuse on State      Budgets'', using the most conservative assumption, in 1998      States spent $77,900,000,000 to shovel up the wreckage of      substance abuse, only $3,000,000,000 to prevent and treat the      problem and $433,000,000 for alcohol and tobacco regulation      and compliance. This $77,900,000,000 burden was distributed      as follows:       (A) $30,700,000,000 in the justice system (77 percent of      justice spending).       (B) $16,500,000,000 in education costs (10 percent of      education spending).       (C) $15,200,000,000 in health costs (25 percent of health      spending).       (D) $7,700,000,000 in child and family assistance (32      percent of child and family assistance spending).       (E) $5,900,000,000 in mental health and developmental      disabilities (31 percent of mental health spending).       (F) $1,500,000,000 in public safety (26 percent of public      safety spending) and $400,000,000 for the state workforce.       (8) Intergovernmental cooperation and coordination through      national, State, and local or tribal leadership and      partnerships are critical to facilitate the reduction of      substance abuse among youth in communities across the United      States.       (9) Substance abuse is perceived as a much greater problem      nationally than at the community level. According to a 2001      study sponsored by The Pew Charitable Trusts, between 1994      and 2000--       (A) there was a 43 percent increase in the percentage of      Americans who felt progress was being made in the war on      drugs at the community level;       (B) only 9 percent of Americans say drug abuse is a      ``crisis'' in their neighborhood, compared to 27 percent who      say this about the nation; and       (C) the percentage of those who felt we lost ground in the      war on drugs on a community level fell by more than a      quarter, from 51 percent in 1994 to 37 percent in 2000.       (b) Extension and Increase of Program.--Section 1024(a) of      the National Narcotics Leadership Act of 1988 (21 U.S.C.      1524(a)) is amended--       (1) by striking ``and'' at the end of paragraph (4); and       (2) by striking paragraph (5) and inserting the following      new paragraphs:       ``(5) $50,600,000 for fiscal year 2002;       ``(6) $60,000,000 for fiscal year 2003;       ``(7) $70,000,000 for fiscal year 2004;       ``(8) $70,000,000 for fiscal year 2005;       ``(9) $75,000,000 for fiscal year 2006; and       ``(10) $75,000,000 for fiscal year 2007.''.       (c) Extension of Limitation on Administrative Costs.--     Section 1024(b) of that Act (21 U.S.C. 1524(b)) is amended by      striking paragraph (5) and inserting the following new      paragraph (5):       ``(5) 8 percent for each of fiscal years 2002 through      2007.''.       (d) Additional Grants.--Section 1032(b) of that Act (21      U.S.C. 1533(b)) is amended by adding at the end the following      new paragraph (3):       ``(3) Additional grants.--       ``(A) In general.--Subject to subparagraph (F), the      Administrator may award an additional grant under this      paragraph to an eligible coalition awarded a grant under      paragraph (1) or (2) for any first fiscal year after the end      of the 4-year period following the period of the initial      grant under paragraph (1) or (2), as the case may be.       ``(B) Scope of grants.--A coalition awarded a grant under      paragraph (1) or (2), including a renewal grant under such      paragraph, may not be awarded another grant under such      paragraph, and is eligible for an additional grant under this      section only under this paragraph.       ``(C) No priority for applications.--The Administrator may      not afford a higher priority in the award of an additional      grant under this paragraph than the Administrator would      afford the applicant for the grant if the applicant were      submitting an application for an initial grant under      paragraph (1) or (2) rather than an application for a grant      under this paragraph.       ``(D) Renewal grants.--Subject to subparagraph (F), the      Administrator may award a renewal grant to a grant recipient      under this paragraph for each of the fiscal years of the 4-     fiscal year period following the fiscal year for which the      initial additional grant under subparagraph (A) is awarded in      an amount not to exceed amounts as follows:       ``(i) For the first and second fiscal years of that 4-     fiscal year period, the amount equal to 80 percent of the      non-Federal funds, including in-kind contributions, raised by      the coalition for the applicable fiscal year.       ``(ii) For the second, third, and fourth fiscal years of      that 4-fiscal year period, the amount equal to 67 percent of      the non-Federal funds, including in-kind contributions,      raised by the coalition for the applicable fiscal year.       ``(E) Suspension.--If a grant recipient under this      paragraph fails to continue to meet the criteria specified in      subsection (a), the Administrator may suspend the grant,      after providing written notice to the grant recipient and an      opportunity to appeal.       ``(F) Limitation.--The amount of a grant award under this      paragraph may not exceed $100,000 for a fiscal year.''.
