 Not that they know your name, Dave, but they do know your face.  I wished to join my good friend, the majority leader, in thanking you for your 31 years of service. We deeply appreciate your fine work, and we wish you well in your retirement. Thank you so much.  (Applause.)                        Dodd Amendment No. 5685
