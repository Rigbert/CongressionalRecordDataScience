 There was too much business left unfinished. So I made the decision to keep the Senate in session this month to continue working on behalf of the American people. I am proud to report that is just what we have done.  The Senate has now passed regular appropriations measures that account for 87 percent of next fiscal year's discretionary spending, we finalized our work on the National Defense Authorization Act named for Senator McCain, and in August alone, we have confirmed eight more of the President's well-qualified nominees for the Federal courts. But, as I have stated, the continuing, historic obstruction from Democrats on the President's nominees continues to make our progress on that front insufficient, so we will stay at it.  Currently before us are nominees to be Assistant Secretary to the Department of Health and Human Services, a Vice Chairman for the Federal Reserve, important posts at the Departments of Justice and Treasury, and a slate of impressive nominees for the Federal judiciary. I hope we can continue to make progress. It remains my intention to confirm all 17 of the nominees currently before us before the Senate concludes our business this week.                            ____________________
