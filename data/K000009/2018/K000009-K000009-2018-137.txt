 So I urge my colleagues to oppose this bad bill.  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the strong opposition to it from the United Steelworkers of America and from the Communications Workers of America. As a proud daughter of labor, I am proud to stand here today in opposition to this bill.                                          United Steelworkers,                                  Pittsburgh, PA, January 9, 2018.     Re United Steelworkers oppose inclusion of anti-worker H.R.          986, Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act of 2017 in S. 140.     House of Representatives,     Washington, DC.       Dear Representative: On behalf of the 850,000 members of      the United Steelworkers (USW), we strongly urge you to oppose      S. 140 on the House floor this week. Rather than     being identical to the Senate bill, this version includes the      anti-worker and undemocratic Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act of      2017 (H.R. 986).       H.R. 986 would exempt all employees of federally recognized      Native American-owned commercial enterprises operated on      Indian lands from the protections of the National Labor      Relations Act (NLRA) and would authorize over 567 distinct      and separate labor law jurisdictions in the United States.       To be absolutely clear, this legislation strips workers--     both Native American and non-Native American--of their NLRA      protections. While some organizations have falsely attempted      to paint tribal governments as similar entities to states      (which are exempt from the NLRA), tribal governments are      substantially different than states in one key democratic      principal: state governments allow workers an ability to vote      for their legislators no matter their ancestry, while most      tribal governments require blood quantum or lineal descent to      determine who is eligible for membership or citizenship.       Simply put, if H.R. 986 becomes law by inclusion in S. 140,      U.S. citizens working in the United States for tribal      commercial enterprises would not be able to vote for the      elected representatives who set their labor laws. These      workers will lose the ability to petition the government that      oversees their working conditions.       The gaming industry, which is an employer for approximately      246 of the 567 federally recognized American Indian tribes;      has over 600,000 casino workers on tribal lands, the      overwhelming majority of whom are not Native Americans. In      2011 before the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, the National      Indian Gaming Commission testified that the vast majority of      employees (up to 75 percent) were non-tribal members.       Our union understands the importance of the principle of      tribal sovereignty; however the fundamental human rights of      employees are not the exclusive concern of tribal enterprises      or tribal governments. As the International Labor      Organization highlighted in a letter on a previous version of      this bill, ``it is critical that the State (the national      authority) takes ultimate responsibility for ensuring respect      for freedom of association and collective bargaining rights      throughout its territory''. That is why we believe the      current test set by the NLRB is the best course of action      until labor laws are strengthened in the United States.       In 2004, the NLRB under the Bush Administration ruled for      the first time that Tribal casino workers should have the      benefit of NLRA protections, San Manuel, 341 NLRB No. 138      (2204). Yet, since the San Manuel ruling, the NLRB has      asserted jurisdiction on a case-by-case basis. In 2015, the      NLRB declined jurisdiction citing the 1830 Treaty of Dancing      Rabbit Creek and 1866 Treaty of Washington stating:       ``We have no doubt that asserting jurisdiction over the      Casino and the Nation would effectuate the policies of the      Act. However, because we find that asserting jurisdiction      would abrogate treaty rights specific to the Nation.''      Chickasaw Nation Windstar World Casino, 362 NLRB 109 92015).       Similarly the NLRB declined jurisdiction:       ``. . . when an Indian tribe is fulfilling a traditionally      tribal or governmental function that is unique to its status,      fulfilling just such a unique governmental function      [providing free health care services solely to tribal      members],'' Yukon Kuskokwim Health Corporation, 341 NLRB 139      (2004).       The NLRB has developed a reasonable and responsible test to      determine jurisdiction. H.R. 986 creates significant      confusion and jurisdictional issues over labor law      enforcement and grossly undermines worker's rights. Our union      urges you to oppose S. 140, with the inclusion of H.R. 986,      and asks you to instead work to expand worker's rights not      restrict them further.           Sincerely,                                                    Leo W. Gerard,     International President.                                  ____                                                  January 9, 2018.       Dear Representative: On behalf of the members and officers      of the Communications Workers of America (CWA), I am writing      to express our strong opposition to S. 140. CWA has no      objections whatsoever to Sections 1 and 2 of the bill as      amended. Unfortunately, these non-controversial, sensible      bills have been hijacked to also pass H.R. 986, a bill that      would strip hundreds of thousands of workers at tribal-owned      and -operated enterprises of their protections for the right      to bargain collectively.       H.R. 986 seeks to overturn a National Labor Relations Board      (NLRB) decision in San Manuel Indian Bingo and Casino, which      applied the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) to a tribal      casino enterprise. The NLRB's finding in San Manuel adopted a      test to determine whether the NLRA is applicable to      businesses operating on tribal lands--if it would ``touch      exclusive rights of self-governance in purely intramural      matters'' or ``abrogate Indian treaty rights,'' the NLRA      would not apply, but otherwise the decision will be based on      a series of factors including whether an entity is a purely      commercial enterprise or employs or caters to individuals who      are not tribal members.       The San Manuel test balances two crucial issues--tribal      sovereignty and the right of workers to bargain collectively.      The test ensures that truly internal matters of self-     governance will continue to be handled by sovereign tribes,      while also ensuring that the fundamental rights of workers to      organize and advocate for their own interests are properly      respected. H.R. 986 would overturn this balance by exempting      any enterprise or institution owned and operated by an Indian      tribe and located on its land from the requirements of the      NLRA--or any other guarantee of workers' fundamental right to      organize and collectively bargain.       The practical impact of H.R. 986 would be to exempt a broad      swath of businesses from the NLRA, even though, in many      cases, they are purely commercial enterprises. For many of      these companies--particularly casinos--the majority of their      workforces are not members of the tribe employing them and      therefore do not have full access to internal, tribal      mechanisms for grieving issues or petitioning for change in      tribal policies. This is why the International Labour      Organization stated in 2015 that ``it would appear likely      that an exclusion of certain workers from the NLRA and its      mechanisms would give rise to a failure to ensure these      workers their fundamental freedom of association rights.''       I urge you to oppose S. 140 as amended and instead work to      advance an agenda that protects both workers' fundamental      human right to organize and tribal sovereignty. CWA will      consider including votes on this bill in our Congressional      Scorecard Thank you in advance for your consideration.           Sincerely,                                                 Shane Larson,                                             Legislative Director,                          Communications Workers of America (CWA).
