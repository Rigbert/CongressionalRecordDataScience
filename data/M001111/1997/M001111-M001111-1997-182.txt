 President, I rise today to introduce a bill that, in one act, will do more to protect and restore the threatened salmon runs on the Columbia River than anything else this Government has tried. This bill will designate the last free-flowing stretch of the Columbia River, the Hanford Reach, as a recreational river under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act.  The bill I introduce today, with Senator Ron Wyden, is identical to S. 1489, my bill from the 104th Congress. That bill was developed with a broad spectrum of local interests who worked for months to create a bill with widespread support. While the 104th Congress did not take action on this bill, I feel confident that my colleagues of the 105th Congress will see the tremendous economic and environmental benefits of designating the reach a wild and scenic river and will help me pass this important legislation.  Much has happened in the year since I introduced S. 1489. Most important, the scientific community has verified what many locals already knew: The Hanford Reach will make an enormous contribution to salmon recovery on this embattled river. The Independent Scientific Group [ISG], an expert panel of fisheries scientists, reviewed the full range of salmon recovery programs now in place on the Columbia River. The ISG concluded that the Hanford Reach will be critical to our efforts to recover salmon throughout the Columbia Basin. It suggested that chinook salmon from the reach may serve as a core population from which adults could stray to upstream and downstream tributaries and, given good conditions, may reestablish lost or declining runs.  In this last year, we have fostered a growing consensus that the reach is too precious to risk harming. The Governors of the three States of Washington, Oregon, and Alaska recommended protection for the reach, citing it as critical to maintaining healthy stocks of salmon vital to sustaining the region's fishing economy. The Northwest Power Planning Council has endorsed designation of the reach as a wild and scenic river. Likewise, a number of tribal governments have supported continuing Federal protection of the Reach. Many other wildlife and conservation groups, including Trout Unlimited, the Nature Conservancy, American Rivers, and the Audubon Society have recognized the importance of this stretch of the Columbia and have joined the effort to save it. Finally, newspapers in Seattle, Portland, Yakima, and elsewhere have endorsed wild and scenic designation.  Let me remind my colleagues of the splendors of this 50-mile section of the river. While most of the Columbia River Basin was being developed for agriculture, hydroelectricity, and other economic activities, the Hanford Reach and other buffer lands within the Hanford Nuclear Reservation were kept pristine. Ironically, it was the veil of secrecy and security surrounding the Manhattan project that simultaneously protected the now scarce shrub-steppe ecosystem and created tremendous nuclear and chemical contamination. Fortunately, the arid land, the river's tremendous volume, and new cleanup and restoration technology has minimized the harm done to this vital river.  And vital it is. Its free-flowing nature provides superb habitat that produces 80 percent of the Columbia Basin's fall chinook salmon, as well as thriving runs of steelhead trout and sturgeon. It is the only truly healthy segment of the mainstem of the Columbia River. As the Pacific Northwest is struggling to restore declining salmon runs--and spending hundreds of millions of dollars annually to do so--protecting the Hanford Reach is the most cost-effective step we can take since it is already federally owned.  The reach is also rich in other natural and cultural resources. Bald eagles, wintering and migrating waterfowl, deer, elk, and a diversity of other wildlife depend on the reach. It contains dozens of rare, threatened, and endangered plants and animals. Biologists have identified several new plant species that they believe are unique and found only on lands near the reach.  This part of the Columbia Basin is also of great importance to native Americans, who have lived along the shores and islands of the reach for millennia. There are over 150 archaeological sites along the Hanford Reach, some dating back more than 10,000 years. The reach's naturally spawning salmon remain a vital part of the modern culture and religion of native Americans in the area.  Another area of importance within the reach is the White Bluffs. These fragile cliffs offer dramatic scenery, unique habitat, and fascinating geologic history. Unfortunately, a downstream section of the bluffs has been impacted by irrigation water flowing through the unstable Ringold formation sediments causing it to slide into the river, smothering spawning beds, reducing water quality, and deflecting the course of the river. Should these slumps continue or migrate upstream, some scientists fear the river could become contaminated when it is pushed onto the nuclear reactors lining its south shore. Wild and scenic river designation might help prevent such catastrophes.  The reach also provides an abundance of recreational opportunities. It is very close to the tri-cities of Kennewick, Pasco, and Richland, WA, and several hours drive from the major urban centers of Seattle and Portland. It affords residents and visitors opportunities to hunt, boat, fish, hike, kayak, water ski, bird watch, or simply relax and enjoy the solitude. The reach adds tremendously to the quality of life--and economy--of the area.  It is because of the reach's importance to the local residents and economy that I convened a diverse group of area citizens in 1995 to develop this bill that I reintroduce today. This Hanford Reach Advisory Panel had a wide array of interests and concerns that we addressed in this bill. For example, there was a concern about the potential impact a wild and scenic river designation could have on the traditional uses of the water and nearby lands. So, the panel incorporated specific language to protect current economic activities, such as agriculture, power generation and transmission, and water withdrawals. This bill excludes the 3 percent of private property recommended in the National Park Service's Record of Decision in order to honor the request of those private land owners. The legislation also guarantees that local government and interests have a formal role in the management of the river corridor, which will come under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.  In addition, this bill includes the advisory panel's recommendation that the Secretary of the Interior and relevant Federal agencies work with local and State sponsors to develop a program of education and interpretation related to the Hanford Reach. The city of Richland and area tribes, among others, have been working with the Department of Energy on a museum and regional visitor center proposal and are eager to make the natural and human history of the reach part of the project.  This legislation includes provisions urged by the advisory panel to improve the habitat value, access, and appearance of the Columbia River shoreline in the tri-cities' area. Much of the rivershore is now lined with high, steep levees that were put in place before the network of dams controlled the flow of the river and reduced the need for such flood control structures. This bill directs the Army Corps of Engineers, which built, owns, and maintains the levees, to coordinate with local sponsors on demonstration projects to restore the rivershore. The bill directs the corps to undertake some small levee modification projects in partnership with Kennewick, Pasco, and the Port of Kennewick in the short-term. For the longer term, the corps is directed to undertake a comprehensive study of the levees and determine if rivershore restoration is feasible and should become a Federal priority.  Mr. President, let me conclude by again thanking my Hanford Reach Advisory Panel and reiterating to my colleagues the importance of protection of the Hanford Reach. The reach is the last free-flowing section of the mighty Columbia and as such produces outstanding salmon habitat, superb recreational opportunities, and vital economic benefits. I urge my colleagues to take speedy action, pass this important bill and permanently protect the Hanford Reach as a wild and scenic river.                                 ______                                       By
