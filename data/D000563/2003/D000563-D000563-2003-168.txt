 We know this is the greatest moral challenge of our time. This is our chance to keep our promise to the world to make certain that America's compassionate leadership is meaningful to people around the world.  I ask my colleagues, please, look beyond the Budget Act. Look to the fact that we have a challenge here that is worthy of our vote at this time. I hope you will support this amendment.  I reserve the remainder of my time.  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield the remaining time to the Senator from Pennsylvania.
