 James Comey, Jr., should be confirmed to be our next Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. I feel it should be done without delay. Director Mueller has served very well, but his term expires early September. It is imperative the Senate work quickly to confirm his successor.  I worked with Ranking Member Grassley to schedule James Comey's confirmation hearing as soon as we returned from the Fourth of July recess. Earlier this month, with Senator Grassley's cooperation, we in the Judiciary Committee unanimously reported the nomination of James Comey to the floor. However, in contrast with the treatment of previous FBI Director nominees--the FBI Director nominees of all preceding Presidents--who were all confirmed by the full Senate within a day or two of being reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee, James Comey is the first FBI Director nominee to be filibustered in Senate history by either Republicans or Democrats.  In this case, of course, it is the Republicans who are filibustering a law enforcement position such as this, somebody who was voted out of the committee by every single Republican and Democratic Senator--and then to be filibustered by Republicans on his nomination?  We should be voting to confirm James Comey tonight. It has already taken twice as long to bring up this nomination for a vote in the full Senate as for any previous FBI Director. President Obama officially nominated James Comey on June 21, 38 days ago. No other FBI Director has waited longer than 20 days from nomination to confirmation. The FBI Director plays a very vital role in our national security, and the Senate must put an end to these routine delays.  Nearly 12 years ago, when the Senate considered President Bush's nomination of Robert Mueller to be Director ofthe FBI on the same day he had been reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee, I spoke about how the rights of all Americans were at stake in the selection of a new FBI Director and how the FBI has extraordinary power to affect the lives of ordinary Americans.  Contrast that with President Bush, Democrats were in the majority, and we Democrats worked to get President Bush's nominee confirmed the same day he came out of committee.  We Democrats made sure politics were not in play in the confirmation of the FBI Director. Republicans shouldn't allow politics to play in the confirmation of an FBI Director. I said at the time, with Robert Mueller, I noted the FBI's sweeping investigatory powers, when used properly, can protect all of us by combating crime, espionage, and terrorism. But I also warned that unchecked, these same powers could undermine our civil liberties and our right to privacy.  When I spoke those words, I didn't know that just 40 days later the world--and the FBI -would change dramatically in the wake of the terrorist attacks on September 11. It shook this area, including even the Senate because of the anthrax attack, which killed a number of individuals. One of the anthrax letters was addressed to me. As the full Senate considers the President's nomination of James Comey to be the seventh Director of the FBI, what I said in 2001 holds true today. With the increased counterterrorism role of the FBI and the expansion of the FBI's surveillance activities, it is even more imperative that the next FBI Director possesses an unflagging commitment to the Constitution and the rule of law.  James Comey is the right man to lead the FBI. He has had a long and outstanding career in law enforcement. He worked for years as a front-line prosecutor on a range of cases fighting violent crime, terrorism, and white-collar fraud, all of which are at the core of the FBI's mission. He also served as the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. He served as the Deputy Attorney General under President George W. Bush.  In fact, Madam President, many of us remember, when he was Deputy Attorney General, the dramatic hospital bedside confrontation James Comey had with senior White House officials who tried to prod an ailing John Ashcroft to reauthorize an NSA surveillance program--a program that the Justice Department had concluded was illegal. Yet White House staff was over there trying, at his hospital bed, to get the Attorney General to agree to it. But the Deputy Attorney General stepped in, in his role as Acting Attorney General, and stood firm against this attempt to circumvent the rule of law, and I believe he will continue to show the same strength of character and principled leadership if confirmed as Director.  During his confirmation hearing before the Judiciary Committee, James Comey proved that his reputation for unwavering integrity and professionalism is well-deserved. One area of great concern for me was his approval of a 2005 legal memo to authorize the use of various methods of torture, including waterboarding. I wanted to make sure that as FBI Director, James Comey would never condone or resort to waterboarding a prisoner--something for which we have prosecuted people in other countries. He answered my questions and stated directly, unequivocally, that waterboarding is not only personally abhorrent but that it is torture and illegal. He also testified that if confirmed he would continue the FBI's policy of not permitting the use of abusive interrogation techniques against prisoners, including sleep deprivation and cramped confinement.  Mr. Comey and I do not agree on all matters. I do not agree with him that the Authorization for the Use of Military Force permits the government to detain indefinitely an American citizen captured on American soil in military custody without charge or trial, and I will continue to oppose efforts to codify such an interpretation of the law. I was glad James Comey committed to adhering to the current administration policy of not indefinitely detaining Americans in such circumstances.  When he testified before us, I saw a man of integrity and honesty, competent in background, and so once he is confirmed--and I trust he will be confirmed once this filibuster has ended--I will continue to press him on the scope and legality of surveillance conducted by the government pursuant to the PATRIOT Act and other authorities under the Foreign Surveillance Intelligence Act. As I noted during his confirmation hearing, just because the FBI has the ability to collect huge amounts of data does not mean it should be collecting huge amounts of data. As the head of our premier law enforcement agency, the FBI Director bears a special responsibility to ensure that domestic government surveillance does not unduly infringe upon our freedoms. I have long said that protecting our national security and protecting Americans' fundamental rights are not mutually exclusive. We can and must do both. I fully expect that James Comey will work to achieve both goals.  After Director Mueller's distinguished tenure at the Bureau, James Comey has big shoes to fill. The next Director must face the growing challenge of how to sustain the FBI's increased focus on counterterrorism while at the same time upholding the FBI's commitment to its historic law enforcement functions. It is going to be particularly difficult to protect this country and protect our law enforcement functions because of sequestration and other fiscal constraints, but I think the FBI has to continue to play a key role in combating the crimes that affect everyday Americans--from violent crimes, to bank robberies, to fraud and corruption cases.  If we learned nothing else since the September 11 attacks, we learned that it matters who leads our Nation at all levels of government. We need strong, principled, ethical leaders who steadfastly adhere to the law. I am confident that James Comey is such a leader. I am urging Senators on both sides of the aisle to join me in voting to overcome this filibuster in a vote to confirm him to be the next Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  As I said before--and I will put into the Record how long it has taken from nomination to confirmation--twice as long as President Bush's FBI nomination, more than twice as long as President Reagan's FBI nomination, and twice as long as President Nixon's FBI nomination. In every one of those cases, no Democrat filibustered President Bush, President Reagan, and President Nixon. We all worked to get the FBI Director in there. This filibuster by my friends on the other side of the aisle is unprecedented. I wish they would treat President Obama the same way we treated President Bush, President Reagan, and President Nixon and not make President Obama seem to be somehow different and interfere with law enforcement the way they have.  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a chart showing how long it took previous Presidents.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:------------------------------------------------------------------------                                            Total # days from nomination           FBI Director Nominee                    to confirmation------------------------------------------------------------------------JAMES B.
