Mr. Chairman, I rise to make a point of order. I make a point of order against the amendment. This amendment is not germane, and as such is a violation of rule XVI, clause 7.  This rule states that: ``No motion or proposition on a subject different from that under consideration shall be admitted under color of amendment.''  This amendment deals with a proposition different from that being amended; and, therefore, is a violation of rule XVI, clause 7, and I insist on my point of order.
