 President, I am concerned about the impact the Medicare conference report will have on low-income Medicare beneficiaries who are living with HIV/AIDS. I have heard a lot of opposition to this bill from the HIV/AIDS community. My concern is with their access to drug treatment therapy under the Medicare prescription drug benefit. Is it your understanding that the Medicare conference report will not prevent low-income Medicare beneficiaries who are living with HIV/AIDS from getting all the drugs they need through Medicare Part D?
