  Mr. President, maybe the Senator can help me out. It says, ``Prior to the deposit of the instruments of ratification, the Administration shall certify to the Senate that with regard to [the following],'' and it lists the following nonstrategic nuclear weapons, that ``it is the policy of the United States . . . that discussions toward these ends have been initiated with the Russian Federation.''  All the Russian Federation can say is, ``I'm not going to discuss this with you,'' done, period, over; they have vetoed it. Look, if I am sitting in the Russian Duma, I am going to--and we are all worried about these reactionary nationalists who are the browns and the reds undercutting Yeltsin--I have got a real easy one. I go to Yeltsin and say, I tell you what, you've indicated to us you don't want to expand NATO but there is nothing you can do to stop it. I've got the way to stop it right now. When the President picks up the phone and calls you and says, ``By the way, I want to initiate discussions relative to tactical nuclear weapons,'' tell him, ``No. No.''  Guess what? By definition, no expansion of NATO, because the President cannot deposit these instruments until--until--he can certify to the U.S. Senate that discussions with the Russian Federation have been initiated.  Now, call me paranoid, if you would like, but I know what I would do. I am a pretty good politician. The Senator from North Dakota is even a better politician. We are all politicians in here. They are not any different in the Duma. They are no different in the Russian Federation. So I have a real easy one. And by the way, if they had not figured it out, I just told them.
