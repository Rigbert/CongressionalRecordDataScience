Speaker, of both Houses that the conference committee dissolved after the conference report was filed and the House acted in a bipartisan manner to approve it. I believe it is healthy to continue to debate the merits of the PATRIOT Act and to continue vigorous congressional oversight of its authorities. But it is also imperative that we not play political games with the vital tools our law enforcement and intelligence communities need to keep us safe from additional attacks on American soil.  We must not rebuild the wall of separation between the FBI and CIA and return to the pre-9/11 mindset that madeAmerica vulnerable to a terrorist attack. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this extension of the PATRIOT Act so as to give the other body the time to expeditiously pass the conference report on H.R. 3199. As recent events have highlighted, the threat of terrorism has not receded, nor has the urgency of continued vigilance.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
