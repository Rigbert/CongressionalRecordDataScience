Speaker, I will leave it to others to ask why. Today I rise with my colleagues with firm resolve to send a message to our enemies that engage in terrorism that we are at war. America and her people will stand together today, as we have in the past, and defeat our enemies.  Here in the great hall of democracy, in the well of the House of Representatives, I personally call for a declaration of war so that we may unleash the full might of our country's resources upon our enemies.  We must give our institutions, the FBI, the CIA, the armed services, the full legal authority to act and protect the life and property of the United States of America. We must authorize reprisals against our enemies and those who harbor them.  In closing, I say God bless America and God bless our President during these times.
