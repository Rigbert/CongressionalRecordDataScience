 President, I submit a resolution that passed the Senate last year unanimously. My resolution, which I am introducing today with Senator Kempthorne and more than 50 original cosponsors, establishes October 8 as the Day of Concern about Young People and Gun Violence.  Tragically, this resolution has special meaning for all of us after the events of last Friday. While, thankfully, no children were directly involved in the slayings of Officer Jacob Chestnut and Special Agent John Gibson, certainly the officers' children and young people across the nation were hurt and horrified by the violence that occurred in our nation's Capitol.  I am once again submitting this resolution because I am convinced the best way to prevent gun violence is by reaching out to individual children and helping them make the right decisions. This resolution gives parents, teachers, government leaders, service clubs, police departments, and others a special day to focus on the problems today of young people and gun violence. October is National Crime Prevention Month--the perfect time to center our attention of the special needs of our kids and gun violence.  A Minnesota Homemaker, Mary Lewis Grow, developed this idea for a ``Day of Concern for Young People and Gun Violence''. Other groups, such as Mothers Against Violence in America, the National Parent Teacher Association, and the American Medical Association have joined the effort to establish a special day in which to express our concern about our children and gun violence. The proclamation of a special day of recognition also provided support to a national effort to encourage students to sign a pledge against gun violence. In 1997, 47,000 students in Washington State signed the pledge card, as did more than 200,000 children in New York City, and tens of thousands more across the nation.  The Student Pledge Against Gun Violence calls for a national observance on October 8 to give students the chance to make a promise, in writing, that they will do their part to prevent gun violence. The students' pledge promises three things: (1) they will never carry a gun to school; (2) they will never resolve a dispute with a gun; and (3) they will use their influence with friends to discourage them from resolving disputes with guns.  Just think of the lives we could have saved if all students had signed--and lived up to-- such a pledge last year. Consider that in the months between today and the day we demonstrated our concern about youth violence last year, we've had an outbreak of school violence. Eleven students and two teachers have been killed and more than 40 students have been wounded in shootings by children. In addition, we've lost thousands of children in what has become the all-too-common violence of drive-by shootings, drug wars, and other crime and in self-inflicted and unintentional shootings.  Last year, Senator Kempthorne and I led the cosponsorship drive of this resolution after his 17-year-old neighbor was murdered by a 19-year-old in a random act of violence in Washington state. Ann Harris' parents vowed to transform their grief into an opportunity to help teach our young people to care about each other and to stop the violence. We both pledged our support.  We all have been heartened by statistics showing crime in America on the decline. Many factors are involved, including community-based policing, stiffer sentences for those convicted, youth crime prevention programs, and population demographics. None of us intend to rest on our success because we still have far, far too much crime and violence in this society.  So, we must find the programs that work and focus our limited resources on those. We must get tough on violent criminals--even if they are young--to protect the rest of society from their terrible actions. And we, each and every one of us, must make time to spend with our children, our neighbor's children, and the children who have no one else to care about them. Only when we reach out to our most vulnerable citizens--our kids--will we drop youth violence to zero.  Mr. President, I urge all of my colleagues to join in this simple effort to focus attention on gun violence among youth by proclaiming October 8 the ``Day of Concern about Young People and Gun Violence.'' We introduce this resolution today in the hopes of getting all 100 Senators to cosponsor this resolution prior to its passage, which we hope will occur in September. This is an easy step for us to help facilitate the work that must go on in each community across America, as parents, teachers, friends and students try to prevent gun violence before it continues to ruin countless lives.                          ____________________
