Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend, the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), for yielding and for bringing this resolution before this body.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the resolution in honor of our dear friend and colleague Joe Moakley. He was a good and decent man. Some would say he was too good, he was so good. He was a tireless worker and fighter for the people of his district and for all of the citizens of our country. He had a deep concern for human rights, for civil rights, for those who had been left out and for those who have been left behind.  He will be deeply missed by the people of his beloved Boston, and he will be missed by all of us here in this House.  Mr. Speaker, our friend, our colleague, Joe Moakley, took to heart what Horace Mann said when he said we should be ashamed to die, we should be ashamed to leave this world until we have made some contribution to humanity.  Joe Moakley made more than a contribution. When we look at Boston, look at the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, when we look at America, when we look at our world, we live in a different place, we live in a better place because of the work, the commitment, the dedication and the vision of this one man.
