Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman and join him in his objection. I have a great deal of respect for the gentleman and my great friend from Colorado, but this is a very carefully worked bill, very carefully crafted bill, and decisions have been made that are discrete on a project-by-project basis, and I do not think it is correct policy to simply then have an across-the-board cut regardless of what the amount is and would join my chairman in opposition to the amendment.
