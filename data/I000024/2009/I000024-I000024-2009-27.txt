Steven C. McCraw is a native of El Paso, TX, and holds a Bachelor of Science degree and a Master of Arts degree from West Texas State University. Mr. McCraw began his career in 1977 as a State Trooper and later a Sergeant Narcotics Investigator for the Texas Department of Public Safety.  Becoming an FBI Special Agent in 1983, Mr. McCraw served in the Dallas, Pittsburgh, Los Angeles, Phoenix and San Antonio Field offices. He worked at FBI headquarters in assignments that included Unit Chief of an Organized Crime Unit; Inspector; Deputy Assistant Director; Assistant Director of the Office of Intelligence, which was established in February 2002; and Assistant Director for the Inspections Division where he was responsible for strategic planning, internal investigations and bureau-wide performance evaluations. He also served as the Inspector-In-Charge of the Southeast Bomb Task Force. After the attacks on our Nation on September 11, 2001, the President created the Foreign Terrorist Tracking Task Force and named Mr. McCraw as the director. At the point when our Nation seemed most vulnerable, Mr. McCraw led the charge to identify and locate additional terrorist threats.  Mr. McCraw retired as an FBI Assistant Director in August 2004. After more than 20 years of exemplary Federal service, he could have simply retired. Instead, he answered the call of Texas Governor Rick Perry and was appointed the Director of the Governor's Office of Homeland Security. Mr. McCraw has been instrumental in leading the State's homeland security efforts, from border security to hurricane response, including the successful humanitarian relocation of hundreds of families left homeless by Hurricane Katrina. His extensive background in law enforcement and intelligence has enabled him to make well-informed decisions in preparing for and responding to all hazards and threats in Texas.  On July 17, 2009, Mr. McCraw was selected as the Director of the Texas Department of Public Safety. He will be leading nearly 8,500 commissioned and non-commissioned personnel in the department where he started his law enforcement career.  On behalf of the Congress and the country, I would like to thank Mr. McCraw for his service to the Nation and wish him well as he continues his contributions to the safety and security of the State of Texas.                          ____________________
