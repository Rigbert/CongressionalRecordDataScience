President, it has been more than a year since the Columbine tragedy, but still this Republican Congress refuses to act on sensible gun legislation.  Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. Until we act, Democrats in the Senate will read the names of some of those who have lost their lives to gun violence in the past year, and we will continue to do so every day that the Senate is in session.  In the name of those who died, we will continue this fight. Following are the names of some of the people who were killed by gunfire one year ago today.  October 3, 1999:  Jonos Baptiste, 21, Miami-Dade County, FL; Stephen Barnett, 39, Baltimore, MD; Brandon Brewer, 26, Nashville, TN; Frederick Darrington, 30, Kansas City, MO; Ernesto Galvan, 33, Dallas, TX; Charles Hart, 45, Detroit, MI; Lloyd Hilton, 24, Gary, IN; Herman M. Logan, 26, Chicago, IL; Pablo A. Martinez, 20, Oklahoma City, OK; Melvin B. McPhail, 51, Madison, WI; Arthur Michael, 50, San Antonio, TX; Joe Moore, 29, Fort Wayne, IN; Ryan Pearson, 22, Kansas City, MO; Michael J. Plancia, 18, Salt Lake City, UT; Miquel Rivas, 21, Houston, TX; William M. Smith, 52, Memphis, TN; Brandon A. Wakefield, 20, Longview, WA; Porsche Williams, 15, Miami-Dade County, FL; and unidentified male, 62, San Jose, CA.  One of the victims of gun violence I mentioned, 15-year-old Porsche Williams of Miami-Dade County, Florida, was a young mother. In addition to caring for her own three-year-old child, Porsche cared for her younger brothersand sisters after her mother died of cancer. Porsche's life ended tragically when her ex-boyfriend shot and killed her one year ago today. The 21-year-old gunman later shot and killed himself  We cannot sit back and allow such senseless gun violence to continue. The deaths of these people are a reminder to all of us that we need to enact sensible gun legislation now.                          ____________________
