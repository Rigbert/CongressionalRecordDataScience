Thank you, Chairman Royce.  Meanwhile, the law enforcement and media reports continue to document Americans on the U.S. sex offender registries who were caught sexually abusing children in East Asia and Central and South America and everyplace in the world. It is the same horror movie replayed over and over. We must do more to warn destination countries so that they can, in turn, protect their children from sex tourism. We have the information and technology that is employed to protect children.  Madam Speaker, I ask Members to support this legislation. It is the second time that we have brought this bill to the floor. It is slightly different than it was in 2010. It passed then. It got no action in the United States Senate.  I hope all five of these historic bills are taken up in a very timely fashion by the U.S. Senate because protecting the weakest and the most vulnerable--women, children, and especially the at-risk population--from this cruelty must be an imperative. And the Senate needs to act, as we are acting.  I would like to thank the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children for their support of the legislation.
