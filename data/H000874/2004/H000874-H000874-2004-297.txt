Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. It is a shame we cannot have a longer, more substantive debate on this. The gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Nussle) got up and criticized the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Moore) for his inconsistency. He is for middle-class tax cuts, as I am; but he wants to pay for them. The gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Nussle) in 1997 voted for the Balanced Budget Amendment, as I did, which had exactly the same PAYGO as is included in the Moore motion to instruct.  Hear me, I say to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Toomey). The gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Nussle) voted for exactly the same PAYGO as did 193 Republicans. Stick with your original convictions.                              {time}  1515
