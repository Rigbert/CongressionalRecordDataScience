 President, we are working our way through the Transportation appropriations bill. We have one amendment pending. I see the Senator from Oklahoma is here, and he shortly is going to ask to set aside this amendment in order to call up an amendment. I ask any other Members who have amendments they wish to offer during this debate to come to the floor, offer their amendments, and we will work our way expeditiously through as many as possible. I remind all colleagues that the majority leader has been very clear that due to the Jewish holidays we will be finishing by midday on Wednesday; therefore, Members should expect a very long night tomorrow night as we work our way through these amendments. It will work a lot better if Members come to the floor and offer their amendments so we know what order we have and how we can work through them. I ask Members who have been calling us and letting us know they have an amendment to come to the floor this eveningor tomorrow morning at the latest and get those amendments up so we can go through them.
