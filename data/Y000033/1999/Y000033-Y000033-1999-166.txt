Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I want to clarify the Biosphere Reserve Program is operating without any congressional authority at all. Our constitutional system is designed to make our government responsible to the people; that is, the American citizens who are the ultimate sovereign authority in our system, a people who must satisfy the concerns of outsiders before they are no longer sovereign. That is why this is called the American Sovereignty Act.  I respectfully request my colleagues to vote for this legislation, get us back in control under our Constitution. That is our role. That is our charge. Not to do so is neglecting our responsibility.  Mr. Chairman, I include the following for the Record:                                                           Senate,                                           State of Minnesota,                                       St. Paul, MN, May 11, 1999.     Hon. Tom Coburn,     House of Representatives,     Washington, DC.       Dear Congressman Coburn: As Chairman of the Minnesota      Senate Committee on Natural Resources and Environment, I      commend your efforts to defund the Man and Biosphere Program      (MAB). Since one of the major opponents of your efforts is      Congressman Bruce Vento of Minnesota, who represents a      compact urban district with little undeveloped land, I would      like to tell you about the painful experience northern      Minnesota had with the MAB program in the past.       During the mid-1980's the National Park Service proposed a      massive Northwoods International Biosphere Reserve that      included lands in my Senate district which were included      without notifying me or any other local elected officials. In      1984 the state-sponsored Citizen's Committee on Voyageurs      National Park took up this issue after a casual comment from      the then Voyageurs National Park Superintendent Russell Berry      that our area had been nominated as a biosphere reserve. At a      public meeting of that committee on December 1, 1984 in      Minneapolis after the nomination was made, Mr. Berry,      partially explained one reason for the biosphere reserve by      stating ``I'd like to be in as strong a position as possible      to influence activities outside the boundaries that would      adversely affect the Park in the context of things that would      be detrimental to the ecosystem within the Park.''       Because the park is surrounded by thousands of acres of      private property, Mr. Berry intended to use the biosphere as      a means to implement land use controls on private property.      Since my constituents did not want their constitutionally-     guaranteed private property rights further threatened, they      strongly opposed this proposal. Consequently, in 1987 the      Northwoods International Biosphere Reserve nomination was      withdrawn by National Park Service Director William Penn      Mott.       Until the MAB program is authorized by Congress and      statutory protections for private property are guaranteed, I      will support all efforts to defund this program. Without      these protections, unelected federal bureaucrats will again      use biosphere reserves as a means of implementing federal      land use controls on private property.       Since Mr. Vento's district is 300 miles away from the ill-     fated Northwoods International Biosphere Reserve proposal, I      would encourage you to listen to those who represent people      who live and work in the affected area rather than those who      recreate in the area on weekends.       Thanks again for your efforts in defense of local control      and private property.           Sincerely,     Senator Bob Lessard.                                  ____                                               Chesapeake, VA,                                                     May 18, 1999.     Congressman Richard Pombo,     United States Capitol Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Pombo: Thank you for asking for my comments on the      process of UNESCO designation of World Heritage Sites.       During the Reagan Administration, these designations were      honorary and benign in nature. However, like so many United      Nations programs, this one has fallen subject to      inappropriate mission creep. It has become a proxy for      international attempts to override national sovereignty and      control land use.       The current Administration has submitted a thirteen year      old press release to invoke my name in support of the World      Heritage Site proposals. This is unfortunate political game-     playing and deceptive in that it does not represent my      position. Favorable statements made about an honorary and      benign program more than a decade ago are patently not      applicable to that program as it is now being utilized.       The American Land Sovereignty Protection Act, as I      understand it, will require congressional approval of United      Nations World Heritage Site proposals. I believe that this is      a necessary and reasonable safeguard for American citizens      against overreaching, unelected, unaccountable domestic and      international bureaucracies.       This legislation Chairman Young is sponsoring, H.R. 883,      will bring welcome relief to property owners threatened by a      United Nations bureaucracy that has grown out of control.           Sincerely,     Donald Paul Hodel.                                  ____                                                 Stockton, CA,                                                     May 13, 1999.     Hon. Richard Pombo,     Member of Congress, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Congressman Pombo: Thank you for contacting me      regarding the House Committee on Resources' March 18 hearing      on the American Land Sovereignty Protection Act, H.R. 883.       As you know, before President Ronald Reagan appointed me      Assistant Secretary for Fish, and Wildlife and Parks,      Department of the Interior, I served Governor Ronald Reagan      as the Director of California's Department of Fish and Game.      I am especially proud of the environmental agenda we were      able to implement, and the success we had with programs that      encourage ranchers, farmers and other private landowners to      maintain, develop and enhance wildlife habitat on privately      owned land. Those benefits continue to this day, and they      serve as excellent examples of public benefits that flow from      private land ownership without government intervention or      funding.       Before coming to Washington, D.C. in 1980 to serve      President Reagan, I gave 20 years of volunteer service on the      board of directors of the National Wildlife Federation (NWF),      including two terms as the Foundation's president-elect      (1976-78).       Before my career and commitment to wildlife resources and      the environment, I defended America's freedoms, including the      right to own private property, when serving 4\1/2\ years with      the U.S. Marine Corps during WWII, and another three years      during the Korean Conflict.       At the March 18 hearing of the House Committee on      Resources, I understand that the U.S. Department of the      interior witness entered into the official record a 17-year      old letter I signed while serving the Reagan Administration      as Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife and Parks. I      recently reviewed the letter in question, and you should know      that it merely dealt with the technical issue of creating a      standardized form for recording information on World Heritage      Sites. The letter must not be interpreted as anything other      than that.       The record of the Reagan Administration and the current      Clinton Administration regarding UNESCO's World Heritage, and      Man and the Biosphere programs are starkly different. Under      the Reagan Administration, these designations were indeed      voluntary, non-regulatory, and honorary. This is in sharp      contrast with the current Administration that invited the      World Heritage Committee to Yellowstone National Park to      condemn private property located outside of the Park! The      World Heritage Committee delegation present was comprised      largely of non-elected bureaucrats from Third World      countries. Such an action by the World Heritage     Committee clearly runs roughshod over America's sovereignty.       H.R. 883 is sorely needed to require Congress to oversee      non-elected bureaucrats, in both the United States and the      United Nations, from threatening our nation's sovereignty and      private property rights of American citizens. Former United      States Ambassador to the United Nations, Jeane J.      Kirkpatrick, stated this best in a May 5, 1999, letter she      sent to the House Committee on Resources on this issue. she      wrote, inter alia: ``In U.N. organizations, there is no      accountability. U.N. bureaucrats are far removed from the      American voters. Many of the State Parties in the World      Heritage Treaty are not democracies. Some come from countries      that do not allow the ownership of private property. The      World Heritage, and Man and Biosphere Reserve committees make      decisions affecting the land and lives of Americans. Some of      these decisions are made by representatives chosen by      governments not based on democratic representation, certainly      not the representation of Americans. What recourse does an      American voter have when U.N. bureaucrats from Cuba or Iraq      or Libya (all of which are parties to this Treaty) have made      a decision that unjustly damages his or her property rights      that lie near a national park? When the World Heritage      Committee's meddling has needlessly encumbered a private      United States citizen's land and caused his or her property      values to fall, that citizen's appeals to these committees      (if that is possible) will fall on deaf ears.''       I strongly support H.R. 883 and urge its passage. I believe      H.R. 883 is desperately needed, and I know that it is in the      best interest of our nation and her citizens to require our      elected representatives in the United States Congress to      properly oversee the actions of non-elected bureaucrats      within the United States and the United Nations.           Sincerely,                                                G. Ray Arnett,                                        Former Assistant Secretary     for Fish and Wildlife and Parks.                                  ____                                                  Clark Ranch,                                     Paso Robles, CA, 14 May 1999.     Hon. Richard W. Pombo,     Congress of the United States, House of Representatives,          Washington, DC.       Dear Congressman Pombo: I greatly appreciate you informing      me about the May 12, 1999 letter from Deputy Assistant      Secretary of the Interior Stephen Saunders to House Resources      Committee Chairman Don Young regarding H.R. 883, the American      Land Sovereignty Protection Act.       The Saunders letter cited a letter I signed 15 years ago as      Secretary of the Interior regarding the U.S.'s continued      participation in the World Heritage Convention at a time when      our nation decided to withdraw from the United States      Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).      My letter is characterized by Mr. Saunders as showing ``a      strong bipartisan consensus that U.S. involvement with the      World Heritage Convention and other international      conservation conventions at issue in H.R. 883 pose absolutely      no threat to U.S. sovereignty.''       That was true fifteen years ago. It is no longer the case      today.       When I was Secretary of Interior for President Ronald      Reagan, World Heritage sites were merely honorary      designations. They did not threaten private property rights      or national sovereignty. They were designed to recognize      outstanding natural and cultural resources in America without      creating new layers of regulation on private landowners and      rural communities.       Unfortunately, this program has been used in some cases by      the current administration to threaten private property      owners and national sovereignty. For example, in its efforts      to stop a proposed mine on private property outside      Yellowstone National Park, the current administration in 1995      invited the World Heritage Committee to the park to evaluate      alleged environmental threats caused by the proposed mine.      This visit by unelected United Nations bureaucrats created a      circus-type atmosphere whereby the World Heritage Committee      made the owners of that private property a pariah in the      international community. Partially as a result of this visit      and a formal declaration later against the proposed mine by      the World Heritage committee, the mine was never developed.       I also understand that some in the current administration      are attempting to use our membership in the World Heritage      Committee to help stop a proposed mine in Australia that is      strongly supported by the duly elected government of that      country. Such an effort against a sovereign nation would have      been unthinkable under the Reagan Administration which      honored the sovereignty of democratically elected      governments.       My review of H.R. 883 shows it merely provides      congressional oversight of the World Heritage Program to      prevent an international agency from threatening private      property rights and national sovereignty as it did in      Yellowstone and is attempting to do in Australia. This      legislation will provide the type of adult supervision from      elected officials that every domestic and international      bureaucracy needs.       I appreciate you alerting me that my 15 year old letter is      regrettably being used for political purposes in Washington,      D.C.           Sincerely,     William P. Clark.                                  ____                                              Pulp & Paperworkers'                                             Resource Council.       Dear Representative: The Pulp and Paperworkers' Resource      Council (PPRC) strongly urges you to support H.R. 883, the      American Land Sovereignty Protection Act, which soon will be      voted on by the full House. This bill provides for      Congressional oversight of United Nations Biosphere Reserves      and World Heritage Sites in the United States. The biosphere      program is not even authorized by Congress, nor is the      program part of an international treaty.       PPRC is a ``Grassroots'' organization representing more      than 300,000 Pulp and Paper Workers and some 900,000 Wood      Products Industry Workers. Many of our members are unionized      workers and we have members in virtually every state of the      union. We support natural resource policies that allow our      mills to thrive and keep our members and their families      employed in well-paying union jobs.       PPRC is very concerned how America's sovereignty over its      natural resources is increasingly threatened by international      agreements and unelected bureaucrats at international      organizations which often are dominated by Third World      nations that have poor records in protecting their own      natural resources. This was painfully evident when several      PPRC officers participated in the World Commission on      Forestry and Sustainable Development conferences.       United Nations Biosphere Reserve and World Heritage Site      designations, administered by the United Nations Educational,      Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), are nominated      through a secretive process that excludes local governments,      union workers, private landowners and other average citizens.      Only high-ranking unelected officials at the State      Department, other federal agencies, UNESCO and national      environmental advocacy groups are involved in this nomination      process.       Our Members, from diverse states such as New York,      Arkansas, Kentucky and Minnesota have fought hard to get a      seat at the table when biosphere reserves were proposed in      their areas. In all cases, officials from federal agencies      ardently worked to keep them out. H.R. 883 would open up this      process by requiring that all existing biosphere reserves in      the United States be authorized by an Act of Congress by 2002      or they would cease to exist. This would empower average      citizens to become involved in these designations.       At House Resource Committee hearings in Tannersville, NY,      Washington, D.C. and Rolla, MO, PPRC testified in strong      support of this legislation. It embodies a basic principle of      open government that citizens and communities have a right to      know about decisions affecting them before they are made.       Again, the Pulp and Paperworkers' Resource Council strongly      supports H.R. 883.           Sincerely,                                                       Don Wesson,     PPRC National Secretary.                                  ____                                                      May 5, 1999.     Hon. Bruce F. Vento,     House of Representatives,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Vento Thank you for your letters of March 24th and      April 28th regarding my testimony before the House Resources      Committee on the March 18th hearing of the American land      Sovereignty Protection Act, H.R. 883. In my opinion the      important issue here is protection of Americans' rights of      democratic process. I sought to emphasize the dangers I see      in Congress's waiving of its role and responsibilities over      matters which fundamentally affect citizens of the United      States and ceding that role and its associated powers to a      global organization in which affected Americans have no      representation.       As I understand it, the proposed Act does nothing more than      affirm Congressional role in the management of our public      lands, a role mandated to it by the Constitution under      Article IV, Section 3, which states: ``The Congress shall      have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and      Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property      belonging to the United States.'' I believe that is a clearly      worded duty which Congress is bound by the Constitution to      uphold.       Your letter raises several questions concerning my      testimony, each of which I have addressed below.       I. Please explain the simultaneous decision to continue our      active participation in the World Heritage Convention and the      U.S. Man and the Biosphere Program [after your support for      the successful U.S. withdrawal from UNESCO], both of which      are coordinated at the international level by UNESCO.       The United States' Permanent Representative to the United      Nations oversees U.S. participation in many United Nations'      programs and organizations, including aspects of U.S.      participation in UNESCO. The World Heritage and Man and the      Biosphere programs, however, were not among them when I held      that job.       As you know, the Department of the Interior has primary      responsibility for the World Heritage and the Biosphere      programs. The Department of the Interior, along with a      federal interagency panel controls all aspects of these      programs. No member of Congress is included on this panel.      Neither was a United States' U.N. Ambassador when I held that      position. The Code of Federal Regulations July 21, 1980      public notice of proposed U.S. World Heritage Nominations or      1981 states U.S. law at the time I was our UN Ambassador:      ``In the United States, the Secretary of the Interior is      charged with implementing the provisions of the Convention,      including preparation of U.S. nominations. Recommendations     on the proposed nominations are made to the Secretary by an      interagency panel including members from the Office of the      Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife and Parks, the      Heritage Conservation and Recreation Service, the National      Park Service, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service within      the Department of the Interior; the President's Council on      Environmental Quality; the Advisory Council on Historic      Preservation, and the Department of State.''\1\ (Emphasis      added). I was never included on the panel as the Department      of State Representative. I was never invited to participate      in any decisions concerning these programs.---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \1\ ``Proposed U.S. World Heritage Nominations for 1981,      Public Notice,'' 45 FR 48717, July 21, 1980. You will find      the same language in each annual notice.---------------------------------------------------------------------------       I raised the issue of the U.S. withdrawal from UNESCO to      make a point: the UNESCO of the 1980's demonstrates quite      well both an example of an incompetent and corrupt      international organization and the nearly insurmountable      obstacles of trying to reform it and hold it accountable.      During my tenure as U.S. Ambassador, I sought to limit the      proliferation and scope of U.N. based on international      organizations which were accountable to no responsible,      democratically elected government. This discussion serves to      reinforce the point I was trying to make during my testimony,      namely that Congress should take an active role in the      oversight of programs which impact private citizens in this      country.       II. [A]s you know, 7 of the 20 World Heritage Sites in the      United States were listed as such during your tenure as our      Ambassador to the U.N. In your capacity as U.N. Ambassador,      did you oppose these nominations based on the fact that      Congress had not specifically authorized these listings?      At any point in your tenure, did you attempt to have any      existing designations withdrawn on the same basis?       I refer you to my answer above. The Department of the      Interior is charged with implementing the provisions of this      program, not the United States' UN Representative's office. I      had no role and I was not aware of the details of these      programs. Now, however, that this issue has ripened, I      believe it is time to restore Congress' proper role in this      matter.       III. ``Your prepared testimony . . . includes the      statement, `International Committees--whatever the substance      of their decisions--do not represent the American people and      cannot be held accountable by them,' (emphasis added). Is it      accurate to conclude from this statement that you believe      specific Congressional authorization should be required for      U.S. participation in any program which involves an      `international committee?' ''       Obviously, these committees do not represent the American      people. That is not their function. I want to be absolutely      clear on this point. Only our representatives on those      committees represent Americans. Obviously, the Cuban or      Libyan delegates to these committees do not represent the      American people and, in fact, often oppose American      interests, regardless of the issue. Neither do the New      Zealand--to take a country at random--or Brazil. The United      States' Congress, on the other hand, is elected and does, in      fact, represent the American people. U.N. based committees,      unlike Congress, are not accountable to the American people      because they have not been elected by or chosen in any way by      the American people. They do not represent and are not      concerned with U.S. national interests nor the interests of      U.S. citizens.       In this democracy, the citizens grant powers to our elected      leaders through our votes from the local and state levels up      to the Congress and the Presidency. We give them the power to      declare our lands national parks and the right to enact the      laws that restrict our use of our properties. We give our      duly elected leaders the authority to select the judges who      will interpret those laws. Our elected leaders, in turn,      respond to our wishes because, just as we have granted them      power, so may we take it from them in the next election.      Representation and accountability are the foundation of the      freedoms we cherish. Having fought and won elections      yourself, you know this principle well.       In U.N. organizations, there is no accountability. UN      bureaucrats are far removed from the American voters. Many of      the States Parties in the World Heritage Treaty are not      democracies. Some come from countries that do not allow the      ownership of private property. The World Heritage and Man and      the Biosphere committees make decisions affecting the land      and lives of Americans. Some of these decisions are made by      representatives chosen by governments not based on democratic      representation, certainly not on the representation of      Americans. What recourse does an American voter have when UN      bureaucrats from Cuba or Iraq or Libya (all of which are      parties to this Treaty) have made a decision that unjustly      damages his or her property rights that lie near a national      park? When the World Heritage committee's meddling has      needlessly encumbered a private United States citizen's land      and caused his or her property values to fall, that citizen's      appeals to these committees (if that is even possible) will      fall on deaf ears.       As for your question ``Is it accurate to conclude from this      statement that you believe specific Congressional      authorization should be required for U.S. participation in      any program which involves an `international committee?,' ''      my answer is, in any U.N. based committee which makes      decisions that importantly affect American citizens. Speaking      to the issue at hand, which is the requirement of      congressional authorization of World Heritage and Biosphere      site designations, I definitely believe congressional      authorization should be required. Congressional role should      be protected, I believe, should be required, in any process,      any time the Constitution specifically places a duty on      Congress to act. The question presented here is specific. The      Constitution mandates congressional responsibility over      public land management. The World Heritage and Biosphere      programs directly impact the management of public and private      lands in the United States. Congress should be involved.       The Constitution grants and requires Congress' broad      control over the management of the public lands. The      Executive branch, through the Department of the Interior and      in conjunction with the World Heritage and Man and the      Biosphere programs (the ``international committees'' created      by this Convention) should not be allowed to exercise      Congress' constitutional authority.       IV. ``Should Congressional authorization be required for      any international agreements/contracts which allow use of our      national resources and public lands, such as mining or timber      harvesting? If it is the case that your support for requiring      Congressional authorization is limited only to those areas      included in H.R. 883, please explain the specific      characteristics of `international committees' dealing with      conservation which makes them particularly threatening?''       First of all, as you know, any U.N. based agreements or      contracts which allow use of our natural resources and public      lands require various forms of authorization from our elected      officials. In this particular case, the authorization must      come from Congress. The Convention itself requires that      ``the inclusion of a property in the World Heritage List      requires the consent of the State governed.'' [Article II,      Section 3] The State in question is the United States and      its consent requires the consent of the people through      their duly elected representatives in accordance with the      Constitution. That means Congress, the body delegated the      authority over land management by the Constitution. The      ``American Land Sovereignty Protection Act'' is consistent      with both U.S. and international law.       In the second part of your question, you ask what are the      specific characteristics of ``international committees''      dealing with conservation which makes them particularly      threatening?'' My answer is, those communities which affect      substantial interests of U.S. citizens. If American citizens      have an interest in the conservation of a particular area,      that decision should be made by Congress, the body delegated      responsibility by the Constitution for making these decisions      in full view of the American public. And if each decision      requires consideration of costs and benefits to the property      rights of individual voters affected, so be it. UNESCO      committees are not competent to address the complex private      property and public interest issues presented here. They have      no interest in how their actions affect private U.S.      citizens. I believe Congress should not abdicate its      responsibilities for land management to international groups      whose members have no concern for protecting individual      property rights and American interests.           Sincerely,                                             Jeane J. Kirkpatrick.
