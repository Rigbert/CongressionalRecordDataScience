President, I have no objection to just accepting by voice vote his amendment if the language was previously voted on in the last Congress and has been pending for some time.  Mine is very short. I call on any Senator to tell me if there is anything they disagree with. It says:       Nothing in this division, or amendment made by this      division, shall be construed to diminish any rights under the      first amendment to the Constitution of the United States.       Nothing in this division shall be construed to prohibit any      constitutionally protected speech, expressive conduct or      activities (regardless of whether compelled by, or central      to, a system of religious belief), including the exercise of      religion protected by the first amendment to the Constitution      of the United States and peaceful picketing or demonstration.      The Constitution does not protect speech, conduct or      activities consisting of planning for, conspiring to commit,      or committing an act of violence.  Does any Member of this body, Republican or Democratic, disagree with that language? Basically, it says the Constitution is the Constitution. We follow the Constitution. Does anyone disagree with that language?
