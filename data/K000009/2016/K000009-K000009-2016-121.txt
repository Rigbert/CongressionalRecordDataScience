 I think Congresswoman Lujan Grisham has done such a phenomenal job here, and I appreciate her interest in the necessity of desalinization work and how important the Department of Energy is in finding a solution that is cost effective and the most advanced energy system we can have to desalinate as we move forward. I share her interest in finding funding for this important work, and, hopefully, in a conference situation, we can provide a way to provide some resources.  I really applaud the gentlewoman for her path-breaking efforts on behalf of a very important issue.
