 President, for the information of all Senators, tomorrow morning at 9:30 a.m., the Senate will resume consideration of H.R. 2676, the IRS reform bill. Senator Roth will immediately be recognized to offer an amendment relating to offsets. It is hoped that the Senate will be able to make substantial progress on this legislation so that the Senate may finish this bill on Wednesday or Thursday of this week. Senators can, therefore, expect rollcall votes throughout the session on Wednesday.                          ____________________
