 James Bianco and his father, Anthony Bianco.  Jim Bianco is the CEO of Cell Therapeutics Inc., a Seattle-based company that develops cancer therapies. Recently, Jim was honored by the National Organization of Rare Diseases, NORD, for his distinguished work.  Jim's father, Anthony Bianco, also just received some long-overdue recognition for his military service to our Nation. During World War II, Tony Bianco was a pilot with the 32nd bomb squadron. Our Christmas Day, 1944, Tony was not required to fly. But he choose to fly that day in service to his country. On that mission over Czechoslovakia, his squadron was attacked. Shrapnel came through the floor of his B-17, entered his lower leg, and exited through his knee. It was a serious injury, yet Tony managed to land his plane safety. He spent the next nine months in a hospital in Italy before being sent back to the United States.  Because of the recovery time for his injury and the coinciding of the end of the War, Tony was never given his 2nd Lieutenant bars. Tony's son Jim just recently discovered this oversight, and has worked diligently to get his father the recognition he deserves.  Recently, Jim was able to present his father Tony with his 2nd Lieutenant bars in recognition of his correct status after his bravery in World War II. I, too, would like to recognize Anthony Bianco and thank him for his brave service to our country. Congratulations should go to both of these men, and a heartfelt thanks to both of them for serving our country.                          ____________________
