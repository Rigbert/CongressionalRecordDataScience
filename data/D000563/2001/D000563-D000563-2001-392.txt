President, Members of the Senate, this is an amendment I am offering for Senator Kennedy. The HOPE scholarship tax credit is valuable to students but not to those who are attending community colleges and public universities. It is limited to tuition and fees.  This amendment expands the reach of the HOPE scholarship tax credit to include other costs of college, such as transportation, daycare, cost of computers, books, and the like. This will mean the HOPE scholarship tax credit will help children of limited means from families who aren't wealthy receive a college education.  I hope Members of the Senate will consider a change in the upper tax rates to bring it to the same level as all other tax rate reductions, the benefits of that savings going to the kids in community colleges so they can qualify for the HOPE scholarship tax credit.  Thank you, Mr. President.
