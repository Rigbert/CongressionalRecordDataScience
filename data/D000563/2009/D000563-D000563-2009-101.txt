Earlier we were embroiled in the reading of an amendment that would have literally consumed the entire day and forced us into another day's time and run the risk of not providing money for the troops when the continuing resolution, the funding resolution, ran out.  The Senator from Vermont withdrew his amendment, and now we have moved to this bill. But there is nothing stopping us. A consent agreement can be entered into by both sides of the aisle that can move this through quickly and say to our troops: We are with you.  I yield to the Senator from Rhode Island.
