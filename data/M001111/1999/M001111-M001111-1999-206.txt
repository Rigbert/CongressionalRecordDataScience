 President, I rise today to recognize a class of students from Tahoma High School in Maple Valley, Washington who are the champions of the Region One--Western States award of the ``We the People . . . the Citizen and the Constitution'' national finals. This outstanding groupearned the highest cumulative score in their geographic region during the first two days of the ``Citizen and the Constitution'' national finals, competing against 50 other classes from across the country. Their remarkable understanding and appreciation of the fundamental ideals and values of American constitutional government assure me that this emerging generation will contribute much to the future of civic life.  These Tahoma High School students serve as role models to their peers, not only by expressing their views and arguments in a poised and mature manner, but also by expressing them as they relate to government. I commend these students on beginning this important civic dialogue at an early age, and sincerely hope that they make it a life-long commitment. The honored students, led by Mark Oglesby, are: Adam Baldridge, Mary Basinger, Josh Bodily, Sydney Brumbach, Katie Carder, Erica Chavez, Elizabeth Dauenhauer, Steven Dekoker, Meaghan Denney, Nathan Dill, Marisa Dorazio, Jesse Duncan, Jayson Hart, Jon Hellstom, Carolyn Hott, Daniel Lindner, Casey Lineberger, Clark Lundberg, Karrie Pilgrim, Michael Pirog, David Rosales, Jason Shinn, Jeremy Sloan, Justin Sly, Donny Trieu, Orianna Tucker, Jessica Walker, Raymond Williams, and Elizabeth Zaleski.                          ____________________
