 President, I rise today to pay tribute to Dick Boyd, who will retire at the end of October after 32 years of service to the Westvaco Corporation. For over thirty years, Dick has helped establish Westvaco and the Fine Papers mill into fixtures of Wickliffe, Kentucky. Though not originally from Kentucky, Dick became a valued member of the Wickliffe community, raised his family there and continues to have close ties to Kentucky.  In 1966, Dick joined Westvaco as the Assistant Public Relations Manager at the Fine Papers Division in Luke, Maryland. The next year, Westvaco announced that Wickliffe, Kentucky would be the site of a new $80 million mill. It was while assisting in the public relations details of this announcement that Dick began his long association with the community of Wickliffe. Later that year, Dick, his wife Malinda and their two daughters moved to Wickliffe. Dick became Public Relations Manager for Fine Papers in 1970.  Dick held that job until 1988. During that time, he played an integral role as the Fine Papers mill became the bedrock of the Wickliffe community. After a brief stint during 1988 in the Kentucky State Government as Deputy Secretary of the Cabinet for Economic Development, Dick returned to Westvaco as Regional Public Affairs Manager, a position he held until 1991. At that time he moved to Washington to become Westvaco's Director of Public Affairs, a position he continues to hold today.  Since the 1966 announcement that the plant would be built in Western Kentucky, Westvaco has spent more than half a billion dollars to create a state-of-the-art papermaking facility in Wickliffe. Today, Westvaco employs over 750 men and women in Kentucky, and makes an annual contribution of $134 million to the local economy. The growth of the mill and the company's great relationship with the community are a legacy of Dick's career at Westvaco and his 24 years in Kentucky.  Mr. President, I have worked closely with Dick on several issues of great importance to both Westvaco and my constituents in the Wickliffe area. His hard work and dedication have allowed Westvaco to become an important part of the Wickliffe community. I have enjoyed working with him, thank him for all his efforts on behalf of Westvacoand the people of the Wickliffe community, and wish him the best wherever his future endeavors may take him.                          ____________________
