GOODLATTE. It is a high percentage. The question is what percentage of cases we have in Federal courts now that can be removed from the court system if there is a penalty for bringing a frivolous or fraudulent case? If that indeed is 25 percent, that is a substantial reduction. I think it would be greater than that.  Not only will frivolous and fraudulent cases be settled, but in some cases where there is merit in the case that the parties have not been able to get together, they will get together because of the increased risk involved in the case and nonmeritorious cases will be settled or dismissed before somebody takes the risk of bringing an action all the way through the cost of the judge, the jury, and everybody else that has to be involved, and all the time involved in the case. We can reduce those by encouraging settlement. I think this is a very good vehicle to do it.
