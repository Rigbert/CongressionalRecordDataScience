President, if the leader will yield further. As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I commend the distinguished majority leader, the Democratic leader, and the chairman and ranking member of that committee for pushing us this far on the appropriations. It is highly commendable.  I join my friend from Maryland in saying there are many of these nominations on the calendar that need to be cleared as soon as possible--especially the judges that are there. We have new vacancies in our courts. Again, once a person has been confirmed, it still takes weeks before they get out of whatever life they are in--private practice, or whatever--to get out of that and get set up and get their law clerks hired, and on and on, and with all that it means with their families and lives and all. So if some can be cleared now, we know it will be 5 weeks sooner.
