 President, again for the majority leader, I would ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today it stand in recess until the hour of 9:45 a.m. Friday, March 24, 1995; that following the prayer, the Journal of proceedings be deemed approved to date; the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day; that there then be a period for the transaction of routine morning business not to extend beyond the hour of 10 a.m, with Senator McCain to be recognized for up to 10 minutes. I further ask that at the hour of 10 a.m, the Senate proceed to the consideration of H.R. 831, the self-employed health deduction bill.
