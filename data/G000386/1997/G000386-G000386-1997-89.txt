 I thank the Senator from New Mexico for his kind remarks. And he has spoken better than I can on that issue. But basically what his constituents do not realize and my constituents do not realize, is that we have a very cost-effective delivery of medicine in rural America, very high quality by the way, but because of the historical basis for the reimbursement of Medicare, based upon that cost-effective medicine, we are at a very low level, and the options that metropolitan areas have will not come to rural America; but the provisions of the legislation he just described will make that possible now.  And so I can say this, that in 1995, it would not have been included in the legislation without the intervention of the Senator from New Mexico, even though it was my basic legislation. And he helped us this time at a very, very critical time in the negotiations between the House and the Senate. So I may have authored this legislation, but the fact that it is in the final package is a tribute to the leadership of Senator Domenici.  I will continue on and say that we have also for rural areas the provisions for:  Expanding the existing telemedicine demonstration project, in order to improve the delivery of health care to underserved areas;  Reform of the eligibility requirements for rural health clinics, enabling this vital program to operate as originally intended; and  My legislation assisting rural referral centers.  I am also pleased to finally see my legislation to provide direct reimbursement at 85 percent of the physician fee schedule to nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, any physician assistants is finally going to become law. Similar measures were included in the President's Medicare proposal and in the House Ways and Means Medicare bill and were part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1995.  Senator Conrad and I introduced these bills in the last three Congresses. We reintroduced them again in this Congress and were successful in getting them included in the Senate Finance Committee bill. This legislation will reform Medicare policies which, under certain circumstances, restrict reimbursement for services delivered by these providers.  Direct reimbursement to these nonphysician providers will improve access to primary care services for Medicare beneficiaries, particularly in rural and under served areas.  There has been much deliberation in this Congress over proposals to address the problem of uninsured children in our Nation.  I am very pleased that the bill before us today includes a strong bipartisan package addressing this matter. This bill includes a total of $24 billion to be spent on children's health insurance initiatives for those who are not currently enrolled in Medicaid or who do not have access to adequate and affordable health care coverage. This is $10 billion more than the President's original proposal.  We should view this achievement not only as an important piece of health care policy, but also as a giant step toward improving the quality of life for our Nation's children. I commend the Senate leadership, particularly Chairman Roth and Chairman Domenici, for their leadership and commitment to this important matter.  These funds will be provided to States in the form of block grants. States are allowed considerable flexibility in designing health insurance programs, yet States must meet important Federal guidelines in their efforts to provide quality health care coverage.  I am confident that this proposal will be successful in meeting our goals to cover our Nation's uninsured children.  Yet, it is important that Congress remain committed to this goal and we must closely monitor the developments of the proposal set forth in this legislation.  This budget bill includes a number of improvements to the Medicaid Program to ensure that high-quality of care is provided to our Nation's most vulnerable population. And, this bill reforms Medicaid to give States much more flexibility in managing their programs.  In recent years, States have undertaken numerous initiatives to control spending in Medicaid. As a result, Medicaid spending has slowed significantly. This budget saves a total of $13.6 billion in the Medicaid Program over 5 years. Most savings are achieved through new policies for payments to disproportionate share hospitals. Funds have been retargeted to hospitals that serve large numbers of Medicaid and low-income patients.  Other improvements made to the Medicaid Program include changes to last year's welfare reform law so that benefits are restored to legal immigrants needing long-term care services. Also, a number of important reforms were made to managed care policies for Medicaid programs serving children, people with disabilities, and other Americans.  Of course, I do have a number of concerns, Madam President. Does this bill represent a long-term solution to the problems facing the entitlement programs? No, it most certainly does not. But I note that the proposal of Senators Roth and Moynihan to establish a Medicare Reform Commission is included in the conference agreement. We will look to the work of this commission to make proposals for reform and to help us produce the consensus we need to act to put the Medicare Program on a sound footing for the retirement of the baby-boom generation. Make no mistake: we will need to do more. But on balance, I believe that we have made a good start.  I want to conclude by again thanking Senators Roth and Domenici and theirhard-working staffs for the efforts they have made, for several years now, to bring us to this point.
