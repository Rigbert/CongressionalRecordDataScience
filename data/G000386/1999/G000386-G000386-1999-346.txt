 President, I am joined today by Senator Breaux in introducing the Health Care Fraud Control Act of 1999. This bill is an effective, efficient and economical way to fight fraud, waste and abuse in publicly funded health care programs. It takes a system that is successful in combating Medicaid fraud and expands its authority to pursue investigations in other federal programs when investigators uncover or suspect fraudulent or abusive activities. This bill is common sense.  State Medicaid Fraud Control Units have long been at the forefront of health care fraud enforcement. The Health Care Fraud Control Act would give these units the authority needed to investigate other fraud and abuse cases, including Medicare cases, at the same time as Medicaid cases. This bill, which will be introduced by Rep. Rick Lazio (R-N.Y.) in the House, would streamline the enforcement process for anti-fraud agents, cutting down on bureaucracy and allowing investigators to pursue anti-fraud cases more efficiently. This bill is an important weapon in the war against health care fraud in the Medicaid and Medicare programs.  The streamlined effort would be especially effective in fighting nursing home fraud and neglect. Many times seniors are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid payments. Combined, these two programs cover the bulk of the cost of nursing home care in our country. When a nursing home receives both Medicare and Medicaid payments, the potential for fraud is much too high. As the law stands, even if a fraud control unit establishes a strong case showing Medicaid fraud and uncovers Medicare fraud at the same time, it must wait while various federal agencies investigate the Medicare side before the case can be prosecuted.  Any effort to combat fraud is critical. Medicaid's annual budget is $178 billion, and fraud cases can involve significant amounts of money. Meanwhile, improper payments through Medicare were $12.6 billion in Fiscal Year 1998.  Expanding the Medicaid anti-fraud units' jurisdiction will help us erode health care fraud. With billions of tax dollars wasted each year, we need every weapon we can find in the anti-fraud arsenal. We can't afford to waste a single health care dollar.                                 ______                                       By Mr. McCAIN:  S. 1419. A bill to amend title 36, United States Code, to designate May as ``National Military Appreciation Month''; to the Committee on the Judiciary.                  national military appreciation month  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to designate the month of May National Military Appreciation Month. As my colleagues may recall, I had sponsored a resolution earlier in the year, cosponsored by 61 Senators, designating May 1999 as National Military Appreciation Month. That resolution, S. Res. 33, passed by a vote of 93-0 on April 30. The new bill will make that designation permanent.  The introduction of an All-Volunteer Army was an outgrowth of the disenchantment many Americans felt in the wake of the Vietnam War. The end of conscription and the transition to the All-Volunteer concept has been criticized by some for not adequately reflecting socioeconomic divisions within our country. In point of fact, however, with the requisite attention and care, it produced the finest armed forces in history. How far we had come since the tumultuous times of the 1970s when military readiness descended to abysmal levels was evident for all the world to see in the overwhelming victory over Iraqi forces during Operation Desert Storm. But that success has been taken for granted too long. Over 15 years of declining military budgets, combined with record high levels of deployments, have stretched the military to precarious levels.  The end of conscription had another, more far-reaching and subtle implication: it diminished the percentage of the public, including its elected officials, with military experience. This is not a criticism of those who did not serve; on the contrary, as a strong supporter of the All-Volunteer Army, I remain committed to its survival and success. This gradual diminishment in the shared experience of having served in uniform, however, makes it increasingly important that the public reflect every year on the enormous role their armed forces have on preserving freedom.  As thousands of American soldiers move into position in Kosovo, while others continue to serve in Bosnia as well as on the demilitarized zone in Korea and around the world, it is imperative that our men and women in uniform know of the strong continuing support of their country for their dedication and service to this country. Whether we individually agree with each and every deployment or not, we have learned to separate our support every deployment or not, we have learned to separate our support for the armed forces from our differences over the policies that sent them into harm's way. Dedicating one month every year to express our appreciation for the armed forces, the same month in which we recognize Victory in Europe Day, Military Spouse Day, Armed Forces Day, and, most importantly, Memorial Day, is an appropriate measure that I hope will have the support of all my colleagues in Congress.  Mr. President, I generally take a somewhat dim view of celebratory resolutions. But those who fought on the battlefields of Lexington, Gettysburg, Normandy, in the Ardennes and onOkinawa, in Hue and at Khe Sanh, in the deserts of the Persian Gulf and the dusty streets of Mogadish, in the skies over Kosovo and who stand a lonely vigil on the DMZ, must not be forgotten. Too much blood has been spilled in defense of liberty. We owe to those who perished and those who survived, to devote one month out of the year to reflect on the sacrifices of those who have worn their nation's uniform throughout its history.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill, the attached correspondence in support of S. Res. 33 from the Secretary of the Air Force and Air Force Chief of Staff, as well as a letter from retired General Gordon Sullivan, president of the Association of the United States Army, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1419       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

Hon. John McCain,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McCain: On behalf of the 100,000 members of      the Association of the United States Army, I applaud your      introduction of Senate Resolution 33, which would designate      May, 1999, as National Military Appreciation Month.       AUSA agrees that Americans should reflect more often on the      sacrifices of our military personnel throughout history.      Designating a month in which we observe Victory in Europe      Day, Armed Forces Week, Military Spouse Day, and Memorial      Day, is particularly fitting.       AUSA supports your efforts and recommends that the      resolution be amended to make the observance of National      Military Appreciation Month an annual event.           Sincerely,                                               Gordon R. Sullivan,     General, USA Retired.                                  ____                                            Department of Defense,                                   Secretary of the Air Force,                                      Washington, DC, May 6, 1999.     Hon. John McCain,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McCain: On behalf of the men and women of the      United States Air Force, we thank you and the Senate for      designating May 1999 as National Military Appreciation Month.      As you well know, our airmen are not only engaged in the      Balkan operations, but all around the world, with over      100,000 people either forward stationed or deployed. We are      proud of the personal sacrifice and tremendous service they      give our great nation, and it is heartwarming to see the      Senate recognize their efforts. Thank you for your gracious      show of support.     Michael E. Ryan,       General, USAF, Chief of Staff.     F. Whitten Peters,       Acting Secretary of the Air Force.                                 ______                                       By
