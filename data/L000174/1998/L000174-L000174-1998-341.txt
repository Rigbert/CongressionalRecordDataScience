President, I am sure my friend from Oklahoma will allow me to describe what my position will be on it, and I appreciate him stating it. And I do not want to get into the debate he and the Senator from North Dakota have been having. I was here to support, as I have, the amendment of the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Gregg. And what I have before me is an amendment that I think makes a great deal of sense.  I said yesterday that nobody is running up to me in the streets of Vermont and saying, ``Oh, please, whatever you do, be sure and give a lot of immunity to the poor tobacco companies.'' Nobody in Vermont is saying, ``Whatever you do, make sure first and foremost you protect the tobacco companies.''  They have made it very clear that they are concerned with protecting teenagers, concerned with protecting their children, concerned with getting back some of the costs that we in Vermont have spent on health care for those who have suffered from addiction to cigarettes.  But I ask, Mr. President, at the conclusion of my statement that I be allowed to put in the Record a letter from C. Everett Koop and David Kessler to Senator Gregg and myself dated May 20, 1998.
