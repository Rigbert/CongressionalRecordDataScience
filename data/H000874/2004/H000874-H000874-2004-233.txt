 Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I know the gentleman has been waiting with bated breath, and I know he checks every day to see the status of the budget, and I appreciate his concern for getting this budget to the floor. I wish I had more news than I did last week. There continues to be discussions between the two bodies, and I hope and expect to have a conference report ready for the House to consider sometime next week.
