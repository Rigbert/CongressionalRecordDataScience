President, this amendment offered by my friend from Iowa would significantly delay even the initial registration process for the 11 million undocumented individuals in the country.  We believe the pathway to citizenship has to be earned, but it also has to be attainable. This amendment would further delay a process that already would take at least 13 years.  Bringing these 11 million people out of the shadows is not only the right thing to do, it is the best thing to do. It keeps our country safe. We would know who is here. We could focus our resources on who poses a threat.  This amendment is also unnecessary. We have been pouring billions of dollars into border security in recent years. We have made enormous progress since the last immigration bills in 2006 and 2007, and this bill takes even more steps.  As I said yesterday on the floor, I am going to have to oppose this amendment.  I yield the floor.
