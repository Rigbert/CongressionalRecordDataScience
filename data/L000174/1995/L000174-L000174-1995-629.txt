President, I am, as I have said, going to speak again on the question of the balanced budget. I think that the speeches made by the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia and the distinguished senior Senator from New York are such that I hope a lot of people will listen to them.  Obviously, I myself am in great agreement. As I have stated, the Senate owes a thanks to both of them. But more than that, the United States owes thanks. This is a matter that should be debated.
