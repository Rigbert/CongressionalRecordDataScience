 The fact of the matter is that I think some people did something wrong. They should not have done it. There are over 1,000 employees who will be affected by this amendment. In this amendment, we say none of the employees of ATF, none of the money may be used to provide bonuses or any other merit-based salary increase for any employee of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.  Is there one person on this floor who can honestly say that one or two or three of the folks who work at BATF are not employees who are deserving of merit increases, of bonuses, of recognition for heroic action, just because there are some who do not act in the manner that we would want, or because the agency for which they work has a mission with which some of us or maybe many of us do not agree?  Ladies and gentlemen of this House, this is an ax where a scalpel may be needed. Let us think about what we are doing. If you want to do away with ATF, you have that opportunity. That is the way it should be done, not to say to the employees who work at ATF, at our request, the overwhelming majority of whom are trying to do the best job they know how, that none of the funds in this bill can be used to give them a merit increase or a bonus for heroic behavior or any other behavior.  Ladies and gentlemen of this House, as I said earlier, we have significant and strong differences of opinion, but that does not mean we need to act irrationally. I frankly was opposed to the last amendment because I thought the message that the sponsors wanted to send about the bailout of Mexico was affected by an amendment which may affect many, many nations and may affect the stabilization of our dollar and of other currencies. Another meat ax approach to important, serious issues.  I ask the House to reject this amendment. In voting to reject this amendment, not to in any way be interpreted as sanctioning bad activity at ATF or adopting the premise that ATF is an agency that you want to support, but an action that says, ``I am a responsible Member of the House, of 435 people, who is going to support or oppose amendments or proposals based upon their merit and their impact and their accomplishment of objectives that I support.''                              {time}  1815  I ask every Member of this House to reject this amendment.
