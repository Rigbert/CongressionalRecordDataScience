 A crisis that impacts the readiness of our Army today and in the future. It was my hope that we would have a plan early this year. Nine months later, I am still waiting for a comprehensive plan from the Army and I see no evidence that the new budget addresses this problem.  I ask the distinguished Chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, who I know has long supported adequate funding for our National Guard units, to seriously consider the problem this amendment was intended to address. Twenty new Blackhawks this year is only the tip of the iceberg, but I believe we have a genuine crisis on our hands. It was an emergency nine months ago and it has only gotten worse today. Certainly, that is true in the state of Delaware and I have heard nothing from the Army to make me think that the same is not true in aviation units throughout the nation.  If, as I understand to be the case, the distinguished managers of this bill believe that this funding cannot be designated as emergency funding, then I hope that they will pledge to adequately address this issue within the fiscal year 2002 defense budget. I cannot go home to Delaware and tell them that we are aware of this crisis, have been for almost a year, and yet did nothing and have no plans to do anything. This problem must be addressed this year.
