President, about two months ago, Senator Abraham and I began holding a series of meetings involving industry and consumer representatives to work out a bill that would permit and encourage the continued expansion of electronic commerce, and promote public confidence in its integrity and reliability. Together, we solicited and received technical assistance from the Department of Commerce and the Federal Trade Commission. In late September, we put the finishing touches on a Leahy-Abraham substitute to S. 761.  On Tuesday night, after most members had left for the day, Senator Abraham went to the floor and propounded a unanimous consent on a very different substitute to S. 761. Because I was not able to respond fully to his comments the other night, I would like to do so now.  At the outset, let me say that I support the passage of federal legislation in this area. In particular, we need to ensure that contracts are not denied validity that they otherwise have simply because they are in electronic form or signed electronically.  As I have said many times, however, we must tread cautiously when legislating in cyberspace. Senator Abraham's bill, S. 761, takes a sweeping approach, preempting countless laws and regulations, federal and state, that require contracts, records and signatures to be in traditional written form. My concern is that such a sweeping approach would radically undermine laws that are currently in place to protect consumers.  We are told that S. 761 will have tremendous benefits for ``the public.'' Who exactly is ``the public'' that will benefit from this legislation? Not consumers. The bill is strongly opposed by consumer organizations across the country.  Supporters of this bill say that consumers will benefit from S. 761 because it will permit them to contract electronically for goods and services, and to obtain electronic records of their transactions. I agree that consumers should be able to contract online, but that is not the issue. Consumers already can contract for most things online, as anyone who has heard of such businesses as ``amazon.com'' and ``ebay.com'' knows. The issue here is whether we are going to allow public interest protections now applicable to private paper transactions to be circumvented simply by conducting the same transaction electronically.  Let me tell you about an incident that occurred in my office just this week. An industry lobbyist called to ask for a copy of my recent floor statement regarding this legislation. We sent him a copy as an attachment to an e-mail. An hour later, the same lobbyist called back to say that he had received the e-mail, but could not read the attachment. So we e-mailed it to him again, this time using a different word processing format. The lobbyist called back a third time to say that he still could not read the statement, and would we please fax a copy to his office, which we did. This sort of thing happens every day in offices and homes across the country.  It was only after we sent the fax that it occurred to me that under this bill, the unfortunate caller would have been deemed to have received written notice of my floor statement, in duplicate no less, before it ever reached him in a form he could read. No great loss in the case of my floor statement, but swap a bank and a homeowner for the Senator and the lobbyist in this story, and a foreclosure notice for the floor statement, and you can begin to see the harm this legislation could cause to ordinary Americans on a regular basis.  Many fine and responsible companies have called my office over the last few months, to express support for one or another version of S. 761. I have no doubt that they and a great many other American businesses that respect and value their customers would benefit from federal e-commerce legislation and share the benefits with their consumers.  We must not forget, however, that the purpose of consumer protection legislation is not so much to reinforce the good business practices of the best businesses in our society, but rather to protect consumers from the abusive and fraudulent minority of businesses that will take any opportunity to use new technologies to prey on consumers. That is why we must keep the interests of consumers in mind. While I do not question in any way the good intentions of the industry representatives who support this bill, they do not have the duty that we in Congress do to represent the broader public interest.  In urging speedy passage of S. 761, Senator Abraham pointed to ``the fact'' that it passed the Commerce Committee unanimously, and ``the fact'' that the President endorsed it. The fact is, the bill that Senator Abraham asked us to pass earlier this week is not the same bill that the Commerce Committee reported in June.  For one thing, it includes a new and complex provision regarding what it calls ``transferable records,'' that has never been considered by any Committee of the House or Senate. The bill also contains a host of other new provisions and amendments, including provisions and amendments relating to agreements, admissibility of evidence, record retention, and checks.  Furthermore, this bill is far less respectful of the states than the Commerce-passed bill, which was itself unprecedentedly preemptive. This legislation should be an interim measure to ensure the validity of electronic agreements entered into before the states have a chance to enact the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act. Once the UETA is adopted by a state, the federal rule is unnecessary and should ``sunset.''  Unlike the Commerce-passed bill, the new S. 761 would maintain a strong federal hand in the commercial law of electronic signatures and electronic records within a state even after it adopts the UETA. This is true because the bill would lift its preemptive effect only to the extent that a state's UETA is consistent with the provisions of S. 761. The reformulation can have only one possible objective, which is to prevent states like Vermont or California or even Michigan from passing e-commerce legislation that is more protective of consumers than federal law.  That is why the bill is so strongly opposed by the States. The National Conference of State Legislatures writes that the latest version of S. 761 ``would eviscerate consumer protections which consumers now enjoy off-line and mandate how states are to transact business.'' The New Jersey Law Revision Commission, an agency of the New Jersey Legislature, writes that it ``vigorously opposes'' S. 761, calling it ``an unwarranted imposition on State law'' that ``would create more problems than it would solve.'' Other representatives of the States have expressed similar concerns.  To summarize, the Commerce Committee did not unanimously report this bill, nor did the Administration endorse it. Indeed, I doubt that anyone in the Administration set eyes on this bill before Monday, when it was filed as a substitute to S. 761.  Moreover, the Administration does not currently endorse even the more modest bill reported by the Commerce Committee. In a recent letter to the House Judiciary Committee regarding title I of H.R. 1714, which substantially resembles S. 761, the General Counsel of the Commerce Department noted that, at the time S. 761 was reported, the spillover effect of its provisions on electronic contracts on existing consumer protection and regulatory standards had not been identified. He concluded:       Now that this effect has become clear, and it is equally      clear that enactment of this measure is desired by some      precisely because of this spillover effect, we [i.e., the      Administration] must oppose these provisions as currently      drafted.  The same letter states:       Consumer protection is [an] important area where the public      interest has been found to require government oversight.      States, as well as the Federal government, must not be      shackled in their ability to provide safeguards in this area.      Yet this is precisely what this legislation would do.  The recently-filed substitute version of S. 761 would do the same.  I was surprised to hear Senator Abraham say that his efforts to negotiate with those of us who had concerns about the bill had been ``unsuccessful.'' As I have already discussed, those negotiations were very successful. They produced a truly bipartisan bill that promoted e-commerce for the benefit of all Americans and not just special interests. It took many weeks of hard work to achieve that result.  I urge my colleagues to oppose the substitute for S. 761.  I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from Federal Trade Commission to my office dated September 3, 1999, and a letter from the Commerce Department to Representative Hyde dated October 12, 1999.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                         United States of America,                                     Federal Trade Commission,                                Washington, DC, September 3, 1999.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: In response to your request, I am      pleased to submit the views of the Federal Trade Commission      on S. 761, the ``Third Millennium Digital Commerce Act,''      which was reported by the Commerce Committee on June 23,      1999. You have asked, in particular, whether the bill could      undermine consumer protections in state and federal law, and      how the bill might be improved.       We share the broad goals of S. 761, which are to promote      the development of electronic commerce through the expanded      use of electronic signatures and electronic agreements. As      with other aspects of electronic commerce, these technologies      hold possibility of reducing costs and expanding      opportunities for consumers. Although the bill appears      primarily focused on removing barriers to electronic commerce      in business-to-business transactions, we have begun analyzing      the possible impact of the bill on business-to-consumer      transactions.       The bill's potential application to consumer transactions      raises questions that should be addressed. For instance,      would the bill preempt numerous state consumer protection      laws? Would borrowers be bound by a contract requiring that      they receive delinquency or foreclosure notices by electronic      mail, even if they did not own a computer? Would consumers      who had agreed to receive electronic communications be      entitled to revert to paper communications if their computer      breaks or becomes obsolete? Would consumers disputing an      electronic signature have to hire an encryption expert to      rebut a claim that they had ``signed'' an agreement when, in      fact, they had not? What evidentiary value would an      electronic agreement have if it could be easily altered      electronically? It may be that with some clarification, these      questions can easily be addressed.       We would be pleased to work with the Congress, industry and      consumer representatives to craft provisions that would      provide protections for consumers while allowing business-to-     business commerce to proceed unimpeded.       By direction of the Commission.                                                C. Landis Plummer,     Acting Secretary.                                  ____                                            General Counsel of the                                  U.S. Department of Commerce,                                 Washington, DC, October 12, 1999.     Hon. Henry J. Hyde,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, House of          Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: This is to convey the views of the      Administration regarding Title I of H.R. 1714, the      ``Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce      Act,'' as reported by your Subcommittee on Courts and      Intellectual Property (``Subcommittee'').       We support the overall goal of H.R. 1714 of promoting a      predictable, minimalist legal environment for electronic      commerce, including the encouragement of prompt state      adoption of uniform legislation assuring the legal      effectiveness of electronic transactions and signatures. We      also appreciate the desire and the work of the Subcommittee      on Courts and Intellectual Property to put forward a bill      that addresses the concerns of the Administration as      explained in Commerce and Justice Department testimony before      that Subcommittee.       In particular, we note that section 103 of the reported      bill, titled ``Interstate Contract Certainty,'' is directed      to ``any commercial transaction affecting interstate      commerce'' and that ``transaction'' is defined to exclude      activity involving federal or State governments as parties.      We endorse these features of the bill, which make the scope      of the legislation broad enough to encompass most day-to-day      commercial electronic transactions without interfering with      the orderly adoption by governments of electronic means for      transacting their public business.     We also are pleased that the reported bill omits any      provision for federal agency initiatives to enjoin state laws      not conforming to the requirements of this statute.       We continue to support strongly the principles for the use      of electronic signatures in international transactions set      out in section 102. These are fully consistent with the      principles we have been actively promoting internationally      since July, 1997, when President Clinton and Vice President      Gore issued the Framework for Global Electronic Commerce      charging our Department to ``work with the private sector,      state and local governments, and foreign governments to      support the development, both domestically and      internationally, of a uniform commercial legal framework that      recognizes, facilitates, and enforces electronic transactions      worldwide.''       We nevertheless believe that the bill, as reported, would      still preempt state law unnecessarily, both in degree and      duration; invalidate numerous state and federal laws and      regulations designed to protect consumers and the general      public; and otherwise create legal uncertainty where      predictability is the goal. We therefore must strongly oppose      the measure in its current form.       To begin with, we do not understand why it is necessary to      override existing federal laws governing commercial      transactions. The purpose of this legislation has always been      explained as the elimination of antiquated requirements for      physical contracts and pen-and-ink signatures. Because those      legal principles are embodied in state law, it is      understandable that some limited preemption of state law is      necessary to accomplish that goal pending the States'      adoption of the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA).      The federal rules applicable to these transactions are      grounded in regulatory obligations, not basic contract law      principles. We do not believe it is appropriate to sweep away      these requirements on an across-the-board basis. to the      extent that federal regulatory rules need updating to address      the new reality of electronic transactions, this should be      done on a case-by-case basis, to ensure that the public      policy concerns that underlie the existing measures are fully      addressed in the electronic world. Accordingly, we believe      only state law standards should be affected by federal      legislation in this area.       Section 103 of H.R. 1714 as reported to your Committee      continues to place significant, and we believe inappropriate,      limits upon the States' ability to alter or supersede the      federal rule of law that the bill would impose. As I      indicated in my testimony before the Courts and Intellectual      Property Subcommittee, this legislation should be limited to      a temporary federal rule to ensure the validity of electronic      agreements entered into before the States have a chance to      enact the UETA. Once the UETA is adopted by a State, the      federal rule is unnecessary, and it should ``sunset.'' The      reported bill would maintain a strong federal hand in the      commercial law of electronic signatures and records within a      State even after it adopts the UETA. This is true because the      bill would lift its preemptive effect only to the extent that      the UETA ``as in effect in such State,'' or any other law of      the State, is ``not inconsistent, in any significant manner''      with the provisions of this Act.       The pervasiveness and strength of this continuing federal      influence over States' laws is shown by the broad and      unqualified wording of some of the substantive provisions of      section 103. For example, subsection 103(a)(3) provides: ``If      a law requires a record to be in writing, or provides      consequences if it is not, an electronic record satisfies the      law.'' Similarly, subsection (a)(4) provides that wherever a      law ``requires a signature, or provides consequences in the      absence of a signature, the law is satisfied with respect to      an electronic record if the electronic record includes an      electronic signature,'' and subsection (a)(5) provides highly      specific requirements for ensuring that a legal record-     retention requirement will be satisfied by an electronic      record. With such provisions in section 103, the bill's      continuing preemption of all State laws which are ``not      inconsistent in any significant manner'' with the provisions      of this Act would perpetuate federal law as the core of the      commercial law of electronic signatures and records in every      state. As emphasized in our Department's testimony before the      Subcommittee, deference to state law in the area of      commercial transactions has been the hallmark of the legal      system in this country. The reported bill remains      inconsistent with this important tradition which has      produced a system of commercial law widely considered the      best in the world.       Subsections 103(a) (3), (4) and (5), which I have just      mentioned, coupled with the broad party autonomy language of      section 103(b), would also place excessive limits on      governmental authority. In particular, these provisions would      appear to preclude virtually any regulation of private      parties' authentication of recordkeeping practices in the      sphere of electronic commerce, as is common and recognized as      appropriate with respect to paper-based transactions.* But      these regulations, including consumer protection laws, laws      governing financial transactions, and others, are essential      to ensure that the public interest is protected.---------------------------------------------------------------------------     * These provisions are similar to some contained in S. 761,      as reported by the Senate Commerce Committee. I expressed      support for that measure because it ensured that contracts      could not be invalidated because they were in electronic form      or because they were signed electronically. At the time the      bill was reported, the spillover effect of these provisions      on existing consumer protection and regulatory standards had      not been identified. Now that this effect has become clear,      and it is equally clear that enactment of this measure is      desired by some precisely because of this spillover effect,      we must oppose these provisions as currently drafted.---------------------------------------------------------------------------       For example, raising concerns similar to those noted in      this Department's testimony on H.R. 1714, Banking Committee      Chairman Leach recently wrote to Commerce Committee Chairman      Bliley noting that the federal financial regulatory agencies      have raised a concern about the language of the section of      H.R. 1714 (section 103(b) of the version before your      Committee) relating to the autonomy of parties to a contract      to set their own requirements with respect to electronic      records and signatures. Specifically, he noted the need to      ensure that the bill's party autonomy provisions would not      limit government authority to engage in limited regulation of      authentication- or records-related matters in certain private      party transactions in the public interest. We agree; for      example, given the unqualified authorization provided by      subsection 103(b) to private parties to determine the      ``methods'' as well as the ``terms and conditions'' under      which they will use and accept electronic signatures and      records, banks would be free to adopt methods that could      result in the absence of adequate records or sound      authentications of transactions when the bank examiner      arrives.       Chairman Leach also noted that the Federal Reserve Board      has raised concerns regarding the application of H.R. 1714 to      negotiable instruments, such as checks and notes. He pointed      out that the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform      State Laws recognized some of these concerns and therefore      excluded transactions covered by the Uniform Commercial Code      from coverage under UETA. We agree with the concerns raised      by Chairman Leach and believe that amendments or      clarifications along the lines he has suggested continue to      be needed in the context of H.R. 1714 as reported to your      Committee.       Consumer protection is another important area where the      public interest has been found to require government      oversight. States, as well as the Federal government, must      not be shackled in their ability to provide safeguards in      this area. Yet this is precisely what this legislation would      do.       Section 104, ``Study of Legal and Regulatory Barriers to      Electronic Commerce,'' is consistent with the      Administration's commitment to ensure the careful review of      possible legal and regulatory barriers to electronic      commerce. Indeed, this provision in the bill as reported      focuses upon barriers to electronic commerce, as such, rather      than more narrowly upon commerce in electronic signature      products and services. We believe this focus is appropriate.      However, to avoid duplication of agency reporting, we would      recommend against inclusion of the Office of Management and      Budget as an agency to receive initial agency reports under      the provision.       In summary, we believe that the bill as reported by the      Subcommittee addresses some important concerns of the      Administration that were set out in our earlier testimony.      However, H.R. 1714 in the form reported to your Committee      retains significant flaws that would have to be addressed      before the Administration could support the bill. We would be      pleased to continue to work with your Committee on this      important legislation.       The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is      no objection to the submission of this report from the      standpoint of the Administration's program.           Sincerely,     Andrew J. Pincus.                          ____________________
