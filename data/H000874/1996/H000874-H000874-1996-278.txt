Speaker, I would now like to yield to a gentleman who served with Elijah in the House of Delegates and then was his colleague as a member of the Maryland State senate, will now be again his colleague here in the House of the people, the distinguished Representative from the Fourth Congressional District of Maryland, Mr. Albert Wynn.
