President, I know the distinguished Senator from Utah would not want to leave a wrong impression about what has happened, so perhaps I might flesh out his remarks just a tad.  One, it should be noted that every single Democratic Senator wants to see a juvenile justice bill passed. The comments about pulling the bill down have all come from the Republican side of the aisle, not from the Democratic side of the aisle.  As far as working on this, I am not sure to what the Senator is referring. I don't know when I have spent so much time on the phone, the computer and e-mails, and on a bill as I have this past weekend. Our staffs have worked late into the night. We were given a wish list from the Republican staff, as was appropriately done at the beginning of the weekend. We worked on that all weekend long, calling Senators all over the country on it. As of last night, we had cleared 40 amendments. That is progress. That is very significant progress.  Now, the distinguished Senator from Utah said on the talk shows this weekend that they need seven amendments on the Republican side. Four were introduced yesterday, but this morning there are suddenly 10. We have kind of floating numbers here. But the facts are such that we have been working and we have cleared a very large number of amendments that Senators never have to see.  The last crime bill took 12 days. There were 99 amendments. We walked through it, and we did it. I remember being on that committee of conference, and the distinguished Senator from Utah may recall that we were there until 3, 4, 5 o'clock in the morning. These were complex issues, but we got it done. The crime rate has been coming down for 6 years--something that I have not seen under any other administration before--Republican or Democrat. So we can get somewhere on this.  We have significant issues in here. Every single Member on this side of the aisle is committed to seeing a juvenile justice bill passed. We want to go on to debate and vote on Y2K. The majority leader is correct in saying the supplemental has to be passed. We are not trying to delay it. I assure my friend from Utah that an enormous amount of work was done this weekend, and it was done until very late last night. I think my last e-mail on this came through to me at about 12:30, 12:45 this morning. We are getting it done.  Now, the distinguished Senator from North Carolina has been sitting here patiently and wishes to speak about a lifetime friend, a man who deserves a great deal of honor and praise by this Senate from both sides. I think we would do the Senate well and the memory of the great man well by both of us holding this debate until after the caucus. I thank the distinguished Senator from North Carolina for his courtesy, which was doubly helpful this morning because I know this is a difficult time for him.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
