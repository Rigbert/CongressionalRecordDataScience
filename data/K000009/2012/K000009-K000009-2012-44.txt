When Wall Street came in here, in a flash in a weekend, $700 billion walked out the door--a thousand times more than the gentlelady is asking for. And it would seem to me that with this point of order, there's never been a more critical time in our country to waive it in order to do the job of America.  I mentioned the Minneapolis bridge that collapsed. Well, I can tell you we have one in Cleveland that's ready to do the same. It's the same design.  What could be more important than investing in this country, creating jobs, and meeting these unmet national needs. In western Ohio, we have McCord Road, the site of a major Norfolk Southern mainline in Amtrak, and young people were killed there at grade. And now they delayed that project decades rather than doing the kind of grade crossing that's needed.  Mr. Chairman, you can talk about points of order, but the most important point of order is keep the Nation in order. And I think the most important way we can do that is to keep this transportation funding flowing, making our Nation more competitive, creating jobs, and leaving a legacy to the future better than we found it. So I strongly support the gentlelady's amendment and object to the point of order and ask, along with my colleagues, that it be waived.  The CHAIR. Does any other Member wish to speak on the point of order? If not, the Chair is prepared to rule.  The Chair finds that this amendment includes language imparting direction to the Secretary of Transportation. The amendment therefore constitutes legislation in violation of clause 2 of rule XXI. The point of order is sustained and the amendment is not in order.  The Clerk will read.  The Clerk read as follows:                          working capital fund       For necessary expenses for operating costs and capital      outlays of the Working Capital Fund, not to exceed      $174,128,000 shall be paid from appropriations made available      to the Department of Transportation: Provided, That such      services shall be provided on a competitive basis to entities      within the Department of Transportation: Provided further,      That the above limitation on operating expenses shall not      apply to non-DOT entities: Provided further, That no funds      appropriated in this Act to an agency of the Department shall      be transferred to the Working Capital Fund without majority      approval of the Working Capital Fund Steering Committee     and approval of the Secretary: Provided further, That no      assessments may be levied against any program, budget      activity, subactivity or project funded by this Act unless      notice of such assessments and the basis therefor are      presented to the House and Senate Committees on      Appropriations and are approved by such Committees.               minority business resource center program       For the cost of guaranteed loans, $418,000, as authorized      by 49 U.S.C. 332: Provided, That such costs, including the      cost of modifying such loans, shall be as defined in section      502 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974: Provided      further, That these funds are available to subsidize total      loan principal, any part of which is to be guaranteed, not to      exceed $21,955,000.

Amendment Offered by Mr. McClintock  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.  The Clerk read as follows:       Page 6, line 23, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced      to $0)''.       Page 150, line 9, after the dollar amount, insert      ``(increased by $114,000,000)''.  The CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes.  Mr. McCLINTOCK. If the House is to live up to the promises the Republican majority made to the American people to bring spending under control, some tough choices are going to have to be made. This amendment, however, is not one of them. This is about the easiest choice that the House could possibly make to put an end to the so-called ``Essential Air Service'' that lavishly subsidizes some of the least essential air services in the country.  This program shells out nearly $200 million a year, including $114 million of direct taxpayer subsidies, to support empty and near-empty flights from selected airports in tiny communities, most of which are just a few hours' drive from major airports. A reporter recently investigating this waste took one of these flights from Ely, Nevada, and was the only passenger on that flight. Our constituents paid $1.8 million for this air service that carried just 227 passengers during the entire year. Ely is a 3\1/2\-hour drive from Salt Lake City International Airport.  Thief River Falls, Minnesota, is considered an Essential Air Service airport, despite the fact that it's just a 1 hour and 9 minutes drive to Grand Forks International Airport in North Dakota. Hagerstown is just 75 miles from Baltimore, but subsidizing their air flights is considered an ``essential air service.''  Now it's true there are a few tiny communities in Alaska--like Kake's 700 hearty souls--that have no highway connections to hub airports, but they've got plenty of alternatives. In the case of Kake, Alaska, they enjoy year-round ferry service to Juneau. In addition, Alaska is well served by a thriving general aviation market and the ubiquitous bush pilot.  Rural life has both great advantages and great disadvantages, but it is not the job of hardworking taxpayers who choose to live elsewhere to level out the differences.                              {time}  2040  Apologists for this wasteful spending tell us it is an important economic driver for these small towns--and I'm sure that's so. Whenever you give away money, the folks you're giving it to are always better off. But the folks you're taking it away from are always worse off to exactly the same extent. Indeed, it is economic drivers like this that have driven Greece's economy right off a cliff.  An airline so reckless with its funds as to manage its affairs in such a ludicrous way would quickly bankrupt itself. As we can plainly see, the same principle holds true for governments.  This was a temporary program set up when we deregulated commercial aviation during the Carter administration. It was supposed to last a few years to give rural communities a chance to adjust. That was 34 years ago.  In 2010, in one of the most decisive congressional elections in American history, voters entrusted the House to Republicans with a crystal clear mandate: Stop wasting our money.  Last year, the House responded to this mandate by voting to eliminate Essential Air Service subsidies in the FAA reauthorization bill. So what's the response of the House Appropriations Committee? They do not eliminate funding for this wasteful program. They do not reduce funding for it. No, they increase funding by 11 percent in a single year to a new historic high.  Mr. Chairman, our Nation is borrowing 40 cents of every dollar that it is spending. It has lost its AAA credit rating. Its taxpayers are exhausted. Its treasury is empty. Our children are staggering under a mountain of debt that will impoverish them for years to come, and yet the House Appropriations Committee, in defiance of last year's decision by the House to eliminate this program, has just voted a double-digit percentage increase for a program that flies near empty planes across the country.  I think we can do better than that. I offer instead this amendment to stop fleecing taxpayers for this expensive folly. I believe that House Republicans will ultimately prove themselves worthy of the trust the American people have given them in this perilous hour in our Nation's history. I believe that House Republicans can summon the fortitude to save our country from financial wreck and ruin. And I offer this amendment to put that day to a modest test.  I yield back the balance of my time.
