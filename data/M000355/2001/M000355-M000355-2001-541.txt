 He will be recognized at 3:15 to lay down the first amendment.  I conclude the opening comments by saying, as I said before, McCain-Feingold will not take money out of politics; it will take the parties out of politics.  Having said that at the beginning of 2 weeks of a wild ride, it will be easier to predict who will win the NCAA tournament than how the bill will come out after 2 weeks of amendments. I think there is one prediction I can make fairly confidently. I think there will be an effort, hopefully not supported by a majority but an effort to water down anything that might offend the AFL-CIO. I predict by the end of this debate there will be no paycheck protection, watered down restriction on coordination and issue advocacy as it applies to the AFL-CIO, and no disclosure of the union ground game. So it is about the only prediction I will confidently make, that before we are finished with this debate, the opposition to the AFL-CIO will have been taken care of by the watering down and massaging of language to the point where they sign off on it.  I hope that will not be the case because last year they spent considerably more on the election than either of the two political parties. I repeat, they spent more on the election last year than either one of the two great political parties.  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield?  Mr. McCONNELL. Let me finish my point and I will be happy to yield.  I hope by the time we get to the end of the debate, they will still think they are impacted. I yield to my friend from Arizona for a question.  Mr. McCAIN. I will bring it up at another time.  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I yield the floor.
