Speaker, reclaiming my time, and I thank the gentleman from California for those comments, but it is interesting because our submarine technology happened to end up in the hands of the former Soviet Union through a subsidiary of a company operating here and also in Europe. It does not matter if U.S. citizens are in those jobs; what matters is who owns the company. And beyond that, why should we be outsourcing anything from the Patent and Trademark Office?  I totally oppose this bill. At least I want on the record that there was one Member standing to say that the constitutional protections to America's patent holders and inventors should not be breached. It has been working. Why change it?                Announcement by the Speaker Pro Tempore
