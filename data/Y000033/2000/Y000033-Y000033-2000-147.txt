I want to compliment the gentleman because he has introduced a bill to do just that, to take into consideration all of the facets of energy, to take and decide how many Btus we need for the future of this Nation.  Right now that has not happened. In fact, the administration has closed down 34 refineries in the United States. The last refinery, built in 1980, was in Alaska. That is what has happened to us.  The gentleman's bill, and I believe I am a sponsor with the gentleman, it says to bring to light the need for nuclear power, hydropower, wind power, for conservation, for gas, and for oil, and to put it all together in a package so that my grandchildren will have the ability to have Btus available to them so they can live, yes, a better way. I believe that is crucially important.
