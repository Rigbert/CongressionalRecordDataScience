 As I am sure most people know, the gentleman and I agreed--I made a statement on the floor last night, and I made a statement immediately after--Israel, like any other nation in the world that is assaulted by a terrorist organization that wants its demise, wants to kill its people and push it from its country, any nation on Earth, including ours, would defend itself. That is what they did.  They gave 2 weeks' notice, of course, as the gentleman knows, to the Turks and to the individuals who were undertaking this so-called humanitarian mission.  And I might say that the gentleman and I share a humanitarian concern about the plight of the Palestinian people. Unfortunately, they are ill-served by some of those who have, by force, taken over their leadership in Gaza.  But Israel did what any nation would do. It gave notice and said, if you will deliver those to Ashdod, the port, we will offload the humanitarian material and make sure that it's delivered to its recipients, not to a terrorist organization that would use it for purposes of terror and attacks on civilians, but use it for the purposes of relieving those in some distress.  I would point out, as the gentleman well knows, international reports are that, in fact, there are sufficient food and medicine in Gaza today. It is my view that that mission, in effect, accomplished its objective, and its objective was to create confrontation and to put at risk the security of Israel and its people.  So that the answer to your question is that I have talked to Mr. Berman and I want to talk to you, as well, so that we can determine what is the best course of action for us to take.
