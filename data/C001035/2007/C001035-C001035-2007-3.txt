President, this morning WABI-AM radio in my home State of Maine dedicated the George Hale Studio in Bangor. I commend Clear Channel Communications for recognizing the many contributions George Hale has made to our State during his 54-year career in broadcasting, and I am honored to offer a few words in tribute to him.  George Hale is a true broadcasting legend. For more a half century, he has kept the people of Maine informed, he has entertained us, and he has brought us together as a community of friends and neighbors. He has brought the best of Maine into our homes, and he has always been a welcome guest.  Still going strong today, George Hale will forever be associated with the Bangor Auditorium and the great high school basketball tournaments held there, but that is just a start. University of Maine football, baseball, and basketball have all benefited from his great work, and he is beloved by generations of fans, coaches, and players. Whether describing victory or defeat, he always treats the athletes with respect and appreciation for their efforts.  Generations of Mainers have begun their day with George. Many used to begin their day by tuning in at 5:45 a.m. to hear his thoughts and comments on everything ranging from Red Sox to world affairs.  And the tradition continues today. Along with his friend and cohost Ric Tyler, George's show provides news and insight about the issues facing Maine and the Nation. As one who has appeared on his show many times, I can say that George always treats his guests with fairness and respect.  George was blessed with a great voice, and he has used it well as a powerful spokesman for great causes. His support for the March of Dimes, and especially his advocacy for the folic acid campaign, has greatly helped this outstanding organization carry out is vital mission of improving the health of babies by preventing birth defects and infant mortality. The March of Dimes and George Hale truly are a championship team.  WABI-AM radio is known as the Voice of Maine. It is a fitting name because George Hale truly is the Voice of Maine. He is a great friend to me and to all the people of my State. I know we all look forward to many more years of hearing that great voice from the George Hale Studio.                          ____________________
