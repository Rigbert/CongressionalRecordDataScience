 Res. 304       Whereas tens of millions of Americans have served in the      Armed Forces of the United States during the past century;       Whereas hundreds of thousands of Americans have given their      lives while serving in the Armed Forces during the past      century;       Whereas the contributions and sacrifices of the men and      women who served in the Armed Forces have been vital in      maintaining our freedoms and way of life;       Whereas the advent of the all-volunteer Armed Forces has      resulted in a sharp decline in the number of individuals and      families who have had any personal connection with the Armed      Forces;       Whereas this reduction in familiarity with the Armed Forces      has resulted in a marked decrease in the awareness by young      people of the nature and importance of the accomplishments of      those who have served in our Armed Forces, despite the      current educational efforts of the Department of Veterans      Affairs and the veterans service organizations; and       Whereas our system of civilian control of the Armed Forces      makes it essential that the country's future leaders      understand the history of military action and the      contributions and sacrifices of those who conduct such      actions: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--       (1) the Secretary of Education should work with the      Secretary of Veterans Affairs, the Veterans Day National      Committee, and the veterans service organizations to      encourage, prepare, and disseminate educational materials and      activities for elementary and secondary school students aimed      at increasing awareness of the contributions of veterans to      the prosperity and freedoms enjoyed by United States      citizens;       (2) the week that includes Veterans Day be designated as      ``National Veterans Awareness Week'' for the purpose of      presenting such materials and activities; and       (3) the President should issue a proclamation calling on      the people of the United States to observe such week with      appropriate educational activities.
