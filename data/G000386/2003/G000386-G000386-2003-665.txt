 President, last night the President addressed the Nation to announce that coalition forces were in the early stages of military operations to disarm Iraq, to free its people, and to defend the world from grave danger.  This action was taken as a last resort against an evil dictator, Saddam Hussein, who for 12 years has continued to defy and evade his commitments and responsibilities set out for him by 17 United Nations Security Council resolutions.  I believe Saddam Hussein must be disarmed, and for this reason I supported the resolution authorizing the President to take military action if diplomatic efforts were unsuccessful.  And, while some Members of this body did not support the authorization for the use of force back in October, I am confident that we here, Republicans and Democrats, stand united in our support for our uniformed personnel now in harm's way.  During the past few weeks and months, I have seen and heard communities all across my State send off, with tearful eyes, their sons and daughters, husbands and wives, and moms and dads who have been called to serve.  These brave men and women, from Decorah to Muscatine, Red Oak, to Mason City, Pocahontas to Davenport, stood proud while high school bands played the ``Star Spangled Banner,'' and local religious leaders prayed for their safe return.  Over 3,700 Reserve and National Guard troops in Iowa have been called up for active duty. They come from all professions and all economic backgrounds.  I commend them, and all those serving in the U.S. Armed Forces, for their courage, bravery and patriotism. I am grateful for the enormous sacrifice made by these men and women and their families. I could not be more honored by their commitment to freedom, and I will continue to pray for their quick and safe return home to their loved ones.                          ____________________
