I was asked several years ago: Of all the Senators with whom you serve, can you name one you look up to time and again? At the time, I said it was Paul Sarbanes of Maryland. I liked Paul so much and respected him so much. He made such a contribution, not just for his State of Maryland but for the Nation during his time of public service.  My good fortune was not only to get to know Paul but also to meet and get to know his wife Christine. What an extraordinary woman. She was a gifted, thoughtful, articulate person whose background and interest was in the classics. She would lose me in a hurry when we got into a conversation, as we did once or twice, about her area of interest.  I can recall traveling once from London Heathrow back to the United States, picking up a book along the way that was titled ``Rubicon,'' a story on the Roman Empire. I sent it to her, as if she needed my advice or background in that subject. She wrote me the nicest note afterwards thanking me for it.  She was a real lady and a great complement to Paul. The two of them worked so well together representing the State of Maryland and showing what a couple could do together working in public service.  I was so saddened to learn yesterday that Christine passed away. She was such a fine person. I wanted to add my voice on the Senate floor in sympathy for the Sarbanes family and so many people across the State of Maryland who came to know and respect her over the years.                          ____________________
