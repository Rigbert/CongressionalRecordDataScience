Chairman, I am sympathetic to the gentleman's concerns, particularly because my home State of California probably has more than its fair share of endangered species problem.  The Endangered Species Act hinges upon the principle that, if a species is listed, that it will be recovered and management will return to the States. This push by the States is the reality we see playing out. Bats, wolves, greater sage-grouse, delta smelt, the list goes on and on and on.  It should come as no surprise, then, to see the States pushing back through their elected Representatives in the legislative branch in an effort to bring the Endangered Species Act back into balance.  I would support this amendment.
