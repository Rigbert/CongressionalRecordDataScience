Riverside has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Dr. Susan Rainey is one of these individuals. On July 31, 2008, Dr. Rainey will end a decade of service to the students and families of the Riverside Unified School District, and her retirement will also mark the end of a 40-year career in education. On July 23, 2008, a dinner will be held in Dr. Rainey's honor.  Dr. Rainey has been with the Riverside Unified School District (RUSD) since July 1998 and led the District through many challenges and achievements. Under her leadership, RUSD schools have consistently achieved academic gains. RUSD has built nine new schools and modernized many others. Two of the schools have been named No Child Left Behind National Blue Ribbon Schools and 23 schools have earned the California Distinguished School Award. Individually, many students have excelled in sports, academics, and the arts. Under Dr. Rainey's leadership, each student has been afforded every opportunity for success through such programs as the Advancement Via Individual Determination (AVID) program.  Prior to joining RUSD, Dr. Rainey worked for the Yucaipa, Palo Alto, Redlands, Monrovia, Brea-Olinda, Hemet and Charter Oak school districts. She also has been involved in numerous professional and community organizations including: the Rotary Club of Riverside; American Heart Association; Association of California School Administrators; California City School Superintendents; Riverside Association of School Managers; California Association of large Suburban School Districts; andthe United Way. Dr. Rainey also serves as a docent at the Mission Inn in Riverside.  The success of the Riverside Unified School District can be attributed to the strong and inspiring leadership of retiring District Superintendent Dr. Susan Rainey. RUSD has produced National History Day and California State Science Fair, Envirothon, and Mock Trial winners, innumerable California Interscholastic Federation champions and world class artists and musicians. RUSD is home to several Riverside County principals and teachers of the year who have set a standard of excellence for others to follow.  Dr. Rainey's tireless passion for education has contributed immensely to the betterment of the community of Riverside, California. I am proud to call Dr. Rainey a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members, teachers, administrators and students are grateful for her service and salute her as she retires.                          ____________________
