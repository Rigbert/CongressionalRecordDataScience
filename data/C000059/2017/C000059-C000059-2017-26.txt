Chair, last year, May of 2016, in the previous administration, the Department of the Interior issued a finding of no significant impact with respect to these operations; thus followed a review of 23 oil and gas platforms currently operating offshore in the State of California. The review drew upon the best available science and reaffirms that these operations are operating safely, as they should.  This amendment is nothing more than another attempt to restrict offshore development, and I oppose the amendment and encourage my colleagues to vote ``no.''  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
