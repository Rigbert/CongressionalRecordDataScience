 President, the leader would like me to inform all of our colleagues that there will be a period for morning business for 2\1/2\ hours to accommodate a number of requests by Members. It is hoped that during tomorrow's session, the omnibus appropriations conference report will become available. Senators should therefore be aware rollcall votes are possible during Friday's session. The Senate may also be asked to turn to any other legislative or executive items for action.                          ____________________
