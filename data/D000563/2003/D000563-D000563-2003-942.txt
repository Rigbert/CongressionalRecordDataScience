I think it is a good point to be made. These true deficits are at the expense of the Social Security trust fund. In the closing years of the Clinton administration, surpluses that we generated were paying off the debt of the Social Security trust fund, making it a stronger program for years to come, as baby boomers will arrive and ask for benefits.  Now, in the Bush administration, with tax cuts for the wealthiest people in America, we are raiding the Social Security trust fund and weakening it at a time when we know we need it the most.
