 President, I rise to make a very brief statement and ask for a speech to be printed in the Record. I attended the National Veterans of Foreign Wars Convention and heard a speech delivered by one of our colleagues that I think is one of the finest speeches I have ever heard any of our colleagues deliver, although it was not on the Senate floor. It was delivered before several thousand veterans of foreign wars.  It was delivered by our colleague, John McCain, from the State of Arizona, in response to being the recipient of Legislator of the Year, picked by the veterans, the VFW.  I strongly commend it to my colleagues, because it is the most articulate statement I have ever heard, and I believe one of the most articulate they will ever read, about what it means to serve one's country.  I will say now what I said to John McCain after he delivered that speech, after listening to him: That is the John McCain that I knew 20 years ago. I am glad to see it is still the same John McCain.  I ask unanimous consent that the address by our colleague, Senator John McCain, at the National Veterans of Foreign Wars Convention, March 7, 1995, be printed in the Record at this point.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Address by Senator John McCain, Before the Veterans of Foreign Wars,                              March 7, 1995       Thank you. I fear I cannot adequately express my deep      gratitude for the great honor you have done me by giving me      this award. As often as we are the targets of public abuse,      politicians also often find we are the recipients of      undeserved acclaim. After a while, one learns to keep both      scorn and praise in perspective. They come with the job.       Tonight is different. I am deeply moved to be recognized      for some small service by you who have distinguished      yourselves by your service to our country in war. For most of      us, it has been many years since we wore the uniform. But it      is still the opinion of those who wore the uniform that      matters most to us. I want to thank you very much for      choosing me to receive the VFW's Congressional Award. It is      an honor I will long cherish.       I will also long remember the honor the people of Arizona      have bestowed upon me by trusting me to represent their      interests in Congress. I believe they would understand,      however, when I say that I once knew a greater honor. It is      an honor I share with all of you, an honor we learned about      in America, but experienced in someone else's country. It is      the great honor of knowing your duty and ransoming your life      to its accomplishment.       I was blessed to have been born into a family who made      their living at sea in defense of their country's cause. My      grandfather was a naval aviator; my father a submariner. They      were my first heroes, and their respect for me has been the      most lasting ambition of my life. It was nearly pre-ordained      that I would someday find a place in my family's profession,      and that my fate would carry me to war.       Such was not the case for most of you. Your ambitions did      not lead you to war; the honors you first sought were not      kept hidden on battlefields. Most of you were citizen-     soldiers. You answered the call when it came; took up arms      for your country's sake; and fought to the limit of your      ability because you believed your country's welfare was as      much your responsibility as it was the professional      soldier's.       I did what I had been prepared for most of my life to do.      You did what I did but without the advantages of training and      experience that I possessed. You were kids when you saw      combat. I was thirty years old. I believe you outranked me.       I do not mean to dismiss the virtues of the professional      soldier. I consider my inclusion in their ranks to be the      great honor of my life. The Navy was and yet remains the      world I know best and love most. The Navy took me to war.       Unless you are a veteran you might find it odd that I would      be indebted to the Navy for sending me to war. You might      mistakenly conclude that the secret veterans' share is that      they enjoyed war.       We do share a secret, but it is not a romantic remembrance      of war. War is awful. When nations seek to resolve their      differences by force of arms, a million tragedies ensue.      Nothing, not the valor with which it is fought nor the      nobility of the cause it serves, can glorify war. War is      wretched beyond description. Whatever gains are secured by      war, it is loss that the veteran remembers. Only a fool or a      fraud sentimentalizes the cruel and merciless reality of war.       Neither do we share a nostalgia for the exhilaration of      combat. That exhilaration, after all, is really the sensation      of choking back fear. I think we are all proud to have once      overcome the paralysis of terror. But few of us are so      removed from the memory of that terror to mistake it today      for a welcome thrill.       What we share is something harder to explain. It is in part      a pride for having sacrificed together for a cause greater      than our individual pursuits; pride for having your courage      and honor tested and affirmed in a fearsome moment of      history; pride for having replaced comfort and security with      misery and deprivation and not been broken by the experience.       We also share--and this is harder to explain--the      survivors' humility. That's a provocative statement, I know,      and the non-veteran may easily mistake its meaning. I am not      talking about shame. I know of no shame in surviving combat.      But every combat veteran remembers those comrades whose      sacrifice was eternal. Their loss taught us everything about      tragedy and everything about duty.       I suspect that at one time or another almost everyone in      this room has been called a hero for having done their duty.      It is at that moment that we feel most keenly the memory of      our comrades who did not return with us to the country we      love so dearly. I cannot help but wince a little when heroism      is ascribed to me. For I once watched men pay a much higher      price for that honor than was asked of me.       I am grateful, as we all are, to have come home alive. I      prayed daily for deliverance from war. No one of my      acquaintance ever chose death over homecoming. But I      witnessed some men choose death over dishonor. The memory of      them, of what they bore for country and honor helped me to      see the virtue in my own humility.       It is in that humility--and only in that humility--that the      memory of almost all human experiences--love and hate, loss      and redemption, joy and despair, suffering and release,      regret and gratitude--reside. In the end, that is the secret      that veterans share.       It is a surpassing irony that war, for all its unspeakable      horrors, provides the combatant with every conceivable human      experience. Experiences that usually take a lifetime to know      are all felt--and felt intensely--in one brief moment of      life. Anyone who loses a loved one knows what great loss      feels like. Anyone who gives life to a child knows what great      joy feels like. The veteran knows what great joy and great      loss feel like when they occur in the same moment, in the      same experience.       That is why when we are asked about our time at war, we      often offer the contradictory response that it was an      experience that, if given the choice, we would neither trade      nor repeat. The meaning behind that response is powerful, and      I fear that my own powers of expression have failed to      explain it clearly. But you know what I am talking about, and      in gratitude for the honor you have bestowed on me, I wanted      to this evening talk about things I more often leave      unexpressed.       Perhaps, I should talk about the veterans issues before the      104th Congress. But no doubt you have by this point in your      convention heard from both Congress and the Administration a      great many promises to protect and advance the interests of      American veterans. For my part, I would simply affirm that      the sacrifices borne by veterans deserve to be memoralized in      something more lasting than marble or bronze or in the      fleeting effect of a politician's speech. Your valor and your      devotion to duty have earned your country's abiding concern      for your well-being. I am, I assure you, committed to      honoring that debt.       I suspect you already knew that or you would not have      honored me with this award.      [[Page S4522]] And, as I said, I wanted to talk of other      things as well tonight, of the experiences we share and the      memory that holds us to one another.       Let me talk now of what you gave your country, the      contribution for which the nation is in your debt. It is more      than the battles you won. More than Iwo Jima or Midway or the      Battle of the Bulge. More than the Chosin Reservoir or      Inchon. More than flights over that most heavily defended      enemy capital, Hanoi. More than Khe San or the I Drang.       All these battles, all these grim tests of courage and      character have made a legend of the American fighting man's      devotion to duty in every community in America. And it is the      lesson of your courage that will help instruct those who will      defend our country tomorrow in their duty. For they will      seek to immortalize in their own devotion to duty your      valor and the long and noble history of a free people's      defense of their liberty. Their character will be derived      in part from their appreciation of your character.       You know, as well as I, that the world in which they      shoulder their responsibilities is an uncertain one. Our      familiarity with man's inhumanity to man assures us that      Americans will be asked someday to again bear sacrifices that      only the brave can endure. That burden will be their honor,      as it was once ours.       I have memories of that honor that caution me to this day      to be careful when asking such sacrifices of others. But I      fear that the day will come when my caution is overcome by      necessity.       Last June, the free world celebrated one of the greatest      battles in the long struggle against tyranny--the invasion of      Normandy. President Clinton, quite appropriately,      memorialized the occasion by recognizing the profound debt      the world owes to the veterans of D Day. In the President's      words: ``they saved the world.''       Our world, then and now, is indeed the consequence of their      suffering on killing grounds that were once and are again      quiet beaches in a peaceful corner of the free world. But the      memory of their sacrifice, and the memories of sacrifice that      are held by all of you, caution us always to never assume      that peace is the normal state of world affairs.       I have memories of a place so far removed from the comforts      of this blessed country that I have forgotten some of the      anguish it once brought me. But my happiness these last      twenty years has not let me forget the friends who did not      come home with me. The memory of them, of what they bore for      honor and country, causes me to look in every prospective      conflict for the shadow of Vietnam.       I do not let that shadow hold me in fear from my duty as I      have been given light to see that duty. Yet, it no longer      falls to me to bear arms in my country's defense. It falls to      our children, and our children's children. I pray that if the      time comes for them to answer a call to arms, the battle will      be necessary and the field well chosen. But that will not be      their responsibility. As it once was for us, their honor is      in their answer, not their summons.       I trust in their willingness and ability to answer the call      faithfully. I hold that trust in deference to memories of      brave men lost long ago. I hold that trust in deference to      you and the courage with which you came of age during a      moment of violence and terror. I know that the cause which      you defended will not suffer in our children's hands. They      are born into the same traditions, with the same values that      empowered us.       I know that on some fitting, distant occasion, young men      and women will be instructed in their duty by recalling our      children's and our grandchildren's example. And on a quiet      beach somewhere, many years from now, the liberated will      again gather to pay tribute to the liberators, look upon      their seasoned faces and say: they were warriors once and      very brave. You and I know how great an honor that is.       Thank you for this award. I will always try to remain      worthy of the honor. Good night and God bless you.                               ____________________
