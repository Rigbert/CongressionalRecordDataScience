Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time.  Mr. Speaker, human beings have a tendency to, unfortunately, respond to previous wrongs against them or slights that they have seen, real or imagined. October Surprise has been mentioned by the chairman of this proposed subcommittee every time I have heard him speak on this issue. I have spoken to him personally. He feels very deeply that October Surprise hearings were a mistake. He may have been right.  I stand before you disavowing the issue of money. I do not think that is what this is about. If in fact there was a legitimate purpose for this investigatory committee, an unusual creation within the committee itself, then the $990,000-some odd dedicated to that objective would be justified.  The fact of the matter is, however, as the gentleman from Connecticut has so ably pointed out, everybody knew what was happening. The outrage that I hear articulated is not justified by some surprise.  During the Bush administration, everybody knew, everybody knew, that the Iranians were trying to make hay out of what was happening in Bosnia. Everybody knew that the Iranians had sent people to Bosnia. It was in the newspapers, much less an intelligence report.
