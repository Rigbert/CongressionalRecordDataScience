President, recently the Associated Press wrote a great article about Stephen and Gwen Huneck and their Dog Mountain studio. I have seen this article reprinted throughout the country.  If one goes into my office in Washington, my office in Vermont, my home in Vermont, or my home here, one would see many pieces of Stephen's artwork. Both Marcelle and I are great fans of his.  One of the pleasures of living in a small State like ours is that we had the opportunity to get to know Stephen and Gwen and realize what real human beings they are. They are among our valued friends, and I want the Senate to have the opportunity to read this article as part of an insight into why we think so highly of them. I ask unanimous consent to have the article printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                            (By John Curran)       Degas had his ballerinas, Monet his water lilies. For      Stephen Huneck, inspiration comes on four legs--its teeth dug      into a stick, or tugging on a piece of rope, or playing on a      beach.       The eclectic Vermont folk artist, who started out whittling      wooden sculptures of dogs and now specializes in dog-themed      furniture, woodcut paintings and children's books, has carved      out a unique niche with his whimsical reproductions of      Labrador retrievers and other dogs.       And his Dog Mountain studio and dog chapel--on a      picturesque 175-acre hillside farm in rural northern      Vermont--have evolved into a kind of doggy Disneyland,      drawing animal lovers and their pets from all over, and some      to mourn.       To Huneck, dogs are more than man's best friend.       ``I really believe they're the great spirit's special gift      to mankind,'' said Huneck, 59. ``Dogs teach us more than we      teach them.''       But his first lessons were tough ones.       He was bitten by a German shepherd as a toddler, terrorized      by a St. Bernard on his newspaper route as a teenager and      left heartbroken once when his father bought a puppy for the      family--but took it back to the pound the next day.       ``Through it all, I just loved dogs,'' he said.       A longtime antique collector, the Sudbury, Mass. native      turned to art professionally in the early 1980s, using old-     fashioned chisels, saws and planes to hand carve his first      few canine creations. Much of the basswood, cherry, maple and      pine he works with comes from his farm.       His woodcuts--dogs with halos, dogs peaking out from under      bedcovers, dogs sniffing each other--brim with the      playfulness of a 6-week-old puppy. His sculptures and      furniture, meanwhile, range from his Angel Dog statues-- a      black lab with golden wings--to coffee tables with sculpted      dog likeness legs, from night tables with dog head handles to      rocking dogs.       Dog lovers fairly hound him for commissioned works. His      client list includes actress Sandra Bullock (a dog sculpture      wedding present for her husband), Dr. Phil McGraw of TV talk      show fame (a drawing of his dog) and U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy,      whose Washington, D.C., office is decorated with Huneck art.       ``I think, to describe his work to someone who has never      seen it, you simply say `You have to see it, I can't describe      it to give it the credit it deserves,''' said R. Scudder      Smith, publisher of Antiques and The Arts Weekly, in Newtown,      Conn. ``It is too full of fun, imagination and talent to put      into words.''       His books, including ``Sally Goes to the Beach,'' ``Sally      Goes to the Farm'' and the new ``Sally Gets a Job,'' feature      woodcut prints accompanied by simple, pithy captions that      celebrate man's unique relationship with dogs.       ``Like a dog, he has no inhibitions,'' said Rob Hunter,      gallery manager for Frog Hollow Vermont State Craft Center.      ``He goes all over the place with his work. He has tapped      into that playfulness you get with a dog.''       The dog chapel grew out of a bit of inspiration after his      1994 hospitalization with Adult Respiratory Distress      Syndrome, which nearly killed him. When he came out of it, he      says, he had a vision.       ``I kept thinking what a great thing it could be, for      people not only to mourn the loss of a dog but to celebrate      nature and their relationships with their dogs,'' he said.       Using wood harvested from his own property, Huneck modeled      the one-room chapel after 19th-century Vermont churches, with      vaulted ceilings, stained glass windows and wooden pews.       Built at a cost of ``several hundred thousand dollars'' and      completed in 2000, it has stained glass windows with images      of dogs pieced into them.       The wooden pew-style benches in the 30-by-22 foot main room      have one-dimension dog likenesses at either end that are so      realistic, Huneck says, that live dogs sniff their bottoms.       Outside, a sign welcomes all: ``Welcome all creeds, all      breeds. No dogmas allowed.''       ``I wanted the dogs to know this is their place,'' he says.       It's also a place for their owners--many of them still      grieving over their loss, years later.       The walls are covered in handwritten remembrances and      photographs left by owners. It's no accident: Paper and      pencils are stocked on a door near the entrance, next to the      statue of Artie the angel dog, a black Labrador with golden      wings.       ``We came with Webster, to remember Boris,'' reads one.      ``He passed this week. He was a good dog and we will miss      him. Webster will miss him too. But our visit today will help      us all. Thanks. Cambridge, Mass.''       Another: ``Roxie: you are the dog of my heart. You taught      me so much about life and love. Always, N.''       Another: ``In memory of Rebel, our beautiful greyhound, who      died when I was giving birth to my daughter, Kyra.''       ``I got this idea that I wanted people to be able to put up      pictures of their dogs and put up a short paragraph about      their dogs and that they could share that with other people      and that it would always be there,'' said Huneck. ``To my      great surprise, the place is almost completely, totally full      of photographs.       ``It brings tears to your eyes, or you could start      laughing. It's just incredible insight,'' he said.       Weddings and civil union ceremonies have been held in it,      although whenever someone makes such a request, Huneck and      his wife, Gwen, explain that the chapel has to remain open      for others while the ceremony is being held.       The chapel, which is unheated and never closes, is busy and      full of life in summer and fall, but quiet, empty and solemn      on most winter days.       ``It's just so unique,'' said Jennifer Goodman, 29, of      Boston, who made the three-hour drive to it last month,      accompanied by her boyfriend and her 7-year-old basset hound,      Beans.       ``My friends were like `You're going to Vermont? Are you      going to go skiing?' I'm like, `No, we're going to a dog      mountain,' and no one quite understands it. We literally just      got here, checked into a hotel.''       Twice a year, Huneck and his wife throw outdoor barbecues--     with food for everyone, two legs or four.       ``When dogs pull up in here, they may never have been here      before, but it's like they saw the `Disneyland' sign. They      just get so excited, so happy,'' he said.                          ____________________
