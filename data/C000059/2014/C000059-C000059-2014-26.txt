Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to the community are exceptional. Lake Elsinore has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Robert E. ``Bob'' Magee is one of these individuals. On January 25, 2014, Bob will be honored as the 2013 ``John Packman Award'' recipient at the Lake Elsinore Chamber of Commerce Installation and Awards Gala.  Each year, the Lake Elsinore Chamber of Commerce awards one individual the John Packman Award. This individual is selected based on the criteria that they have given the highest level of service to his or her community in the past year. After evaluating all that Bob has done for our community, it became clear how worthy he is of this honor.  Bob was born and raised in the thriving city of Sacramento, California, to Ed and Lynn Magee as one of four children. Bob went on to graduate high school after his family moved to the sunny Southern California city of San Diego and later attended San Diego State University (SDSU), where he earned his degree in Public Administration with an Emphasis in City Planning. Bob's thriving career began when he interned for Assemblyman Larry Stirling's 77th District Office and later with the Planning Department of the City of Santee during his years at SDSU. Following these experiences, Bob's passion for public service ignited. His first job out of college led him to follow this passion to Lake Elsinore, where hebegan to work with the city's Planning Department on a wide array of things, including reviewing development applications and supervising the city's Code Enforcement Program.  In 1995, Bob became the Director of Governmental Affairs for Recyc, Inc, where his experience eventually led him to become the Vice President of its parent Company, Gro West. His extensive work and specialization in Mining and Land Development, Heavy Equipment Rentals, and Wholesale Nurseries created an environment for tremendous growth within the region. In 2001, Bob expanded his experience in the field by accepting a position as Executive Officer for Forest Wood Fiber Products. His management style demonstrated through his roles in the business community led him to win a seat on the Lake Elsinore City Council in 2003. He would go on the win a second term in 2008, where he was selected by his colleagues to serve as the Lake Elsinore City Mayor, a position he has held four times.  It is hard to imagine that Bob would have any free time on his hands, yet has he always found time for his community. Bob was a Little League Baseball coach for virtually a decade during the 1990s, and prioritized public safety by organizing and instituting Neighborhood Watch groups throughout the area. He served as Vice Chairman of the County's Historical Commission, Chairman of the Lakeland Village Advisory Committee, Chairman of the Riverside County Transportation Commission (RCTC), and as Chairman of the RCTC's Budget Subcommittee. He is also a dedicated member of the Riverside County Solid Waste Advisory Task Force, the Lake Elsinore Redevelopment Committee, the State Route 91 Advisory Committee, the Wells Fargo Inland Empire Community Board, and the Riverside County Republican Central Committee.  For all that he has done, it is no surprise that Bob has been the recipient of numerous community awards including being named ``Citizen of the Year'' by the Lake Elsinore Chamber of Commerce in 2005, ``Distinguished Citizen of the Year'' by the Tahquitz District of the Boy Scouts of America in 2010, and being appointed to the State Board of Fire Services by then Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger.  In his spare time, Bob enjoys off-road racing, riding motorcycles, golf, tennis and walking his dog. He and his wife, Gina, live in Lake Elsinore where they enjoy cheering on their son, Richard, who is serving in the United States Army.  Considering all that Bob has done for Lake Elsinore, the Lake Elsinore Chamber of Commerce named him their 2013 John Packman Award recipient. Bob's tireless passion for service has contributed immensely to the betterment of our community. He has been the heart and soul of many organizations and events and I am proud to call him a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for his service and salute him as he receives this prestigious award.                          ____________________
