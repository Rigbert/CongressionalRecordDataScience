Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  The gentleman from Pennsylvania, after I spoke, talked about liberal extremists and the balanced budget. As one who has voted on numerous occasions for the balanced budget constitutional amendment, as one who voted for the Stenholm balanced budget that did not pass, and as one who voted for the coalition budget which would balance the budget in 7 years, faster than the budget offered by the other side, I do not believe that I fall in that category.  I say again, nothing that happens today will balance the budget, whether the President signs the continuing resolution or not. The fact of the matter is there would be no necessity for a continuing resolution if this House and the Senate had passed appropriation bills in a timely fashion. They cannot agree. They have not done that, and that is why we are here as we are.                          ____________________
