Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me.  I will not use the full time. I just wanted to say to my good friend from Virginia, the chairman of the authorizing committee, that the normal way, place the animal would be downed would be at the slaughterhouse anyway.  The point we are trying to make is do not put it in the food chain. That is the heart of the gentleman from New York's (Mr. Ackerman) amendment which he has not changed. So I just wanted to clarify that, and I also am concerned that at that slaughter facility that that diseased animal not contaminate the other animals. So there is a tremendous burden on that slaughterhouse, but the point of the gentleman from New York's (Mr. Ackerman) argument and amendment is do not put that sick animal in the food chain.  I support his amendment, and I thank the gentleman for offering it.
