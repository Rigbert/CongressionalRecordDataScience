Speaker, as all of us know, we have been considering for a number of years now the question of how we ensure that we have ethical conduct in this body, but more importantly, how we give confidence to the American people that we are handling their business in a fashion which they can trust and be proud of. It is a difficult effort.  We had scheduled for tomorrow a rule which would have established a process of access and oversight that many believe would be an improvement. The committee that was set up was chaired by Mr. Capuano, and Mr. Smith, Lamar Smith, was his ranking member or cochair.  Mr. Smith just an hour ago or so, or 2 hours ago, brought a new proposal, which we had not seen, to the Rules Committee. We have asked Mr. Capuano about that proposal. He has indicated that he wants an opportunity to review it because he had not seen it before.  In light of that, I have had discussions with the other side of the aisle with reference to a procedure in which we would not consider the rule that was proposed, the rules change that was proposed, tomorrow. We do expect to consider it soon, but not tomorrow.  Tomorrow, and I will be asking at the end of this for unanimous consent, I have discussed with Mr. Boehner and Mr. Blunt doing the seven suspension bills. There are eight suspension bills scheduled for today. One of them is the Andean bill, which I think is not of any controversy, the 10-month extension on that bill. I will be asking for unanimous consent, therefore, for tomorrow to be a suspension day.  This will give Mr. Capuano and Mr. Smith the opportunity to discuss a new proposal which has been put on the table just this afternoon, and they will discuss that.  I know that Mr. Boehner and Ms. Pelosi, the Speaker, have had discussions. I presume those discussions will continue.  So my expectation is tomorrow, after the unanimous consent, we will conclude this bill. We will then have no further business. We will have the Andean suspension bill. After the conclusion of the Andean suspension bill, we will have no further business for today that Members would be voting on. And then we would, tomorrow, consider the seven suspension bills, and my presumption is it will be a relatively early day tomorrow, Thursday.                          ____________________
