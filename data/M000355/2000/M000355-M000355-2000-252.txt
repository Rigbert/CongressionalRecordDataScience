 The Senator from Kentucky has 9 minutes remaining.  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I am not sure I will use the entire 9 minutes. I thank the Senator from Washington for his contribution to this debate once again, and also my friend from Utah, and remind everyone the last time we voted on the Hollings amendment, it only got 38 votes. Even the Washington Post, with whom I am seldom aligned on this subject, opposes the measure. Senator Feingold opposes the measure.
