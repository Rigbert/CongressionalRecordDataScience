 President, the Senate has had an opportunity this morning to hear from one of the most distinguished spiritual leaders in America. He happens to be an individual who lives in my hometown of Louisville, KY, the senior minister at Southeast Christian Church, Bob Russell, who ministers to literally thousands of individuals in Louisville, southern Indiana, and surrounding areas. He built his church over a number of decades from a small group of individuals who gathered in a basement-like structure to a mighty building, but the program there is much more than a building. The magic of his ministry and those who are associated with him has attracted an enormous number of people and has changed the lives, literally, of tens of thousands of people in that area of our country.  What a privilege it has been to have him with us this morning. The Senate has had a rare opportunity to hear from really one of the great ministers of America.                          ____________________
