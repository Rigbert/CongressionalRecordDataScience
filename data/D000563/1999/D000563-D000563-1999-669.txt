President, I thank the ranking Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee, Senator Frank Lautenberg, who has announced his retirement. He is headed for the last budget roundup. This is the second to the last stop. I have one more year with Frank Lautenberg as spokesman on that committee who has made an enormous contribution to the committee, his State, to this Nation, and certainly this budget deliberation. We are going to miss him. He has done a great job for America.  I have known for many years the chairman of this committee, Senator Domenici of New Mexico. When I was a member of the House Budget Committee, his reputation was well known. He has been a deficit hawk for as long as I have known him. I am sure he has some sense of relief today dealing with a budget that is in much better circumstances than it was a few years ago. That is due in no small measure to his contribution. Though I may disagree with him on this particular budget resolution, it does not diminish my respect for what he has done in this budget process in demanding honesty. I hope he will continue on that pursuit, and I hope we will share goals in the near future. I am looking forward to doing just that.
