President, Vermont environmental advocate James Ehlers has won the prestigious 2016 Zetterstrom Environmental Award, an honor presented annually by Green Mountain Power Company. I know James well from having worked for most of the last two decades to protect and restore Lake Champlain. I have often found myself as the focus of his unrelenting vision to achieve a ``swimmable, fishable, drinkable'' Lake Champlain, and I agree with that vision.  Since his earliest days with Lake Champlain International, LCI, James has made it his mission to restore Lake Champlain fisheries. In recent years, James has broadened his work and the mission of LCI to also address many known and suspected lake pollutants, to prevent the spread of invasive species, and to tackle many other issues affecting the our beloved Lake, which is also known as the jewel of New England.  Named for the famed osprey advocate, Meeri Zetterstrom, the GMP-Zetterstrom Environmental Award is presented annually to one person, business, group, or nonprofit to honor a significant contribution to Vermont's environment. It is accompanied by a $2,500 donation to the winner's environmental cause. For James, of course, that is the Lake Champlain ecosystem.  The hard work that makes this award so well-earned by Mr. Ehlers is detailed in an article published this month in The St. Albans Messenger.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the St. Albans Messenger, July 1, 2016]                     LCI's Ehlers Recognized by GMP       A man once called Lake Champlain's loudest advocate is      being honored for his tireless devotion to Vermont's most      important body of water. James Ehlers, executive director of      Lake Champlain International, was presented with the GMP-     Zetterstrom Environmental Award for his unwavering efforts to      protect and improve Lake Champlain. The award, named for      famed osprey advocate Meeri Zetterstrom, comes with $2,500 to      support LCI's work.       ``As with Meeri Zetterstrom, grit, a big voice, and a thick      skin are key elements of James' environmental advocacy,''      said Steve Costello, a Green Mountain Power vice president      who worked with Zetterstrom on osprey restoration, and      presented the award. ``Both made bettering the environment      their life's work, and neither was put off by tough      challenges. They got energized by tackling what others might      think was impossible.''       Zetterstrom, an elderly widow when she set out to restore      endangered ospreys to Vermont in the late '80s, was a feisty      visionary who took her fight to politicians, fishermen,      utility executives and community leaders to build support for      her effort. She exposed the danger of venturing too close to      osprey nests by shooting video and sending it to local TV      stations, educated schoolchildren, and ultimately inspired an      effort that resulted in ospreys' removal from Vermont's      endangered species list.       Like Zetterstrom, Ehlers has been an environmental advocate      for decades, and has led LCI since 1999. He took LCI--little      more than a Father's Day fishing derby--and turned it into a      broad lake-focused environmental group with tens of thousands      of supporters. The annual LCI derby has become one of the      leading fishing derbies in the nation, while LCI's focus has      grown to include lake-advocacy, education, cleanup and      restoration.       LCI operates Lake Champlain's first and only pollution-     prevention boat, removing waste from recreational boats to      reduce illegal dumping. Ehlers ensured continuation of the      state's lake trout and salmon restoration program by working      with the Vermont Governor's Office, the Great Lakes Fisheries      Commission, commissioner of the Department of Fish &      Wildlife, and Senator Patrick Leahy's office. Similarly, he      brought together landowners, lawmakers, scientists, and      public stakeholders to effect stronger Clean Water Act rules      for the benefit of Lake Champlain.       Ehlers has built a reputation as a tough, focused and      effective leader. In 2010, Sen. Leahy lauded Ehlers' efforts      following a federal appropriation to help the lake. He said,      ``Your work at Lake Champlain International has been      instrumental in securing the future of Lake Champlain. All of      us who enjoy its waters every year are very grateful for your      dedication. Many thanks for the work that you do.''       For his part, Ehlers said he is proud of his focus on lake      improvement and environmental advocacy, and honored to      receive the Zetterstrom Award, but more proud of all those      behind the scenes who don't get the credit they deserve for      making his work possible--the volunteers, members, staff, and      benefactors.       ``It's an honor to receive this award from Green Mountain      Power. And frankly, unexpected. I am just one member of a      team--a team deeply committed to truly sustainable      communities. We'll use the funds received to support our      important education programs at LCI and recruit more people      to the team necessary to effect real change, the transition      to an economy that protects water rather than the current one      predicated on its pollution. We have made gains in recent      years, but it's not enough. Lake Champlain is more than a      place to recreate. The lake sustains our cities with drinking      water and supports habitat essential to our state's unique      environment,'' Ehlers said. ``Meeri had a vision and saw it      to completion, and Vermont is better for it. Like Meeri and      so many others out there, we must continue the hard work      ahead to reverse the effects of centuries of pollution in      Lake Champlain. This will take time, but there are important      steps we can take now so that future generations will have      the benefit of this critical natural resource. As Cousteau      said many years ago, and it is as valid now as it was then,      there is     no disconnecting the life cycle from the water cycle. If I      can continue to remind people of this and motivate people to      act on it, both our natural resources and our most precious      resource, our children, will be better off. We are all at      least 60 percent water, after all.''       LCI is a federally recognized 501(c)(3) non-profit      organization actively involved in shaping the future of Lake      Champlain's water and fisheries health for the well-being of      the people who depend on it today and tomorrow. To protect,      restore, and revitalize Lake Champlain and its communities,      LCI educates, advocates, and motivates to ensure that Lake      Champlain is swimmable, drinkable, and fishable,      understanding that healthy water resources are essential for      a healthy economy and a healthy community.       The GMP-Zetterstrom Environmental Award, first presented in      2010 shortly after Zetterstrom's death, was created to honor      her legacy and recognize others who follow her example. Past      award recipients include Sally Laughlin, a leading wildlife      advocate and scientist whose work was instrumental in      restoring three species of endangered birds in Vermont;      Michael Smith, the founder of Rutland's Pine Hill Park;      Margaret Fowle, who leads Vermont's peregrine falcon      restoration program; the Lake Champlain Committee, which for      five decades has used science-based advocacy, education and      collaboration to protect and improve Lake Champlain; and      Kelly Stettner, who founded the Black River Action Team,      which protects the Black River in southeastern Vermont; and      Roy Pilcher, co-founder of Rutland County Audubon.                          ____________________
