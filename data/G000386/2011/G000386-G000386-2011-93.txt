 President, I intend to object to proceeding to the nomination of Norm Eisen to be Ambassador to the Czech Republic at the Department of State for the following reasons.  I object to the proceeding to the nomination because of Mr. Eisen's role in the firing of the inspector general of the Corporation for National and Community Service, CNCS, and his lack of candor about that matter when questioned by congressional investigators. The details of Mr. Eisen's role in the firing and his misrepresentations about that matter are detailed in the Joint Minority Staff Report of the House Committee on Government Reform and the Senate Finance Committee, dated November 20, 2009. I would also ask unanimous consent that a letter of January 12, 2011, sent by myself and Congressman Issa to Mr. Bauer, then counsel to the President, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                Congress of the United States,                                 Washington, DC, January 12, 2011.     Hon. Robert F. Bauer,     Counsel to the President, The White House, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Bauer: We write to express our objection to the      President's use of a recess appointment to install Norman L.      Eisen as U.S. Ambassador to the Czech Republic. As you know,      we objected to Mr. Eisen's nomination on the grounds that he      attempted to constructively remove the Inspector General (IG)      of the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS)      without the prior notice required by law and that he misled      Congressional investigators.       It is our concern that the President's decision to force      through such a nominee without the advice and consent of the      Senate signals a departure from his recent pledge to work      cooperatively with Congress.       The President announced Mr. Eisen's nomination on June 28,      2010. On September 27, 2010, Senator Grassley provided public      notice of his intention to object to the nomination. Senator      Grassley referred to ``Mr. Eisen's role in the firing of the      Inspector General of the Corporation for National and      Community Service and his lack of candor about that matter      when questioned by Congressional investigators.''       During that investigation, a bicameral group of      investigators learned Mr. Eisen personally delivered an      ultimatum to former CNCS IG Gerald Walpin demanding that he      resign or be terminated within one hour. At the time he      delivered the ultimatum, no notice had been provided to      Congress as is legally required by the Inspector General      Reform Act (IG Act). As you know, the IG Act requires the      President to communicate in writing the reasons for removal      of an IG to Congress not later than 30 days prior to taking      action.       During an interview on June 17, 2009, Mr. Eisen refused to      answer at least 12 direct questions. He did, however, assert      on that date that the CNCS Board of Directors unanimously      supported the removal of IG Walpin. He also asserted that the      White House conducted ``an extensive review'' in response to      concerns raised by the Board about 10 Walpin's fitness      following a May 20, 2009 CNCS Board meeting. According to Mr.      Eisen, his ``extensive review'' substantiated the Board's      concerns and informed the decision to remove IG Walpin.       Our investigation found that, contrary to Mr. Eisen's      assertions, the Board had not unanimously expressed a desire      to have Mr. Walpin removed prior to the decision. Moreover,      we could find no evidence that Mr. Eisen's ``extensive      review'' consisted of anything more than simply asking the      CNCS General Counsel to document the Chairman of the Board's      concerns about Mr. Walpin. Mr. Eisen did not interview the      CNCS Directors. He did not provide Mr. Walpin or anyone else      in the Office of Inspector General an opportunity to be      heard. He took action based on incomplete information      provided only by individuals who had adversarial      relationships with the IG.       Mr. Eisen has had several opportunities to address our      concerns and has yet to do so. He failed to be forthcoming      and responsive during his initial meeting with our staff on      June 17, 2009. He again demonstrated a lack of candor in      response to Questions for the Record following his nomination      hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on July      22, 2010.       In the interest of allowing Mr. Eisen to address our      concerns, we scheduled a meeting with our staff for December      16, 2010 at 11:30 A.M. At approximately 11:15 A.M., the White      House postponed the meeting until 2:15 P.M. At approximately      2:00 P.M., the meeting was canceled by the White House Office      of Legislative Affairs without further explanation. By      calling off a face-to-face meeting in favor of a recess      appointment, the White House sent the message that the      President is not interested in hearing the concerns of      Republican Members of Congress.       In short, Mr. Eisen took action on behalf of the President      that ran afoul of the IG Act and subsequently misled      Congressional investigators in lieu of conducting a fair,      thorough, and responsible investigation. Senate confirmation,      under the advice and consent clause, is one of the strongest      checks on executive power. Recess appointments are      meantatofill vacancies that arise during a long recess, not      to bypass the confirmation process. We are troubled by the      Administration's circumvention of that process, especially in      this instance. The vacancy arose on January 20, 2009, and yet      the President waited eighteen months before making an      appointment. Given that there had already been considerable      public controversy over Mr. Eisen's actions in this matter at      the time of his appointment, issues with his confirmation      should have been easily anticipated. For these reasons, we      believe that a recess appointment of Mr. Eisen to serve as a      United States Ambassador is particularly inappropriate.       Thank you for your attention to this important matter. We      look forward to working with the White House toward our      mutual goal of identifying and deploying qualified      individuals of the highest integrity to serve American      interests abroad.           Sincerely,     Darrell Issa,       Chairman, U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government      Reform.     Charles E. Grassley,       United States Senator.                          ____________________
