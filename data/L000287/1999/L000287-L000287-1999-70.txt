Mr. Speaker, one of the fundamental liberties of our country is freedom of religion. The right to exercise our religious beliefs free of government coercion. The Federal Government must not force a citizen to act against his or her religious beliefs.  Because of their strong religious convictions, some Americans do not pay their taxes. They do not pay their taxes because their religion forbids them from supporting war. Seventeen cents out of every tax dollar received by the Federal Government is spent on the military.  This military spending is inconsistent with the religious beliefs of hundreds and thousands of Americans. Because of their strong beliefs, these people would rather disobey their government than disobey their God or their beliefs. As a disciple of Ghandi and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s, preachings on nonviolence, I understand the difficult choice these Americans face.  That is why I am introducing this legislation. The Religious Freedom Peace Tax Fund would allow religious and conscientious objectors to pay their taxes without violating their religious beliefs. These taxpayers would have their tax payments placed in the Religious Freedom Peace Tax Fund. Money from this fund could not be spent for military purposes. Religious objectors would be assured that their tax payment would not increase military spending--that paying taxes would not violate their religious beliefs.  The Joint Committee on Taxation has determined that the Religious Freedom and Peace Tax Fund legislation is a slight revenue raiser. The bill will not reduce military spending. It simply will allow thousands more Americans to pay their taxes in good conscience.                          ____________________
