Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, both the U.S.-Chile and U.S.-Singapore Free Trade Agreements contain several important provisions within the purview of the Committee on the Judiciary. Both agreements contain competition clauses that ensure antitrust laws are applied in a neutral, transparent and nondiscriminatory manner while safeguarding basic procedural rights.  The agreements also contain robust intellectual property protections, requiring the governments of Chile and Singapore to take affirmative steps to eradicate the piracy of trademarks, patents, satellite television rights and other forms of intellectual property. These intellectual property provisions are widely supported and are likely to serve as a model for future free trade agreements. The intellectual property and antitrust provisions required no substantive changes to U.S. law and thus are not within the text of the implementing legislation before the House today.  For the last several years, I have woefully and repeatedly expressed concern about substantive changes to U.S. law contained in free trade agreements. Before passage of the Trade Promotion Authority Act, immigration provisions were included in earlier free trade agreements such as NAFTA without formal consultation with Congress. This regrettable practice created precedent for subsequent trade agreements, and immigration provisions were included in both the Chile and Singapore Free Trade Agreements before the elevated consultation requirements created by the Trade Promotion Authority were enacted last year.  Mr. Speaker, article I, section 8, clause 3 of the Constitution gives the Congress plenary authority over matters pertaining to immigration and naturalization. During the Committee on the Judiciary's mock markup of this legislation, I, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers), the ranking member and several members of the committee spoke with a united and bipartisan voice and declared that immigration provisions in future free trade agreements will not receive the support of the Committee on the Judiciary. Plainly stated, the Committee on the Judiciary will oppose any future free trade agreement that contains substantive changes in immigration law.  Following the markup, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers), the ranking member, and I transmitted a letter to the United States Trade Representative that reaffirmed Congress' exclusive constitutional mandate to consider immigration law. An additional letter was sent by other members of the committee and several Members of the Congress not on the committee echoing this bipartisan commitment. This was sent to the Trade Representative.  Mr. Speaker, the Committee on the Judiciary's July 10 preintroduction markup of this legislation was a mock markup in name only. At the markup, the committee reported several substantive amendments to the draft we were furnished, and these were incorporated into the legislation which we consider today.  First, while the draft implementing legislation created a separate visa category for skilled workers from Chile and Singapore, the Committee on the Judiciary amended the Immigration and Nationality Act to ensure that these visas, 6,800 in total, are now deducted from the national H-1B visa cap at the time they are issued and when they are renewed after five or more prior extensions.  The committee also reported an amendment to ensure that every second extension of temporary status for citizens of Chile and Singapore be accompanied by a new employer attestation to ensure that an employer updates the prevailing wage determination after each second application for extension.  In addition, the committee approved an amendment that requires an employer to pay a fee equal to that charged to an employer petitioning for H-1B visa status whenever a temporary exit visa is granted and after every second extension of that status.  Finally, H.R. 2738 and H.R. 2739 now explicitly state that an employer generally cannot sponsor an alien for an EL or H-1B1 visa if there is any labor dispute occurring in the occupational classification at the place of employment, regardless of whether the labor dispute is classified as a strike or a lockout. In this regard, title IV of both bills provides greater worker protection than that presently contained in the H-1B program.  The committee's commitment to ensuring that its amendments were incorporated into the introduced bills we consider today dramatically enhanced the quality of the legislation and recaptured a crucial prerogative of the Congress. It is my hope and expectation that the Committee on the Judiciary's clarion call over the last 2 weeks that immigration provisions be excluded from future trade agreements will be clearly received by this and future administrations.  Given the leadership of Ambassador Zoellick, his proven commitment to working with Congress on a cooperative and constructive basis that fully respects the constitutional prerogatives of this body and the dedication and professionalism of his staff, I have great confidence that the will of Congress will not be ignored.                              {time}  1045  Mr. Speaker, reducing barriers to U.S. exports is crucial to restoring America's economic vibrancy. U.S. products containing intellectual property continue to lead America's exports, and it is incumbent upon this body to ensure that foreign governments stamp out the rampant piracy that costs America and Americans several billion dollars a year.  Strong safeguards in these agreements will ensure that the governments of Chile and Singapore create criminal sanctions to punish intellectual property theft with the seriousness and severity that it demands. In addition, the antitrust provisions will ensure that these governments do not rely on the increasingly common foreign practice of manipulating antitrust laws to discriminate against American businesses.  Mr. Speaker, the Chilean-Singapore Free Trade Agreements contain critical market-opening provisions which will expand commercial opportunities for America's farmers and dairy producers and ensure that the United States continues to lead the world in exports. These agreements also advance America's broader strategic interests by liberalizing trade with two key economic allies which serve as regional models for neighboring countries.  For the reasons I have outlined, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
