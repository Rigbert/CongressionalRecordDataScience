Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 128) supporting respect for human rights and encouraging inclusive governance in Ethiopia, as amended.  The Clerk read the title of the resolution.  The text of the resolution is as follows:                              H. Res. 128       Whereas the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia has      been an important partner of the United States and a regional      leader in promoting economic growth, global health, and peace      and security;       Whereas Ethiopia has helped advance the national interests      of the United States and regional partners, including through      contributions to international peacekeeping, combating      radical Islamist extremism and other forms of terrorism, and      regional cooperation through the African Union;       Whereas Ethiopia has made great strides in addressing      significant challenges in global health, child survival, and      food security;       Whereas Ethiopia's transition from authoritarian rule to      participatory democracy has not kept pace with other reforms;       Whereas the ruling Ethiopian Peoples' Revolutionary      Democratic Front (EPRDF) claimed to win 99.6 percent of the      vote in elections that were deemed neither free nor fair in      2010 and all 546 parliamentary seats in 2015, thereby further      consolidating the EPRDF's single party rule;       Whereas the Charities and Societies Proclamation and Anti-     Terrorism Proclamation, both enacted in 2009, have      accelerated the contraction of democratic space, severely      limited the practice of fundamental human rights, enabled      abuses by security forces, and impeded efforts to promote      accountability for such abuses in Ethiopia;       Whereas government forces launched a violent crackdown on      protests by ethnic Oromo and Amhara over their perceived      marginalization in 2015, resulting in hundreds of deaths and      tens of thousands of arrests;       Whereas the Government of Ethiopia has recently released      hundreds of political prisoners, but has continued to      periodically detain government critics and opposition      figures;       Whereas the Government of Ethiopia has periodically imposed      a state of emergency that even further restricts freedoms of      assembly, association, and expression, including through      blockage of mobile internet access and social media      communication;       Whereas the 2017 Department of State Country Report on      Human Rights Practices for Ethiopia cited serious human      rights violations, including arbitrary arrests, killings, and      torture committed by security forces, restrictions on freedom      of expression and freedom of association, politically      motivated trials, harassment, and intimidation of opposition      members and journalists; and       Whereas these persistent human right abuses, including      state-sponsored violence against civilians in the Oromia,      Amhara, and Somali regions of Ethiopia, as well as the abuse      of laws to stifle journalistic freedoms, stand in direct      contrast to democratic principles, violate the Constitution      of Ethiopia, and undermine Ethiopia's position as a regional      leader for economic growth, peace, and security: Now,      therefore, be it       Resolved, That the House of Representatives--       (1) recognizes and commends Ethiopia's efforts to promote      regional peace and security, including through the      contribution of peacekeeping forces to regional and United      Nations peacekeeping operations;       (2) recognizes the importance of continued United States      and Ethiopian partnership in combatting terrorism, promoting      economic growth and opportunity, and addressing global health      challenges;       (3) notes with deep concern persistent reports of      widespread human rights abuses and the contraction of      democratic space in Ethiopia, which may threaten stability      and reverse economic progress over the long term;       (4) condemns the use of excessive force by Ethiopian      security forces, including the killing of unarmed protesters,      and the wrongful arrest and detention of journalists,      students, activists, and political leaders exercising their      constitutional rights to freedom of assembly, association,      and expression;       (5) recognizes and commends the recent peaceful and      voluntary transfer of authority from Prime Minister      Hailemariam to new Prime Minister Abiy and welcomes Prime      Minister Abiy's inaugural speech calling for open political      competition and the defense of fundamental human rights;       (6) calls on the Government of Ethiopia to--       (A) lift the state of emergency;       (B) repeal or amend proclamations used as a tool to      suppress human rights in Ethiopia, including the Charities      and Societies Proclamation and Anti-Terrorism Proclamation of      2009, and respect the rights of Ethiopian citizens to freedom      of assembly and expression, in keeping with Articles 30 and      29 of the Ethiopian Constitution;       (C) end the use of excessive force by Ethiopian security      forces and hold accountable those responsible for killing,      torturing, or otherwise abusing the human rights of civilians      exercising their constitutional rights through fair and      public trials;       (D) release all activists, journalists, and opposition      figures who have been wrongfully imprisoned for exercising      their constitutional rights, including those arrested for      reporting about public protests;       (E) improve transparency around development policies and      activities that may infringe upon the human rights of local      communities; and       (F) allow for an independent examination of the state of      human rights in Ethiopia by a rapporteur appointed by the      United Nations;       (7) urges protesters in Ethiopia to refrain from the use or      incitement of violence in demonstrations;       (8) urges opposition groups and the Government of Ethiopia      to directly engage in peaceful discussions to air grievances      and broaden political discourse;       (9) calls on the Department of State and the United States      Agency for International Development--       (A) to engage in a cooperative effort with the Government      of Ethiopia in the formulation of a comprehensive strategy,      in coordination with other donors, to help advance democracy,      rule of law, human rights, economic growth, and peace and      security in Ethiopia;       (B) continue to strengthen ties with Ethiopia, including      through the provision of appropriate levels and forms of      security assistance, in correlation to the Ethiopian      Government's own demonstrated commitment to democracy, rule      of law, human rights, economic growth, and peace and security      in the region;       (C) condemn human rights abuses and the excessive use of      force by Ethiopian security forces while pressing for the      release of individuals wrongfully detained; and       (D) hold accountable individuals responsible for gross      human rights violations in Ethiopia through appropriate      mechanisms, which may include the imposition of targeted      sanctions pursuant to the Global Magnitsky Human Rights      Accountability Act (Public Law 114-328); and       (10) stands by the people of Ethiopia and supports their      peaceful efforts to increase democratic space and to exercise      the rights guaranteed by the Ethiopian Constitution.
