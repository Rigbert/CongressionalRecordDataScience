Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, too many Americans believe our campaign finance system iscorrupt. We must treat this illness in the body politic which, in my opinion, if ignored, will undermine our democracy.  Like beauty, of course, genuine reform may be in the eye of the beholder. In my view, genuine reform must purge from Federal elections unregulated soft money which has become so pervasive. Meehan-Shays does that.  Reform should be subject to disclosure. The issue ads which are so clearly intended to influence elections must be covered. Meehan-Shays does that.  Reform, in my opinion, should level the playing field for challenges by further restricting franked mail in election years. Meehan-Shays does that.  Reform, as well, should encourage wealthy candidates to limit personal spending and toughen disclaimers on ads, giving voters better information with which to judge content. Meehan-Shays does that.  Reform also should enhance candidate disclosure by giving the public quick access via the Internet. Meehan-Shays does that.  Meehan-Shays does all of these good things, Mr. Chairman, but, by any standard, is breathtakingly modest. Yet, in this Republican Congress, its enactment is in doubt. Though there are good provisions in other bills, I will support Meehan-Shays as our best hope of fixing some problems now.  I might say that I know the distinguished gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Maloney) has an amendment that she will be now offering, which I also strongly support, which, in effect, says that, although there are reforms in Meehan-Shays that we want to adopt, there is more yet to do. She will establish a commission to look further at how we can make our election laws better.  Having said what reform is, let me say what it is not. Reform is not the Paycheck Protection Act, a Republican proposal to gag working Americans. Californians wisely rejected, Mr. Chairman, the paycheck protections last month as we did in March. Hopefully, this part of the Republican vendetta against working families will finally disappear.  Reform is not repealing all contribution limits. This would just tilt the playing field even more toward the affluent and away from ordinary Americans, for whom giving $1,000 to candidates is beyond reach, let alone $25,000.  Reform is not repeal of public financing of presidential elections, which ended the thrilling campaigns of yesteryear financed out of the suitcases stuffed with untraceable cash.  Finally, reform is not underfunding the Federal Election Commission. Republicans argue we do not need new laws, just enforcement of current ones. Yet, House committees have recommended funding for next year for campaign law enforcement that is simply inadequate. The majority are generous with rhetoric, but not with the resources the FEC needs to police campaigns.  Mr. Chairman, this debate that we are now engaged in is not designed, unfortunately, to facilitate the passage of reform. Indeed, many of us believe, perhaps cynically, that it is designed to undercut, undermine, and defeat campaign finance reform. In fact, many leaders on the Republican side make no secret of their antipathy towards reform legislation and particularly the Meehan-Shays legislation.  I hope that, notwithstanding this disastrous procedure, notwithstanding the opposition of many in the Republican leadership and many Republicans, notwithstanding those who would undercut reform efforts, I am hopeful that, through it all, that we will, nevertheless, have the courage and the wisdom and the common sense to pass Meehan-Shays. Amendment No. 30 Offered by Mrs. Maloney of New York to Amendment No.          13 in the Nature of a Substitute Offered by Mr. Shays
