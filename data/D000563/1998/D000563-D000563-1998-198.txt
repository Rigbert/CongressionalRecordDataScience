President, the $100 million we have invested is for the hardware for the computers. It now costs $13 to $16 every time they do a background check. I think the people should pay for it. The Senator from New Hampshire would take the money out of FBI for other law enforcement. I think the FBI needs these funds to do important tasks. I hope the Senator will agree that the FBI is an agency that we need to be strong in the United States. Taking $50 million to $75 million away from them is not going to make them a stronger agency or make Americans any safer at home.
