I am heading home for townhall meetings in Oregon over the weekend. I am the ranking Democrat on the committee, the storied committee, as my colleagues know, that works in a bipartisan way.  Bill Bradley tells this story about how he flew all over the country to meet with Republicans to talk about how you could find common ground to deal with tax reform. At this time, we haven't been able to get the majority to even walk down the corridor in an effort to try to get a bipartisan bill. As I told my colleagues, I have written two of them.  My question to my friend is, when you have your community meeting, how do you think people in Connecticut are going to react to the idea that we had maybe an hour or so to try to make our way through a bill that is actually the biggest tax bill in 31 years? I know my colleague tries very hard to be straightforward with his constituents, and he will tell them: I got it with insufficient time to get into it. How will they react to that?
