 President.  Mr. President, is the Chair in the position, since so many people are wishing to speak, to, in a sense, unofficially acknowledge the order in which we are standing on the floor? I think it might make things appropriate. I know the Senator from Michigan was here before the Senator from Delaware. The Senator from Delaware was here before other people.  My inquiry is, is there an attempt on the part of the Chair to recognize people in the order in which they are sitting on the floor waiting to be recognized?
