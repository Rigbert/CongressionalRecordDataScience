Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Metropolitan Philip Saliba, who led the Antiochian Orthodox Christian Church in North America for nearly 50 years and who passed from this life on March 19, 2014. Metropolitan Philip was the longest-serving bishop in any branch of Orthodoxy in the United States and leaves behind a tremendous legacy of service to the Orthodox Christian community.  Metropolitan Philip began leading Antiochian Orthodoxy in 1996 and frequently visited St. George Antiochian Orthodox Cathedral in Toledo and St. Elias Antiochian Church in Sylvania. His leadership will be greatly missed, as he played a key role in inspiring unity among Orthodox churches during his tenure. His compelling vision for unity was noted by The Toledo Blade, where he was quoted as saying: ``As long as we are fragmented and known by Antiochians and Greeks and Serbians and Bulgarians and Russians, we will have no impact as a church on this country''.  His eminence is remembered fondly for his personal warmth and compassion and has been described by his parishioners as a ``visionary''. One of the metropolitan's many accomplishments includes the founding of a church camp, Antioch Village, in Bolivar, Pennsylvania, which flourished under his direction. Indeed, he was lauded for this achievement, and for his other successful endeavors in expanding the reach of the church.  A staunch advocate for inclusion, Metropolitan Phillip welcomed converts without connections to the church's Middle Eastern roots and expanded the role of women in the church. He insisted on the creation of a women's organization and appointed women to the archdiocese's board. The metropolitan also urged the church to modernize in other capacities, by using English during liturgies and by beginning a clergy retirement program.  Under his purview, the number of parishes in the diocese quadrupled in size--a true testament to the significant impact of his leadership. Indeed, his imprint on the Orthodox Christian community will live on, as will his memory. To his brothers Nassif and Najib Saliba, and all those whose lives he touched, we offer our heartfelt sympathy. We hope that they draw comfort in the days ahead and in the memories of this extraordinary man and the gift of his life.                          ____________________
