President, if the Senator would yield on that point, I would tell my good friend from Iowa how touched I was when I received his e-mail saying how the people of Iowa have stood with the people of Vermont, as we did with the people of Iowa when they faced a disaster. When I received the e-mail, the Governor of our State, Governor Shumlin, and I and the head of our Vermont National Guard, General Dubie, had just helicoptered into one of our prettiest towns, but it was totally cut off. The only way we could reach it was by helicopter. I saw people working together. Nobody knew whether they were Republicans or Democrats or cared. They were all working together to help each other.  I will tell my friend from Iowa, I took the liberty of showing his very meaningful, very heartfelt e-mail--similar, also, to ones I got from other Senators--and I thought how much that meant. If I might address the Senator from Iowa directly, I will tell you, the people of Vermont appreciate it because I know how heartfelt it was. It meant a great deal.
