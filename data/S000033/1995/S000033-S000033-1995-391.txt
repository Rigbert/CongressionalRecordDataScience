 We need far more information about this bailout and, second of all, and most importantly, we want the U.S. Congress, which presumably was elected to represent the American people, to be able to vote this thing up or down, and in my view, the Congress would vote it down.  Now, I think if the American people are upset about this process, it is terribly important that they stand up, they tell the President and the Republican leadership that they understand what is going on, that they want a vote on the floor of the House, they want the Members of Congress to represent their interest and not put $40 billion at risk.  So we hope very much that the people will stand up, fight back, and start callng their Members of Congress, the President's office, and the leadership to demand a vote on this important issue.
