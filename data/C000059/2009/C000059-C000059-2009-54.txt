I rise today to recognize and honor one of those individuals: outgoing Norco City Council Member, and former Mayor, Frank Hall.  Frank started his public service career in 1993 as a member of the Streets and Trails Commission in Norco, California. With that experience he was elected as a Norco City Councilmember in 1997. As member of the Norco City Council, Frank also served as Mayor in 2008, 2004 and 2000. In 2000, Frank received the Norco Chamber of Commerce Man of the Year Award.  Over his accomplished career, Frank served on a number of special committees which addressed a wide range of issues. He worked on transportation issues as a member of the Riverside County Transportation Commission, Riverside Transit Authority Board of Directors and the Transportation Uniform Mitigation Fee Northwest Zone Committee. He promoted education and learning in the community as a member of the Riverside Community College, Norco Friends of the Library, Norco Historical Society and the Corona/Norco Family YMCA. He also was successful in rallying support for NSWC, Corona and joined a regional effort to keep the base from being realigned to Port Hueneme during the last round of Base Realignment and Closure.  Frank Hall will leave the Norco City Council with many accomplishments; his legacy will serve as a shining example and constant reminder of what it means to be a public servant. I am proud to call Frank a fellow community member, American and friend. It has been an honor to work with him for the betterment of our community and I salute his service to the City of Norco.                          ____________________
