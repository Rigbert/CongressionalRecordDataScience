 President, I rise in support of the conference report on H.R. 2215.  With approval of this conference report, we are one step closer to authorizing the operations of the Justice Department for the first time since 1979. I commend the conferees, and particularly the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee Senator Leahy, for the work they have done on this measure. It will improve the operations of the Department, and in so doing it will strengthen our efforts against terrorism, help protect our borders, and prevent crime and drug abuse.  I would like to highlight a few of the provisions of the conference report that I think are particularly important, beginning with the establishment of the Violence Against Women Office. Today is the first day of Domestic Violence Awareness Month, and it is a fitting tribute to this special month that H.R. 2215 provides this Senate with an opportunity to make our voices heard loud and clear on the importance of continuing the fight against domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking.  A key tool in that fight is the permanent and independent Violence Against Women Office, a proposal I first introduced in the Senate in March, 2001, and now established in the Conference Report. This provision means that the Office will be removed from its current location inside the Office of Justice Programs, and become its own free-standing entity. The bill also sets out the jurisdiction of the Office and the extensive duties and functions of the Director. It also requires that the Director be nominated by the President, confirmed by the Senate and report directly to the Attorney General.  With this bill, the Violence Against Women Office is set out in black and white. Its leadership and agenda cannot be pushed to the sidelines nor marginalized as one of many offices in a large bureau. Instead, this law gives the Violence Against Women Office the foundation and roots it deserves. It will be its own, separate and distinct office within the Department of Justice with a Director who answers only to the Attorney General. This statutory authority is long overdue.  Since we passed my Violence Against Women Act in 1994, the Office has been charged with disbursing billions of dollars to states, localities, tribal governments and private organizations to improve the investigation and prosecution of crimes of domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking; to train prosecutors, law enforcement and judges on the unique aspects of cases involving violence against women; and to offer needed services to victims and their families.  The Violence Against Women Office also handles and coordinates the Department of Justice's legal and policy issues regarding violence against women, everything from enforcing protection orders across State lines to issuing annual reports on stalking. The Office also works with other Federal agencies, such as the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the Immigration and Naturalization Service about Federal policies, programs, statutes, and regulations that impact violence against women.  It is a tall order for the Violence Against Women Office, and to carry out these critical mandates, we must ensure that the Office has the sufficient visibility, prestige and authority. An independent office will provide just that platform. An independent office will be insulated from any attempts to undo the great work it has historically accomplished. A director nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate will have the credibility and the bully pulpit to travel this country and get local people to the table. Let me be clear, to meet its mandate, the Violence Against Women Office should not, must not, and cannot be buried within a grant-making bureaucracy.  Since the Violence Against Women Act passed in 1994, we have changed the way folks think about domestic violence and sexual assault. We have hauled these matters out from the closet, and called them their proper names, ``crimes'', crimes that warrant investigation and prosecution with crime victims who desperately need our help. Across the country there are signs that the law is working. Statistics released by the Justice Department last month indicate that rape and sexual assault crimes dropped 8 percent from 2000 to 2001. The New York City Police Department is beginning to use digital cameras to capture the injuries of domestic violence which has drastically improved the way these cases are prosecuted. One of the first trials for cyberstalking is underway in Chicago.  In my home State of Delaware, the Violence Against Women Act and the leadership of the Office have made an enormous impact. Just last week, the STOP grant program, one of several grant programs in the Violence Against Women Act, awarded $85,000 to the Sexual Assault Network of Delaware so that it can formalize community responses to sexual assault crimes and victims. Since 1995, Delaware has received more than 30 grants totaling almost $8.5 million dollars, all of it designated to combat violence against women.  But sadly, we are not done.  The National Violence Against Women Survey reports that nearly 25 percent of women sometime in their lives has been raped or physically assaulted by an intimate partner.  One out of 5 adolescent girls in America becomes victims of physical or sexual abuse in a dating relationship according to a report issued by the Journal of American Medicine.  We still need Domestic Violence Awareness Month this October. And we need the leadership of an independent and separate Violence Against Women Office. I want to thank the Senate conferees, Senators Leahy, Hatch and Kennedy, who worked long and hard to get an ensure that the Violence Against Women Office Act was included in the compromise Conference Report, and I thank Senators DeWine, Levin, Specter, Carnahan, Hutchison, Miller, Collins and Carper who originally joined me when I first introduced a bill for an independent office in March, 2001. And finally, in this first week of Domestic Violence Awareness Month, it is right to give thanks for the tireless efforts of advocates and service providers who support the women and children victimized by domestic violence and sexual assault.  The next point I would like to highlight is that the Conference Report reauthorizes the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974. Congress has tried for over six years to get this job done and as the former Chairman of the Judiciary Committee and the current Chairman of the Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs I am extremely gratified we were able to renew the juvenile justice law here.  Last year, Senators Kohl and Reed and I introduced S. 1165, the Juvenile Crime Prevention and Control Act. That bill reauthorized the 1974 Act, authorized the Juvenile Accountability Incentive Block Grant for the first time, and proposed to close the gun show loophole. S. 1165 contained provisions similar to H.R. 1900 and H.R. 863, and provisions complimentary to Senator Leahy's S. 1174. Major provisions of H.R. 1900, H.R. 863, S. 1165 and S. 1174 are included in this Conference Report today. Provisions from S. 1165 included in the Conference Report will ensure that youth in the juvenile justice system are protected from abuse and assault by adults in adult jails. The Conference Report ensures we will remain focused on preventing juvenile crime before it occurs: it reauthorizes Title V, the Justice Department's juvenile crime prevention grant program. Title V resources have been critical in Delaware to sponsor programs to reduce school violence, provide transition counseling to students returning to their local school from alternative school placement, reduce suspensions, expulsions, truancy, and teen pregnancy, and provide services to the children of incarcerated adult offenders. I compliment Senator Kohl for his steadfast devotion to Title V and for ensuring it is continued through this Conference Report.  The Conference Report adopts provisions of S. 1165 that authorize the Juvenile Accountability Incentive Block Grant. This program was created in the 1998 Commerce Justice State appropriations bill but has never been authorized. It provides resources to States and units of local government so programs can be developed to promote greater accountability in the juvenile justice system. The Conference Report also expands the purposes to which JAIBG funds can be put, for the first time, resources are provided to support proven strategies for rehabilitating adjudicated youth and familiesas well as for reducing juvenile re-offense rates. In years past, my state has used JAIBG funds to establish a Serious Juvenile Offender program through the Delaware Division of Youth Rehabilitative Services, which provides an immediate secure placement of violent youth offenders who have violated the terms of their probation. Delaware has also used these funds to expand diversionary programs such as Teen Court and Drug Court, thus reducing the time between arrest and disposition of juvenile offenders, and to add psycho-forensic evaluators in the Delaware Office of the Public Defender to identify and address mental illness as a cause for delinquent conduct. I compliment the conferees for including provisions drawn from S. 1165 and H.R. 863 in this Report.  I would also like to highlight the provisions in the Conference Report that are designed to strengthen Boys and Girls Clubs of America. Provisions here will allow for the establishment of 1,200 additional Clubs across the Nation. This will bring the number of Clubs to nearly 4,000, serving nearly 6 million young people across America.  Finally, this Conference Report also incorporates much of S. 304, the Drug Abuse Education Prevention and Treatment Act, a bill which Senators Hatch, Leahy and I introduced together. While I am disappointed that many of the bill's drug treatment provisions were dropped in conference, I promise to fight for those provisions again in the next Congress.  I want to draw attention to three of the important provisions from S. 304 that were included in the conference report to address addiction among those in the criminal justice system and make sure that we are doing all we can to keep them from reoffending. Specifically, the conference report reauthorizes two key programs created in the 1994 Biden Crime Law to deal with drug addicts in the criminal justice system, prison-based drug treatment and the drug court program, and includes my ``Offender Reentry and Community Safety Act of 2001,'' which creates demonstration programs to oversee the reintegration of high-risk, high-need offenders into society upon release.  Let me address prison-based drug treatment first. Providing prison-based treatment is not ``soft''; it is smart crime prevention policy as the Key and Crest programs in my home state of Delaware have shown. If we do not treat addicted offenders before they are released, they will return to our streets with the same addiction problem that got them in trouble in the first place, and they are likely to re-offend. This is not my opinion; it is fact. More than 80 percent of inmates with five or more prior convictions have been habitual drug users, compared to approximately 40 percent of first-time offenders. Prison-based treatment programs are a good investment and an important crime prevention initiative.  And so are drug courts. The Federal Government has funded drug courts since 1994 as a cost-effective, innovative way to deal with non-violent offenders who need drug treatment. Rather than just churning people through the revolving door of the criminal justice system, drug courts help these folks get their acts together so they won't be back. When they graduate from drug court programs they are clean and sober and more prepared to participate in society. In order to graduate, they are required to finish high school or obtain a GED, hold down a job, and keep up with financial obligations, including drug-court fees and child-support payments.  Drug courts have been proven effective at keeping offenders with little previous treatment history in treatment, providing closer supervision than other community programs to which the offenders could be assigned, reducing crime and being cost-effective.  Just as treating addicted offenders when they are in the criminal justice system is smart crime policy, so is making sure that high-risk, high-need offenders get reintegrated into society upon release. These individuals have served their prison sentences, but they pose the greatest risk of re-offending because they lack the education, job skills, stable family or living arrangements, and the substance abuse treatment and other mental and medical health services they need to successfully re-integrate into society. The demonstration reentry programs created in this conference report will help supervise high-risk people when they are released from jail and make sure they get the services and other support that they need so they won't go back to a life of crime and can be productive members of our society.  Once again, I thank the conferees, Senators Leahy, Hatch and Kennedy and their staff, including Bruce Cohen, Beryl Howell, Ed Pagano, Tim Lynch, Steve Dettelbach, Makan Delrahim, Leah Belaire, Wan Kim, Melody Barnes and Robin Toone, for their unfailing support for these provisions, and for their hard work in bringing the Conference Report to the floor.
