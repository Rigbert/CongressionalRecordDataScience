 President, in recent days there has been much speculation regarding my position on retaining the severability of the campaign finance reform bill being considered by the Senate.  First let me start by reiterating my strong and unwavering commitment to meaningful campaign finance reform. Since I arrived in the Senate, I, along with many of my colleagues, have championed an overhaul of our campaign finance system. Our system demands more disclosure and accountability, we should reduce the amount of money in the system, we should ensure that the voice of every American can be heard, and we must require fairness.  I admire Senator McCain and others for their courage and persistence in pursuing this goal. Senator McCain has shown himself to be a real leader, and I enjoy working with him in the Senate.  I believe the McCain/Feingold bill is a carefully crafted, balanced bill. There have been a number of amendments to this bill, some of which I have supported; some I've opposed. Campaign finance reform, in addition to reforming the excesses of the current system, must be fair and not favor any one party or group over another. If the court, at some later date, finds that some part or parts of our reform effort do not pass constitutional muster, that ruling should not be allowed to tip the scales to the benefit or detriment of one class of actors with regard to their ability to engage in political debate. As strongly as I believe in reforming our campaign finance laws, I also believe we should do a better job of supporting our public schools, providing more and better access to qualityhealthcare, protecting our environment, and creating family wage jobs. If my, or the people who share my positions, ability to communicate those positions is altered to a greater or lesser extent than those with other opinions, then what we have left will be fundamentally unfair. The balance of this bill could change depending on the court's interpretation. The severability issue goes directly to this point.  Which leads me to why I believe this year's effort is different from previous efforts in one very significant and fundamental way. Today, we know more about the Supreme Court than we did just a few months ago. We know that the court is not beyond interpretations that would appear to favor one party over another. And that has given me pause, and, I would think, it may give my colleagues pause, when we consider the application of this law, how it will be tested in court, and what we may end up with as a result.  If the Supreme Court decided to uphold limits on the amount of soft money flowing to our parties, while allowing special interest groups to spend unlimited sums to attack or defend candidates, then we will turn the electoral process over to those same special interests who we seek to limit.  In this debate, too often, people who have differed with the sponsors have been characterized as wanting to ``kill'' the bill. Contrary to those assertions, this bill, with or without non-severability, is about to pass the Senate.  After careful consideration, I have decided to vote against the non-severability amendment. I have made this judgement with strong reservations about how the Court could interpret the law we pass.  I am not willing to participate in enacting a precedent for severability that could impact a wide range of bills to come before the Senate. Rather than adding a non-severability clause to this bill the Congress should act quickly to meet the challenges that may be presented by any future court action, and fashion a set of campaign finance laws that will serve to strike a balance and ensure fairness.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reformers frequently assert that there is a great desire throughout the land for their campaign finance scheme. The truth is there is not, nor has there ever been, a groundswell of public demand for even the concept of ``reform,'' let alone an unconstitutional assault by the Federal Government on the constitutional freedom of citizens, groups and parties to participate in America's democracy.  On that note, I would ask that a March 22, 2001 article in the Washington Times entitled ``Nation Yawns at Campaign Finances,'' be printed in the Record at this point.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Times, Mar. 22, 2001]                   Nation Yawns at Campaign Finances                           (By Donald Lambro)       Campaign finance reform may be the No. 1 issue in the      Senate right now, but outside of Washington it does not even      make the top-40 list of most important problems facing the      country.       Sen. John McCain, Arizona Republican, with the help of      favorable national news media coverage, has managed to drive      the issue to the top of the Senate agenda this week--ahead of      education, health care, Medicare, Social Security, tax cuts      and other issues that score much higher in poll after poll.       Polls show that Americans strongly support the overall      concept of campaign reform, but it does not appear on most      lists of what concerns them the most, or if it does, comes in      dead last.       ``We've asked people what is the most important problem      facing the country and watched campaign finance reform      languish at the bottom of every list of 20 to 25 issues,''      said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster based in Atlanta.       Compared to other issues, campaign finance long has been in      the basement of public priorities,'' the ABC News Web site      said in an analysis earlier this week.       ``Most people have more pressing concerns, and most doubt      reform would effectively curb the role of money in      politics,'' it concluded.       The Pew Research Center asked 1,513 adult Americans last      month what is ``the most important problem facing the country      today.'' Campaign finance reform did not specifically appear      among its list of 45 responses.       Morality/ethics/family values tops the list with      12 percent, followed by education (11 percent), the      economy and jobs (13 percent), crime (8 percent), health      care (6 percent), and energy costs (6 percent).       Other polls similarly place the issue at the bottom of the      issue rankings. An ABC News poll taken in January ranked it      16th out of 18 issues. It was last among 16 issues in the      general election.       Mr. McCain made campaign finance reform the centerpiece of      his unsuccessful campaign for the Republican presidential      nomination last year, but polls showed that most of those who      supported him in the primaries did so for other reasons--such      as his patriotism and character--not for his signature issue.       Only 9 percent of the voters in the New Hampshire primary      said the issue was their biggest concern. There was even less      concern on the Democratic side.       The issue all but disappeared in the general election. It      was seldom raised by Al Gore, and George W. Bush, who opposes      the McCain campaign finance reform bill, rarely mentioned the      issue unless asked about it.       Asked how campaign finance reform was playing in Georgia,      Mr. Ayres replied facetiously: ``It's a burning issue. It's a      topic that dominates every dinner table conversation. You      can't go into a supermarket check-out line without hearing      everyone talk about it.''       In fact, Mr. Ayres, ``It's an elite, media-driven,      editorial page issue that concerns'' very few people.      Virtually every poll seems to confirm that view.       When a Princeton Survey poll released earlier this month      asked 1,200 people what should be Mr. Bush's top priorities      this year, campaign finance reform barely registered at the      bottom of the list with a minuscule 3 percent.       What were the top concerns of most people? Education (29      percent), the economy (20 percent), tax cuts (15 percent),      Medicare, (14 percent), and Social Security (13 percent).      Even foreign policy, at 4 percent, scored higher than      campaign reform.       ``People care more about how the taxpayers' money is being      spent than about how the politicians are raising money for      their campaigns,'' Mr. Ayres said.       The fact that the Senate is spending so much time on an      issue they rate very low, or not at all, ``just feeds the      suspicion that Congress spends a lot of time on issues that      people don't really care much about,'' he said.       ``It doesn't show up as a high priority issue, not because      people don't want reform, but because they don't believe that      they are ever going to get it,'' said independent pollster      John Zogby.       But for most Americans, Mr. Zogby conceded, ``it's just not      a passionate issue.''  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I have authored a number of op-eds on this subject over the years and I ask unanimous consent that the most recent, appearing March 23, 2001, in USA Today, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                    [From USA Today, Mar. 23, 2001]                       ``Reform'' Hurts Freedoms opposing view: bill unfairly restricts parties' ability to challenge                                incumbents                          (By Mitch McConnell)       Next week, in its debate over changing campaign-finance      laws, the Senate will consider a constitutional amendment      overriding the First Amendment and thereby allowing the      government to restrict all spending on communications ``by,      in support of, or in opposition to'' candidates for public      office.       So empowered, Congress could ban ``soft money'' and even      make it illegal for corporate-owned newspapers to endorse or      mention political candidates within 60 days of an election.      Currently, the media is specifically exempted from federal      campaign-finance law, even though these corporate      conglomerates exert tremendous influence on the political      system. You could call this exemption the media's      ``loophole.''       The McCain-Feingold bill less forthrightly but just as      effectively restricts the constitutional freedom of citizens      groups and parties to speak out on issues, and elections.      McCain-Feingold makes it illegal for citizen groups to      criticize members of Congress in TV or radio ads, unless they      register with the federal government and conform to a litany      of restrictions. Such restrictions on political speech are      sure to be declared unconstitutional, as have 22 similar      efforts previously struck down in federal court.       McCain-Feingold also attack the national parties, making it      illegal for them to pay for issue advocacy, voter turnout and      such mundane overhead expenses as utilities, accountants,      computers and lawyers (necessary to comply with existing      complex campaign-finance laws) with funds outside the current      strict ``hard money'' limits. Hard money refers to funds that      can be given directly to candidates and is subject to severe      contribution limits (limits not adjusted for inflation since      they were created in 1974).       McCain-Feingold would starve the parties. Few are moved by      the parties' plight until they consider that candidates      running against incumbent congressmen have only one reliable      source of support: parties.       Without party soft money, liberal news media and ``special      interest'' groups would move closer to total domination of      the American political environment. If banned, party soft      money (which already is publicly disclosed and therefore      accountable) will     give way to the shadowy world of special-interest soft money,      where there is no public disclosure and no accountability.      That does not meet anyone's definition of ``reform.''  Mr. McCONNELL. Senator Sessions would like to speak on the bill at the conclusion of the session. Perhaps he could wrap it up for us tonight. We will see everyone at 9 o'clock in the morning. At the conclusion of his remarks, unless floor staff has an objection, he will put us in recess.
