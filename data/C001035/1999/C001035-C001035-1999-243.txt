President, Senate Republicans are committed to enacting legislation to preserve, strengthen, and save Medicare for current and future generations. In addition to addressing the long-term issues facing Medicare, it is absolutely critical that this Congress also take action this year to remedy some of the unintended consequences of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, which have been exacerbated by a host of ill-conceived new regulatory requirements imposed by the Clinton administration.  These problems are the subject of the issue my colleague from Kansas and I wish to address today, for these problems are jeopardizing access to critical home health services for millions of our Nation's most vulnerable and frail senior citizens.  America's home health agencies provide invaluable services that have enabled a growing number of our vulnerable senior citizens to avoid hospitals, to avoid nursing homes, and receive the care they need and want in the security and privacy of their own homes--right where they want to be.  In 1996, however, home health was the fastest growing component of the Medicare budget, which understandably prompted Congress and the Clinton administration to initiate changes that were intended to make the program more cost effective and efficient. There was strong bipartisan support for the provisions that called for the implementation of a prospective payment system for home care. Unfortunately, until this system is implemented, home health care agencies are being paid under a critically flawed interim payment system known as IPS, that penalizes those home health agencies that historically have been the most cost effective.
