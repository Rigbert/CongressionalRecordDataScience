President, let me say I am going to have staff work with the Parliamentarian for a bit--my staff and Senator Salazar's staff, and others--to see if we can address the concern of the Senator from Colorado. Maybe we can get a number of Senators involved in this so we can lock in some actual votes.  I would be very pleased to get a commitment from the distinguished chairman of the committee, Senator Cochran, to have my amendment included in the next group of votes. That is a pretty simple request--something that goes on here very often. It seems to me if we cannot do that, and I am not included, then I guess I have to stay at my post here and say that I think the taxpayers ought to get some protection and we ought to stop the ripping off, the persistent plundering of tax revenue, at a time when the President and everybody else says you cannot justify these kinds of incentives. If I can get a commitment from the distinguished chairman from Mississippi to have my amendment included in the next group of votes, and we will get an up-or-down vote, I would certainly like to save my larynx and let the Senate get about its business.
