Chair, I understand the gentleman's concerns. I would suggest that he go down to the Administrator's office, our new Administrator, Mr. Pruitt, and meet withhim. I don't think that there is any desire on his part to militarize the Environmental Protection Agency, and I think that he will see this new Administrator wanting to do the right thing.  Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment and urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
