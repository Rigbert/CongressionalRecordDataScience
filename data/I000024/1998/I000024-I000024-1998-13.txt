President, section 606 subparagraph (6) of S. 2279 will have the unintended consequences of limiting competition at Chicago's O'Hare airport. I have spoke at length with Senators Lott, McCain, and Ford regarding my concerns with this provision and understand that it may be possible to correct this problem in conference. I hope that is the case.  This provision will allow those carriers who have lost landing/takeoff slots to foreign air carriers at Chicago's O'Hare to get them back. On the surface this seems very fair; however, it will in fact unfairly favor the largest slot holder at O'Hare at the expense of other competitors and new entrants. Because the dominant carrier at O'Hare has lost the most slots, it stands to gain the most. The result will be less competition rather than more at O'Hare.  Mr. President, by way of further explanation on this issue, I would like to submit for the Record a letter Senator Nickles and I sent to Senators Lott, Daschle, McCain, Hollings, Shelby, and Lautenberg describing our concerns and asking for their assistance in correcting the problem.  Knowing that the managers of the bill have worked very hard to increase competition, I am certain they share my concerns regarding market domination at O'Hare. In my discussions with Senator Lott, he has assured me that he has no position on section 606 and would not object to this section being removed in conference.  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.                                         United States Senate,                               Washington, DC, September 23, 1998.     Hon. Trent Lott,     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Tom Daschle,     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.     Hon. John McCain,     Chairman, Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation          Committee, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Hon. Ernest F. Hollings,     Ranking Member, Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation          Committee, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Hon. Richard C. Shelby,     Chairman, Subcommittee on Transportation, Senate          Appropriations Committee, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Hon. Frank R. Lautenberg,     Minority Member, Subcommittee on Transportation, Senate          Appropriations Committee, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senators: We are writing to express our strong      opposition to a proposal that would increase major airline      dominance at a key hub airport while at the same time      reversing a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) decision      and undercutting our international obligations. Specifically,      a provision in Section 606 of FAA Reauthorization (S. 2279)      would hand over roughly 35 slots at Chicago's O'Hare      International Airport to its largest slot holder, United      Airlines, while restricting access at that hub to its      competitors and new entrants. It is our understanding that      this special interest provision is being adviced for      inclusion in other pieces of ``must-pass'' legislation. Such      special interest legislation benefiting one airline will no      doubt lead to less competition and higher airfares. We urge      you to foster greater airline competition by deleting this      special interest provision from S. 2279 and preventing it      from being attached to other legislation.       Late last year, United petitioned FAA on just this issue      and was rejected soundly. United sought priority for any      future slot exemptions claiming they would replace the 35      slots withdrawn under FAA regulations and used by foreign      carriers in order to meet our bilateral commitments. In a      March 1998 order, FAA found that the public interest     would be best served by continuing to meet our aviation      bilateral agreement commitments to international air      transportation using the slots withdrawn from United and      American Airlines at O'Hare, while using the slot exemptions      to increase competition at that key airport. The priority by      which slots were to be withdrawn was well known. United chose      not to invest in better priority slots to protect its      schedule and slot holdings. In rejecting United's request,      FAA found:       ``Since 1993 the FAA withdraws, on average, 31 air carrier      slots from United, which is approximately four percent of      United's domestic slot base. These slots are withdrawn based      on a priority numbering system that was established by random      lottery in 1986. Slots having the lowest numbers are most      vulnerable to withdrawal, regardless of the slot holder. As      articulated in our previous denial to United concerning this      issue, United made its selection or acquisition of slots with      vulnerable withdrawal priority and planned its hub operations      fully knowing the effects of the rule's operations might have      upon them . . . United knew, or should have known, that these      slots were vulnerable in case of withdrawal.''       We applaud the Commerce Committee's efforts to fashion a      bill that promotes greater airline competition aimed at      producing lower airfares and improved service in all      communities. Accordingly, we respectfully urge your support      for striking this provision of section 606, the effect of      which is directly opposite the intent of S. 2279 and other      procompetitive aviation legislation.           Sincerely,     Jim Inhofe,     Don Nickles.
