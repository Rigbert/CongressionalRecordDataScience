Speaker, earlier today the Women's Caucus received an outstanding briefing from Joan Holmes, the President of the Hunger Project. The focus of her briefing was to help us understand the essential and often overlooked role that women play in ending hunger around the world.  As we look towards the real needs that people face, it is vital that programs we fund through the instrumentalities of the Departments of Agriculture and State, as well as the Agency for International Development, I encourage all of our colleagues to take the time to read this most helpful presentation. The Hunger Project works to empower women in many countries around the world, and in my view is deserving of our support and understanding.  I ask unanimous consent to insert in the Record at this point the statement by Joan Holmes, entitled ``Women and Ending Hunger: The Inextricable Link''.             Women and Ending Hunger: The Inextricable Link                            (By Joan Holmes)                              Introduction       Madame Chairperson and Distinguished Members of Congress,      it is an honor to testify before the Women's Caucus today. I      commend the Caucus for focusing on the inextricable link      between women and ending hunger.       My name is Joan Holmes, and it's been my privilege to be      the president of The Hunger Project since its inception in      1977.       In my testimony I will address:       First, Chronic Hunger and who is most affected;       Then, the three distinct ways women are essential to ending      hunger and achieving sustainable development;       Next, what happens to a society when women are empowered;      and       Finally, where the world is now--in recognizing the vital      role of women.                   An Understanding of Chronic Hunger       Chronic hunger continues to be the greatest failure of our      age. It takes the lives of 20,000 of us each day. Eight      hundred and forty million of us are chronically      undernourished. The largest number of hungry people are in      South Asia, but the most severe hunger is in sub-Saharan      Africa.       When most of us think of hunger, we think of famine--sudden      shortages of food due to war, drought or natural disasters.      Less than 8% of hunger deaths are due to famine--the rest are      due to chronic hunger.       The persistence of hunger is not an issue of the quantity      of food. The world produces more than enough food for      everyone. Hunger persists when people--particularly women--     are systematically denied the opportunity to produce enough      food--to be educated--to learn the skills to meet their basic      needs. Hunger persists when the poor--mostly women--have no      voice in the decisions that affect their lives.                     women most affected by hunger       When we speak of hungry people--we are literally speaking      of women and children. The vast majority of the world's poor      are women. The gap between women and men caught in the cycle      of poverty has continued to widen in the past decade.       An estimated 80 percent of the world's refugees are women      and girls. Two-thirds of the world's illiterates are female.      Of the millions of children kept out of school--2/3 are      girls.           women are at the center of the development process       The fundamental thesis of my testimony is--women are at the      center of the development process, and until and unless we      make the empowerment of women a central strategy in ending      hunger--hunger will persist. Until and unless we empower      women, none of the UN Millennium Development Goals will be      met.       My testimony today does not come from the perspective of      empowering women to achieve gender equality as a matter of      social justice--even though that has my unequivocal support.       The analysis I am presenting today comes from looking      strategically at what needs to happen to end hunger and      achieve sustainable development. In this analysis, I am going      to use the phrase ``women's empowerment''. It is important      that we know what that phrase means.       Although there is no country where there is gender      equality, in the countries that have the persistence of      hunger--the subjugation, marginalization and disempowerment      of women is particularly severe.       So, when we say empowering women--what this means is to      lift some of the shackles that constrict and suppress their      lives.       three distinct ways women are fundamental to ending hunger       Let's examine three ways in which women are fundamental to      the end of hunger:       First, the inextricable link between women's well-being and      the overall health of a society.       Second, the enormous, yet largely unrecognized and      unsupported role of women as producers.       Finally, women's leadership--a necessary component of      ending hunger.             women's well-being and the health of a society                      Girls and women are deprived       With regard to women's well-being and the link to the      health of a society, let's look to South Asia. India and      Bangladesh account for more than 1/3 of the remaining hunger,      and their malnutrition rates are among the highest in the      world. One-third of all babies in Bangladesh and 1/4 of the      babies in India are born underweight and malnourished. This      compares to 12 percent in Africa.       The question is--Why are these rates so high in Bangladesh      and India, countries which are food self-sufficient? In fact,      India has more than 40 million tons of surplus food in      storage.       Why are the rates of malnutrition higher in South Asia than      in Africa, which we know is considerably less developed? In      1996, UNICEF commissioned a landmark study to answer that      question. In a report called, ``The Asian Enigma'', they      concluded, ``The exceptionally high rates of malnutrition in      South Asia are rooted deep in the soil of inequality between      men and women.''       Women eat last and least. They eat only the food that is      left over after the males have eaten. Often men and boys      consume twice as many calories--even though women and girls      do much of the heavy work. Girls in India are four times more      likely to suffer from acute malnutrition than boys.           When women and girls are deprived, society suffers       Next, let's examine the effects this deprivation has on      society.       We've always been clear that the health of the mother is      the single most important factor in determining the health of      her child. New scientific data makes it clear that it is not      just her health when she is pregnant, or even throughout her      entire life, but going back to when she herself was in the      womb. And so, let me describe for you the insidious ``cycle      of malnutrition'' that persists in South Asia.       A baby girl in India and Bangladesh is born underweight and      malnourished. She is nursed less and fed less nutritious food      than her brother. She is often denied health care and      education. She is forced to work even as a child. Her work      burden increases significantly as she gets older--even when      she is pregnant. She is married and pregnant when she is      young, often just a teenager. She is underweight and      malnourished when she gives birth to her children who are      born underweight and malnourished. And the cycle continues.       Even in the Punjab, the region of India where the green      revolution was most successful, this cycle and these high      rates of malnutrition still persist.                              New Research       It has been clear for some time that maternal deprivation      and subsequent fetal deprivation cause children to be highly      susceptible to infectious diseases like tuberculosis and      malaria.       New research shows that maternal deprivation also makes the      body susceptible to diseases we associate with affluence--     hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, among      others. In the next 20 years, India will have the largest      number of diabetic patients, and coronary heart disease will      become the leading cause of mortality.       This new research underscores that what begins as the      neglect and discrimination of women ends in causing adversity      for the health and survival of all.                           Women as Producers       Now as to the role of women as producers: just as we must      learn to think ``women'' when we think ``hungry people''--we      must think ``women'' when we think food producers in the      developing world. And, I regret to say, we do not. Women have      been largely bypassed by development assistance and programs      focused on agriculture.       Rural women are responsible for half of the world's food      production and produce 60 to 80 percent of the food in most      developing countries.       In sub-Saharan Africa, women food farmers produce 80      percent of Africa's food, do the vast majority of the work to      process, transport, store and market Africa's food, and they      also provide 90 percent of the water, wood and fuel. Food      processing alone creates a heavy work load for women. In      parts of Africa, women spend four hours a day grinding grain.       They do all this, despite the fact that they own 1 percent      of the land, receive less than 7 percent of farm extension      services, and receive less than 10 percent of the credit      given to small-scale farmers.                     Effects of HIV/AIDS in Africa       If this reality weren't challenging enough, we must also      recognize that the impact of HIV/AIDS on agricultural      production and food security has been devastating. Families      affected by HIV/AIDS see their food production cut by 40%.       This epidemic in Africa is spiraling out of control because      men have multiple partners and unsafe sex, and women because      of their     low status are kept uninformed about prevention and powerless      to protect themselves. Twice as many young women as men are      infected.       Bottom line--there is a direct correlation between women's      low status, the violation of their human rights, and HIV      transmission. In epidemiological terms, persuading 10 men      with several partners to engage in safe sex has far greater      impact than enabling one thousand women to protect themselves      from their only partner. The 10 men are at the beginning of      the chain of infection; the 1,000 women are its last link.               Violence against women impedes development       The other health hazard is violence against women. Violence      against women continues to devastate millions of women      worldwide, destroying families and impeding development.       In this new century--in the year 2003--it is sobering to      acknowledge that many societies still find it acceptable and      justifiable to beat--rape--stone--burn--disfigure and murder      women. When one group of people in society is treated as      inferior to another--the only way to keep that lie in place      is by violence and the threat of violence.             Women's invisible work in the informal sector       The majority of women in the developing world work in      agriculture. But a significant portion also work in the      informal sector. Their work remains largely invisible in      official statistics, because it takes place outside the      formal economic structure.       Women work as--vendors, weavers, potters, handicraft      workers, laundry workers, and manual laborers. Women may be      poor, illiterate and undernourished, but they are      economically active. They contribute significantly to the      economy and society with their labor.       Let me give you a specific example of the importance of      women's work--regardless of how invisible it is:       In India, young girls and women include in their daily work      collecting and drying of cow dung which is used primarily as      fuel in most of rural India where 75 percent of the      population lives. Their work saves India at least $10.5      billion a year that would otherwise need to be spent on      petroleum. It is estimated that, if the Indian women went on      strike and no longer collected cow dung, India would be in an      economic crisis in three weeks.                           Women's Leadership       The third critical link--between women and ending hunger is      women's leadership. In countries with the persistence of      hunger, women bear full responsibility for the key issues in      ending hunger: family health, nutrition, sanitation,      education and increasingly--family income. Yet women are      systematically denied the information, education and freedom      of action they need to fulfill these responsibilities.       When women have more voice in decision making in the home,      their families are healthier, better nourished and better      educated. In Brazil, as well as other countries, research      shows that income in the hands of mothers has four times the      impact on child nutrition as the same income in the hands of      fathers.       When women gain voice in decision making in their villages,      they have the opportunity to alter the development agenda to      address issues critical to meeting basic needs. They take      action against dowry, domestic violence, child marriage and      child labor. Women in positions of leadership begin to      transform gender relations and to call into question the      deeply entrenched patriarchal system. They help other women      to know their rights.       In India and Bangladesh, there is now an extraordinary      opportunity. New laws guarantee that \1/3\ of all seats in      elected local government are reserved for women. As a result,      in the region of the world where women have been the most      subjugated--more than 5 million women have engaged in the      political process by standing for elections and 1 million      women have become elected local leaders--more elected women      than in all the other countries of the world combined.       I consider this transfer of power to these one million      elected women--who themselves are often illiterate and      malnourished--to be a potent and direct intervention in the      persistence of hunger.               When women are empowered--society benefits       Now let's examine what happens to a society when women are      empowered. The evidence is overwhelming--women's empowerment      has the most far-reaching effects on the lives of all--men,      women and children. Let's examine some of this evidence:       A recent analysis of development by the World Bank      indicates that countries with smaller gaps between women and      men in areas such as education, employment and property      rights have lower child malnutrition and mortality, they also      have less corruption in governance and faster economic      growth.       Cross-country studies report that if the Middle East, South      Asia and Africa had been as successful as East Asia in      narrowing the gender gap only in education, the Gross      National Product (GNP) per capita in these regions would have      grown by an additional 16 to 30 percent from 1960 to 1990.       In sub-Saharan Africa, if women farmers were given the same      support as that given to men their yields could increase by      more than 20 percent. And, it is now clear that women's      empowerment is more influential than economic growth in      moderating fertility rates, thereby slowing population      growth.       Bottom line: women are at the center of the development      process. When they are empowered these are the results:      faster economic growth, less corruption in governance, lower      childhood malnutrition, lower child mortality, increased      agricultural production, more children in school, including      girls, health hazards are reduced, and the overall health and      wellbeing of a society is greatly improved.    The gap between recognition of women's vital role and policies,                           programs and action       Even though the evidence is overwhelming and there is      increasing recognition that women are the key to sustainable      development--the gap between this recognition, and policies,      programs, and action is enormous.       Now let's look at 3 examples:       First, the International Conference on Financing for      Development--known as the Monterrey Summit. The Monterrey      Summit did address issues like good governance, people-     centered development, and global responsibility--but the      vital role of women in achieving sustainable development was      not recognized. The words ``gender sensitive'' made it into      the final Monterrey Consensus document, but the four people      who control the world's purse-strings--President Bush, the      heads of the World Bank, IMF and the European Commission      never once mentioned the vital role of women. In fact, the      word ``woman'' was used only once among these four keynote      speakers and that was in reference to micro credit.       Regarding the 2001 New Partnership for Africa's Development      (NEPAD)--we need to know that this charter does not come      close to recognizing that women are key to development. In      fact, women are not adequately included in any section of its      analytical framework or its plan of action.       Now let's look at the constitutional amendment which      guarantees women \1/3\ of the seats in local village councils      in India. It was passed by one vote. The amendment continues      to be under attack, and is in danger of being repealed.                            Recommendations       Given that women are at the center of the development      process:       1. I recommend that women be placed in high level decision-     making positions in all international organizations.       2. All legislation--budget allocations--and programs      related to development must specifically empower women as the      key change agents to achieve sustainable development.                          ____________________
