 President, let me add to the comments of my friend from Connecticut. It is interesting that the Senator from Connecticut mentioned the portraits outside the Senate and those who have been selected to have their likenesses there because of their great contributions to the Senate.  I remember actually introducing the Senator from West Virginia at an event in my State in which I made that very point: That in the future, when they are determining which great Senators of the current period to add, the Senator from West Virginia will certainly be among them. In my view, he is the greatest orator in the Senate today and certainly in my 18 years here, I have had a chance to listen to them all.  The Senator from West Virginia is without peer in this body. To listen to his skills applied to our friend and colleague from Massachusetts is a treat on a Monday afternoon, and I thank him for his contribution.
