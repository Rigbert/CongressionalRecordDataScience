Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, the events of September 11 have brought to life the heroism displayed by our public safety officers and those who assist them in the line of duty. This tragedy has also created many unique and unfortunate situations that have not been fully contemplated prior to September 11. In these cases, we have a responsibility as a Congress to act so that our laws treat fairly those who die in the line of duty.  Father Mychal F. Judge, a priest who years earlier had consoled the families of TWA Flight 800 after it exploded off of Long Island and who had gone on a recent peace mission to Northern Ireland, had been a chaplain with the New York City Fire Department since 1992. He was ministering to the victims at the World Trade Center when a rain of debris showered upon him, resulting in his death.  This legislation is given a short name in recognition of Father Judge and his efforts while addressing two concerns which his situation has brought to light. Under current law, the Bureau of Justice Assistance is directed to make payment of monetary benefits to the survivors of public safety officers who are killed in the line of duty. This bill addresses any ambiguity in existing law by specifically naming chaplains who are in service as being eligible for the same benefits as other public service officers.  Under current law, benefits may only be paid to the spouse, child or parent of the deceased. H.R. 3297 allows benefits to be paid to whomever the chaplain has designated as the beneficiary of his or her life insurance policy in the event that the deceased has no living spouse, child or parent. In the case of Father Judge, the benefit would go to his two surviving sisters.  I urge all Members to support this legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
