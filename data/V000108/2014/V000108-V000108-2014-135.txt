Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman's remarks and would also point out that the committee has raised significant questions regarding duplication with service-related facilities and services by the Special Forces.  More importantly--and I think this is key--we must be careful not to create or give the perception that we are treating Special Forces differently than anyone else who serves this country in uniform.  Anyone who puts the uniform of the United States military on, they are all special. I strongly oppose the gentleman's amendment.  I reserve the balance of my time.
