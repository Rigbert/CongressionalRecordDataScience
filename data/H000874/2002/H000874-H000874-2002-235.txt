Chairman, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Ms. McCarthy).  (Ms. McCARTHY of Missouri asked and was given permission to revise and extend her remarks.)  Ms. McCARTHY of Missouri. Mr. Chairman, I commend the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ney) with regard to his work on election reform which was very bipartisan and passed this House nearly unanimously. That is why I am troubled today with having him stand up and present a bill for our support that he opposes personally, and opposes the bill we all seek, which has bipartisan support and will genuinely reform our campaign laws.  To reform election laws and campaign laws in the same session would enforce in people's mind that we have indeed our process up here and restored integrity to our election system.
