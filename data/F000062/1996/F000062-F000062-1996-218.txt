 President, I rise today to bring some thought and consideration to the 48th anniversary of Sri Lanka's independence from colonial rule.  Sri Lanka, which had been dominated by Portuguese, Dutch, and, of course, one and a half centuries of British rule, has emerged in the final decades of this century as a nation firmly committed to democracy and the rule of law.  The last few years have brought tremendous gains for democracy and freedom throughout the world, and while we applaud the successes in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, we should not overlook the progress this island of some 17 million citizens has made on its own.  Since 1982, when J.R. Jayewardene was elected the first post-colonial president, Sri Lanka has held regular national elections notable for their peaceful transitions of power between its two major political parties: the United National Party [UNP] and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party [SLFP], or coalitions led by them.  Sri Lanka's third presidential election was held on November 9, 1994 with former Prime Minister Chandrika Kumaratunga winning with 62 percent of the vote. Voter turn-out was an impressive 70.5 percent. The most recent parliamentary elections were held in Sri Lanka on August 16, 1994, with the UNP and the SLFP winning a roughly equal number of seats.  President Kumaratunga intends to continue with wide-ranging, significant economic reforms that are moving Sri Lanka away from state controls and subsidies to a more decentralized, market-oriented system. This has allowed Sri Lanka to maintain a significant 5 percent average annual growth rate throughout the last decade.  Sri Lanka has also proven its commitment to providing for the basic human needs of its people. Since independence, successive Sri Lankan Governments have maintained a policy of free education from the primary level through the university level. The literacy rate, for both men and women alike, is an impressive 90 percent. The Sri Lankan Government also provides an extensive program of free health care, which includes child immunization. Sri Lanka boasts an average life expectancy of 70 years and an infant mortality rate of 19/1000 which is highly remarkable for this region of the world.  The United States has ties with Sri Lanka dating back to the nineteenth century, ties that have greatly strengthened since Sri Lanka's independence. We are now Sri Lanka's biggest trading partner with our annual bilateral trade standing at $1.4 billion. We also maintain ties to Sri Lanka through bilateral educational, information and cultural programs. The United States has a continuing, active Peace Corps Volunteer Program there, and has operated a Voice of America Station in Sri Lanka for more than 40 years.  Unfortunately, Sri Lanka continues to experience the tragedies of political violence, resulting primarily from the Tamil insurgency in the North and, to a lesser extent, from a mainly Sinhalese group in the South. The news we hear about Sri Lanka here in the United States all too often focuses only on these ongoing conflicts, which have brought death and suffering to Sri Lanka for over 10 years.  It is my hope that Sri Lanka will one day resolve its internal disputes and that peace will return to this nation which has demonstrated such an impressive commitment to democracy. President Kumaratunga has expressed her intention to seek a political solution to the ethnic conflicts and has announced a set of proposals aimed at devolving power to the regions. She has also reiterated her pledge to address minority grievances through dialog and negotiation.  On the 48th anniversary of Sri Lanka's independence, I would like to express my support to President Kumaratunga as she works to determine a lasting solution to the ethnic conflicts in Sri Lanka. I share her hope that peace, reconciliation, and a system of nonviolent negotiation between all parties will soon prevail for the people of Sri Lanka.                          ____________________
