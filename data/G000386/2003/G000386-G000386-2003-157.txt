 President, I understand the concerns of the Senator from Montana, and look forward to continuing to work with him to reauthorize the TANF program in the coming months. I appreciate his concern for the need for Montana to pursue welfare policies it believe make sense in that State. I agree that we will discuss these and other issues as we reauthorize the TANF program and am also optimistic we will be able to reach an understanding on these policies.  Mr. President, current law penalizes rural and small urban facilities by paying them 1.6 percent less on every inpatient discharge than their counterparts in urban areas of a million or more people. This is one reason for MedPAC's finding that Medicare inpatient profit margins are substantially worse for rural and small urban facilities than for those located in large urban areas.  The provision raises the inpatient base rate for hospitals in rural and small urban areas to the same rate as that in large urban areas from October 1, 2003 through March 31, 2004. Every State except Rhode Island has rural or small urban hospitals, so 49 States will benefit from this provision.  The fiscal year 2003 omnibus Appropriations bill included a 6-month version of this policy. The policy ends on September 30, 2003. A permanent version of this policy was included in the Senate- and House-passed prescription drug bills this summer. MedPAC has endorsed a permanent version of this policy in its 2003 recommendations.  The cost of the provision is $300 million, for the 6-month period beginning October 1, 2003 and ending March 31, 2004, according to preliminary scores from CBO.  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the preliminary CBO estimates.
