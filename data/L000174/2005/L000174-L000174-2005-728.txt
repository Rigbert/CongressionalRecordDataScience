President, this is a matter which I and my friend from California, Senator Boxer, will be speaking about later this afternoon, and that is the tragic death of a remarkable young Californian, Marla Ruzicka.  Marla was the founder of a humanitarian organization devoted to helping the families of Afghan and Iraqi civilians who have been killed or suffered other losses as a result of U.S. military operations. She died in Baghdad on Saturday from a car bomb while she was doing the work she loved and for which so many people around the world admired her.  In fact, Tim Rieser, in my office, has worked closely with her. We received e-mails about the work she was doing, and even photographs of people she was helping arrived literally minutes before she died.  I will speak later today about this. But she was a remarkable person. When I spoke with her family in California yesterday, I told them this was a life well worth living, that most people would not accomplish in their lifetime what this 28-year-old wonderful woman accomplished in hers.                          ____________________[Page S3773]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                             MARLA RUZICKA
