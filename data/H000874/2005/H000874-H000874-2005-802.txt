Speaker, I thank the gentleman for referencing the Committee on Ways and Means, but I certainly agree with him that having the gentleman from California (Mr. Thomas) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Rangel) work closely together, and perhaps their respective Chairs of the subcommittees that might deal with that work together, would be very, very useful to accomplishing an objective as opposed to simply passing a bill that then languishes in the Congress and never gets to the President.  If, in fact, we consider that, and it sounds to me like we certainly do not have enough information to determine whether or not the week after next the energy bill might be on the floor, but if and when it comes to the floor, Mr. Leader, would you contemplate the possibility of having an open rule on that piece of legislation, given its importance and scope?  I am happy to yield to the gentleman for a response, Mr. Speaker.  Mr. DeLAY. I appreciate the gentleman yielding to me, Mr. Speaker.  We have not discussed any rule. Actually, we are discussing with the relevant committee chairmen whether we can get it that quickly or not. But I would imagine that the Committee on Rules would have the same sort of rule that we have had on this bill for the last couple of years. So I would not see anything changing.
