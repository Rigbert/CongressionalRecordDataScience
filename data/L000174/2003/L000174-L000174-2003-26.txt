President, the Burlington Free Press recently ran a story about expansion plans by Green Mountain Coffee Roasters in Waterbury, VT. The company has begun work on a 52,000-square-foot warehouse and distribution center that will significantly expand manufacturing capacity. Under the leadership of Bob Stiller, Green Mountain Coffee has consistently been rated one of the fastest growing and best managed small public companies in the United States.  Small businesses are the backbone of Vermont's economy, and Green Mountain Coffee has been an outstanding corporate partner in our State for over 20 years. Started in a small cafe in Waitsfield, VT, in 1981, growing into a publicly traded company in 1993, and now announcing this $8.4 million expansion in Waterbury, Green Mountain has been a national leader in the specialty coffee market and an international leader in promoting fair trade coffee.  I commend Bob and all the employees at Green Mountain Coffee for their success at not only selling great coffee but also promoting sustainable farming throughout the world. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the article that appeared in the Burlington Free Press be printed in the Record so that all Senators can read about the success of this company.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Burlington Free Press, Nov. 6, 2003]                       GMC Has Expansion Brewing       Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc. plans to begin      construction this month on a 52,000-square-foot warehouse and      distribution center in Waterbury in an $8.4 million project      that's intended to also expand the specialty coffee company's      manufacturing capacity, the company said Wednesday.       ``We are impressed with Waterbury's support, which enables      us to expand our facilities in the downtown Waterbury      location contiguous to our manufacturing and roasting      operations,'' Green Mountain Coffee Chairman and CEO Robert      Stiller said.       Green Mountain Coffee said the company expects to save      money over the long term thanks to new automation equipment      to be installed in the new building. The additional warehouse      space also will allow for more product diversity and      eliminate outside storage expenses.       This expansion will mean the company's packaging,      warehousing and distribution capacities will match its      current coffee roasting capacity of about 40 million to 50      million pounds.       Moving functions into the new building will allow Green      Mountain Coffee to increase its packaging capacity in its      65,000-square-foot plant that houses its roasting, warehouse      and distribution operations, the company said.       The company expects the building to be finished by fall      2004, and the transfer of distribution and warehousing      functions completed by the spring 2005.       ``This expansion is critical to our success in executing      our long-term growth plans to be the leader in roasting and      selling specialty coffee to a broad array of customers,''      Stiller said.                          ____________________
