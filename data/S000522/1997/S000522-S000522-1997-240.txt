Mr. Speaker, over the last year, we have witnessed a steady deterioration in the human rights situation in Belarus. Belarusian President Alyaksandr Lukashenka has flouted international commitments by infringing on the human rights of the citizens of Belarus. He has violated elementary human rights and freedoms, such as freedom of speech, assembly and association, and has stifled democracy by clamping down on the media, on the democratic opposition, and on fledgling nongovernmental organizations. Lukashenka has amassed near-dictatorial powers, using an illegitimate constitutional referendum held last November to extend his power, disbanding the Parliament and creating a new legislature and constitutional court subservient to him.  The international community has widely censured Lukashenka for his blatant disregard for international commitments. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe [OSCE] has repeatedly called upon the Government of Belarus to respect human rights and democratic principles, to enter into dialog with the opposition and to ensure freedom of the media. The chairman in office of the OSCE has stated that neither the preparations for the November 1996 referendum nor the new constitution comply with OSCE norms, principles, and commitments. The OSCE hopes to send a mission to Belarus this month if it receives assurances that the mission can meet with members of the opposition.  Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, the human rights situation in Belarus has taken a turn for the worse in recent weeks. Last week, on April 3, the leadership of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe--Helsinki Commission--wrote to President Lukashenka expressing our dismay at recent developments in Belarus and urging President Lukashenka to reverse the deterioration of human rights in his country and live up to obligations freely undertaken as an OSCE member.  Mr. Speaker, I request that the letter be included in the Record.                                        Commission on Security and                                        Cooperation in Europe,                                    Washington, DC, April 3, 1997.     His Excellency Alyaksandr Lukashenka,     President, Republic of Belarus,     Miensk, Belarus.       Dear President Lukashenka: We are writing to express our      heightened concern about the further deterioration in the      human rights situation in your country and to protest a      series of actions by your government in blatant violation of      OSCE principles and norms.       Within the last few weeks, two American citizens, including      a U.S. diplomat, have been expelled from Belarus. First      Secretary Serge Alexandrov was unjustly and illegally      detained and expelled for observing an opposition rally, a      routine practice of diplomats. A few days earlier, on March      16, Belarusian Soros Foundation Executive Director Peter G.      Byrne was prevented from reentering Belarus, detained, held      incommunicado for over 12 hours in flagrant violation of      diplomatic and consular conventions in effect between the      United States and Belarus, and forcibly expelled the next      day. Mr. Byrne ostensibly was expelled for illegal activity,      but in reality, was expelled for supporting efforts to      develop Belarus' fledgling civil society.       These expulsions come on the heels of other repressive      actions, including arrests and beatings of demonstrators who      have been protesting your policies over the last few months.      Organizers of these rallies, such as former Chairman of      Parliament Mechyslau Hryh have received stiff fines or have      been arrested and jailed for up to 15 days. We are alarmed by      reports of beatings that resulted in injuries and detentions      of several hundred protestors and journalist during      yesterday's demonstrations in Miensk.       We are deeply concerned about the Belarusian Government's      restrictions on the right to freedom of speech and assembly--     as manifested by your March 5 decree which also bans the      display of Belarusian national symbols at rallies--and the      arrest of peaceful protestors, as well as journalists, at a      number of these rallies. We are also alarmed by the political      intimidation of leading opposition figures, as illustrated by      police visits to their homes demanding they admit they      violated a presidential edict that restricts demonstrations,      and by police searchers of various political party      headquarters. In February, two opposition leaders were      attacked in Miensk in separate incidents by unidentified      assailants under suspicious circumstances. Also, we have      received reports of the intimidation of university professors      and other examples of crude threats by police against      democratic activists.       We are especially troubled by the plight of Henadz      Karpenka, Deputy Chairman of the 1996 parliament and chair of      the opposition shadow cabinet, who was on a hunger strike to      protest the special police guard placed outside his ward in a      hospital where he is currently a patient.       Another example of apparent intimidation is the March 10      decree calling into question important tax exemptions granted      to the Belarusian Soros Foundation and other non-governmental      organizations and the March 18 announcement that all      nongovernmental     organizations in the country will be investigated. We      understand that these investigations by government security      officials have commenced.       Furthermore, freedom of the media in your country continues      to be assailed, most recently by the withdrawal of press      accreditation from and the expulsion of Russian NTV reporter,      Alexander Stupnikov, the March 23 decree banning of several      Russian television networks from broadcasting footage from      Belarus, and the recent announcement by your government that      all foreign journalists must obtain new accreditation.       Earlier this year, OSCE Chairman-in-Office and Danish      Foreign Minister Helveg-Petersen, urged your government to      take action to respect fully OSCE norms, principles and      commitments, to enter into dialogue with the opposition and      to ensure freedom of media. Unfortunately, actions since that      time have only further called into question your government's      commitments under the Helsinki Final Act and subsequent OSCE      agreements. We urge you to take to heart the concerns of the      OSCE and other international entities, as well as individual      countries, including the United States, and to begin to      reverse the serious deterioration of human rights that has      occurred in your country during the last year.       Mr. President, last week you spoke to your countrymen about      the international isolation that Belarus is now facing. The      best way that you can prevent this international isolation,      if you so desire, is to live up to obligations you have      freely undertaken as an OSCE member.           Sincerely,     Christopher H. Smith,       Co-Chairman.     Steny H. Hoyer,       Ranking Member.     Alfonse D'Amato,       Chairman.     Frank Lautenberg,       Ranking Member.                          ____________________
