Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Chairman, one standard element of obtaining a criminal conviction is that the defendant has the appropriate criminal intent.  Now, under the bill without the Scott amendment, if the taxicab driver does not have the criminal intent which includes knowledge of what is going on, then the taxicab driver and the company cannot be convicted. If they do have the criminal intent to evade a State parental involvement law, then they ought to be convicted of transporting the minor across the State line.  What the Scott amendment does is effectively immunize transporters who have criminal intent, and that is why the amendment ought to be defeated. I urge the membership to vote ``no.''  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.
