Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York for yielding me the time; and I wish to join my colleagues this evening in paying special tribute to our dear and able and incredibly hardworking Member of this House, Congressman Ben Gilman of New York, an ambassador for our country at home and abroad, someone whose knowledge is unparalleled.  As I said recently to the Governor of New York, when the day comes for Ben Gilman to cast his last vote here, I would hope that there would be a way for him to become an ambassador at large. I would give him without portfolio, and I would give him the toughest problems in the world, and we have sure got a couple of those right now because I know that I would have a completely honest, extraordinarily knowledgeable, very experienced diplomat, someone who understands the Congress and who has dedicated his life to building peace, to building understanding, to building alliances and maintaining those alliances, understanding the importance of those alliances and knows world leaders on a first-name basis.  There is not a corner of the world where he cannot go and be received. So I think it is important for the American people to know that the institutional memory that exists with this man is unparalleled in the executive branch. I cannot find one person over there, regardless of administration, that can compare to what this man has done.  So I wanted to add my words of commendation this evening to urge the Bush administration to give Ben a very brief sabbatical and then give him a really hard job and he would have entree here in the Congress whenever he would choose to come back.  I want to thank him for his deep friendship on both sides of the aisle, to his wife, Georgia, who is his constant companion, to his family. Thanks to the citizens of New York for sending this incredibly gifted man to serve in this House.
