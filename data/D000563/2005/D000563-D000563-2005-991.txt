 If I can ask either Senator--both served in the military, and the Senator from South Carolina in the Judge Advocate General Corps--it strikes me this is an important thing for our troops, to give them clarity, in terms of policy. I would ask the Senator from South Carolina if, in his visits to Guantanamo or visits with other military personnel, he has found that sentiment.
