 It is a long question, but I certainly want my friend from New Jersey to respond to that question.  I ask my colleague from New Jersey, is this legislation smacking of the worst form of colonialism, in the sense that it takes away all of the important democratic rights of the American citizens of Puerto Rico? Basically, four Republicans, who likely believe in strong austerity programs, will essentially be running that island for the indefinite future. Would my friend from New Jersey agree this is colonialism at its worst?
