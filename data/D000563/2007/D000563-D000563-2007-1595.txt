President, I would say to my friend from Iowa, that is why I was asking the questions because I think the questions get beyond the word ``noninterference'' into the reality of the choice we are suggesting.  I do not believe it is an interference to the rights of seniors eligible under Medicare Prescription Part D to give them an additional choice. And that is all we are asking: Allow Medicare to offer to the seniors another choice. They can reject it. They can accept it. I do not think that is mandatory or interfering.  I think, frankly, that a free-market Republican such as my good friend from Iowa would grasp that as a good option. It means the private insurance companies would then have to do their best to compete with Medicare. If Medicare offers a better plan, seniors can take it. If it does not, they can take private insurance options that are currently available.
