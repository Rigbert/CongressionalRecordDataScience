Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the Speaker's table the bill (H.R. 3212) to ensure compliance with the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction by countries with which the United States enjoys reciprocal obligations, to establish procedures for the prompt return of children abducted to other countries, and for other purposes, with the Senate amendment thereto, and concur in the Senate amendment.  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
