R. 1628, the American Health Care Act, to the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions for further consideration to ensure that it does not endanger the health of women. This closed-door, fast-track process is no way to make decisions that affect the health of every single woman in this country. It is imperative that we fix this legislation in an open, regular-order committee process.  I ask unanimous consent that the motion be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                   Motion to Commit With Instructions       Mrs. Murray moves to commit the bill H.R. 1628 to the      Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions with      instructions to report the same back to the Senate in 3 days,     not counting any day on which the Senate is not in session,      with changes that--       (1) are within the jurisdiction of such committee; and       (2) eliminate provisions that make it harder for women to      access health care, by--       (A) preventing women from accessing care through trusted      health care providers;       (B) allowing or requiring insurance companies to offer      plans that do not fully cover women's health care needs;       (C) charging women more for coverage; or       (D) ripping away women's access to the coverage they      receive today.
