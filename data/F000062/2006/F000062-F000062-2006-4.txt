 President, I rise today to discuss the assurances my friend and colleague from Oregon and I have received from U.S. Trade Representative, USTR, Susan Schwab and Assistant Secretary of Commerce David Spooner about the import monitoring program on Vietnamese textiles and apparel. In response to concerns raised by Senator Dole and Senator Graham about the impact of Permanent Normal Trade Relations, PNTR, for Vietnam, Ambassador Schwab and Secretary of Commerce Carlos Gutierrez wrote a letter stating their intention to monitor U.S. textile and apparel imports from Vietnam and self-initiate antidumping investigations if the normal elements of an antidumping case can be demonstrated. The Commerce Department will conduct a review every 6 months, and the program will last until the end of this administration. I ask the Senator from Oregon if he is aware of the concerns that have been raised about this program.
