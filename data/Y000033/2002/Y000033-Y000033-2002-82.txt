Mr. Speaker, I do agree with the gentleman's words and I insert into the Record at this point an exchange of letters between myself and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Boehlert) regarding H.R. 3609.         House of Representatives, Committee on Transportation and            Infrastructure,                                    Washington, DC, July 23, 2002.     Hon. Sherwood L. Boehlert,     Chairman, Committee on Science, Rayburn Building, Washington,          DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter of July 23,      2002, regarding H.R. 3609, the Pipeline Infrastructure      Protection to Enhance Safety and Security Act, and for your      willingness to waive consideration of provisions in the bill      that fall within your Committee's jurisdiction under House      Rules.       I agree that your waiving consideration of section 9 of      H.R. 3609 does not waive your Committee's jurisdiction over      the bill. I also acknowledge your right to seek conferees on      any provisions that are under your Committee's jurisdiction      during any House-Senate conference on H.R. 3609 or similar      legislation, and will support your request for conferees on      such provisions.       As you request, your letter and this response will be      included in the Congressional Record during consideration on      the House Floor.       Thank you for your cooperation in moving this important      legislation.           Sincerely,                                                        Don Young,     Chairman.                                  ____                                         House of Representatives,                                         Committee on Science,                                    Washington, DC, July 23, 2002.     Hon. Don Young,     Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,          House of Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Committee on Transportation and      Infrastructure has had under consideration H.R. 3609, the      Pipeline Infrastructure Protection to Enhance Security and      Safety Act. Section 9 of that bill falls under the      jurisdiction of the Committee on Science.       By waiving consideration of H.R. 3609 the Committee on      Science does not waive any of its jurisdictional rights and      prerogatives.       I ask that you would support our request for conferees on      H.R. 3609 or similar legislation if a conference should be      convened with     the Senate. I also ask that our exchange of letters be      included in the Congressional Record.        I look forward to working with you on this and other      important pieces of legislation.           Sincerely,                                                Sherwood Boehlert,                                                         Chairman.  Mr. Speaker, I yield whatever time he may consume to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Tauzin), chairman of the very powerful Committee on Energy and Commerce, a good friend.
