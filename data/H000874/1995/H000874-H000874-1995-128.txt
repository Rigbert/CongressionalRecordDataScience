Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  In closing, we are pleased to support this, but I would reiterate my personal concern, and I believe the concern of our side of the aisle, that as we save, as the gentleman from California [Mr. Thomas] has pointed out, $500,000, or thereabouts, from the Clerk's office, and we transfer the responsibility of unified point of entry and first entry into the FEC, it is, I think, agreed on both sides that there will be an additional cost to the FEC.  We have provided, by correspondence more than legislation, that of the $1.5 million for computerization, a portion of that can be used for the purposes of carrying out this additional responsibility that we transfer from the Clerk's office to the FEC.  We have no opposition to that, but I would like to observe that we must carefully review the capacity of the FEC to do those things which the public expects it to do. This will be a step in the right direction. But it will only be a step in the right direction if they have the capacity to do the job from an administrative standpoint, enter the data properly, have it accessible easily, and be able to respond to the public's questions.  I will be looking as a member of both the authorizing and the appropriating subcommittees that have responsibility to oversee FEC at the impact that this additional responsibility has on them with a view next year to make sure that they have sufficient funds to carry out what the American public believe to be an absolutely essential task of knowing where money comes from, where it goes, and what relationship, if any, it has to policy.
