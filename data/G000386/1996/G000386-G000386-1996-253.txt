 President, I rise today to salute an enterprise undertaken almost two decades ago by two community-oriented entrepreneurs in northeast Iowa. Declaring that radio for the Black community was an idea whose time had come, Jimmie Porter founded KBBG-FM radio in 1977 with his partner, Warren Nash, Jr., in Waterloo, IA. Incorporated as Afro-American Community Broadcasting, Inc., KBBG's charter pledged to fulfill the needs, interests and wishes of ethnic minority people in northeast Iowa.  KBBG has come a long way since its first equipment testing of 10 watts on July 26, 1978. On its first full day of broadcasting that August, KBBG reached a 4 to 5 mile radius. Today, the radio station boasts a 60-mile radius, 10,000 watts, and 11 employees.  The largest African American owned and operated noncommercial educational radio station in my State of Iowa, KBBG Radio has provided almost $1.8 million of public service announcements for nonprofit organizations in the last 8 years.  Mr. President, I proudly commend KBBG Radio, its owners and its employees for providing a valuable service to the Waterloo and Cedar Falls metro area and to northeast Iowa.  A model of self-development and community outreach, KBBG continues to build on its well-served motto, communicate to educate. Mr. President, I thank and congratulate KBBG for 18 years of service and extend my wishes for continued success in the future.                          ____________________
