Speaker, I rise today to recognize the extraordinary life of Philip Markowicz, who was a resident of Sylvania, Ohio and Aventura, Florida. Phil was also a renowned author and lecturer on the Holocaust and Judaism as a survivor of the Holocaust. As a business leader, he founded Phil's TV and Appliance in Toledo, Ohio.  Phil was born in 1924 in Przerab, Poland where he attended the Przedborz Yeshiva and was known as a Bible and Talmud prodigy, and had the intention of becoming ordained as a rabbi.  Unfortunately, the 1939 Nazi Invasion of Poland shutdown the Przedborz Yeshiva and as a teenager through the first years of World War II Phil was confined in the Lodz Ghetto working as a slave laborer under Nazi rule. He spent all of his nonworking time in intensive study of many of the classic works of history, philosophy and political thought, supplementing his orthodox religious studies.  When the Lodz Ghetto was dismantled, Phil was deported by the Nazis to the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp. He realized that staying there meant certain death and he sneaked into an outside work detail, avoiding the gas chambers and crematoria. Along with his brother, Henry, he survived slave labor concentration camps, disease, beatings and starvation, culminating in a death march, until he was liberated by the American forces in the spring of 1945. His body was wracked with typhus and tuberculosis and he weighed only 87 pounds. He and his brother were the only survivors of the Holocaust--their entire family had perished.  After a few months of recovery in a hospital, Phil was sent to a Displaced Persons camp in Germany where he was elected to the governing council. It was there that he met and married his wife, Ruth Fajerman Markowicz, who was also a Holocaust survivor, and they had a son, Allen Markowicz. The Markowicz marriage and the birth of their son were the first of each in the camp.  After waiting for five years, the family was permitted to immigrate to the United States in 1950, and upon arriving in Toledo, Ohio, Phil found employment, sometimes working two or three jobs at a time while studying the newly growing field of television and electronics. In less than 10 years Phil and his wife Ruth established a successful business, Phil's TV and Appliance, and added two daughters to their family, Sylvia and Diane.  Phil eventually resumed his study of Torah. He wrote a well-received memoir, My Three Lives. A musical oratorio which was inspired by Mr. Markowicz's life and philosophical writings, Tikvah (Hope), has been performed at the Toledo Museum of Art; in Champaign-Urbana, Illinois; at Bowling Green State University; at the Detroit Holocaust Memorial Museum; in North Carolina; at the Jewish Theater of the South in Atlanta; and was part of the Martin Luther King Memorial Week ceremonies in Atlanta in 2006. Phil was a featured interviewee on the award-winning documentary Bearing Witness: The Voices of Our Survivors.  Phil spoke on the Holocaust and on Torah at various venues, including Universities, secondary schools, religious institutions, seminars and Public Television. He was invited to lead religious services, read from the Torah and its accompanying Haftorah, and present sermons. Phil served as a president of the Tarbuth Society, one of the Torah study groups in which he participated, and was a member of Congregation B'nai Israel in Sylvania, Ohio and the Aventura Turnberry Jewish Center Synagogue in Aventura, Florida.  In addition to his wife, Ruth, he was preceded in death by his daughter, Diane Markowicz; his brother, Henry Markowicz; and the rest of his family in the Holocaust.  Phil will ultimately be remembered for his dedication to his family, and we offer his children, Dr. Allen and Sylvia, his nine grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren, and his friends our prayers. May they find comfort in the poignant and profound memories of what Phil endured and survived, and what his life has embodied for generations to come.                          ____________________
