 President, the health insurance system in our country has been broken for a very long time. For far too long, families and businesses across my home State of Washington have been forced to make some tough decisions, spending nights struggling or whispering after their kids go to bed about how to pay the bills and praying they do not get sick.  I am proud to say that is about to change. Over the course of months of work on this issue, I have noticed it is very easy for this debate to tip into the realm of abstractions, to focus on numbers and charts--to devolve into petty partisanship or ideological inflexibility. Too often real people get left out of this conversation--mothers and fathers who are scared they are going to lose their jobs; families scared they are going to lose their insurance; people with preexisting conditions who cannot get coverage and who know they are one hospital visit away from bankruptcy; small business owners who cannot afford another premium increase and who want to cover their employees but they cannot keep up with the rising costs; senior citizens who are forced to cut their pills in half to make them last twice as long; people who pay their premiums and like their doctors, but when they get sick they find out that some of the most personal choices in their lives are being made by their insurance companies.
