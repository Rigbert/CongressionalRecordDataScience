Mr. Speaker, I would like to extend a statement of appreciation to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey), who has worked along with us through these last several months in trying to bring this conference report to conclusion. There were differences, as anyone might expect. We did finally work out those differences. I expect we could find some controversy here in this bill; I think we could find areas that I do not agree with and areas that the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey) does not agree with. But, nevertheless, this is a good work product as we dealt with the many different institutions and principals who were involved in bringing this bill to conclusion.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
