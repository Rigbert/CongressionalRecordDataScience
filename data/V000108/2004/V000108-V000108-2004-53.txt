Speaker, it is with great admiration that I rise today to honor the memory of Mrs. Victoria Soto Candelaria for her lifelong contributions to her community. Victoria passed away unexpectedly on July 4, 2004. Victoria was a pioneer educator who touched the lives of numerous students, both in and out of the classroom. She was also a union leader, activist, and community advocate, and her numerous accomplishments are worthy of the highest commendation.  After earning a bachelor's degree from Indiana University and a master's degree from Purdue University, Victoria devoted twenty-nine years to the School City of East Chicago teaching English and Spanish. In 1987, she was elected President of the East Chicago, Indiana Federation of Teachers, Local 511, a position she held until 2001. Additionally, Victoria was President of the Indiana Teachers Federation from 1997 until 2003. As well as being dearly loved and respected by her family and community, Victoria was known for her passionate belief in helping to educate the working people in her community.  Victoria strongly believed in the importance of community involvement as well as political activism. She served as secretary of the Northwest Indiana Federation of Labor and as Vice President of the Indiana AFL-CIO. She also served on the Board of Directors for the Lake County Integrated Services Delivery and for the Lake Area United Way. Victoria was a trustee for Ivy Tech State College and for the Indiana Federation of Teachers. In the political arena, she was a member of the Indiana Governor's Roundtable on Education and a member of the Governor's Commission for Hispanic and Latino Affairs. She was a three time National Education Policy advisor to President Clinton, a delegate to the Indiana Democratic Convention, and a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1992 and 1996. Victoria received invitations to the presidential inaugurations in 1993 and 1997. She was also honored with the Sagamore of the Wabash in 1997.  While her work in the educational and political fields placed extraordinary demands on her time, Victoria always found time to spend with her most important interest, her family. By providing unwavering guidance to her children, she instilled in them the morals and fortitude that have molded her children into successful adults who are raising families of their own. She is survived by her loving husband of 42 years, Isabelino, three sons and one daughter, eight grandchildren, and a host of other relatives.  Mr. Speaker, Victoria Soto Candelaria dedicated her life to educating the nation's youth and serving as a leader and role model for all Americans. Because of her lifetime work and achievements, Mrs. Candelaria has been lauded as a tireless, passionate, and visionary advocate of the people. I respectfully ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in remembering Mrs. Candelaria and her outstanding contributions to Indiana's First Congressional District. She will be admirably remembered and truly missed.                          ____________________
