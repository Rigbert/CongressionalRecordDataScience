During hearings on this bill, the committee heard testimony from historian David Hackett Fischer, whose writings on the Revolutionary War point out George Washington's support for property rights and strong actions that he took to ensure that his soldiers respect the property of civilians, even when the property belonged to a Tory sympathizer.  Washington personally gave strict orders to forbid looting, even though plunder was the norm at the time, and even though many of his men were hungry, dressed in rags and marched barefoot in the snow. It is remarkable that in so desperate a situation with so noble a cause, he imposed on the Patriot side such a high standard on private property.  Washington's honorable policy stood in stark contrast to the routine seizure of booty by the British and Hessian troops. It is no accident over the course of the early years of the war, 1776 and 1777, in the battleground of New Jersey, a population that was once evenly divided in its loyal threw its support to the American cause. There are lessons we can learn from Washington's example.  In earlier battlefield protection efforts, the National Park Service uses its eminent domain powers to seize land from unwilling sellers. The justified resentment of this caused hurt and subsequent efforts.  Our enthusiasm for battlefield protection notwithstanding, I hope as we set out to preserve historic sites that we copy George Washington, not George III.  I reserve the balance of my time.
