President, this amendment is a very straightforward one. It would prohibit credit card companies from penalizing or terminating customers who pay their bills on time.  The core principle of this bankruptcy legislation that we are debating today is responsible borrowing, and being responsible for your debts. Here, we have a population of the most responsible borrowers, those who pay their bills timely and full each and every month. But what is happening is that there is a growing movement among credit card companies to penalize these individuals or to terminate their credit arrangements. I think it is wrong and I think we should do something about it here today.  The credit card industry claims it is too expensive to maintain these accounts. Frankly, if you look at the charges that they receive from merchants on each transaction, the very substantial interest rate that they charge for outstanding balances, and also the membership fees which now seem to be ubiquitous, those claims seem to be very hollow. Indeed, this should be an issue about not only responsibility but fairness, and also about whether we really do believe that if people conduct their lives appropriately, pay their bills on time, are responsible, that they should end up being penalized.  If we are talking, today, in this legislation, about responsible borrowing, how can we allow the most responsible borrowers in our society, ones who pay their bills each and every month, to be punished by these credit card companies?  I urge adoption of this amendment. I retain the remainder of my time.
