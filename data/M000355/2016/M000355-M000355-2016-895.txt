 President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session for the consideration of Calendar Nos. 519 through 545 and all nominations on the Secretary's desk; that the nominations be confirmed en bloc, and the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate; that no further motions be in order; that any statements related to the nominations be printed in the Record; that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate then resume legislative session.
