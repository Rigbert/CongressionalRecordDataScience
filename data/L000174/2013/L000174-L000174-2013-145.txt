President, I would like to take a moment to pay tribute to retired BG Douglas Kinnard, a former University of Vermont professor and retired general officer who passed away on July 29 of this year at the age of 91.  Long before I came to know General Kinnard, he had built a reputation as a wise and thoughtful soldier. Respected for his leadership and integrity on and off the battlefield, he honorably served our country in three wars, including two tours in Vietnam, despite his misgivings about American strategy and involvement in the conflict. Having graduated from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point on D-day during World War II, Douglas Kinnard rose to the rank of brigadier general before retiring from the Army to pursue his doctor of philosophy at Princeton University.  It is no surprise given his intellect and objectivity that when he went searching for his first faculty job, he found a home at the University of Vermont. Those who have worked with General Kinnard have praised him as an imposing figure that was ``always open and fair'' and an ``enjoyable colleague'' who taught his students about real patriotism from his own experience.  I am grateful that the University of Vermont was able to benefit from the many gifts General Kinnard brought with him to his work in Burlington and throughout the country. Marcelle and I send our condolences to his wife Wade and son Frederick. I will miss his steady counsel, which he provided me throughout my Senate career. The many soldiers, students, and colleagues who were fortunate to have known him throughout his long and industrious life will not soon forget his impact.  The Burlington Free Press recently paid tribute to General Kinnard and his many contributions. I ask unanimous consent that a recent Free Press article entitled ``Remembering UVM prof., ex-Army general Douglas Kinnard'' be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Burlington Free Press, Aug. 7, 2013]       The Two Accomplished Careers of Douglas Kinnard, 1921-2013                            (By Tim Johnson)       In 1977, midway through his faculty career at the      University of Vermont, ex-Army man Douglas Kinnard was      invited to appear on ``Good Morning America'' to talk about      the Vietnam War with his former commanding officer, William      Westmoreland.       The appearance preceded the publication of Kinnard's book,      ``The War Managers,'' which drew on a detailed survey Kinnard      had sent to all the American generals in Vietnam in 1974, a      year before U.S. forces finally withdrew. The survey      revealed, among other things, that about 70 percent of the      generals thought the war's objectives were unclear, and that      more than half thought the war shouldn't have been fought      with American troops.       Mark Stoler, a UVM historian who knew Kinnard, recalls      watching the show and thinking that Westmoreland looked      uncomfortable while Kinnard remained unruffled. ``He just sat      there, smiling,'' said Stoler, who recalled that Kinnard had      ``an incredibly sharp mind'' and was eminently clear-headed      about that controversial episode in American military      history.       Kinnard, who died of pneumonia last week in Pennsylvania at      age 91, spent about a decade in UVM's Political Science      Department during the 70s and 80s, in what for him was a      second career following 26 years as an Army officer and      service in three wars. He won the respect of his UVM peers      partly because of his intellect: He did, after all, complete      his Ph.D. work at Princeton in just three years, following      his retirement in 1970 as a brigadier general.       ``Very capable, very serious,'' said Garrison Nelson,      professor of political science. ``A remarkably well-organized      guy. A good teacher and a relatively high grader, as I      recall. I have very fond memories of Doug.''       Kinnard was also prolific. His first book on President      Eisenhower, an adaptation of his doctoral thesis, was also      published in 1977. ``The Secretary of Defense'' also came out      during his UVM tenure, in 1980, and he wrote about Vietnam      again later in ``The Certain Trumpet: Maxwell Taylor and the      American Experience in Vietnam.''       Among Kinnard's eight books were two memoirs, the first of      which details his life's remarkably humble beginnings.      ``Abandoned'' by a broken family at age 4 and placed in an      orphanage in Paterson, N.J., he was moved into a boarding      house after several months and raised by an extended Catholic      family.       ``He had to take care of himself,'' said his son, Frederick      Kinnard, in a phone interview. ``He was an adult before age      5. He lived with an old Irish spinster above a saloon.''       Kinnard made his way through Paterson's St. Joseph Grammar      School and Eastside High, became an Eagle Scout, and      eventually won an appointment to West Point. He didn't aspire      to be a soldier, he told an interviewer in 1977, but chose      West Point partly because it was close to home.       ``It was a good way to go to college,'' he said. ``I really      wasn't thinking about a military career.'' The Army became      his career, however, with a series of promotions. He      graduated on June 6, 1944--D Day--and was dispatched to      Europe where, as an artillery lieutenant and forward      observer, he was awarded the Bronze Star for Heroic      Achievement. During the Korean War, he served in an artillery      unit, and later was assigned to the Pentagon and to NATO      headquarters in France.       Kinnard did two tours in Vietnam. The first, beginning in      1966, was as chief of operations analysis under Gen.      Westmoreland. When he returned to the United States he was      promoted to brigadier general, but he was having doubts about      the war and mulling a career in academia. Of the war, he told      an interviewer for the Princeton Independent in 2004:       ``The more I dealt with [the war and U.S. strategy], the      more skeptical I became, especially about the assumption      underpinning [General] Westmoreland's and American strategy:      that if we punished the enemy enough, he would negotiate an      end favorable to us. I was convinced that we really did not      understand the enemy or his motivations, or even his      strategy. The premise that our punishment would bring us      victory was to build a strategy on a house of cards.''       Kinnard wanted to retire but the Army refused and sent him      to Vietnam again, in 1969, this time commanding artillerymen.      The Independent interviewer asked him how he felt about being      sent back to Vietnam, given his doubts about the war.       ``You must understand that I had already applied for      retirement, and that was turned down,'' he said. ``So when      the decision was made that I would definitely go back, then I      had to concern myself with my job and not worry about my      personal feelings. As Commanding General of Force Artillery,      I commanded eight thousand troops in sixty firebases from the      Cambodian border to the South China Sea. I had to visit those      people daily and get involved in the planning, so I had to      toss my personal feelings--gone! Nothing can stand in the way      of the welfare of your troops. Your job is to defeat the      enemy; your job is to take care of your     troops and keep your casualties down. And that's what I      did.''       Later in that tour he served as chief of staff of the      Second Field Force and aided in planning of the Cambodian      incursion of 1970, which incited fierce protests in the      United States. The U.S. bombing of Cambodia that had preceded      that operation was unknown to him, he said, as it was to the      American public.       After he returned home he retired and headed to Princeton      as a 48-year-old graduate student. He didn't conceal his      military background but didn't advertise it either. When he      started looking for a faculty job, he impressed his      interviewers at the University of Vermont.       ``He was an imposing presence,'' said Stoler, who shared      with Kinnard a scholarly interest in military history.       ``I remember Professor Kinnard as a very professional and      enjoyable colleague,'' said Frank Bryan, who retired from UVM      recently as a political science professor. ``Our areas of      expertise were different, of course, but I can say he was a      very good `department citizen'--always open and fair and      collegial.''       Nancy Viens was Kinnard's secretary at UVM for two years.      She typed ``The War Managers'' for him.       In the beginning, she said, ``I was very intimidated about      working for a 6-foot general from the Army. I'd signed (anti-     war) protest petitions and all that.''       He surprised her, though, telling her, ``I'm not your      average run-of-the-mill general.''       ``He turned out to be one of the nicest people I've ever      known,'' she said, adding that he kept in touch with her for      years after they both left UVM. Of the Vietnam War debates,      she said, ``He had sympathy for both sides. He did his job as      a general and then he got out.''       In the Independent interview, Kinnard was asked what he      taught UVM students about the Vietnam War.       ``I taught them that it was a war that should not have been      fought,'' he said. ``It should not have gone past the      advisory effort. I traced for them all the presidential      decisions that were made, going from Truman all the way up      through Nixon, and showed how each one led to another. But      those decisions were made at political levels; the generals      had no part in them.''       He acknowledged that patriotism could take many forms, and      that the war opponents had done the country ``a great      service.''       Following their joint appearance on ``Good Morning      America,'' Kinnard told the Independent interviewer,      Westmoreland gave him a ride to Laguardia Airport, and      Kinnard gave Westmoreland a copy of his book.       ``Well, God, he called me for a whole week, asking, `Who      said this?' and `Who said that?''' Kinnard recalled. ``I      said, I can't tell you that, General Westmoreland,' because I      had promised the respondents anonymity. I went away to Maine      for a week, and the book arrived in the mail with his notes      written on damn near every page.''       After Kinnard left UVM, he continued lecturing and writing,      holding positions at the University of Oklahoma, Naval War      College, National Defense University and University of      Richmond. In 1994, President Clinton appointed him to the      American Battle Monuments Commission and he helped plan the      World War II memorial on the National Mall.       ``He wasn't a retiring type,'' Frederick Kinnard said.       ``Doug Kinnard had the wonderful facility of being highly      knowledgeable and impeccably honest,'' said Sen. Patrick      Leahy, D-Vt., in an email. ``I've relied on his good judgment      for years. Marcelle and I were sorry to learn of his passing      and send condolences to his family.'' Besides his son,      Douglas Kinnard is survived by his wife, Wade Tyree Kinnard.      He will be buried at West Point Aug. 15.                          ____________________
