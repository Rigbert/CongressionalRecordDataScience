I thank the gentleman for yielding.  I rise in strong support of H.R. 3910, the companion legislation to S. 1609. This is a very important bill to the State of Alaska and the State of Washington.  I would like to compliment my friend, Mr. Larsen, for his work on this legislation.  I was originally a cosponsor of this. This is a much-needed bill for the management of fish in Alaska as well as in the State of Washington, where most of my fishermen do come from.  I would also like to thank Steny Hoyer, the majority leader, for bringing this bill to the floor and making sure it becomes a reality.  This is a bill that was strongly supported by the whole delegations from the State of Washington and from the State of Alaska, Senators as well as House Members. There was no objection to this legislation. It is an example of how we can work together on an issue that affects both areas. It is really much sought for by the industry itself. And I want to compliment everybody that worked on this legislation.
