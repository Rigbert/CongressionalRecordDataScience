 President, today we will have a period for morning business throughout the afternoon. Under a previous unanimous-consent agreement, we will vote on passage of the Military Construction appropriations bill at 5:30 p.m. today. The final 10 minutes prior to the vote is scheduled for closing remarks on the MILCON legislation. As a reminder, we have also reached an agreement for consideration of the Legislative Branch appropriations bill and will be scheduling that matter for tomorrow's session. As always, Members will be notified as additional votes are scheduled.  We have a number of other legislative and executive matters that are possible this week, including additional appropriations bills, the nomination of Porter Goss to be Director of the CIA, and an extension of various expiring family tax provisions.  Mr. President, I thank the Senate for its attention. I yield the floor.                          ____________________
