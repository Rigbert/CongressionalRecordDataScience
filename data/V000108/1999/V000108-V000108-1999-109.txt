Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I pay tribute to an outstanding citizen of Indiana's First Congressional District, Mrs. Vera Lillard-Young, of Gary, Indiana. After forty years of dedicated public service, Mrs. Vera Lillard-Young announced her retirement from the Child Welfare Unit of the Lake County Office of the Division of Family and Children on Friday, August 27, 1999.

Mrs. Vera Lillard-Young has dedicated a substantial portion of her life to the betterment of the people and families of Northwest Indiana. Her distinguished career with the Lake County Division of Family and Children has had a positive impact on our community. For more than forty years, she has served as an important figure within the Division of Family and Children. She has held several positions throughout her tenure, but none as important as Division Manager with the Child Welfare Unit, the position from which she retired in August of this year.  A 1945 graduate of Wendell Phillips High School in Chicago, Mrs. Vera Lillard-Young enrolled as a student at Woodrow Wilson Junior College, which she attended for two years. In 1950, she earned a Bachelor of Science in Biology from De Paul University. Mrs. Vera Lillard-Young continued her education by taking graduate courses at Indiana University Northwest with an emphasis in social work. Additionally, she has attended several social work seminars in Chicago as well as at the University of Georgia.  In 1958, Mrs. Vera Lillard-Young began her career in social work as a caseworker at what was formerly called the Lake County Department of Public Welfare, which is today known as the Lake County Division of Family and Children. She has held several positions while employed with the Lake County Division of Family and Children, including: Caseworker with the Aid to Dependent Children Unit in Hammond, Indiana; Supervisor with the Child Welfare Unit in Hammond, Indiana; Assistant Division Head with the Child Welfare Unit in Hammond, Indiana; Assistant Division Head with the Aid to Families with Dependent Children Unit in Gary, Indiana; Assistant Division Director with the Child Welfare Unit in Gary, Indiana; and Division Manager with the Child Welfare Unit in Gary, Indiana.  After forty years of dedicated service, Mrs. Vera Lillard-Young is retiring as Division Manager with the Child Welfare Unit of the LakeCounty Division of Family and Children. During her tenure with the Lake County Division of Family and Children, she instituted and organized a foster parent recognition dinner, served on the Corrective Action Committee which initiated new policies and procedures within the Lake County Division of Family and Children, and chaired the foster parent training committee. Additionally, she is an active member of St. Timothy's Community Church.  On this special day, I offer my heartfelt congratulations to Mrs. Vera Lillard-Young. Her large circle of family and friends can be proud of the contributions this prominent individual has made. Her exceptional work with the Lake County Division of Family and Children will be greatly missed. I sincerely wish Mrs. Vera Lillard-Young a long, happy, and productive retirement.                          ____________________
