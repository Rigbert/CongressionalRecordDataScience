Speaker, will the gentleman yield on one point?  As the gentleman is talking, I am thinking about when NAFTA was discussed here, and we were told President Salinas had the greatest democratic heart, with a small D, beating in this century. Can you imagine a President of the United States being so disgraced that he then is a man without a country?  That gentleman who headed Mexico now may be living in Ireland, for all we know, and his brother is in jail, and will be standing trial for drug-related charges, and we act, I mean the proponents act as if nothing happened.
