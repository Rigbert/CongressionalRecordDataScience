 President, today I am introducing legislation on behalf of myself and Senators Levin and Bryan that will offer consumers protection against unknowingly purchasing a vehicle that has been rebuilt after sustaining substantial damage in an accident.  The sale of rebuilt vehicles that have been wrecked in accidents has become a major national problem. According to the National Association of Independent Insurers, about 2.5 million vehicles are involved in accidents so severe that they are declared a total loss. Yet, more than a million of these vehicles are rebuilt and put back on the road.  In a report to the state Legislature, the California Department of Consumer Affairs found, with respect to California alone ``More than 700,000 structurally damaged and 150,000 salvaged vehicles are returned to streets and highways every year without a safety inspection, and they pose a potential hazard to all of California's twenty million unsuspecting motorists.''  In many cases, ``totaled'' cars are sold at auction, refurbished to conceal prior damage, then resold to consumers without disclosure of the previous condition of the car. The structural integrity of these vehicles has been so severely weakened that the potential for serious injury in an accident is greatly increased.  In one case, a teenage who purchased a rebuilt wreck was rendered quadriplegic after an accident in which her vehicle rolled 360 degrees at about five miles an hour. The vehicle had been in a previous accident. It had been badly repaired and then resold without disclosure of its previous condition. The vehicle's roof was replaced after the first accident, but in the subsequent accident, the roof collapsed when the substandard welds failed.  In another incident, a mother purchased a Honda Prelude for her daughter's high school graduation. Although only hail damage was reported at the time of sale, the car had actually been totaled in Texas and rebuilt in Arkansas. The repair shop acknowledged that they had spent only about $3,000 on repairs, despite an insurance company's estimate of over $10,000 worth of damage. The inadequate repair resulted in the collapse of the right front suspension inflicting a debilitating head injury on the driver.  In yet another case of fraud, Jimmy Dolan bought a used Toyota from a dealership in Clovis, California. The odometer had only 19,000 miles on it and he was told the car was like new and in original condition. In fact, that was untrue. The previous owner had been involved in a serious accident that required $8,700 in repairs. After a series of problems with the car, the original owner took it back to the dealership and traded it in. The dealership then resold the car to Jimmy Dolan for almost $14,000.  After only a minor accident, Mr. Dolan found out the truth about his car. He managed to trace the car back to the original owner who described the extent of the damage. Despite having full knowledge of the vehicle's history, the dealership refused to give Dolan a refund. Eventually, he had to file a civil lawsuit to recoup his losses.  These are just three cases in which serious physical and financial losses were inflicted on innocent victims who unknowingly purchased a vehicles that had sustained major damage.  The bill that I am introducing will address the problem of rebuilt wrecks by: providing nationwide written disclosure for every vehicle sale of previous salvage and major damage; providing widespread coverage for all vehicles including vehicles of any age or value, motor homes, pickups, and motorcycles; allowing states to maintain existing salvage laws; strengthening the Federal rebuilt vehicle database to promote instant access to vehicle accident histories for consumers, dealers, and law enforcement; requiring certification by a qualified repair facility of the proper repair of any salvage vehicle before it is returned to the road.  This bill has been endorsed by the Attorneys General of California, Connecticut, Iowa, and Michigan. In a letter of support, Attorneys General Blumenthal, Lockyer, and Miller state that this bill ``has strong disclosure requirements that will put consumers on notice before they agree to buy a car concerning any prior collision or flood damage.''  They also state ``We especially appreciate that this bill tracks the Resolution adopted in 1994 by the National Association of Attorneys General. That Resolution calls for the strong national standards and remedies that are provided for in this bill.''  Mr. President, I submit this letter for the record.  This bill also has the support of a number of consumer advocates including: Center for Auto Safety, ConsumerFederation of America, Consumers for Auto Reliability and Safety, Consumers Union, National Association of Consumer Advocates, Public Interest, and U.S. Public Interest Research Group.  In a letter of support from the National Association of Consumer Advocates, Pat Sturdevant writes ``This bill is entirely consistent with views of the major national consumer groups in that it would require disclosure of major damage to vehicles. Provide broad coverage of most used vehicles, prevent laundering or washing of titles to conceal prior damage, provide for effective criminal and civil enforcement, and provide a minimum standard of consumer protection while allowing states to offer stronger protection to their citizens.''  I submit this letter for the Record.  The bill is also strongly supported by the Automotive Recyclers Association and the Auto Dismantlers Association.  Mr. President, there is no question that the sale of rebuilt vehicles is a major national problem. We need to insure that we provide the proper solution. I believe that this bill is that solution and I urge my colleagues to support it.  I want to thank the Senators from Michigan and Nevada for their assistance with this legislation. Their input and support has been invaluable to the development of this bill. I ask that letters in support of the bill be printed in the Record.  The material follows:                                   Office of The Attorney General,                                         State of Connecticut,                                                   March 18, 1999.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senator, Washington, DC.     Re: The Salvaged and Damaged Motor vehicle Information          Disclosure Act       Dear Senator Feinstein: We are writing in order to express      our support for the Salvaged and Damaged Motor Vehicle      Information Disclosure Act, a bill which we understand you      and Senators Levin and Bryan intend to offer.       We are very aware of the harm caused to consumers who      unwittingly purchase used cars that had sustained major      damage. They not only pay far more than the vehicle's market      value, they may be placing themselves and their families in      danger.       Despite state efforts to vigorously enforce state laws      requiring car sellers to make salvage and damage disclosures,      the problem continues to be our nation's top consumer      compliant regarding used car sales. It is right for Congress      to act. However, in acting, Congress must protect consumers,      while permitting the states flexibility to deal with this      growing problem.        Your draft bill achieves those two major goals. It has      strong disclosure requirements that will put consumers on      notice before they agree to buy a car concerning any prior      collision or flood damage. It uses definitions that provide      strong baselines of protection, while permitting individual      states to impose tougher standards, if that is their choice.      It effectively deals with the problem of ``title-washing'' by      ensuring that information about prior collision or flood      damage remains on vehicle titles, regardless of the state of      titling. Finally, it provides strong remedies, by subjecting      violations to criminal penalties, civil law enforcement      actions by state attorneys general, and substantial private      civil remedies.       We especially appreciate that this bill tracks the      Resolution adopted in 1994 by the National Association of      Attorneys General. That Resolution calls for the strong      national standards and remedies that are provided for in this      bill.       Another reason we support this bill is that it follows the      successful mode of the federal odometer law, originally      enacted in the 1970's. That law provided for the same types      of strong national standards and remedies found in your bill.      States have relied on the federal odometer law to file many      civil and criminal law enforcement actions against odometer      spinners and have recovered millions of dollars in      restitution for consumers. Strong federal and state      enforcement, plus the private actions brought under the      odometer law, have put a real dent in odometer fraud. We look      forward to similar results as we join forces to tackle auto      salvage fraud.       Thank you for your leadership on this issue. We look      forward to working with you in the fight to protect used car      buyers.           Very truly yours,     Richard Blumenthal,                                  Attorney General of Connecticut.     Bill Lockyer,                                   Attorney General of California.     Tom Miller,     Attorney General of Iowa.                                  ____                                           National Association of                                           Consumer Advocates,                                                   March 19, 1999.       Dear Senators Feinstein, Levin and Bryan: We are a consumer      protection organization very concerned about the safety      hazard posed by the resale of rebuilt wrecked cars. We      strongly support the national salvage and damaged motor      vehicle disclosure bill which you intend to offer because it      will protect consumers against the unsuspecting purchase of a      rebuilt wrecked car. This would require disclosure of major      damage to vehicles, provide broad coverage of most used      vehicles, prevent laundering or washing of titles to conceal      prior damage, provide for effective criminal and civil      enforcement, and establish a federal minimum standard of      consumer protection while allowing states to offer stronger      protection to their citizens. The bill is consistent with the      recommendations embodied in the 1994 Resolution of the      National Association of Attorneys General and adopted by the      Attorneys General of all 50 states, so we anticipate that it      will receive broad support from law enforcement.       We remain strongly opposed to competing legislation, which      the Washington Post termed ``controversial'' and featured as      a example of ``special interest'' legislation. That bill was      opposed by the Attorneys General of 39 states, encountered      major opposition in the House, and was removed from the      Omnibus Appropriations package after objection by the White      House. The current measure remains flawed, failing to cover      more than half the used cars on the road, and eliminating      many of the state law protections that consumers now have      against unscrupulous sellers of rebuilt wrecks. Its      definitions of ``flood'' and ``nonrepairable'' vehicles are      extremely loose, and its standard of proof and weak and      inadequate enforcement mechanism would do nothing to deter      the fraudulent sale of dangerous rebuilt wrecks.       It can hardly be disputed that automobile salvage fraud is      a serious problem which requires federal action. Each year,      more than one million ``totalled'' cars are rebuilt and sold      to unsuspecting consumers. These consumers need protection      from salvage fraud. I am looking forward to continuing to      work closely with leading state Attorneys General on this      important public safety issue, and would welcome the      opportunity to wok with you and your staffs in obtaining the      genuine reform which your pro-consumer bill will provide.           Sincerely yours,                                      Patricia Sturdevant.
