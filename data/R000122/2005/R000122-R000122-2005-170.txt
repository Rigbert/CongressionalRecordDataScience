President, last week Senator Collins and I came to the floor to offer an amendment on the Transportation-Treasury appropriations bill to increase funding for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, more commonly known as LIHEAP. We would have increased the appropriations to the authorized amount of $5.1 billion. With Senator Collins' support, and with the help of 53 other Senators, we came forward to make a statement that in this cold winter that is approaching, with soaring energy prices, Americans needed help and we could do better. Fifty-three Senators, Democrats and Republicans, northerners and southerners, east coasters and west coasters supported our amendment when it came to a vote. But it failed to pass because of a procedural need to acquire 60 votes. We, joined by 30 of our colleagues, are here again today to offer our amendment to the Labor-HHS appropriations bill.  Our amendment provides $2.92 billion in emergency spending for the LIHEAP program. This amount, coupled with the $2.18 billion in the Labor-HHS appropriations bill, will fully fund LIHEAP at the authorized level of $5.1 billion, a level authorized by this Congress and signed into law by the President just 3 months ago. At this level, LIHEAP will cover the full increase inrecipients' heating costs so they would not be forced to pay more out of their very limited budgets for this winter's heating season. It is imperative that this appropriations bill provide additional resources to the LIHEAP program so families are safe and warm this winter.  As we speak, there is a storm raging in the Northeast in New England. We expect in some parts of the region to have snow this evening. Winter is coming. It is coming with a particular ferocity at this moment. But something else is already happening: Rising energy prices, extraordinary increases in energy prices, much of it as a result of Hurricane Katrina that struck the gulf coast area. As I have said before, the first surge was high water that overwhelmed low-income people in New Orleans and Mississippi and Alabama and other cities along the gulf coast. The second surge is high energy prices which are about to overwhelm many individuals in the Northeast and the Midwest and throughout this country where the temperatures begin to fall as they do this time of year. We have to do more to protect these people because we know it is coming.  One of the lessons from Katrina is that we understand that there are people who are vulnerable, and they have to be protected before the storm hits, not afterwards. This is an opportunity to do that for people throughout this country who are vulnerable this winter to rising energy prices and falling temperatures.  I particularly thank Senators Specter and Harkin for their strong support of the LIHEAP program. I realize the difficult choices they faced this year in determining spending limits for the Labor-HHS appropriations bill. I appreciate their support for this amendment to add emergency spending for LIHEAP.  On Saturday, the New York Times printed an editorial titled ``Washington's Cold Shoulder.'' I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the editorial be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, Oct. 22, 2005]                       Washington's Cold Shoulder       The weather is turning cold, and home heating fuel is      increasingly unaffordable. The Energy Department recently      reported that households should expect to pay 48 percent more      this year for natural gas, on average, and nearly a third      more for oil and propane--assuming a ``normal'' winter and no      further supply disruptions like Katrina.       In and of themselves, those increases will be too much for      an estimated seven million low-income Americans, including      old people, disabled people and families with children. On      top of gasoline prices that are already high and wages that      are stagnating, the rising cost of heating fuel is bound to      be devastating.       Yet Congress is balking at approving an additional $3      billion in federal heating subsidies that would help meet the      coming need. (Lawmakers allocated $2 billion to the subsidy      program last summer, before Hurricanes Katrina and Rita sent      prices soaring.) Earlier this month, and again on Thursday,      measures in the Senate to provide the extra funds were      defeated, largely by a bloc of Republican lawmakers, though      with each vote, a handful of Republicans voted in favor and a      few Democrats voted against.       At the same time, Republican majorities in Congress are      unrelenting in their drive to pass $70 billion in new tax      cuts this fall, most of them for wealthy investors, and $35      billion in spending cuts, most in programs that benefit the      poor.       With Congress's priorities so obviously skewed, the best      chance for adequate heating subsidies this winter lies with      President Bush. Advocates for the poor are hoping that Mr.      Bush will ask for the additional money in a future hurricane-     related emergency spending request to Congress. But so far,      Mr. Bush has not said whether he will ask for more heating      aid, and, if so, when or how much.       This sad lack of urgency is seen elsewhere in the      administration as well. Asked at a news conference earlier      this month whether the administration would support bolstered      subsidies for low-income families and the elderly, Secretary      of Energy Samuel Bodman suggested that everyone just wait and      see. ``I can't respond to that,'' he said, ``other than by      saying we're going to do our very best, first, to see what we      can accomplish by the reduction in demand for energy.''       That's unacceptable. Heating subsidies are not a      conservation issue. Vulnerable people need to keep the heat      on to keep from getting sick, or worse. Such subsidies help      everyone by maintaining public health and safety, ensuring      that others don't become ill and spread illness, or resort to      hazardous means of heating that can cause fires. Heating aid      for the needy is also a matter of common decency, which      ordinary Americans are entirely capable of, though not, so      far, their elected leaders.
