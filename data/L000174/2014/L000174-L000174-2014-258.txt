President, in Vermont we have been fortunate that for almost two decades Judge William Sessions has served with distinction as a Federal judge for the District of Vermont. In January, Judge Sessions announced that he would take senior status later this year. In response to this news, the Vermont Bar Association, Senator Sanders, and I, each appointed three members to the Judicial Nominating Commission.  The commission, as one can imagine, received many applications for this district court vacancy. It interviewed and vetted seven finalists, and then recommended to us the two candidates who garnered unanimous support.  I spent hours interviewing them last week in Vermont, and today I am recommending that the President nominate Geoffrey Crawford, a recently-appointed justice from Vermont's highest court. I talked to him at great length last week and again at length this morning. I am very comfortable in forwarding his name to President Obama, as I now have.  Justice Crawford is an experienced and well-respected jurist. He is known for his modesty and humanity, notwithstanding his elite educational background and intellectual heft. He was a successful plaintiffs' attorney before he was appointed to the Vermont Superior Court in 2002.  Then-Judge Crawford served on the superior court in our State for more than a decade, earning a reputation for his skill in working with juries and handling a wide variety of litigation. Attorneys who have appeared before him, on either side, have found him to be an engaged and careful jurist who treats everyone in the courtroom with respect. I have talked with a number of those lawyers, and they speak of his respect and abilities.  As a lawyer, I wanted to hear this, and although I did not know Justice Crawford before interviewing him for this vacancy, the Vermont legal community repeatedly told me of his intelligence, warmth, and unwavering commitment to the highest calling of public service.  When I met Justice Crawford, I found him to be well deserving of these accolades, and I was impressed by his thoughtfulness and pragmatic approach to the law, as was the chief counsel of the Judiciary Committee, Kristine Lucius, and the state director of my Vermont offices, John Tracy.  I am confident that Justice Crawford will make an excellent Federal district court judge and I hope the President will nominate him soon for the vacancy on Vermont's Federal district court.
