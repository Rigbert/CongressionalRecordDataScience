I often ask in my town meetings if anybody in the audience knows which country in the world is No. 2 in military spending and how much they spend.  Well, most do not know, and it is almost a tie between Great Britain and France. Each of them spend about $45 billion a year, one-sixth of the amount that the United States spends, and yet despite all of this expenditure, $270 billion, six times more than any other nation in the world, we still have soldiers and sailors on food stamps.
