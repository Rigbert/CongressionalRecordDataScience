 President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous consent that the injunction of secrecy be removed from the following treaty transmitted to the Senate on September 13, 2004 by the President of the United States: 2nd protocol amending tax convention with Barbados (Treaty Doc. 108-26).  I further ask unanimous consent that the treaty be considered as having been read the first time, that it be referred, with the accompanying papers, to the Committee on Foreign Relations in order to be printed, and that the President's message be printed in the Record.
