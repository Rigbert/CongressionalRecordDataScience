Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. McSally), my friend who is, again, a strong advocate of this legislation.  Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this important legislation. I want to thank Chairman Upton for his tireless leadership on the 21st Century Cures Act. The bill is the result of years of hard work and brings hope to countless Americans suffering from incurable diseases in all of our districts around this country.  I also want to recognize the work of Congressman Tim Murphy, who has served as a leader and a champion on the critical issue of mental health and is the author of legislation included in this bill that will overhaul our mental health system for the first time in 50 years.  Additionally, this legislation includes parts of a bill that I introduced with Senator John Cornyn to improve mental health collaboration between Federal, State, and local justice systems to allow better responses to mental health crises. These provisions will also divert low-level offenders from incarceration to treatment programs, help reduce recidivism and provide support to mentally ill offenders reentering the community.  Many diverse groups came together in support of these bipartisan efforts, including mental health advocates and law enforcement organizations. I urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of this very important bill. I thank the chairman for his leadership.
