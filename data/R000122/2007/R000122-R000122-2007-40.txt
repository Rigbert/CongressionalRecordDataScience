President, I talked with the managers. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 3 minutes as in morning business and then at the conclusion of my remarks that my colleague, Senator Whitehouse, be recognized immediately after me so we can pay tribute to a State legislator and friend who passed away in Rhode Island.
