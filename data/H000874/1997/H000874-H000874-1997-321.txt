Speaker, I rise to pay tribute today honoring Mr. Robert E. Waxman, a career civilian with the Department of the Navy.  Mr. Speaker, for the past 50 years, Bob Waxman has and continues to serve this Nation and the U.S. Navy with his unceasing commitment to excellence. Today, I pause to pay tribute to this great public servant because it is apparent that Bob Waxman has no intentions of slowing down any time in the near future. There are many measures to examine the life and labors of an individual. Some would point to aptitude, attitude, or theextent of achievements accumulated. However, although these are typically the norm, it has been said: ``The measure of a man is not intellect or natural talent, but what does it take to make a man quit.''  Mr. Speaker, the individual I salute today is an extraordinary leader within our civil service. Robert E. Waxman grew up in Baltimore, MD, and began his illustrious career in the Army Air Corps during World War II, serving 24 months as a flight officer. Bob Waxman first arrived in southern Maryland in June 1949 as a student aid working at the Naval Air Test Center at Patuxent River, MD. After graduating from the University of Maryland in June 1950, he worked briefly for the Army Signal Depot in Baltimore as a laboratory electronics mechanic until accepting a full-time position on January 15, 1951, at the Patuxent River Naval Air Station as an electronic engineer.  By the mid-1950's, Bob Waxman was the chief engineer for the Navy air navigation electronics project, a group of 57 personnel sharing a hangar at the Naval Air Test Center, Patuxent River, MD. In 1958, he was named as the technical director of this organization which grew to become a separate command at Webster Field, St. Inigoes, MD. Incredibly, he still is the head of the same basic organization which has undergone many reorganizations and grown tremendously under his leadership. Today, his entity encompasses 500,000 square feet of administrative and laboratory space on station and another 400,000 square feet off station laboratory. At its peak in 1991 prior to the base realignment and closure process, this organization had 2,861 personnel, of which 353 were civil servants, and the other 2,508 were support contractors. With less than 350 civil servants, his organization grew to a peak business base in fiscal year 1994 of $566 million total obligational authority.  Mr. Speaker, I want to bring this story to the attention of others because it is a tremendous success story of how entrepreneurial civil service managers can be in our Government. Long before U.S. managers in Government and the private sector began embracing the principles of Dr. Edwards Deming and other management gurus, Bob Waxman was applying those techniques touted today as necessary for success. Empowering employees is a technique that has been a hallmark of Bob Waxman's since he became a manager in the early 1950's driving decisionmaking to the lowest levels of the organization.  His management philosophy drove his organization to grow its business base rapidly even during times when he could not hire additional civil servants, never exceeding 400 civil servants. Through partnering with the private sector, Mr. Waxman continued to accept new customers and new business while delivering excellent service to a very broad and diverse customer base. As a result of the innovative business approaches he has applied, this small Navy organization supports, they today have a long and diverse list of customers including many non-DoD agencies. Bob Waxman's management philosophy should serve as the model for any agency today when the Government is being asked to do more with less.  Mr. Speaker, Bob Waxman is one of the Government's most productive managers. Even today, long after he could have retired and made much more money in the private sector, he continues to lead by example. It would be difficult to find a manager either in the Government or in the private sector who has more energy, enthusiasm, and drive than Bob Waxman. He has always sought to achieve and operate similar to a private business. He has maintained throughout his career that the only way to survive in a competitive environment is to ensure that the maximum amount of each dollar is spent delivering a product to the customer and not for covering unnecessary overhead expenses. As a result, his leadership has been identified as having one of the lowest overhead rates of any Government organization, averaging 20 to 22 percent.  Maintaining a lean operation has enabled Bob Waxman and the St. Inigoes organization to successfully compete against the private sector in the late 1970's for the communications equipment installation for all AEGIS class ships. since the successful bid, they have delivered over 50 ships without ever missing a cost or time schedule and without any claims against them. This outstanding record has resulted in 14 consecutive AEGIS Excellence Awards.  It is obvious that Mr. Waxman is an exemplary manager, but his personal style is also very distinguished. His philosophy has always been the open-door policy and his honest, forthright approach has been instrumental in implementing a practical equal employment opportunity environment with favorable working conditions for all. He has been a mentor to his employees and two of his former department heads became technical directors of other Navy Systems Command field activities.  Mr. Speaker, I am honored to bring to the attention of my colleagues the outstanding achievements and dedication of one of our Government's finest. I have had the distinct honor to have worked with Bob Waxman very closely and have enjoyed his quick wit, tireless dedication, and persistence. I am a great admirer of the tremendous work he continues to do for our great Nation and I ask my colleagues to join me in saluting this truly outstanding public servant today as he celebrates 50 years of service to the U.S. Government.  His career has served as an inspiration to countless managers, both in the public and private sectors. His dedication and love for his job is a rarity today. Not many people can claim to have remained as the manager of an entity for as many years as he has, persevering through several challenging attempts to close it. Through all this, Bob Waxman has accrued over 4,400 hours of sick leave and lives by the motto: ``putting in a full, day's work for a full day's pay''. Bob Waxman's leadership and loyalty remind us all that it truly is greater to give than receive. His ongoing service and sacrifice continues to renew and remind us all that the human spirit was never intended to be selfish but selfless.                          ____________________
