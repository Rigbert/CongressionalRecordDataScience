 President, I rise today to honor and congratulate U.S. Sgt. Manuel Bojorquez-Pico of Alabama's Redstone Arsenal, on the day of his swearing-in ceremony as a U.S. citizen. A dedicated patriot and loyal protector of this country and its people, Sergeant Bojorquez is not only an inspiration and role model but a symbol of American democracy and freedom.  Born in Mexico, Sergeant Bojorquez obtained permanent residency status while living in the United States as a child. For a short period of time he moved back to Mexico due to a family illness, but returned to the United States as an adult and applied to reactivate his permanent residency. It was granted and he enlisted in the Army. A few years later, the Board of Immigration Appeals reversed its decision and ordered Sergeant Bojorquez deported.  For several years he filed motions and appeals, and in a final attempt to become a citizen of this country, Manuel contacted the President on July 12, 1994, and requested that he designate the Persian Gulf war a period of military hostility which would allow active duty aliens, such as himself, to apply for naturalization.  Despite the concern, support, and assistance of Representative Cramer and myself, 2 weeks before Thanksgiving the District Director of the Immigration and Naturalization Service informed Manuel he would be deported on February 1, 1995. With little hope left, Manuel contacted the President again and finally his prayers were answered.  Impressed by Manuel's commitment to serving his adopted country, the President passed an Executive order which not only allows Manuel to become a citizen, but also includes other active duty aliens who fought in the Persian Gulf war. This young, vibrant family man proved to us all that the American dream still lives.  Manuel's selfless dedication to defending our country, which he could not call his own until today, is a superior example to all American citizens. I applaud him for his tireless efforts and I thank him for the reminder of how lucky we are to live in this great Nation.                          ____________________
