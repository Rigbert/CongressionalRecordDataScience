They like Kenneth Bacon. He was a member of the media. They are not going to do anything about it, I have decided.  Fortunately, the Washington Times has done something about it. Fortunately, Fox News has done something about it. But there is something that can be done. When the new administration takes office, and a new Attorney General comes in, the Bacon-Bernath lawbreaking should be referred again for criminal prosecution. A professional Justice Department, freed from corrupt partisan influences, should prosecute this case and uphold the law.  Such a referral can easily be added to a list of such referrals on other matters which are already being contemplated, as Representative Dan Burton, who is the chairman of the appropriate House committee, mentioned yesterday.  For example, these, as mentioned, would include criminal referrals related to:  No. 1, evidence that the President broke campaign finance laws, was aware of illegal foreign contributions, and changed policies in return for campaign contributions;  No. 2, evidence that the Vice President broke the law when he made the illegal fundraising phone calls from the White House;  No. 3, evidence that the Vice President committed a felony by lying to the FBI investigators about his knowledge of illegal fundraising activities;  No. 4, that Janet Reno committed obstruction of justice when she refused to appoint an independent counsel;  And now we add this to the list: Evidence that Ken Bacon and Clifford Bernath broke the law when they violated the Privacy Act in the Linda Tripp matter.  It is obvious if the next President of the United States happens to be Al Gore that very likely we will have the same type of Justice Department. I don't think our forefathers ever anticipated, when they were constructing these documents, our Constitution and our statutes, that we would have someone in the President's office who would use the Justice Department to protect his friends and punish his enemies. I have come to the conclusion that if this had been Frankie Vee who had done this, he would currently be serving time in the Federal penitentiary.  I yield the floor.                               Exhibit 1                                            Department of Defense,                                    Office of General Counsel,                                 Washington, DC, December 3, 1999.     Re Request for Representation of Clifford H. Bernath in Tripp          v. Executive Office of the President (D.D.C. No 99-2254).     Sylvia Kasar, Esq.,     U.S. Department of Justice,     Civil Division--Federal Programs Branch,     Washington, DC.       Dear Ms. Kasar: I am writing to request that the Department      of Justice authorize private counsel at federal expense for      Mr. Clifford H. Bernath in connection with the above-     captioned litigation, pursuant to 28 C.F.R. Sec. 5015.       We believe that this lawsuit concerns matters within this      scope of Mr. Bernath's employment at the Department of      Defense. Based on the information now available to us--which      has also been made available to your office--we believe that      providing Mr. Bernath with private counsel at federal expense      is appropriate and in the interest of the United States.       Thank you for your consideration of this matter.           Sincerly,                                                     Brad Wiegnam.                               Exhibit 2               [From the Washington Times, May 27, 2000]  Clinton Accused in `Smear'--Tripp Lawyers Blame White House for Leak                            (By Jerry Seper)       Attorneys for Linda R. Tripp yesterday said the release of      information from her confidential personnel file was ``wrong      and illegal,'' and part of a ``smear campaign'' by the White      House to damage her reputation.       The attorneys said the campaign was engineered by President      Clinton and his senior advisers, who ``turned their public      relations machine against Mrs. Tripp'' to divert attention      from the president's conduct with former White House intern      Monica Lewinsky.       ``The campaign worked, and Mrs. Tripp was publicly      humiliated on numerous occasions,'' attorneys Stephen M.      Kohn, David K. Colapinto and Michael D. Kohn said in a      statement. ``Her reputation was poisoned, her motives      questioned and even her personal appearance became fair game      for ridicule.''       They said the leak of the Tripp file by Pentagon spokesman      Kenneth Bacon to a reporter looking to write a critical story      of Mrs. Tripp was part of that scheme, and that the file's      disclosure was prohibited under the federal Privacy Act.       The Defense Department's Office of Inspector General      concluded that Mr. Bacon and his former top deputy, Clifford      H. Bernath, violated Mrs. Tripp's privacy rights by providing      information from her confidential personnel file to a      reporter for the New Yorker magazine.       But the two men received only mild reprimands Thursday from      Defense Secretary William S. Cohen.       Mr. Cohen criticized Mr. Bacon and Mr. Bernath in letters      for what he called a ``serious lapse of judgment,'' although      neither letter was made part of the men's personnel files and      no further disciplinary action was recommended. The case is      closed.       Mr. Clinton, through a spokesman, yesterday said he had      ``full confidence'' in the Cohen decision.       ``The president has full confidence in the secretary of      defense's management of his staff and the Pentagon and      supports the judgment of the secretary of defense to take the      actions appropriate,'' said P.J. Crowley, chief spokesman for      the White House National Security Council, Mr. Crowley      formerly worked for Mr. Bacon.       Mrs. Tripp is the Pentagon official who blew the whistle on      Mr. Clinton's affair with Miss Lewinsky. Both Mrs. Tripp and      Miss Lewinsky worked for Mr. Bacon.       Mrs. Tripp has since field a lawsuit accusing the White      House and the Defense Department of using her confidential      file to smear her reputation.       In a five-page statement, her attorneys noted that the leak      to Jane Mayer, a reporter for the New Yorker, came after Mr.      Bacon met privately over dinner with former White House      Deputy Chief of Staff Harold Ickes--who ``volunteered'' to      help Mr. Clinton in damage control after the Lewinsky      accusations surfaced. They said Mr. Ickes also had met with      Miss Mayer before the information was released.       ``This was simply not an innocent release of information in      response to an inquiry by a reporter,'' they said. ``It is      well-established that Mr. Bacon and his associate who was      involved in the illegal leak knew that the information      requested from Mrs. Tripp's security file would be used in a      derogatory manner to smear Mrs. Tripp and question her      credibility.''       They also said Mr. Bacon and Mr. Bernath had been told the      information from the file was covered by the Privacy Act and      could not be released without Mrs. Tripp's consent.       Mr. Ickes, now coordinating first lady Hillary Rodham      Clinton's run for a U.S. Senate seat in New York, did not      return calls to his office for comment. He previously denied      any wrongdoing, saying that while he met with Mr. Bacon and      Miss Mayer before the file was leaked, he denied the      discussions were part of a conspiracy.       The White House also has denied any involvement in the      leak, and Mr. Bacon, in a statement on Thursday, said he did      not believe he violated Mrs. Tripp's privacy rights and that      ``ultimately my conduct will be found lawful.''       Sen. James M. Inhofe, Oklahoma Republican who denounced a      Justice Department decision last month not to seek an      indictment of Mr. Bacon or Mr. Bernath, despite concerns      outlined in a July 1998 report by the inspector general,      called the Cohen reprimand ``a travesty.''       ``At a minimum, Bacon and Bernath should have been fired,''      said Mr. Inhofe. ``This is what happened to the Bush      administration official who misused candidate Bill Clinton's      passport file in 1992. It is what Bill Clinton said would      happen to anyone in his administration found guilty of a      similar invasion of privacy.''       Mr. Cohen yesterday denied that he whitewashed the release      of information from Mrs. Tripp's confidential file, saying      there was ``no attempt to injure Miss Tripp's credibility or      her reputation.''       He told reporters at Morristown Airport after touring      nearby Picatinny Arsenal that Mr. Bacon and Mr. Bernath were      seeking to respond to pressure from the media and that there      was no attempt to orchestrate any campaign to discredit Mrs.      Tripp.       ``I don't intend to fire him,'' Mr. Cohen said of Mr.      Bacon.       In a final report made public yesterday, acting Inspector      General Donald Mancuso said the harm to Mrs. Tripp's privacy      interests caused by the release of her confidential personnel      file outweighed any public benefit.       ``Accordingly, the release constituted a clearly      unwarranted invasion of her privacy,'' the report said. The      report said the actions of Mr. Bacon and Mr. Bernath      constituted a violation of the federal Privacy Act.       The documents leaked showed that Mrs. Tripp had said she      never had been arrested, when in fact she had--in what later      was described as a teen-age prank that occurred more than 30      years ago.                             Exhibit No. 3             [From the The Weekly Standard, June 12, 2000] Why Didn't Bacon Get Fried?--The Pentagon's Anti-Tripp Leakers Get a        Slap on the Wrist, and the Privacy Act a Slap in the Face                          (By Jay Nordlinger)       It's just a small matter, in all the Clinton grossness, but      it counts. Linda Tripp was the victim of a dirty, and      illegal, trick. It was played on her by her own bosses at the      Pentagon. And now those men--Kenneth Bacon and Clifford      Bernath--have escaped with the wispiest slaps on the wrist.      This is ho-hum for the Clinton administration; but it is a      reminder of how unlawful and indecent this administration has      been.       Before this little affair slides all the way down the      memory hole, recall the essential facts: In January 1998, the      Lewinsky scandal exploded on Bill Clinton's head. From the      point of view of the White House, Linda Tripp was the major      villain. It was therefore a matter of urgency to discredit      her. In March, Jane Mayer, a Clinton-friendly reporter for      the New Yorker, acquired what seemed a valuable piece of      information: Tripp, as a teenager, had been arrested for      larceny. Mayer put in a call to Ken Bacon, assistant      secretary of defense for public affairs. He was an old      friend; the two had worked together at the Wall Street      Journal. Mayer had an amazingly specific question for him:      How had Tripp responded to Question 21, parts a and b, on      Form 398? This was a highly sensitive national-security      questionnaire, under the eye of the Privacy Act Branch of the      Defense Security Service; Question 21 dealt with arrests and      detentions.       Bacon quickly swung into action. He ordered his deputy,      Cliff Bernath, to get Mayer her answer. Hours before the      reporter's deadline, Bernath told her not to worry: ``Ken has      made clear it's priority.'' Moving heaven and earth, and      alarming career officers as he went, Bernath delivered--right      on time.       It looked like bad news for Tripp: She had not, in fact,      disclosed on Form 398 her 1969 arrest. Bernath told the New      York Times that Tripp faced the ``very serious charge'' of      lying to the government. Defense secretary William Cohen      declared on CNN that Tripp was ``guilty of a contradiction of      the truth,'' which would be ``looked into.'' It soon emerged,      however, that Tripp's arrest had been the result of a      juvenile prank, perpetrated against her. The judge had      reduced the charge to one count of loitering, telling her, as      she recalled it, that her record would be clear. The      Pentagon, rather sheepishly, dropped its investigation of      Tripp. Instead, Congress demanded that the department      investigate Bacon and Bernath--for violating the Privacy Act.      In their attempt to help Mayer nail Tripp, the two men seemed      to have nailed themselves.       The Pentagon's inspector general, Eleanor Hill, duly      launched an investigation. The case being clear-cut, it      didn't take her long to find that Bacon and Bernath had      indeed violated the Privacy Act. In July 1998, she referred      the matter to the Justice Department--which then sat on it      for almost two full years. This would have been      incomprehensible in any other administration. Only in April      2000 did Justice announce that it would not prosecute.      Incredibly, the department claimed that there was ``no direct      evidence upon which to pursue any violation of the Privacy      Act.''       It was then left to Secretary Cohen to determine a penalty      for Bacon and Bernath--if any. What he decided to do was      write a letter expressing his ``disappointment'' in the men.      Each would receive a copy. In this letter, Cohen said that      his subordinates' actions had been ``hasty and ill-     considered.'' He noted that, at the time of the incident,      they and others at the Pentagon were under instruction not to      release anything concerning Tripp without first consulting      department lawyers. The strongest language he used was      ``serious lapse of judgment.'' But this was balanced against      ``the very high quality of the performance that you have      otherwise exhibited.'' Amazingly, Cohen told the press that      ``there was no attempt to injure Miss Tripp's credibility      or her reputation.''       Contemplating this, Dick Morris, the former Clinton      adviser, had no choice but to remark, ``Generally, it is a      good political rule never to say anything that the average 6-     year-old knows isn't true.''       The most striking thing about the Cohen letter is that it      will not even be placed in either Bacon's or Bernath's      permanent file. According to the Pentagon, this is not a      letter of reprimand. A department spokesman, Craig Quigley,      described it as ``a personal letter to both Mr. Bernath and      Mr. Bacon.'' Incredulous, a reporter said, ``So, it's not a      letter of reprimand?'' ``No,'' said Quigley, ``Well, what      would you call it?'' Said Quigley, ``It's an official letter      expressing the secretary's disappointment in the judgment''      of the two officials.       Quigley, like his boss, Bacon, also persisted in the      fiction that the leak to Mayer was no big deal--a matter of      routing, just business as usual. ``This information was taken      in the normal course of the day.'' It was ``done very clearly      and above board.'' You know how it is at the Pentagon: ``A      reporter will call with a question or request for data of      some sort, and it's provided as best we can.'' Anyone who has      ever covered, or tried to cover, the Defense Department will      gladly tell you this is rot. Quigley trotted out another line      as well, one that is increasingly becoming the Bacon defense:      ``You always do a balancing act between the Freedom of      Information Act and the Privacy Act.'' This assertion is      absurd: Form 398 is strickly a Privacy Act document.       After Cohen's non-reprimand, a few Republicans properly      cried bloody murder. Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma accused      the Pentagon of ``a whitewash and a coverup.'' He said that      ``the law was broken, and nothing is being done about it.''      The failure to punish the leakers would ``send a signal to      millions of federal civilian and military employees that      their private government records can be made public for      political purposes, and no one will be held accountable.''       For their part, Bacon and Bernath are denying any violation      of the Privacy Act. At a press conference, Bacon was asked      whether he would apologize to Tripp. ``Well,'' he replied,      ``I have already issued the apologies that I have to issue.''      (He didn't specify what those were.) ``I don't think that I      performed unlawfully,'' he continued. His only regret was      that he had not ``checked this with lawyers.'' In an official      statement, Bacon said, ``It certainly never occurred to me      that the Privacy Act would preclude disclosing how a public      figure recorded a public arrest record on a security      clearance.'' And here is more, perhaps Bacon's richest      utterance to date: ``I obviously knew that this was an issue      of considerable public concern and that the public     had an interest in knowing whether Ms. Tripp had accurately      acknowledged her arrest record.''       Bernath, the junior partner in the enterprise, following      orders, although blindly, was similarly unbowed, saying, ``My      actions were not only legal, but also ethical and correct.''       Meanwhile, Tripp is suing both the Pentagon and the White      House for Privacy Act violations and witness intimidation.      This suit may in fact have been on Cohen's mind when he      declined to take serious action against his guys. Cohen gave      the game away somewhat on Meet the Press, saying of Bacon,      ``He is now the subject of a major lawsuit. And so he will      continue to be held accountable to the legal process.'' This      is exactly the sort of thinking that worries many observers,      including Joseph diGenova, a former U.S. attorney with long      experience in this area. Says diGenova, ``The treatment of      Bacon and Bernath suggests that the Privacy Act will be      enforceable only in civil lawsuits filed by the victims. It      there's no adverse action--not even a letter that goes into      somebody's file--there's no deterrence here. None      whatsoever.'' In other words, ``Don't leave it solely to the      victim, who has to pay lawyers and so on, to enforce her      rights under the Privacy Act. The government should enforce      those rights, especially given that it was government people      who broke the law.''       The president and his men have a bit of a history with the      Privacy Act. You perhaps remember Passportgate. Toward the      end of the 1992 presidential campaign, it was learned that      political appointees in the Bush State Department had rifled      through candidate Clinton's passport files and those of his      mother. Democrats demanded an independent-counsel      investigation. They got one--led by diGenova. One of the      officials involved, Elizabeth Tamposi, was dismissed. The      acting secretary of state, Lawrence Eagleburger, offered to      resign over the matter (President Bush refused). Said      Clinton, in his first press conference as president-elect,      ``If I catch anybody doing [what the passport-file offenders      did], I will fire them the next day. You won't have to have      an inquiry or rigmarole or anything else.''       About a year later, Passportgage had something of a      reprise, this time featuring appointees in Clinton's own      State Department. A few of them got hold of Bush-     administration personnel files and leaked them to Al Kamen of      the Washington Post. Kamen thus had the following story:      ``Guess whose working file was empty? That of very      controversial longtime Bush employee Jennifer Fitzgerald.''      Kamen, of course, was being coy here: Fitzgerald was the      woman rumored to have had an affair with President Bush.      Damen was also able to report that Elizabeth Tamposi's file      included ``concerns from very senior State Department types      that she was not ready for an assistant secretaryship.''       Immediately, the State Department's inspector general,      Sherman Funk, began an investigation. He found that two      employees--Joseph Tarver and Mark Schulhof--were stone-cold      guilty. Funk told Congress that the pair had engaged in      ``criminal violations of the Privacy Act provable beyond a      reasonable doubt.'' The Justice Department (developing a      pattern) refused to prosecute. In November 1993, the      department secretary, Warren Christopher, fired Tarver and      Schulhof. This must have been one of the last acts of      Clinton-administration honor. The contrast with the Bacon-     Tripp case--in this last respect--is overwhelming.       Then, of course, there was Filegate, in which the White      House gathered unto its bosom hundreds of Republican FBI      files, including Linda Tripp's. And the president himself was      prompt to release letters from Kathleen Willey--a woman who      had accused him of improper sexual conduct--when it was      convenient.       If all this didn't begin with Watergate, it was certainly      enshrined there. When the Bacon-Tripp story first broke,      Charles Colson reminded this magazine that it was to a Bacon-     style disclosure that he had pleaded guilty, in 1974. He had      released information from Daniel Ellsberg's FBI file to the      Copley Press, at a time when Ellsberg was a defendant in the      Pentagon Papers case and a thorn in the Nixon      administration's side--the parallels to Tripp are neat.      Colson went to jail for this. The special prosecutor, Leon      Jaworski, rejoiced that Colson's plea had set a precedent: No      longer would political appointees so readily smear their foes      in this way. Indeed, the Privacy Act was a post-Watergate      reform, intended to check Nixonian abuses.       Says diGenova, ``The Bacon thing is a facial and obvious      violation of the Privacy Act. It is made for it.'' Bear this      in mind: ``Linda Tripp was engaged in a very public dispute      with the president.'' His presidency hung in the balance; he,      like Nixon before him, was on the road to impeachment. ``This      is precisely the kind of circumstance that Congress had in      mind when it gave us the Privacy Act. And not to punish this      conduct is a very serious mistake.''       Apart from Tripp's lonely lawsuit, this affair has now      reached an end. Yet two questions hang over it. First, Who      gave Jane Mayer that promising tidbit from Tripp's past?      Mayer says that it was a former wife of Tripp's father.      Others--not necessarily full-time conspiracy theorists,      either--wonder whether that's the full story. Team Clinton      had every reason to dig for dirt on Tripp. The chief      recordkeeper in the White House, Terry Good, testified in a      deposition that the White House counsel's office had      requested ``anything and everything that we might have in our      files relating to Linda Tripp.''       The second question is, Did Bacon act of his own      initiative? Or was he prompted by someone--presumably at the      White House--to let fly what appeared to be damaging      information? Bacon has steadfastly claimed that he acted      entirely on his own, with no order, wink, or nod. But this      strikes most people familiar with the workings of the      Pentagon--and of the Clinton camp generally--as implausible.      A veteran Defense Department hand told us, ``Couldn't happen,      didn't happen, no way, no how. Remember: Everyone who comes      into public affairs is told Privacy Act rules. You don't      release someone's confidential information--to anyone, much      less the media. This is Public Affairs 101. And Bacon is      perpetrating a shameful lie. Any professional in the building      will tell you the same thing.''       So, the Clinton administration lurches to a close, its      players going this way and that, its loose ends being tied      up, however unsatisfactorily. Jane Mayer, the little lady who      started this not-so-great war, was recently a guest at a      White House state dinner. She was seated in a place of honor:      the first lady's table. As for her friend Bacon, he has waxed      philosophical about his humble-gate: ``This is an extremely      small part of a large and painful national drama.''       Yes, but it is significant nonetheless. The rule of law has      taken a beating in this administration, not to mention such      demands as honesty and trustworthiness. After Cohen flaked      out, one of Tripp's lawyers made a somewhat poignant      statement: ``Despite Linda Tripp's unpopularity, the law      should protect her.'' Such a simple notion. And powerful,      even now.
