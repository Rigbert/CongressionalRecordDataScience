 President, I am introducing today the Child Support Performance Act of 1998. This legislation decreases penalties for those 14 states who did not make the child support enforcement system deadline last October.  This legislation decreases the overall penalties to 4% of the child support administrative funds in the first year, and increases the penalties by 4% each year up to 20%. However, if the state meets the benchmark goals it set out with HHS at the beginning of the year, 75% of the penalties would be forgiven each year. This provision encourages states to set realistic goals for the year and recognizes their progress each year instead of the all or nothing approach under current law.  The current penalties for not having the child support enforcement system up and running are enormous. States would be penalized all their TANF (AFDC) funding and their child support administration funds for the year.  The total loss in TANF funds and child support administrative funds from the 14 states amount to over $8 billion per year. More specifically, California would lose $4 billion. Illinois would lose $654 million. Michigan would lose $857 million. Pennsylvania would lose $794 million.  There is enough blame to go around for the states' failures to meet the child support enforcement systems deadline.  The lengthy private sector contractor procurement and federal approval processes; many vendors' inability to complete work to specifications within the time allowed; the long time needed to convert large caseloads into a new system; the difficulties inherent in a single system conversion in large states like California.  All of us would agree that the huge financial penalties imposed on 14 or more states would cause hardship to the children and families in the affected states. However, since over 30% of all child support cases are interstate collection cases, the penalties would have a nationwide impact.  What this means is that children in Kansas or Georgia will not be able to get child support from parents in California, Pennsylvania or the other 12 states who face the devastating penalties.  For the 14 states who face such devastating prospects, without my legislation, the rigid one statewide system requirement and the harsh penalty imposed on states would impoverish 19 million families with children nationwide.  Let me also point out the unfairness of current penalties on Los Angeles County. For California, 25% of the penalty will be borne by LA County, the largest county in the nation, serving 550,000 families. Despite the fact that LA County completed its system by the October deadline and could be certified as recognized by HHS in its March 2, 1998 proposed rules, LA County will be penalized along with the rest of California.  This is unfair and wrong. As I propose in my legislation, when counties have met the system requirement by building their own system with separate HHS funding, their portion should be exempted from the total penalties imposed on a state.  The House of Representatives recently passed Clay Shaw's legislation, H.R. 3130, that lowered the penalties for those states who did not meet the October 1st deadline last year. Representative Shaw's bill lowers the penalties but remains very harsh for those states who missed the deadline but who are on their way to becoming certified within a year or two.  Under Shaw's bill, California alone would face $12 million in penalty in the first year and up to $60 million in the forth year, denying 2.36 million impoverished families in California of their child support. It will not hurt the state, but only those families we are trying to help.  In other big states like Illinois, approximate 730,000 families with children may not get their child support because the state faces $2.7 million in penalties during the first year, and up to $13.5 million in the fourth year.  For Michigan, 1.5 million families with children may not get their child support because the state faces $3.27 million in penalties during the first year, up to $16.3 million in the fourth year.  Some, argue that these cuts are necessary to punish the states for not coming into compliance, but the reality is, that again only hurts the families with children.  Mr. President, the bottom line is, if we don't have child support enforcement systems up and running, children and families don't get their child support. 14 states do not have a child support enforcement system and imposing harsh penalties will not encourage states to perform better but debilitate their ability to serve.  Thank you, Mr. President. I urge all the members to support this legislation and I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1791       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
