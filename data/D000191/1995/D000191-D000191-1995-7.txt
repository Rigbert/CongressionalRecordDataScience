Speaker, we are going to debate a 7-year balanced budget for the United States of America in 3 hours. We spent 4 hours on shrimp-turtle excluder devices, yet they cannot give us another hour or two to debate a balanced budget for the United States of America.  I am a balanced budget Democrat, but this party would have us believe there is only one path. They do not allow any alternative. They are giving us a bigger and better business-as-usual budget. More money for the Pentagon, more weapons we do not need, B-2 bombers that do not work, more tax cuts for the wealthy.  There is another way to balance the budget, but you are going to go after the Pentagon, get rid of cold war weapons that we do not need, that do not work, challenge corporations to give up welfare, do away with agriculture subsidies, even cut back on foreign aid, and maybe charge royalties for mining on Federal land.  But that takes on the rich and the powerful who have been running this city for a quarter of a century, and that party does not have the guts to do it, and they will not even let us offer one alternative. Not even one alternative on the floor of the House.  A balanced budget, yes. Seven years, yes. Let us have an alternative. Let us have a balanced budget.
