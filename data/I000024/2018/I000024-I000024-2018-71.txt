The first vote is the one I strongly support. With this amendment, Senator Toomey is looking to do something that has been very successful; that is, to give a little more opportunity for us to oversee some of the overregulations that are out there.  I was very pleased to have the first CRA that was mine, which I authored, to be enacted into law. We have now had 16 CRAs, Congressional Review Act. It is interesting because we went 20 years without having any of them that were taken, and now we have been successful in doing that. It is a stronger position for those of us in the Senate to be able to get some things done. We can safeguard the importance of deregulation, especially for the future, by passing this amendment today.  Senator Toomey's amendment will give congressional oversight over the CFIUS rulemaking process, which I think everyone in here knows needs to be done and will be done. It will not slow down the implementation process and still grants CFIUS the necessary flexibility to enact in the name of national security.  After that, we are going to have the vote that is going to allow us to move to a package, and I am hoping we will be able to do it because there has been a lot of talk about not being able to get an open amendment process. We have not had one, and that is unfortunate. If we can get this package of amendments put together--there are going to be quite a few of them--all of them will be cleared on both sides. It is going to be one that people are going to be very anxious to get done. It is going to give voice to many of the Members, probably some 40 Members who otherwise would not have the opportunity to have their amendment agreed to or at least heard. I think we will have that opportunity. It is very important we do it now. Hopefully, that package of amendments is going to be one that will be favorably approved.  With that, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
