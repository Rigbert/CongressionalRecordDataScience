 President, if the problem is people misunderstand because this is a roving wiretap, one thing that will get everybody's attention is we amend it, send it back, and it will become real clear. In about 20 minutes of discussion, we can have it back here, and it will not kill the bill--if that is the reason.  No. 2, in the letter from the chiefs, the president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, they do support the bill but they are very clear. Let me quote. They say:       This legislation does not deal with the ability of law      enforcement to use roving wiretaps or 48-hour wiretaps in the      case of terrorism even though this later type of wiretap is      already authorized in other special situations.  They list what they do not like about the bill. They do not like the fact that this is not in the bill. They strongly support this wiretap authority. And if we cannot get it done now in this bill, I respectfully suggest to my friend that no matter how much he wishes to fix this, there will be no ability to get it done standing alone.  I yield back whatever seconds I may have remaining.
