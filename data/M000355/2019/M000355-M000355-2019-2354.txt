 President, on February 1, the Kentucky SupremeCourt will bid farewell to a towering figure in our State's judiciary, Justice Bill Cunningham. A Lyon County native, Bill announced he would retire from the high court at the beginning of next month, bringing to a close a career of public service that has spanned more than half of his life. I would like to take a moment to join his colleagues, his family, and his community in western Kentucky in congratulating Bill on this remarkable milestone and to thank him for his service to the Commonwealth.  Bill first answered the call to service early in his life. Once he graduated from Murray State University and the University of Kentucky College of Law, Bill enlisted in the Army, nobly serving our Nation in uniform in Vietnam, Korea, and Germany. Upon his return to Kentucky, Bill decided to put his legal education to work for the men and women of his community. For the last 45 years, he has done just that.  Working in various courtrooms as the Eddyville City attorney, public defender for the Kentucky State Penitentiary, and the 56th judicial district's Commonwealth's attorney, Bill earned the esteem of his colleagues. In fact, his peers voted him the ``Outstanding Commonwealth's Attorney for Kentucky.''  Beginning in 1991, Bill moved to the other side of the bench when he was first elected as a circuit court judge in western Kentucky, serving in Caldwell, Livingston, Lyon, and Trigg Counties. He was then elected to the Kentucky Supreme Court in 2006. On the high court, Bill represents 24 counties in western Kentucky. His constituents rewarded Bill's accomplished service by reelecting him to a second term in 2014.  In addition to his dedicated leadership in our Commonwealth's legal system, Bill has written six books on Kentucky history and is a frequent contributor to local newspapers. He is also known as a captivating speaker, and I hope he will continue to share his perspective with audiences even in retirement.  As Bill's tenure on the Kentucky Supreme Court comes to a close, I would like to express my sincere gratitude for his lifetime of service to his community, our Commonwealth, and our country. In retirement, Bill said he looks forward to spending more time with his wife Paula, their five children, and their 15 grandchildren. I extend my best wishes to the entire Cunningham family, and I ask my Senate colleagues to help me congratulate Justice Bill Cunningham for his service to Kentucky.  Mr. President, the Paducah Sun recently published a column congratulating Bill on his retirement. I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [From the Paducah Sun, Dec. 30, 2018]                             Justice Served                           (By Joshua Robert)       Often loquacious and poignant, Kentucky Supreme Court      Justice Bill Cunningham struggled Thursday to find the right      words summarizing the coming sunset to his career, emotion      seeping through his typically laid-back demeanor.       ``I'm just very grateful--I'm trying to say this without      getting choked up here--to the Almighty for giving me the      strength to (serve the public),'' the justice told a Sun      reporter. ``I'm so grateful for the people of west Kentucky      for giving me this wonderful opportunity.''       That Cunningham, a state Supreme Court justice for 12      years, paired his deity with the residents of his native and      beloved western Kentucky is not surprising, nor is the      affection one-way.       The judge, folksy and often dressed in his trademark      seersucker suit, cuts a popular figure. An accomplished      jurist, engaging orator and celebrated author, Cunningham is      as Kentucky as they come, though in our opinion, uncommon in      the commonwealth.       Cunningham, 74, of Kuttawa, announced Thursday that he'll      be leaving the Supreme Court on Feb. 1, ending a career in      public service that's spanned more than half his life. He      considered his exit from the high court for more than a year      and was unsettled by the prospect of leaving halfway through      his second term.       But the ``constant bombardment of human woe and suffering''      he's seen and heard from the bench proved too much to      continue. The judge, who felt compelled by duty, did what      good judges are supposed to--he cast aside personal feelings      to make the wisest decision possible, his self-assessment      unsparing that he's not at his best.       ``You've got to be emotionally strong to continue,''      Cunningham said, ``and I'm just worn out with it.''       The judge said he doesn't know what he'll do next, but      it'll be something of service to the people of western      Kentucky.       ``I'm going to stay engaged,'' he said. ``I'm going to take      a couple of months off to get my perspective, then I'm going      to do what other people do when they're out of a job--I'm      going to look for one.''       ``I'd like to be able to serve in some capacity. I just      don't know what that is right now.''       Running again for public office, like for a state      legislative seat, is unlikely. ``I'm a dinosaur, and much of      the political mainstream today has passed me by,'' he said in      his self-effacing manner.       We've gotten to know Cunningham over the years, covering      the justice's speeches and appearances and publishing his      thoughtful, well-written guest opinion pieces from time to      time. If we're coming off as an admirer, it's because we are,      unapologetically so.       We've found Justice Cunningham has admirable traits like      modesty, kindness, intelligence, fairness and loyalty, rare      virtues among today's public servants. His replacement will      come from one of the 24 counties within the First Supreme      Court District, but in truth, it'll be impossible to replace      Cunningham and all he has meant to our communities.       ``There's some great timber out there, so they'll probably      get a better justice than what they have now,'' he said of      the judicial nominating process. With respect to the judge,      that's a dubious claim.       Cunningham is slated to be the guest speaker Feb. 5 during      a Paducah Lions Club meeting at Walker Hall.       ``I'll be a former judge by then, so that's if they don't      cancel the invitation,'' he joked.       We have no doubt the invitation's still good and his speech      will be captivating, as always. After all, jobs and titles      may change, but character doesn't.                               ____________________
