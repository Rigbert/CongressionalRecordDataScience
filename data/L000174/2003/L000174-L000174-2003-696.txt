I thought when I came we were having a debate on the Ninth Circuit, which I understand has now put the Pledge of Allegiance case on the fast track to the U.S. Supreme Court, which has a majority of conservative Republicans. I am sure the distinguished Senator from Alabama will be very happy with whatever way they rule on that.  In the meantime, I say to those in my State of Vermont who ask, there has been no challenge to the law in Vermont. We are not within the Ninth Circuit, and I expect children in Vermont will continue to say the pledge as we have been saying it since sometime in the 1950s, I believe, when the words ``under God'' were added to it.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
