Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the Senate bill (S. 1218) to direct the Secretary of the Interior to issue to the Landusky School District, without consideration, a patent for the surface and mineral estates of certain lots, and for other purposes.  The Clerk read as follows:                                S. 1218       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled, That      subject to valid existing rights, the Secretary of the      Interior shall issue to the Landusky School District, without      consideration, a patent for the surface and mineral estates      of approximately 2.06 acres of land as follows: T.25 N, R.24      E, Montana Prime Meridian, section 27 block 2, school      reserve, and section 27, block 3, lot 13.
