Chair, I was happy to support the gentleman and accept the prior amendment, but this just goes too far.  I couldn't agree with the gentleman more that the Federal obligations for construction in Indian Country far outweigh the amount of money we have in the budget. That is why the Bureau of Indian Affairs Construction account has been and will continue to be a nonpartisan priority for the subcommittee, and we are certainly proud of the progress we have made so far, but I cannot support an offset on an account that also serves Indian Country and other underserved populations.  In addition to cutting the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Indian Affairs, this amendment is likely to cut the Office of Native American Relations, the Office of Small Disadvantaged Business Utilization, the Office of Civil Rights, and the Office of Hearings and Appeals.  Again, while I agree with the increase, and I certainly don't disagree with the gentleman's intentions, I cannot in good conscience agree to this offset.  If we find money down the road in this process as the gentlewoman and I are going through the conference, this is something I would be very interested in looking at, but right now I must encourage a ``no'' vote.  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.  Mr. O'HALLERAN. Mr. Chair, I understand that this bill increases the BIA Construction funding levels from last year, but I must remind the gentleman that this program is still woefully underfunded considering the tremendous needs across the West and in rural communities.  Although I believe this amendment's offset is reasonable considering the basic immediate and dire needs of tribes across the country, I appreciate the gentleman's comments and I hope he will commit to working with me on a bipartisan basis going forward on this amendment to ensure our communities have meaningful access funding for clean water.  I clearly understand the impacts potentially to the Bureau, but I also understand that when you have 80 percent unemployment and the risk of losing 80 percent of your general fund, that there is no other alternative than to look for money here, and I would appreciate consideration in the future.  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. O'Halleran).  The amendment was rejected.                Amendment No. 20 Offered by Ms. Plaskett  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 20 printed in House Report 115-830.
