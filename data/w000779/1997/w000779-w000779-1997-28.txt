 However, subsequent Federal court decisions threaten to undermine the important principle that Federal Government facilities must comply with the same environmental laws that govern the private sector. In fact, one court decision that covers the Hanford Nuclear Reservation would allow Hanford to poison the water, pollute the air and contaminate the soil for decades, and be immunized for any violations that occur before the Hanford cleanup is completed sometime in the next century.  This court ruling allowed the interagency agreement among the Energy Department, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Washington Department of Ecology that governs the Hanford cleanup to be used as a shield to block an enforcement action against the Energy Department for violations of the Clean Water Act.  The Energy Department's use of interagency agreement to bar enforcement of environmental laws not only undermines the Federal Facilities Compliance Act but also puts at risk the health of citizens who live downstream or downwind from Hanford, and near other Federal facilities around the country.  Madam President, we also have a double standard here. The Superfund law only authorizes interagency agreements for Federal facilities; there is no comparable provision and no comparable immunity from enforcement for private sector sites.  Today, Senator Allard and I are introducing the Federal Facilities Superfund Compliance Act to put an end to this double standard. Our legislation makes clear that Federal Government facilities are subject to the same environmental cleanup laws that apply to the private sector. And they are subject to the law now, not sometime off in the future.  Under this legislation, an interagency agreement, such as the Hanford Tri-Party Agreement, can no longer be used as a means to evade other environmental requirements.  Our legislation also makes clear that if Federal facilities fail to meet their obligations, States and affected citizens will be able to enforce against the Federal Government for these violations just as they would be able to enforce against private parties for violations of environmental laws at a private sector Superfund site.  Our citizens who live in the shadow of contaminated Federal facilities should not have to wait years or decades to obtain the health and environmental protections our laws are supposed to provide. I urge all our colleagues to support this important legislation to provide citizens who live downwind or downstream from Federal facilities equal protection under our environmental laws.                                 ______                                       By
