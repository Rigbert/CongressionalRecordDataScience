Speaker, well, I know how much you look forward to these colloquies.  I yield to the gentleman from California.  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, it is the highlight of my week.  I look forward to the next Congress. I do enjoy working with the gentleman from Maryland, even when we disagree, because the gentleman is honest and forthright with his disagreements. The gentleman is willing to work where we do find common ground.  We are going to have philosophical differences, but we are going to have the same commitment that we are going to try to find a way to move forward. At times, we are going to disagree; but those times that we do agree, we work very well together. I admire the gentleman. The gentleman works very hard when he disagrees, and that is just part of what I think the American people expect. We have got a lot of work to go before us. The election is over. I think it is time that thiscountry comes together. We are going to have a lot of work.  As the gentleman from Maryland knows, with the new schedule, Members are going to be here much more than they have been in the past, and we are probably going to be on this floor with legislation a little more than we were last year. I look forward to that and look forward to working with the gentleman on ways that we can work together.  I wish the gentleman from Maryland a very Merry Christmas.
