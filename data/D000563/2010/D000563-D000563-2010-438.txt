Around here we go through so many issues and debates, it sounds as if people are reading telephone directories and don't care, but there occasionally comes along an issue where it does touch you. You can tell from the Senator from Louisiana, she feels this issue--as she should. These are real people, who put their all into a business, who are about to lose it. These are real people who think their businesses can grow with a little bit of help and hire some people. Instead, what we hear from the other sideis we are afraid somebody is going to twist this into a bumper sticker that will look bad.  I used to have a friend of mine named Mike Synar, from Oklahoma. We used to laugh when Members of the House of Representatives would say, ``Man, I hope we don't have to vote on that tough issue again.'' He said, ``If you don't want to fight fires, don't be a firefighter. If you don't want to come to Congress and vote on tough issues, get another job somewhere else.'' I think he was right. He is still right. If these people are afraid of helping small businesses for fear that somebody is going to dream up a bumper sticker and a 30-second ad, think about another job. Because if we can't face issues this important in the middle of a recession and help small businesses with the Landrieu amendment, then we have lost our way.  I am glad to support the Senator, and I yield the floor.
