 President, I rise today to commend a fellow Kentuckian who, like all of us, has asked his neighbors for the honor of representing them in government. Representative Steven J. Rudy speaks for the residents of Ballard, Carlisle, Hickman, Fulton, and McCracken Counties in the Kentucky General Assembly. Amazingly, he won this honor last November at age 26, in his first bid for public office.  Representative Rudy has had a passion for politics and government his entire life. As a high school student, he once declared to his American government teacher that he would hold elective office by age 30. He has always been eager to share his ideas about issues, and to listen to others. After graduating college he worked as a high school teacher, and then at his family's store, Rudy's Farm Center, where he still works when not in Frankfort. In this way he keeps in touch with his constituents.  Representative Rudy has accomplished much in a short time, and I have no doubt he will continue to excel. I look forward to seeing this bright young Kentuckian mature on the political stage. As so many of our best and brightest, he has the potential to transform our Commonwealth into a worldwide leader in technology, medicine, industry, and the cultural arts. I wish him continued success as he follows in the tradition of public service carved out by distinguished Kentuckians such as Alben Barkley and Henry Clay.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record an article from The Paducah Sun, ``Politician long in the making,'' about Representative Rudy's accomplishments and respect for public service.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                  [From the Paducah Sun, Jan. 9, 2005]                     Politician Long in the Making                           (By Matt Sanders)       Kevil, KY--By his senior year at Ballard Memorial High      School, Steven Rudy had developed such a keen interest in      government that he once proclaimed during a county fiscal      court meeting that he would be elected judge-executive before      turning 30.       Rudy may never get a chance to run the county government      because he was elected to the Kentucky House of      Representatives on Nov. 2 at age 26. It was his first try for      public office.       ``Politics has been a lifelong career ambition. There was      really no clear goal growing up,'' said Rudy, who was sworn      in Jan. 4 and will begin his freshman term in the General      Assembly on Feb. 1.       But Rudy doesn't dwell on his upset in the general election      or being one of the youngest lawmakers in Frankfort. Since      his victory, he has focused on becoming a good public servant      and studying the lawmaking process.       ``I've always liked being involved in open discussions--     being able to toss around ideas and make decisions that can      help people. At times, I haven't minded playing the devil's      advocate.''       In the mid-1990s, Julian ``Whitey'' Elliott was Rudy's      American government teacher as well as a county magistrate.      Elliott had a front-row seat at the meeting when the teenager      made his bold prediction. Elliott recalled that he fully      expected his student to make good on his promise and was not      surprised on Nov. 2 by the Republican Rudy's 1,642-vote upset      of 17-year incumbent Charles Geveden in the 1st District.       ``I think Steven has always wanted to make things better,''      Elliott said. ``Early on, even at the local level, he was      able to see that people could serve and make things better.      He never forgot that. Steven saw his chance in this campaign      to make things better.''       As a magistrate, Elliott frequently incorporated county      business into his classroom lectures, which sparked lively      roundtable discussions. He said Rudy never held back his      political views.       ``I kept the students apprised as what was going on in the      county, and I thought it was interesting that Steven was      always willing to speak his mind,'' Elliott said. ``I liked      for the kids to express opinions, but also to respect the      opinions of others who did not agree with you. I tried to get      them to look at issues from the other perspective.       ``I remember Steven leaning toward a Republican stance, and      this was when not every Republican was stating his views      publicly. There were maybe only 300 Republicans in the county      at that time.''       The county now has 712 registered Republicans, compared to      5,154 registered Democrats, according to the Ballard County      Clerk's Office.       Rudy smiled widely and noted that he was the first      registered Republican in his family.       ``My philosophy was always in line with the national      (Republican) platform,'' Rudy said.       In fact, it was through Rudy's persistence that the fiscal      court conducted a meeting in the high school cafeteria so the      students could see government in action.       The fiscal court met twice monthly, in the early afternoon      and at the same time as the American government class. A      substitute teacher took over Elliott's class on fiscal court      days, but Rudy always pleaded with his teacher to allow the      students to attend a meeting. Instead, Elliott brought the      meeting to the students.       ``It was really interesting to watch the magistrates make      decisions on what was right for Ballard County,'' Rudy said.       His interest in government and debate also was nurtured at      Ballard Memorial in the Future Farmers of America chapter,      which taught parliamentary procedure.                            in the beginning       Rudy's political ambition was born at the side of his      grandfather, the late Bill Rudy, who founded the Ballard      County agriculture store that would be the forerunner to the      family farm supply business, Rudy's Farm Center.       Nearly every year, Bill Rudy took his grandson to the Fancy      Farm Picnic, Kentucky's most important grassroots political      event. The often fiery political rhetoric fascinated both      elder and younger Rudy, with their only difference being that      Bill Rudy was a lifelong Democrat.       ``I remember my grandfather talking about the days when the      Democrats bashed the Republicans during the speaking,'' Rudy      said. ``I didn't like that, but I started going to the      picnics at the time (U.S. Senator) Mitch McConnell came along      and he said the things that made me proud.''       Bill Rudy also was involved in State politics--he served as      manager of the State Department of Agriculture's western      Kentucky office in Paducah. He also was a history buff and an      avid reader, which gave him a wealth of knowledge about      American presidents. He could talk for hours about the      presidents and did so at family gatherings.       But had Bill Rudy lived longer, he probably would have      joined his grandson in the Grand Old Party.       ``Dad was really down on Democrats there at the end,'' said      Jack Rudy, Steven's father. ``It may have been what was going      on with (President) Bill Clinton, but he told me that he had      decided on making a change.''       But time did not allow Bill Rudy to change parties. He died      of a heart attack shortly after that conversation with his      son. Bill Rudy's death came in 2000, and ironically on     the first Saturday in August--the day of the Fancy Farm      Picnic.                        once a republican . . .       It seems natural that Rudy recalled one of his earliest      memories was, as a 3-year-old, watching televised replays of      the 1981 assassination attempt of Republican President      Reagan.       The day he registered to vote was also the day he got into      an argument with a deputy county clerk who urged Rudy to      register as a Democrat. Republicans, Rudy said he was told,      rarely were able to vote in primary elections because it was      rare for Republicans to run for elected office in Ballard      County.       ``I couldn't understand that,'' Rudy said. ``Why would      anyone care how you're registered? Voting is what is      important.''       While in college, Rudy wore his Republican feistiness on      his chest during the 1996 presidential campaign. He often      wore a Robert Dole-Jack Kemp T-shirt to classes at the then-     Paducah Community College, much to the displeasure of his      classmates. The Dole-Kemp ticket lost when Democrat Clinton      won a second term.       Rudy's Spartan office at the farm store could resemble the      GOP archives. Atop his filing cabinet is a bottle of red-     white-and-blue labeled ``W'' ketchup, a souvenir from the      2004 presidential race that poked fun at Democrat      presidential nominee John Kerry's wife, Teresa Heinz Kerry,      and stepchildren, who are heirs to the Heinz ketchup fortune.      The bottle stands next to a hardbound copy of ``The Faith of      George Bush.'' Not far away is a photo of Rudy with the      State's three most powerful Republicans, Senators McConnell      and Jim Bunning and Governor Ernie Fletcher.       In fact, business photos and a St. Louis Cardinals' 2005      baseball schedule stand among the few nonpartisan mementos.       But Rudy said his thinking does not always follow partisan      lines. He mentioned two Democrats--former State agriculture      commissioner Billy Ray Smith and 2nd District Rep. Frank      Rasche of Paducah--whom he admired.       ``The Republicans aren't perfect and I don't support      everything within the party,'' Rudy said. ``Billy Ray is a      real down-to-earth guy who would do what was right for all      Kentucky farmers. Frank is someone I feel I can rely on (in      the General Assembly). As chairman of education, he does what      is right for the children of Kentucky.''                             house hunting       The new year will continue to be busy. In addition to      beginning his freshman term in the General Assembly in      February, Rudy and his fiancee, Jessica Patton, are planning      a May wedding. Rudy grinned and said he called Fletcher for      assurance that there would be no special session, which is      usually convened in May.       Searching for a home also presented a challenge. By law,      Rudy must reside within his district, which consists of      Ballard, Hickman, Carlisle and Fulton counties, and nine      western McCracken County precincts. Patton is a receptionist      with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers at Barkley Dam, and the      soon-to-be newlyweds decided to live in McCracken County,      which would be between their work places. That limits their      search to the precincts of Ragland, Woodville, Grahamville,      Lamont, Maxon, Lang, Lone Oak 3, Massac-Milan and Melber.       Rudy pointed to a large map of the nine precincts, covering      nearly one wall in his office. ``Every time she calls and      tells me she found a house, I ask for the location and check      it on the map to see if it's an option,'' Rudy said.                          Reluctant Candidate       Despite his early boasting of political ambitions, there      was not much planning by Rudy prior to announcing his      candidacy. As a small businessman, Rudy said, ``I have seen      things that make Kentucky an unfriendly business state, like      the tax structure.'' He also said he heard much frustration      in the community over the inability of lawmakers to pass a      budget.       Rudy had been active within the party during several      campaigns, including Fletcher's gubernatorial bid, and he      received what he called an unlikely phone call from state      party leaders wanting him to challenge for the 1st District      seat. ``If you would have asked me 18 months ago, it would      have seemed unlikely that I would run. I was very reluctant.      I thought I was too young to be taken seriously,'' Rudy said.      ``But then I figured it was a win-win situation, so I gave it      a shot. If I won the election, great. If I didn't win, the      campaign would have given me plenty of name recognition and I      would have met a great deal of people, which would benefit my      next campaign.''                          The Family Business       Inside Rudy's Farm Center, customers are treated like      family. They are greeted with a smile and a handshake.      Conversations easily flow over a variety of topics--planting      and harvest, weather, church, community events and, of      course, politics.       Retired Barlow farmer Bobby Myers was a frequent customer      and the day was never too busy to pass up discussing current      events with Rudy.       ``We always talked about what was happening, around here      and in Frankfort. He always seemed to know what was going      on,'' Myers said.       Although Myers admitted he never thought then of Rudy as a      future politician, he's confident the freshman lawmaker will      prosper in his new position.       ``I knew his daddy and his granddaddy and Steven is just      like them, good and honest and fair,'' Myers said. ``Those      are the kind of people we need in Frankfort.''       The store--which offers farm, home, hardware and industrial      merchandise--is a family business started in 1986 by his      parents, Jack and Jeanette Rudy. His brother, Matt, also      works at the store. Another brother, Jeff, is a seminary      student.       Steven Rudy handles the center's industrial sales, which      keeps him on his cell phone and behind a computer for much of      his work day.       Rudy took his agriculture education degree from Murray      State University in 2000 and became an agriculture instructor      at Lyon County High School in Eddyville. He used      parliamentary procedure to start the same kind of classroom      debates that he loved as one of Elliott's students.       But his father had always told Rudy there was an opening      for him in the family business. After much prayer and      realizing he could jump-start the store's industrial sales,      Rudy left the classroom, came home and never looked back.       The store lies on the border in both McCracken and Ballard      counties. The front acreage is lined with large merchandise,      but there also is room for a soccer field, complete with two      goals, which the Rudys set up for a local youth league.       Transactions at the farm store typically are finalized with      a bag of freshly popped popcorn, Jack Rudy's favorite snack.      A theater-style popper stands behind the counter, and the      Rudys hand out 50 pounds of the snack every two to three      weeks.       ``Everyone tells me that I eat more than half of it, but      it's a way of saying thanks,'' Jack Rudy said.                             Going To Work       Since his election, Rudy splits his time by attending      sessions in Frankfort for freshmen legislators, working at      the farm store and helping plan the wedding.       The General Assembly will convene Feb. 1 for 25 working      days to consider and act upon legislation.       ``I'm proud of him and I hope he does well,'' Elliott said.      ``The state needs people in Frankfort who care about      people.''                          ____________________[Pages S1191-S1192]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                TRIBUTE TO REPRESENTATIVE STEVEN J.

I was very reluctant.      I thought I was too young to be taken seriously,'' Rudy said.      ``But then I figured it was a win-win situation, so I gave it      a shot. If I won the election, great. If I didn't win, the      campaign would have given me plenty of name recognition and I      would have met a great deal of people, which would benefit my      next campaign.''                          The Family Business       Inside Rudy's Farm Center, customers are treated like      family. They are greeted with a smile and a handshake.      Conversations easily flow over a variety of topics--planting      and harvest, weather, church, community events and, of      course, politics.       Retired Barlow farmer Bobby Myers was a frequent customer      and the day was never too busy to pass up discussing current      events with Rudy.       ``We always talked about what was happening, around here      and in Frankfort. He always seemed to know what was going      on,'' Myers said.       Although Myers admitted he never thought then of Rudy as a      future politician, he's confident the freshman lawmaker will      prosper in his new position.       ``I knew his daddy and his granddaddy and Steven is just      like them, good and honest and fair,'' Myers said. ``Those      are the kind of people we need in Frankfort.''       The store--which offers farm, home, hardware and industrial      merchandise--is a family business started in 1986 by his      parents, Jack and Jeanette Rudy. His brother, Matt, also      works at the store. Another brother, Jeff, is a seminary      student.       Steven Rudy handles the center's industrial sales, which      keeps him on his cell phone and behind a computer for much of      his work day.       Rudy took his agriculture education degree from Murray      State University in 2000 and became an agriculture instructor      at Lyon County High School in Eddyville. He used      parliamentary procedure to start the same kind of classroom      debates that he loved as one of Elliott's students.       But his father had always told Rudy there was an opening      for him in the family business. After much prayer and      realizing he could jump-start the store's industrial sales,      Rudy left the classroom, came home and never looked back.       The store lies on the border in both McCracken and Ballard      counties. The front acreage is lined with large merchandise,      but there also is room for a soccer field, complete with two      goals, which the Rudys set up for a local youth league.       Transactions at the farm store typically are finalized with      a bag of freshly popped popcorn, Jack Rudy's favorite snack.      A theater-style popper stands behind the counter, and the      Rudys hand out 50 pounds of the snack every two to three      weeks.       ``Everyone tells me that I eat more than half of it, but      it's a way of saying thanks,'' Jack Rudy said.                             Going To Work       Since his election, Rudy splits his time by attending      sessions in Frankfort for freshmen legislators, working at      the farm store and helping plan the wedding.       The General Assembly will convene Feb. 1 for 25 working      days to consider and act upon legislation.       ``I'm proud of him and I hope he does well,'' Elliott said.      ``The state needs people in Frankfort who care about      people.''                          ____________________
