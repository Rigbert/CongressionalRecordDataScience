 President, there have been broad requests for a clean continuing resolution. So that is what I have just offered. It is a result of many hours of bipartisan work on both sides of the aisle. It is a fair proposal. It funds all current government operations through December 9, while also providing funding for the new legislation we have just passed overwhelmingly and that the President has signed. That is legislation to address the heroin and prescription opioid epidemic as well as the TSCA bill.  It contains a sufficient downpayment on flood relief for many States, including Maryland, West Virginia, and Louisiana, and, of course, it includes important resources to support our veterans and combat Zika. These are resources needed to help develop a vaccine and promote mosquito control.  Members will have the next 4 days to review before any votes are taken in relation to the issue. Further, we expect the President to either sign or send up the veto message on JASTA by tomorrow. Beginning the process on the clean CR today will ensure that there is adequate time to finish before the override vote and before the current government funding runs out next week. Then we can turn to the veto override.  I look forward to continuing with bipartisan cooperation so we can complete our important work on Zika, veterans funding, and the clean CR that will fund the government through December 9.
