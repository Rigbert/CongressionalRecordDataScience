Presdient, last week, I joined Senator Cardin and Senators Specter, and others in sending a letter to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, FDIC, in an effort to preserve the viability of the Interest on Lawyers' Trust Account program, IOLTA. We have asked the FDIC to ensure that the Transaction Account Guarantee Program, TGLP, through which the FDIC guarantees funds in bank accounts, will also cover lawyer trust accounts. The IOLTA program, which distributes interest on client funds held in lawyer trust accounts to legal aid programs, has been an enormous success in securing legal representation for lower-income Americans. All 50 States have IOLTA programs, and many States mandate participation by practicing attorneys. This program provides funding to important legal aid programs and helps ensure that no person goes without legal representation because of a lack of resources.  Our concern stems from the fact that the TGLP Interim Rule concerning account insurance issued on October 23 would not extend unlimited FDIC insurance to interest bearing lawyer trust accounts, ultimately hurting the public benefit generated by these accounts. According to the FDIC's proposed rules for the TGLP, noninterest-bearing accounts would be insured to protect an unlimited amount of funds. But the insurance for interest-bearing accounts would be limited to $250,000. The lack of an exception for lawyer trust accounts threatens the IOLTA program because it poses a potential conflict for attorneys. Many lawyer trust accounts contain pooled client funds, often in excess of $250,000. As a result of the FDIC's proposed rules, there is legitimate concern that attorneys would move client funds in excess of $250,000 to noninterest-bearing accounts in order to gain the insurance protection, and in an effort to manage client funds as responsibly as possible. This potential ethical dilemma could be prevented by a modification of the proposed rules.  Senator Cardin, Senator Specter, and I have suggested to the FDIC that it modify its proposed rules to make an exception for lawyer trust accounts and provide unlimited insurance on interest bearing accounts containing client funds. This would be an important step towards preserving the success of the IOLTA program, and would remove any potential ethical dilemma for attorneys. Such a modification would ensure that the interest generated by IOLTA accounts continues to be distributed through local nonprofit organizations in each State to fund invaluable legal aid services for low-income families.  I am hopeful that the FDIC will recognize the national importance and success of this program, and will create the exception we have proposed. I would like to particularly thank the Vermont Bar Association for its advocacy in this regard, as well as the American Bar Association for its attention to this issue. Legal representation for everyone is an imperative for a fair and effective judicial system. The IOLTA program has been successful in helping to ensure legal representation for more Americans, and where these goals can be accomplished without the use of tax dollars, such a program should be preserved.                          ____________________
