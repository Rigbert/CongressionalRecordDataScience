 President, I am not a member of the Intelligence Committee. I lead off by saying this has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with the Foreign Operations appropriations bill. We should not be having this debate at this time.  With regard to the issue, there are those on the Intelligence Committee who can speak to it with much more knowledge than I. I am hopeful some of them will come over in the course of this debate. Let me make the point the war on terrorism is an ongoing operation. The decision to classify this material was reached between the intelligence authorizing committees and the executive branch.  Declassifying the information should be carefully considered. For example, would it place in jeopardy the lives of U.S. men and women fighting the war on terrorism? Declassifying material without careful consideration could also have a chilling effect on the sources of information in the war on terrorism, including individuals and foreign governments. It is conceivableboth individuals and foreign governments would be afraid their participation and cooperation in the war on terrorism would become public.  The main point I wish to make is there may be a time and place for this debate, but it is not on this bill. I hope once the debate is concluded we will make a decision not to proceed down this path at this time on this measure.  I retain the remainder of my time.
