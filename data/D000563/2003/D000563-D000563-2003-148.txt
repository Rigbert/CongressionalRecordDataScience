President, there is another very important issue that is associated with this story. I have learned within the last 24 hours that all of the Chinook helicopters in the 106th unit, of which Mr. Slavenas was a part, consist of seven helicopters from the Illinois National Guard and seven from the Iowa National Guard. All of these helicopters do not have the aircraft survivability equipment required to protect them from the very threat that brought down this helicopter on Sunday.  This is a recurring and troublesome issue. We have heard time and again about National Guard forces which are activated and then shortchanged when it comes to the best equipment. We expect the most updated equipment to be given to the units that are in the fight. We understand that Active Duty troops must receive what they need. But consider where we are in the war in Iraq. It is supposedly a complete and seamless integration of National Guard, Reserves, and Active Duty forces. We expect the National Guard, under these circumstances, to receive the necessary upgrades in the war theater.  These Chinook helicopters are supposed to be equipped with one or more protective systems, such as the ALQ-156 system, to detect surface-to-air missiles, along with an automatic flare dispenser as a countermeasure. They are also supposed to be equipped with seat armor to protect the pilot and crew.  What I have learned within the last 24 hours, from reliable military sources familiar with the situation on the ground in Iraq, is many of the Illinois and Iowa National Guard helicopters have flown for almost 6 months in the theater without the necessary aircraft survivability systems. Some of them have received systems, some partial systems, but only within the last week or two, many of the systems have been scavenged from departing Guard units from other States that are leaving Iraq. Many of the helicopters don't have seat armor. There are reports that the radios don't function properly. Reliable military sources have told me and my office about the level of protection for our helicopters in Iraq and what they tell me is unacceptable. They tell me of helicopters ill equipped to deal with the threat of shoulder-fired missiles; units scavenging equipment from helicopters leaving the theater to secure the protective gear they need. They report on helicopters flying without seat armor to protect the pilot and crew, and of helicopters flying without equipment designed to protect them from known infrared missile threats; Guard units scrambling to find the parts necessary to equip their craft with protective gear. Is this how we equip our men and women who are called to active duty?  Today I am asking Secretary Rumsfeld to see to it the helicopters in the theater are provided with the aircraft survivability equipment necessary to meet the expected threat. If that equipment is not available, I believe Secretary Rumsfeld should protect thoseunits until they are properly equipped or reassess when and where they will fly.  I ask unanimous consent that this letter I am sending to Secretary Rumsfeld be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:       Dear Mr. Secretary: We are concerned about reports that the      CH-47 National Guard helicopters attached to the 82nd      Airborne Division, the unit which included the helicopter      shot down by a surface-to-air missile in Iraq on Sunday, may      not have had necessary or fully complete aircraft      survivability equipment. As you know, 16 military personnel      died in that attack, including the pilot, First Lieutenant      Brian D. Slavenas, from Genoa, Illinois. The helicopter was      from the Iowa National Guard.       We understand that, while Guard units that are activated      may leave the United States without all the necessary      equipment, they are to be upgraded in theater. Sources tell      us that a number of the helicopters in the unit in question      were flying in Iraq for almost six months without necessary      equipment, and were only recently provided aircraft      survivability equipment, some of which was not complete. Some      may still be lacking this equipment.       First, we ask that you immediately ensure that the      helicopters in theater are provided with the aircraft      survivability equipment necessary to meet the expected      threat. If that equipment is not available, you should      protect those units until they are properly equipped, or re-     assess when and where they will fly.       We ask that you investigate, and respond as soon as      possible, whether the helicopter that was shot down on Sunday      had on board a fully-operational ALQ-156 system with an      automatic flare dispenser and whether it had seat armor;      whether all of the helicopters in this unit are fully      equipped at this time and the precautions being taken to      protect the crews and passengers of those not properly      equipped. The same questions need to be asked regarding all      activated Guard and Reserve helicopter and fixed-wing units.       We understand that the ALQ-156 is intended to protect      against the expected threat from some surface-to-air      missiles, but may not be as effective against other missiles.      Is the ALQ-156 adequate for the expected threat in Iraq? If      not, we would like to know when the helicopters will receive      the upgraded equipment and your assessment of the risk to      military personnel of flying without such upgraded equipment.       I appreciate your prompt response to this inquiry.           Yours truly,                                                 Richard J. Durbin                                                     U.S. Senator.
