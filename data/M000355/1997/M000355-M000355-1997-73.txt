 I hope the Senator from Wisconsin won't dispute that Professor Neuborne disagreed with the Buckley decision, thinks it was wrong and for 24 years has been trying to argue that somehow the Court ought to reconsider this and change its mind even while the Court has been going more and more in the direction of permissible political speech.  So, Mr. President, I still have the floor, I believe, and if the Senator from Wisconsin is up for a few more questions, I would like to ask him a few.  I gather that the Senator from Wisconsin said last Friday--I know the Senator from Arizona did, too--that they hoped to offer an amendment to restore the individual spending limits on campaigns, if they were given such an opportunity. Is that correct?
