Speaker, It is a great pleasure to bring to the attention of my colleagues the celebration of the 100th anniversary of the Charles County Courthouse in Maryland. Located in the town of La Plata with a unique history, the Courthouse has special meaning to the entire region.  Court was convened for the first time at the Charles County Courthouse on May 25, 1658, in what is currently referred to as Port Tobacco. In 1674, a building was erected at Moore's Lodge about one mile from La Plata. This building was abandoned in 1728 and the courts moved back to original dwellings in Port Tobacco. This was one of the earliest known communities on the east coast and it later became the site of Charles County Colonial government.  The courthouse was completed in 1729 at a cost of 12,000 pounds of tobacco. Destroyed by a windstorm in the early 1800's, a brick structure was built on the same site and occupied by 1820. A suspicious fire completely destroyed the courthouse, reportedly due to the controversy surrounding the proposed move of the county seat to La Plata. In 1894, the legislature approved moving the county seat and provided for a special election to determine the site. On June 4, 1895 La Plata was picked to become the county seat. Completed in 1896 under architect Joseph C. Johnson, a brick Victorian Gothic edifice was built on the present site.  This new courthouse changed little over the years, until the completion of the south addition in 1954. This addition was actually much larger than the original courthouse, easily doubling the size. The courthouse was dedicated with fitting ceremonies on October 2, 1954. In the mid-1970's, the rear of the 1896 building was extended in a typical 18th century style, completely covering the old structure. Today the courthouse is in continuous use, serving as one of the focal points of the growing Charles County region.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join with me in congratulating the fine people of Charles County on this momentous occasion and in wishing the best of luck for the courthouse and its occupants over the next 100 years.                          ____________________
