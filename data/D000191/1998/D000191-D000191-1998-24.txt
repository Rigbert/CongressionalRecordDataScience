Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. Let us get to what we are really debating here today. We are debating the failed trade policy of the United States of America. We are going to run a $200 billion trade deficit this year. That means we are going to export about 4 million jobs. But we were told, ``Don't worry. Those 4 million jobs are those old, dirty, obsolete industrial jobs.'' Even though they were family wages and they paid benefits, not to worry. Those workers will be retrained for the future, the high-tech industry of the United States of America.  So as we export the industrial base jobs, the family wage jobs, the jobs with benefits, what are we going to do now? We are going to import people for those jobs of the future. We are going to export our industrial jobs and we are going to import people into the United States to do the jobs of the future.  What about those 4 million people? What about the people laid off from the aerospace jobs, from the computer companies and everywhere else? Are you telling us the American people are stupid? They know what you are doing here. You are screwing them going and coming. You are going to bring in people to fill the jobs you promised them when you took away their jobs.  Both bills should be rejected, the bill and the substitute.
