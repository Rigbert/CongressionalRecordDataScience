 President, since the Senate last convened, I have learned of the loss of a brave Iowan who was defending freedom overseas. Marine Corporal Zachary Reiff was wounded during combat operations in Helmand Province, Afghanistan and later succumbed to his wounds. This news has hit the close knit community of Preston, IA very hard. My prayers go out to all who knew Zach, particularly his parents Marcia and Matt, as well as his brother Kolby and his sister Emily. By all accounts, he was active in school, having played football, wrestled, and ran track as well as participating in school plays. As such, there was certainly no shortage of people in the community with memories to share. It is also evident that Zach is well thought of judging by the outpouring of good will following the news that he had been wounded. Zach is described as a caring person. Certainly, the beaming smile in many pictures posted on a Facebook prayer page in his honor makes even those who didn't know him wish that they had.  Friends say that Zach was proud to serve his country and liked his work. Zach Reiff is one of those special Americans who throughout our history have not hesitated to put their life on the line for the Stars and Stripes and everything it stands for. Our country is truly blessed to have patriots such as Zach Reiff. We owe him more than we can express and we have an obligation to remember him and his sacrifices in the name of liberty.                          ____________________
