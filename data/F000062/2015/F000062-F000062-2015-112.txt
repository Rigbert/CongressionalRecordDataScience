 President, I rise today to speak about the historic drought that is devastating California and much of the West and to introduce the California Emergency Drought Relief Act along with Senator Boxer.  The toll on some of our most vulnerable communities is mounting.  As of July, 2,091 wells are already dry or will soon run out of water. This puts more than 10,000 people in jeopardy.  Rural and disadvantaged communities are some of the hardest hit.  Just this month, the Washington Post reported that arsenic had been found in wells serving St. Anthony's mobile home park in the Coachella Valley at twice the safe concentration.  In Porterville, Californians are bathing themselves with bottled water.  California is also suffering a massive loss of agriculture production.  A study from UC Davis estimates that farmers will fallow 563,000 acres in 2015, a 35 percent increase from last year when farmers fallowed 410,000 acres.  The State's agriculture sector stands to lose $1.8 billion in direct agricultural costs this year, on top of $1.5 billion last year.  The San Joaquin Valley is at the epicenter of the drought, and the possible damage to our nation's food supply is dire.  The Valley is home to 90 percent of the country's tomatoes, 74 percent of our lettuce, and 95 percent of our broccoli. The drought's effects on the Valley will extend far beyond California's borders.  But the devastating consequences of this drought aren't limited to a single region.  UC Davis also reports that California's economy will lose an estimated $2.7 billion in 2015, along with 18,600 jobs.  That is on top of $2.2 billion last year and 17,100 jobs lost.  Effects on the environment are also destructive.  Groundwater reserves in underground aquifers are being depleted, which is causing the surrounding land to sink.  Delta smelt are at their lowest levels since surveys first began in 1959, while Chinook salmon are imperiled by warmer water in the Sacramento River.  Saltwater from the San Francisco Bay threatens to contaminate freshwater in the Delta, imperiling an entire ecosystem, not to mention the ill effects on drinking water supplies and farmland.  Finally, we can't ignore the increasing threat of wildfires. Since January 1, the U.S. Forest Service reports more than 5,000 fires have burned on state and federal lands, a 10 percent increase over last year.  Despite the high likelihood of a strong El Nino this year, one wet season won't fix the problems. Experts estimate that California needs at least three above-average precipitation years to cover the current 37 million acre-foot deficit.  Doing nothing is simply not an option.  In drafting the bill we're introducing today, we started with the bill that unanimously passed the Senate in 2014.  We then modified that bill, adding significant environmental protections and removing controversial provisions.  We also included a range of provisions to protect and restore threatened and endangered species, as well as a number of programs to support long-term infrastructure projects like desalination, water recycling and storage.  My staff and I have taken dozens of meetings since January.  We have met with Congressional Republicans and Democrats, environmental groups, water districts, and State and local officials.  My California staff has visited water projects throughout the State to collect ideas, and my staff in Washington has consulted closely with Federal agencies to ensure the bill adheres to environmental law.  By releasing a bill this summer, months before the rainy season, Congress and the public will have ample time to review, debate and, where necessary, suggest improvements.  I expect the bill will receive a committee hearing, allowing every member of Congress and the public to weigh in.  Let me briefly discuss how this bill will help.  Federal policy will be most effective if it is aligned with the State's goals and the State water bond.  This means expanding Federal efforts to include long-term solutions such as desalination, recycling and storage. We also must look at ways to help communities that are running out of water.  To help those communities, the bill includes a new program to assist areas that have suffered the brunt of the drought, communities like Porterville and others in Tulare County.  Providing emergency supplies like bottled water is a no-brainer, but it is a short-term fix.  We need to look beyond this emergency at ways we can shift these communities from vulnerable water sources like wells to more sustainable and resilient water systems.  We also need to take a close look at desalination and water recycling. These are two of the most promising technologies that may offer long-term solutions.  The bill identifies 26 desalination projects capable of producing more than 330,000 acre-feet of water.  It also identifies 105 recycling projects with the potential to produce about 854,000 acre-feet of water.  That is a total of 1.2 million acre-feet of clean water per year, enough for 2.4 million households.  But these projects aren't cheap. That is why the bill funds a loan-guarantee program and other financing mechanisms to help make these projects a reality.  Another area we should focus on is storage. This drought has showed that our reservoir capacity is insufficient.  Given the consensus that droughts will grow more severe, we have to increase how much water we can hold from wet to dry years.  The bill positions the Federal Government as a partner with California to build new reservoirs and expand existing reservoirs.  Conservation and groundwater recharge are two more promising areas. While cities and towns are doing their part, the bill also identifies areas where the Federal, state and local governments and the ag sector can do more.  Finally, the Federal Government can play a significant role in supporting research on promising technologies, from recapturing energy and improving membranes used in desalination to developing strategies to minimize environmental effects of smart-water strategies.  The bill also includes a number of short-term, low-cost proposals to protect and assist in the recovery of fish populations, including salmon and smelt.  This includes authorizations to implement the Endangered Species Act recovery plan for salmon; trap-and-barge fish and address predator species, two ways to reduce mortality rates; create additional spawning habitat for endangered and threatened species; and improving how water systems are managed using the latest science and technology.  The bill's short-term provisions build on legislation that unanimously passed the Senate in 2014, with added protections for environmental and water rights and the removal of several provisions to address environmental concerns.  The bill's short-term provisions will help move water efficiently to those areas where it is most needed.  Let me be clear--this language was carefully drafted to remain consistent with environmental laws, including the Endangered Species Act and the Clean Water Act, as well as all biological opinions.  Here are some examples of how the short-term section works.  First, by operating the water systems with more precision, we will be able to monitor for endangered species like the Delta Smelt and adjust pumping levels to avoid harming fish. By doing this, more water can be moved to the communities that need it while protecting endangered and threatened species.  The bill also directs agencies to open the Cross-Channel Gates on the Sacramento River during times when salmon are not migrating. This would allow thousands of acre feet of water to be moved without harming fish or water quality.  For water transfers in the Delta--where water sellers and buyers can help get water where it's needed--we included many additional protections. Every transfer will be reviewed to ensure it is consistent with environmental laws. The transfers, which can only occur in April and May, must include only additional water pumped into the Delta on top of the regular river flow.  Moving water more efficiently will help supply water to millions of Californians in urban areas, from Silicon Valley to Southern California.  It will also increase water allocations for family farms in the San Joaquin Valley. More than 15,000 small farms served by the Friant Water Authority--with an average size of just 83 acres--would benefit.  I have introduced many bills during my years in the Senate, and this may be the most difficult.  Nevertheless, the goal has remained constant: a bill that can get signed into law that benefits all regions of the State.  Congress worked together after Hurricanes Katrina ravaged the Gulf Coast and Hurricane Sandy devastated the East Coast.  I think we now have a bill that will help the West survive this historic drought.  I look forward to a committee hearing on this bill and to public input to make it even better.                                 ______                                       By Mr. McCAIN:  S. 1895. A bill to amend the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act for purposes of making claims under such Act based on exposure to atmospheric nuclear testing; to the Committee on the Judiciary.  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation that would amend the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, RECA, by adding Mohave County, AZ, to the list of counties eligible for downwinder compensation. A similar proposal was introduced today by Congress Paul Gosar. I am hopeful this bill will help close a painful chapter for those Arizonans who were arguably the most affected by nuclear weapons testing during the Cold War.  In 1990, Congress enacted the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act to compensate victims or their survivors who suffered certain illnesses caused by fallout exposure ``down wind'' of atmospheric nuclear weapons testing during the 1950's and 1960's. Among other requirements, eligibility is limited to individuals who can prove their physical presence in one of several affected counties. Astonishingly, despite its close proximity to the Nevada Test Site, the original RECA law and its subsequent amendments never listed Mohave County proper as an affected area. I believe the people of Mohave County deserve to see righted this unjust policy which has obstructed their ability to qualify for compensation.  I understand that several of my colleagues have proposed similar RECA amendments in previous years. I would hope that these various RECA proposals give additional consideration to an April 2005 report by the National Academy of Sciences, NAS, that assessed, among other things, whether additional geographic areas should be added to the RECA program. The NAS study revealed a much wider area of radioactive fallout then originally identified when the RECA law was first written. The report also recommended replacing the geographic area criteria with a new science-based process for determining compensation eligibility, a method similar to what's used in the Radiation Exposed-Veterans Compensation Act and the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act. I believe it is worthwhile for policy makers to consider the recommendations of the NAS report.  This bill is an expansion of the RECA program and thus I will be working with my colleagues to find funding offsets to ensure there is no net increase in government spending if this legislation were enacted. I encourage my colleagues to support this bill.                          ____________________
