 President, since 1987, when I first proposed an overhaul of the welfare system, I have argued that welfare recipients should be required to work. Nine years later, America is still in need of fundamental welfare reform.  So, today, Mr. President, Senator Specter and I are introducing the Bipartisan Welfare Reform Act of 1996--the Senate companion to legislation introduced in April by Representatives Mike Castle and John Tanner and 30 moderate House Members from both parties.  Let me briefly review how we got to this point and why we are taking this action.  Last September, the Senate passed a bipartisan welfare reform bill by an overwhelming vote of 87-12. I voted for that bill, and President Clinton said he could sign it.  Since then, however, polarizing partisanship and Presidential politics have permeated this issue. And, the result has been paralysis. Nothing has been accomplished.  In an attempt to break the gridlock, last February, the Nation's Governors--led by my Governor, Tom Carper--proposed a bipartisan welfare reform bill. In April, Representatives Castle and Tanner and a group of other moderates wrote what I believe is a first-rate bipartisan welfare reform plan.  No such bipartisan plan to date has been introduced in the Senate. And, as this issue will be back before us again soon, Senator Specter and I decided that now is the time--and the Castle-Tanner proposal is the bill to move us forward.  What this bill proposes, in and of itself, is not new. What is new is that it is being proposed all together in a bipartisan fashion.  For that, Representative Castle and Senator Specter deserve great applause. They are reaching across the aisle to do what the American people sent us to Congress to do--work together to solve the problems facing this country. And, again, I think the bill we are introducing today is a first-rate bill.  To highlight the basic principles: there would be a 5-year time limit on receiving welfare benefits. After 2 years, welfare recipients would be required to work--at least 25 hours per week. And, child care would be available, so that children are not left home alone while their mothers are working.  The bill would make getting tough on the deadbeat dads who do not pay child support as high a priority as getting tough on the welfare moms. And, the bill takes steps to crack down on welfare--particularly food stamp--fraud.  This will all sound familiar to those who have followed this debate. And, as I said a moment ago, it is. For the principles have never been in doubt--almost everyone agrees on them.  You see, what has been lost in the shuffle and shouting of the last 10 months is that there is a great deal of common ground on welfare reform. So much so, that if you leave behind the politics and the partisanship, a tough, bipartisan welfare reform bill is easily within reach.  I think this is that bill. But, if not, it is awfully darn close. Let me just mention a couple of examples of bipartisan compromise.  For Republicans, the bill converts aid to families with dependent children--AFDC-- to a block grant to the States. For Democrats, it more adequately invests in child care.  For Republicans, the bill freezes funding for cash welfare payments. For Democrats, it provides additional help to those States faced with economic downturns.  For Republicans, the bill imposes a family cap. For Democrats, it gives States flexibility to opt out.  Is this bill exactly how I would have written a bill on my own in the solitude of my office? The answer is no. But, if we are going to move forward, we must stop insisting that there be a perfect bill or no bill at all.  It is time to say that we do not care who gets credit for reforming welfare. It is time to just do it--in a bipartisan fashion--for the sake of the American people and for the sake of the people on welfare.  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor the Biden-Specter Bipartisan Welfare Reform Act, and I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill prepared by Representative Tanner be included in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:        Highlights of the Bipartisan Welfare Reform Act of 1996 title i--block grant for temporary assistance to needy families (tanf)       Basic grant. Consolidates funding for AFDC, JOBS and      Emergency Assistance (EA) into a $16.35 annual billion block      grant to states beginning in FY 1997 called the Temporary      Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant.       Supplemental grant fund of $800 million for FY 1997-FY 2000      for states with high population growth and/or low grant      amounts per poor person.       Contingency Fund for State Welfare Programs. Establishes a      contingency fund for states of $2 billion in matching funds      over five years (FY 1997-2001) for states that experience      high unemployment or an increase in the food stamp caseload.      States must also meet a 100% maintenance of effort      requirement in the year they use the contingency fund. Funds      are provided at the end and cannot exceed 20% of a state's      annual TANF grant in a fiscal year.       State plan. States would be required to submit a state plan      for approval in order to receive federal funds. The Secretary      must approve any plan which meets the following basic      requirements:       Work Requirements. Require all able-bodied recipients to      engage in work activities within two years of receiving      assistance.       Fair and equitable treatment. Set forth objective criteria      for the delivery of benefits and the determination of      eligibility and fair and equitable treatment, treat families      with similar needs and circumstances similarly and provide      opportunities for recipients who have been adversely affected      to be heard in a state administrative or appeal process.       Out of wedlock pregnancies. Establish goals and take      actions to reduce the incidence of out of wedlock      pregnancies, with special emphasis on teenagers.       Other programs. Have in place a child support enforcement      and child protection programs.       Local Control. Certify that 1) local governments and      private sector organizations are included in all phases of      developing the plan; 2) local officials who are responsible      for administration of services are able to plan, design and      administer programs in their jurisdiction; and 3) there are      no unfunded mandates on local governments.       Non-displacement. Certify that the state program will not      result in the displacement of any current employees or      replacement of an employee who was terminated with      individuals receiving assistance under the state plan.       Maintenance of effort. 85% maintenance of effort      requirement through FY 2001 based on a state's FY 1994      spending on AFDC, JOBS, and AFDC-related child care and EA.      State spending on programs that were not part of the state's      AFDC program would not be counted in meeting the maintenance      of effort. The Secretary may reduce the maintenance of effort      requirement by up to 5% (down to 80%) for states that have      high performance in placing individuals in private sector      employment and increase the states maintenance of effort by      up to 5% (up to 90%) if the state fails to meet the work      participation rates.       Transferability. States may transfer up to 20% of the      federal TANF grant to the Child care and Development Block      grant.       Time limits on benefits:       Five year federal limit. A state may not provide cash      assistance to a family that includes and adult who has      received any assistance under the TANF grant for 60 months.       State option for time limits. States have the option of      terminating benefits to a family that includes an adult who      has received assistance for 24 months.       Exemption to time limits. States may grant exemptions to up      to 20% of the caseload for either reason of hardship or if      the individual has been battered or subject to extreme      cruelty.       Vouchers. States have the option of providing assistance in      the form of vouchers for the needs of the child (diapers,      etc.) for families who lose benefits as a result of the      federal five year time limit. States must provide vouchers to      families who lose assistance as a result of a state time      limit of less than five years.       Work requirements. States must require a parent or      caretaker receiving assistance under the program to engage in      work after receiving assistance for 24 months:       Individual Responsibility Contract. Require welfare      recipients sign an individual responsibility contract      developed by the state upon becoming eligible for cash      assistance. The individual responsibility contract would      outline what actions the individual would take to move to      private sector employment. The contract will also outline      what services the state will provide to the individual.       Eligible work activities. Unsubsidized employment;      subsidized private and public sector employment; work      experience, on-the-job     training; job search and job readiness (limited to 12 weeks      in a year); community service; vocational educational      training (not to exceed 12 months for any individual).      Education and job skills training will not count toward      meeting the first 20 hours of participation (unless in the      case of education, the parent is a teen). Individuals who      have welfare for private sector employment (``leavers'')      would be considered as engaged in work activities for      purposes of calculating participation rates for six months      provided that they remain employed.       Required hours. The minimum average number of hours per      week for all recipients in 20 hours for FY 1996, FY 1997, and      FT 1998; and 25 hours in FY 1999 and thereafter.       Participation rates. States must meet the following      participation rates for single parent families: 1996-15%,      1997-20%, 1998-25%, 1999-30, 2000-35%, 2001-40%, 2002 and      thereafter-50%. The rates for two-parent families are: 1996-     50%, 1997-75%, 1998-75%, 1999 and thereafter-90%.       Pro rata reduction in participation rate. States will      receive pro rata reduction in the participation rate      requirement if the number of families receiving assistance      under the State program is less than the number of families      that received the AFDC in FY 1995.       Work Funding. Provides $3 billion in supplemental funds for      the operation of work programs that states can draw down      beginning in 1999 if the state is maintaining 100% of 1994      state spending on AFDC work programs and demonstrates that it      needs additional funds to meet the work requirements or      certifies that it intends to exceed the work requirements.      The state must match the additional federal funds for work      programs at FMAP.       Other Provisions:       Minor mothers. Teen parents under age 18 must attend school      and live at home or with a responsible adult. States have the      option of denying aid to unmarried teen mothers and their      children.       Family cap. States have the option of denying cash      assistance to additional children born or conceived while the      parent is on welfare.       Bonuses for reducing out-of-wedlock births. Includes      bonuses to states that reduce out-of-wedlock births without      increasing abortions.                          Title II--SSI REFORM       SSI Benefits for children. Reform the SSI program to      address the so-called ``crazy check'' problem in the child      SSI program by eliminating the current Individualized      Functional equivalency standards, maladaptive behavior and      psychoactive substance dependence disorder. The Social      Security Administration would be required to revise      functional equivalency standard within the medical listings.      All children who are currently on the rolls as a result of      the IFA process would be reevaluated under the new criteria      established in Section 9601. Parents would be required to      demonstrate that funds received from SSI were used to assist      the disabled child during the review. The provisions would be      effective on October 1, 1996.       Deeming of parents income for children. Increase the      portion of the income of a child's parents that is ``deemed''      in determining the eligibility of that child for SSI for      families with incomes above 150% of poverty.       Disability Review for SSI recipients who are 18 years of      age. Requires children who received SSI benefits to undergo a      disability review before being placed on the adult rolls at      age 18.       SSI benefits for individuals convicted of fraud. Denies      benefits for ten years to an individual who is found to have      fraudulently misrepresenting residence in order to receive      AFDC, TEA, Food Stamps or SSI benefits simultaneously in two      or more states.       SSI benefits for fugitive felons and probation and parole      violators. Denies SSI benefits to individuals in any month in      which the individual is fleeing prosecution or imprisonment.      Authorizes SSA to provide information regarding SSI      beneficiaries if requested by law enforcement officers for      recipients who are fleeing prosecution or imprisonment.       SSI Continuing Disability Reviews. Requires Social Security      Administration to schedule continuing disability reviews      (CDRs) for all current and future adult SSI recipients to      ensure that they are still eligible. The CDRs would be      scheduled on a staggered schedule with reviews every three      years for covered individuals. Individuals who have      disabilities which are not expected to improve or who are      more than 65 years old would be exempt.                        Title III--CHILD SUPPORT       Distribution. Post-welfare arrearages must be paid to the      family first beginning October 1, 1997. Pre-welfare      arrearages will also be paid to the family first but the      effective date for this provision will be October 1, 2000. If      pre-welfare arrearages paid to the family exceed state      savings from the elimination of the $50 disregard and other      methods of improving collections in the bill, the federal      government will pay the difference to the state.       Incentive adjustments. The Secretary will develop a new      performance-based incentive system to be effective October 1,      1997.       System automation. Extends the 90% enhanced match for state      implementation of the data systems requirement that were      created by the Family Support Act until October 1, 1997.      States must have submitted their advance planning document by      September 30, 1995. Increases in the funding available for      new systems requirements to $400 million from the $260      million, originally included in both bills. Provides an      enhanced match of 80% for new requirements.       Paternity establishment rate. Increases the paternity      establishment rate from 75% to 90%. States failing to reach      it or make adequate progress will have their TANF grant      reduced. Paternity establishment ratio is amended to be based      on all children born out-of-wedlock, not just to those      receiving AFDC or child support services.       New requirements. States must establish an automated      central registry of IV-D case records and support orders and      an automated directory of new hires; operate a centralized      unit to collect and disburse all child support orders (not      just IV-D cases); and meet expanded requirements around      enforcement and paternity establishment.       Licenses. Requires states to have laws suspending drivers,      professional, occupation and recreational license for overdue      child support.                         Title IV--IMMIGRATION.       Food stamp and SSI bar. Current and future immigrants are      barred from food stamps and SSI until attaining citizenship      with the following exceptions:       (1) Children are exempted from the food stamp ban;       (2) Disabled children;       (3) Victims of domestic abuse;       (4) Refugees in their five years in the U.S.;       (5) Veterans and active duty service members and their      spouses and dependents;       (6) Individuals who have worked and paid FICA taxes for 60      months.       5-year ban. New entrants are denied all other federally      means-tested benefits for five years after arrival in the      U.S. with same exemptions as above. Programs not included in      the bar include Medicaid emergency medical services, child      nutrition, immunization programs, foster care and adoption      assistance, higher education loans and grants and Chapter 1.       Deeming until citizenship required for Medicaid (same      exemptions as above) for all immigrants until citizenship.       State options. New immigrants would be barred for five      years from Medicaid, Title XX and the TANF block grant.      States have the option to deny or restrict benefits under      these programs for current immigrants and new immigrants      (after their first five years). State authority to limit      eligibility of immigrants for state and local means-tested      programs. Non-profit organizations and community      organizations designated by the state attorney general would      be exempted from enforcing this ban.       Affidavits of support. Sponsors' affidavits of support are      binding and enforceable against the sponsors until the      immigrant attains citizenship.          title v.--reductions in federal government positions       Requires a reduction of 75 percent in the number of federal      positions in agencies that administer programs that have been      converted into a block grant.                  title vi.--reform of public housing       Ensures that penalties imposed by states against      individuals who fail to comply with rules under welfare      programs do not result in reduced public and assisted housing      rents.                         title vii.--child care       Funding. Over the period FY 1997-FY 2002, combines $13.85      billion in mandatory funding and $6 billion in discretionary      spending into the Child Care and Development Block Grant      (CCDBG):       Discretionary funding (representing the old CCDBG) is      authorized at $1 billion annually and must be appropriated      annually. Allocation of these funds to states is based on      current CCDBG formula.       Mandatory funding or entitlement funding levels are $1.967      billion in FY 1997, $2.067 billion in FY 1999, $2.367 billion      in FY 2000, $2.567 billion in FY 2001 and $2.717 billion in      FY 2002. States will receive a ``base allocation'' based on      what they received in previous years funds above this amount      will be distributed on a matching basis.       CCDBG rules. Rules and regulations of the Child Care      Development Block Grant apply to all funds under the child      care section. Retains current requirement that states apply      minimum health and safety standards to providers and adds a      requirement that states not implement any policy or practice      that has the effect of restricting parental choice. All funds      must be transferred to the lead agency under the Child care      and Development Block Grant. There will be a 5 percent cap on      administrative costs.                       Title IX.--CHILD NUTRITION       Child and Adult Care Food Program. Restructures the meal      reimbursements for family day care homes in the Child and      Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) by targeting assistance to      poorer areas.       Summer Food Service Program. Reduces the reimbursement rate      for breakfast, lunches and snacks served under the Summer      Food Service Program.                      Title X.--FOOD STAMP REFORM       Fraud and Abuse. All of USDA's proposals to combat food      stamp fraud and abuse are included, whereas HR 4 included      only some of those proposals.       Cooperations with child support agencies Requiring food      stamp participants to cooperate with child support agencies      will be an option for the States, rather than a mandate as      under HR 4.       Adjustments to Thrifty Food Program. Food stamp benefits      will be based on 100% of the Thrifty Food Plan rather than      103% as in current law, as in both bills. The standard      deduction used in calculating food stamp eligibility and      benefit levels will be reduced.       Simplified food stamp program States will be authorized to      operate a simplified food stamp program, combining elements      of the food stamp program and the cash welfare program. Such      a program must be approved by the Secretary and may not      increase federal costs or substantially alter the appropriate      distribution of benefits according to household need.       Waiver authority USDA will be required to respond to a      request of a State for a waiver of food stamp rules within 60      days of receipt of the request.                        Title XI.--MISCELLANEOUS       Appropriation of funds by state legislature. Requires that      block grants must be appropriated in accordance with the laws      and procedures applicable to expenditures of the state's own      revenues, including appropriation by the state legislature.      Applies to the cash assistance, child care, child protection      and optional food stamp block grants. (This would preempt      state law in a number of states.)       Social Services Block Grant. Reduces the mandatory spending      level of the Social Services Block Grant by 10% beginning in      FY 1997 through FY2002--from $2.8 billion to $2.52 billion      annually.       Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) programs. Exempts state      and local government electronic benefit transfer programs      from Regulation E of the Electronic Funds Transfer Act.
