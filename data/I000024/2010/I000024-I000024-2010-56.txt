President, I read an article from the October 2010 edition of the Defense Technology International this morning that discussed military and other technology advances. Entitled ``Big Guns: China muscles up artillery punch,'' this article details China's efforts in the development of artillery and rocket systems and the associated doctrine they have created. Specifically, it addresses Chinese efforts in research and development in areas such as computer-based fire control, digital communication, and command capabilities, use of sophisticated radars and jammers, and the development of ramjet powered and stealth coated artillery shells, to name a few key areas. Though not necessarily new items of research and development for the United States, China's efforts in these areas tells me one thing: China is pursuing modernization and development initiatives that, based on our recent history of research and development specific to artillery and rockets, may be superior if they are not at least equal to our efforts  Now let me shift same gears to another potential peer country: Russia and its fifth-generation fighter development. In the same context as China's efforts in artillery and rocket capability, Russia is pursuing the deployment of a fifth-generation fighter, known as the PAK FA advanced tactical frontline fighter. Russia has publicly stated that this aircraft is the peer to the F-22. This aircraft, together with upgraded fourth-generation fighters, will define Russian Air Force potential for the next several decades and will challenge our aviation efforts without question. And don't think that China isn't developing their own fifth-generation aircraft; they are. It is called the JA-12 it is also going to go head to head with our F-22.  The point to this is not a comparison of capabilities or numbers but a public reinforcement of an assessment I have maintained for a long time. We, the United States of America, are not taking our future national security seriously, because we are failing to focus on maintaining the edge that we have had for the last several decades.  So where is the United States in terms of future military hardware necessary to maintain that edge? Did you know that the oldest combat vehicle in the Army inventory is the M109A6 Paladin howitzer and we are on the sixth version of this vehicle which is built around a refurbished chassis circa 1963? The Army's answer to artillery modernization has been the Crusader, which was supposed to replace the Paladin, the Non-Line-of-Sight Cannon as part of FCS, the Non-Line-of-Sight Launch System, another FCS related system, and now the Paladin Integrated Management, or PIM program, which is a modification of the Paladin to a Bradley chassis. All but the PIM program have been cancelled in the last 8 years or so, and the PIM program has been delayed in production.  Current Army fleets of armored personnel carriers, tanks, wheeled vehicles, and helicopters were developed and procured 30 to 60 years ago. DOD and the President's answer to that: cancel FCS, with no viable replacement options, and continue to ``upgrade'' current fleets of Bradleys an Abrams tanks until the next-generation ground combat vehicle can be figured out.  Our strategic bomber fleet of B-52s, B-1s and B-2s vary in age from 10 to 30 years. The SECDEF has publicly stated in the press and in Congress that 2020 will be the first time we see a new bomber, which means that current airframes will have to remain in service until at least 2040.  One of our two fifth-generation aircraft, the F-22, the peer to the Russian's PAK FA and Chinese JA-12, has had the production line cancelled with only 187 aircraft built out of a requested 750, pulling us in a ``high risk'' state for air dominance. The other fifth-generation aircraft, the F-35, will not be ready until at least 2015, has suffered significant cost and timing problems, and will be 250 aircraft less than the requested 1,240.  Our Ohio class Trident submarines, the ones that deliver ballistic missiles from the sea, are an average of 20 years old. Replacement builds don't start till 2019 and won't be finished until 2028. As well, the administration remains opaque about plans for replacement of the 30-year-old air-launched cruise missile which is a critical component of our nuclear and long-range conventional strike capability. This is the same for our Minuteman ICBM, which is decades old as well.  I am convinced well beyond any reasonable doubt that we are heading down a slippery slope due to a shortsighted and dangerous strategy from our current administration. The litany of programs cancelled, modified, or mismanaged over the last two budget periods is minf-boggling--FCS, F-22, F-35, NLOS-C and LS, PIM, missile defense, nuclear stockpile, surface and submarine ships, strategic bombers--the list is overwhelming.  I, for one, will not let this happen. I will continue to voice my concerns over this issue. I will continue to fight for a flat expenditure of at least 4 percent of GDP spent on defense to ensure that this country continues to have the best military in the world. I will continue to press the administration to do more for the future of our national security.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the article ``Big Guns'' to which I referred.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         [From the Defense Technology International, Oct. 2010]               Big Guns--China Muscles Up Artillary Punch                      (By Richard D. Fisher, Jr.)       The International Institute for Strategic Studies' Military      Balance 2010 report places China third in the number of      artillery systems it fields, after Russia and North Korea.      But China doubtless exceeds both in resource commitment and      breadth of artillery investments. Credited with an estimated      17,700-plus towed, self-propelled and rocket systems, the      People's Liberation Army (PLA) has at least 56 artillery      systems in use, development or available for export. The U.S.      Army and Marine Corps, by contrast, have 8,187-plus artillery      pieces of roughly 10 types.       China has had a mixed record of using artillery for      military and political-military goals. Its successes as when      it routed Indian forces in 1962 with the high-altitude use of      artillery and mortars, have been offset by incidents      provoking third-party responses or leading to regional      standoffs. Examples include the shelling of islands      controlled by Taiwan in 1955-58, resulting in U.S.      intervention and a stalemate over the Taiwan Strait. In July,      a unit based in the Nanjing military region fired missiles      from 300-mm. PHL-03 multiple rocket launchers (MRLs) into the      Yellow Sea to show China's anger at U.S. naval exercises with      South Korea. The exercises, a result of China-backed North      Korea's sinking of the South Korean frigate Cheonon in March,      went ahead anyway.       China evolution as an artillery power stems from Soviet and      Russian influences dating to the Korean War Soviet artillery      and training improved PLA artillery operations during the war      and led to the formation of the first formal artillery      command. Soviet aid continued through the 1950s, and by the      time of the Sin-Soviet split of the 1960s, China was      producing copies or modified versions of Soviet pieces.       The PLA makes extensive use of Soviet-origin 152-, 130- and      122-mm. calibers, though Western calibers such as the 155-      and 105-mm. are seeing greater use. China purchased the      Russian 9A52 Smerch 300-mm. MRL in the 1990s, and the PLA      produced a near facsimile in the A-100/PHL-03 MRL. The 155-     mm. PLZ-05 self-propelled artillery system that emerged in      2005 bears an uncanny resemblance to the Russian 2519 MSTA.       In the 1990s, PLA artillery was affected by reforms in      strategy (its closest concept to doctrine) and organization.      Toward the end of the decade, the PLA was immersed in      strategy goals of ``informatization'' and ``mechanization.''      The former included the broad application of improving      information technologies, which for artillery included new      computer-based fire controls and ever-improving digital      communication and command linkages. PLA artillery units      increasingly include flrefinding counter-battery radar such      as the 50-km.-range (31-mi.) SLC-2 and Type 704, and use      sophisticated electronic warfare systems such as the Russian      SPR-2 radio fuse jammer, a possible Chinese facsimile and      possibly a recently revealed artillery radar jammer.      Artillery recon vehicles and recon troops feature advanced      optronic and digital communication capabilities. In addition,      PLA artillery units have sophisticated meteorological      capabilities and use muzzle velocity radar to improve      accuracy.       Mechanization put renewed emphasis on developing tracked      and wheeled self-propelled tubed artillery, with rocket      artillery largely truck-mounted. This trend was emphasized in      late 2004 when Chinese Communist Party and PLA leader Hu      Jintao enunciated the PLAs new ``historic missions,'' a      euphemism for invasions, which call on the PLA to defend      state interests abroad. It is likely that new medium-weight      artillery systems based on airmobile armored personnel      carriers will follow for these strategic missions.       Organic PLA artillery units have decreased in size,      following the pattern of general large-scale troop      reductions. When combined with ``informatization'' advances,      this will permit many infantry and armored divisions to be      reformed into mechanized brigades. However, in a counter-     trend that emphasizes their continued importance, the PLA      maintains five independent artillery divisions and 20      independent brigades. Of these, two divisions and six      brigades are stationed in the Shenyang and Beijing military      regions, for potential Korean contingencies. Three divisions      and eight brigades are in the Nanjing Guangzhou and Jinan      military regions, for Taiwan contingencies.       Among artillery systems, mortars include a 60-mm. hand-held      system used by infantry and special forces. The new Type 93      60-mm. fixed mortar weighs 22.4 kg. (49.2 lb.) and fires 20      rounds/min. to 5.5 km. There are also fixed W91 and W87 81-     mm. mortars that fire to 8 km. and 5.6 km., respectively. The      PLA has largely copied Russia's Vasilyek 81-mm. automatic      mortar, called the W99 or SM-4, which comes in a towed      version or mounted in a Hummer-like vehicle. It fires four      rounds in 2 sec. out to 6.2 km. The W86 120-mm. towed mortar      weighs 206 kg. and fires 20 rounds/min. to 4.7 km.       In 2001, the PLA revealed the PLL-05 mobile mortar based on      the Russian 120-mm. 2S23 NONA-SVK that it purchased in the      1990s, but mounted on a WZ-551 6 X 6 armored personnel      carrier (APC). It fires a rocket-assisted round 13.5 km. In      2007, the PLA revealed a laser-guided 120-mm. mortar round,      though it is not clear if it is in service.       Towed and self-propelled tubed systems dominate artillery      units. The largest number of towed guns are likely the 122-     mm. versions. These include the Type-96, based on the Russian      D-30, with a 360-deg. traversing base, and the simpler Type-     83. Their rocket-assisted rounds have a 27-km. range. The      Type-59 130-mm. towed gun fires a rocket-assisted round 44      km. Of heavy towed artillery, the 152-mm. Type-66, a copy of      the Russian D-20, is most numerous and fires rocket-assisted      rounds 28 km. In 1999, the PLA revealed the 155-mm. PLL01/WA      021 towed artillery system, based on the Austrian Noricum GH      N-45, which fires a rocket-assisted round 50 km. The PLL01      and the Type-66 fire 155- and 152-mm. versions of the Russian      Krasnopol laser-guided shell.       Self-propelled tubed artillery includes the PLL02, which      places the Type-86 100-mm. gun on a WZ-551 APC. In 2009, the      PLA revealed the new Type-07 122-mm. tracked artillery      system, which features hull and electronic improvements over      the previous Type-89 Tracked 122-mm. system. In 2009,      photographs appeared on the Internet of the SH-3, a truck-     mounted 122-mm. artillery system with digital control systems      in a hatch over the cab.       Heavy self-propelled systems include the 155-mm. PLZ-05,      which has a version of the PLL01 gun, and appeared in 2005.      It is replacing the 152-mm. Type-83, which entered service in      1983. The PLZ-05 also fires the Krasnopol laser-guided      projectile and a rocket-assisted round 50 km., and is capable      of flat-trajectory antitank fire. Unconfirmed reports state      the PLZ-05 has an automatic gun-loading system and weighs 35      tons.       PLA investments in rocket artillery are impressive. A five-     wheel all-terrain vehicle has been modified to carry a 107-     mm. MRL for experimental mechanized special forces units. The      tracked Type-89 and more recent Type-90 truck-mounted 122-mm.      MRL feature self-contained 40-round rocket reloaders. In      addition, the Smerch-derived 12-round PHL-03, which      reportedly fires a 150-km.-range missile, is entering      increasing numbers of artillery units. The latest AR1A export      variant features a modular U.S. MLR system-style 5-round      rocket carrier, which speeds reloading. In 2009, Norinco      revealed an as yet unidentified truck carrier for this 5-     round rocket box, similar to Lockheed Martin's High-Mobility      Artillery Rocket System.       The PLA is also investing in larger MRL systems. The 400-     mm. WS-2D reportedly has a range of 400 km., and one payload      features three ``killer unmanned aerial vehicles,'' according      to a Chinese report. An earlier 200-km.-range version, the      WS-3, uses navigation satellite guidance to achieve a      remarkable 50-meter (164-ft.) circular error probable. The WS      family complements the 150-km.-range P-12 and 250-km. B-611M      maneuverable navsat-guided short-range ballistic missiles      (SRBMs), which could supplement or replace the PLA's two      brigades of 300-600-km. DF-11A SRBMs.       New artillery systems are entering amphibious and airborne      units for possible missions abroad. PLA marine and army      amphibious units are receiving the Type-07B tracked 122-mm.      amphibious artillery system, which places the gun from the      Type-07 on a larger hull. Airborne units are equipped with a      version of the Type-96 122-mm. gun, but a new tracked      airmobile APC may feature a mortar or gun system. The ZBD-09      122-mm. gun system could eventually feature in airmobile army      units. Future artillery systems may feature electromagnetic      launch, an area of extensive research. The PLA is also      interested in ramjet-powered and stealth-coated artillery      shells.                          ____________________
