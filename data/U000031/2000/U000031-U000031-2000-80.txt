Speaker, I rise today to mark the end of an era in the government of my home state of Michigan. With the retirement of Judge Roman S. Gribbs, the people of Michigan are losing more that just a Judge, they are losing a man who has dedicated his life to serving the people. His dedication and work over the years for the people of Michigan has been truly admirable and aspiring to many.  With over 45 years of service to his community, Judge Gribbs has left his mark on a countless number of lives. This loving husband and father of five children, began his career as professor at the University of Detroit in 1954. His distinguished career included many different positions within the legal profession. His jobs ranged from Assistant Prosecutor to Sheriff of Wayne County by 1969. He was elected Mayor of the city of Detroit serving from 1970-1974, during which he was elected as the President of the National League of Cities.  In the 25 years since he left the Mayor's office, Judge Gribbs has dutifully served the citizens of Michigan, first on the Third Judicial Court and then on the Court of Appeals. His service throughout his life is a testament to the man that he is, a compassionate, committed worker for the people. Such a public servant is one that the people should treasure and feel fortunate to have in our democracy.  The state of Michigan and our country have been beneficiaries of the generous and outstanding service provided by Judge Roman S. Gribbs. It is my great pleasure to honor him today, and to wish him a happy, healthy and productive retirement.                          ____________________
