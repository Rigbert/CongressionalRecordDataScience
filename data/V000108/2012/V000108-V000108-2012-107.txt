 I would point out one of the fallacies of the gentleman's argument that heused on the floor in his language of the committee's report, that being our very serious concern that in the past we have applied moneys to research that has essentially been siphoned off overseas.  During general debate yesterday on this floor, in my opening remarks, I commended the members of the subcommittee and particularly Chairman Frelinghuysen for making sure we don't do that in this bill this year, and that there is throughout this bill and that report language directives to the Department of Energy to be focused on using this money wisely so that we maintain and begin to grow our industrial base and our manufacturing base and keep these jobs here.  This would be a mistake, and I am opposed to the gentleman's amendment.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it.
