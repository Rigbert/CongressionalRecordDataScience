If a doctor called you and said: Attorney Santorum, there has to be a second opinion here on whether this mother's pregnancy should be terminated postviability, late term, what do you suggest?  I think the first thing you would ask is: What is the penalty if you are mistaken?  Oh, I could lose my license, face a penalty of $100,000 or $250,000.  I think Attorney Santorum and Attorney Durbin would say to this doctor: Wait a minute. Let me sit down and talk to you. Are you prepared to stand behind the fact that this is a viable fetus? Are you prepared to stand behind the fact that there is a threat to life here? Because if you are not, stay away from us.
