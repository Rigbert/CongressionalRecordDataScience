 Grassley, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Cornyn, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Markey, Mrs. Shaheen, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Brown, Mr. Toomey, and Mr. Rubio) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:                               S. Res. 36       Whereas the United States abolished the transatlantic slave      trade in 1808 and abolished chattel slavery and prohibited      involuntary servitude in 1865;       Whereas, because the people of the United States remain      committed to protecting individual freedom, there is a      national imperative to eliminate human trafficking and modern      slavery, which is commonly considered to mean--       (1) the recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision,      or obtaining of an individual through the use of force,      fraud, or coercion for the purpose of subjecting that      individual to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage,      or slavery; or       (2) the inducement of a commercial sex act by force, fraud,      or coercion, or in which the individual induced to perform      that act is younger than 18 years of age;       Whereas the Department of Justice has reported that human      trafficking and modern slavery has been reported and      investigated in each of the 50 States and the District of      Columbia;       Whereas, since 2007, the National Human Trafficking Hotline      has identified more than 45,000 cases of human trafficking;       Whereas victims of human trafficking are difficult to      identify and are subject to manipulation, force, fraud,      coercion, and abuse;       Whereas, to help businesses in the United States combat      child labor and forced labor in global supply chains, the      Department of Labor has identified 148 goods from 76      countries that are made by child labor and forced labor;       Whereas the Department of State has reported that the top 3      countries of origin of federally identified trafficking      victims in fiscal year 2017 were the United States, Mexico,      and Honduras;       Whereas forced labor and human trafficking generates      revenues of approximately $150,000,000,000 annually worldwide      and there are an estimated 40,000,000 victims of human      trafficking across the globe;       Whereas, to combat human trafficking and modern slavery in      the United States and globally, the people of the United      States, the Federal Government, and State and local      governments must be--       (1) aware of the realities of human trafficking and modern      slavery; and       (2) dedicated to stopping the horrific enterprise of human      trafficking and modern slavery;       Whereas the United States should hold accountable all      individuals, groups, organizations, and countries that      support, advance, or commit acts of human trafficking and      modern slavery;       Whereas, through education, the United States must also      work to end human trafficking and modern slavery in all forms      in the United States and around the world;       Whereas victims of human trafficking deserve a trauma-     informed approach that integrates the pursuit of justice and      provision of social services designed to help them escape,      and recover from, the physical, mental, emotional, and      spiritual trauma they endured;       Whereas combating human trafficking requires a whole-of-     government effort that rests on a unified and coordinated      response among Federal, State, and local agencies and that      places equal value on the identification and stabilization of      victims, as well as the investigation and prosecution of      traffickers;       Whereas laws to prosecute perpetrators of human trafficking      and to assist and protect victims of human trafficking and      modern slavery have been enacted in the United States,      including--       (1) the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (22      U.S.C. 7101 et seq.);       (2) title XII of the Violence Against Women Reauthorization      Act of 2013 (Public Law 113-4; 127 Stat. 136);       (3) the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015      (Public Law 114-22; 129 Stat. 227);       (4) sections 910 and 914(e) of the Trade Facilitation and      Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 (Public Law 114-125);       (5) section 1298 of the National Defense Authorization Act      for Fiscal Year 2017 (22 U.S.C. 7114);       (6) the Abolish Human Trafficking Act of 2017 (Public Law      115-392);       (7) the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2017 (Public      Law 115-393);       (8) the Frederick Douglass Trafficking Victims Prevention      and Protection Reauthorization Act of 2018 (Public Law 115-     425); and       (9) the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act      of 2017 (Public Law 115-427);       Whereas the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015      (Public Law 114-22; 129 Stat. 227) established the United      States Advisory Council on Human Trafficking to provide a      formal platform for survivors of human trafficking to advise      and make recommendations on Federal anti-trafficking policies      to the Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat      Trafficking established by the President;       Whereas the Department of Defense, the General Services      Administration, and the National Aeronautics and Space      Administration issued a final rule (80 Fed. Reg. 4967) to      implement Executive Order 13627, entitled ``Strengthening      Protections Against Trafficking in Persons in Federal      Contracts'', that clarifies the policy of the United States      on combating trafficking in persons as outlined in the      Federal Acquisition Regulation by strengthening the      prohibition on contractors from charging employee recruitment      fees;       Whereas, although such laws and regulations are currently      in force, it is essential to increase public awareness,      particularly among individuals who are most likely to come      into contact with victims of human trafficking and modern      slavery, regarding conditions and dynamics of human      trafficking and modern slavery precisely because traffickers      use techniques that are designed to severely limit self-     reporting and evade law enforcement;       Whereas January 1 is the anniversary of the effective date      of the Emancipation Proclamation;       Whereas February 1 is--       (1) the anniversary of the date on which President Abraham      Lincoln signed the joint resolution sending the 13th      Amendment to the Constitution of the United States to the      States for ratification to forever declare, ``Neither slavery      nor involuntary servitude . . . shall exist within the United      States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction''; and       (2) a date that has long been celebrated as National      Freedom Day, as described in section 124 of title 36, United      States Code; and       Whereas, under the authority of Congress to enforce the      13th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States ``by      appropriate legislation'', Congress, through the Trafficking      Victims Protection Act of 2000 (22 U.S.C. 7101 et seq.),      updated the post-Civil War involuntary servitude and slavery      statutes and adopted an approach of victim protection,      vigorous prosecution, and prevention of human trafficking,      commonly known as the ``3P'' approach: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That the Senate supports--       (1) observing National Trafficking and Modern Slavery      Prevention Month during the period beginning on January 1,      2019, and ending on February 1, 2019, to recognize the vital      role that the people of the United States have in ending      human trafficking and modern slavery;       (2) marking the observation of National Trafficking and      Modern Slavery Prevention Month with appropriate programs and      activities, culminating in the observance on February 1,      2019, of National Freedom Day, as described in section 124 of      title 36, United States Code;       (3) urging continued partnerships with Federal, State, and      local agencies, as well as social service providers and      nonprofit organizations to address human trafficking with a      collaborative, victim-centered approach; and       (4) all other efforts to prevent, eradicate, and raise      awareness of, and opposition to, human trafficking and modern      slavery.
