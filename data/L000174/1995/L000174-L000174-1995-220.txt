President, I concur with what the distinguished chairman has said. I think this is extremely important. I have met a number of times with Jordanian officials, and a number of times with King Hussein regarding this and other issues involving Jordan.  Jordan is in a critical, pivotal position. I remember last year--actually, about 11 months ago now--when I had the privilege of accompanying the President of the United States to the signing ceremony of the peace agreement between Jordan and Israel, signed out in the desert in Al Aqabah, in 110-degree weather. I remember the day as though it was yesterday. There was a stiff desert wind blowing. People from Israel and Jordan and from the United States were there to witness the signing of this historic peace agreement. There was a very moving speech by Prime Minister Rabin and by King Hussein. The President of the United States was speaking for all Americans about our pride in this historic agreement.  Every commitment that King Hussein has made, he has kept. Every step he has said he would take, he has taken--many with great courage and great foresight.  This is not an easy time in the Middle East. Prime Minister Rabin, who justly deserves his Nobel Peace Prize, has pushed so hard to keep a peace agreement going in the face of political opposition and terrorist attacks. He and Foreign Minister Peres have worked so hard on this. There is really a handful of people in the Middle East who are trying to bring about peace--not so much for their generation, because their generation will soon reach a time when it fades from the scene, but for the generation of children, Arab and Jew alike. They are facing a potential for peace which their parents did not have, but a potential they now have. This is an area where we can help. The United States has strong and real security interests in that part of the world. We should help.  So I strongly support the administration's position. I think the President and Secretary of State are right.                         Privilege of the Floor
