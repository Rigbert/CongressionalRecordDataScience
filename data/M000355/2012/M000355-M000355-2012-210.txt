 1 public high school in the United States by Newsweek Magazine. Think about that, Madam President--out of more than 20,000 public high schools in the Nation, the top-ranked one is in Kentucky.  The Gatton Academy is in Bowling Green, KY, specifically, and it is a special place. First opened in 2007 and funded by the Kentucky General Assembly, the Gatton Academy is the Commonwealth's only State-supported residential high school with an emphasis on math and science. Bright, highly motivated students come from across the State and stay on campus, taking college-level courses at Western Kentucky University.  Dr. Julia Roberts, a good friend of mine and the executive director of the academy, worked hard for many years to see the school become a reality. How wonderful for her that her vision has been realized. This honor is a recognition that she truly deserves for her steadfast commitment to help Kentucky's finest students blossom and reach their full potential.  Here is a quote from Dr. Roberts that summarizes the school's mission:       The United States has emphasized proficiency or grade-level      learning to the exclusion of nurturing the talents of      advanced learners. A promising future for our country is      closely tied to the development of talent in science,      mathematics, languages arts, the social sciences, and the      arts. The purpose of the Gatton Academy is to extend learning      opportunities for gifted students who live in all parts of      Kentucky.  I also must recognize Dr. Tim Gott, director of the Gatton Academy, without whose hard work the school surely would not have been able to rise to the top. In fact, the Gatton Academy tops Newsweek's list of public high schools this year after ranking fifth in 2011. That is quite a jump up in 1 year, thanks in part no doubt to the indefatigable work of Dr. Gott.  ``It's just wonderful to be able to celebrate Kentucky students,'' Dr. Gott says. He also adds, ``This recognition would not have been possible without the full partnership we have with Western Kentucky University.''  The Newsweek rankings that put Gatton Academy on top were based on measurements such as graduation rates, college enrollment, average ACT and SAT scores, and advanced placement tests per student, as well as scores. This year, the school's average ACT score was 31.2 out of a possible 36, and its average SAT score was 2,010 out of a possible 2,400. In addition, over half of the school's students studied abroad last year, and 91 percent of recent graduates participated in a research project sponsored by a university mentor.  Mr. President, I would like to ask at this time that my colleagues in the Senate join me in recognizing the Carol Martin Gatton Academy of Mathematics and Science in Kentucky and its great contribution to the success of Kentucky and the Nation. The students at Gatton are the future leaders and success stories of America.  I ask unanimous consent that the Newsweek article naming the Carol Martin Gatton Academy of Mathematics and Science in Kentucky as the top-ranked public school in the Nation be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                     [From Newsweek, May 20, 2012]  Kentucky Academy Tops the Chart: Newsweek Ranks Kentucky Academy as                        America's Top High SchoolWhat does it take to be the best public high school in America? Daniel             Stone reports from the top-seeded Gatton Academy                           (By Daniel Stone)       To call the Gatton Academy of Mathematics and Science a      high school, you'd have to suspend an element of reality.      You'll find no football games, pep rallies, or dismissal      bells on the Kentucky campus. Instead you'd find couches      designed for study halls and white boards scribbled with      advanced math. Last week, one student even walked around      campus in a T-shirt proclaiming, ``Extreme science: What a      rush.''       Welcome to Gatton. Or as administrators affectionately call      it, the crucible--a place with admittedly high pressure, but      where every student succeeds. The school has another title,      too: America's best public high school, according to      Newsweek's 2012 ranking of the top 1,000. On every metric      used--test scores and graduation and college matriculation      rates--Gatton sets the nation's curve.       The school, about 100 miles south of Louisville in verdant      Bowling Green, Kentucky, is a public school with selective      admission based only on past academic performance--a key      quality that separates Gatton from other public schools,      which are mostly mandated to seek economic and racial      diversity.       Once students are in, they're given broad autonomy to      pursue subjects that interest them: They befriend their      instructors and conduct scientific research. During semester      breaks, the school helps students study abroad. Last winter,      the offerings were Western Europe and Costa Rica.       It is, you might note, a bit like college.       That's precisely the idea. Back in 2007, generous funding      from the Kentucky statehouse brought Gatton to life. The      facility, a five-story building about the size of one      football field, was built for 126 lucky and ambitious minds.      Students live on campus in dorms and eat with their friends      in dining halls. They see their parents only once a month.      Most of their classes are college level, literally, which      they take on the adjacent campus of Western Kentucky      University. ``We see ourselves as an atypical high school.      We're trying to break the mold of what high school could      be,'' says Tim Gott, who directs the school's academic      programs.       Gatton was designed under the Early College Model, a      concept devised by researchers at the University of North      Texas (UNT) in the 1970s. They wanted to end traditional high      school after tenth grade to push students into a college      environment sooner. ``The idea was to zip them through the      educational process,'' says Richard Sinclair, one of the      early researchers of the model. Sinclair now runs the Texas      Academy of Math and Science, a school similar to Gatton,      albeit twice its size, that's located on the UNT campus.      About seven schools exist under the model, most of them in      the South. Despite the high cost--Gatton's yearly budget for      126 pupils is $2.6 million--state legislatures tend to like      the idea because it gets hungry minds out of school faster,      turning them into taxpayers and industry leaders.       To understand just how different Gatton is, try to name      another high school that has a living room. Or students who      have pet names for their math classes (multi, diffie). Some      high-schoolers pin posters with the latest movie or      heartthrob; in one break room at the end of Gatton's dorm      hall is a floor-to-ceiling crossword puzzle--the one from      SkyMall magazine--that's about half full. When Newsweek      visited last week, senior Jordan Currie picked up the clue      list. ``370 across is kingdom!'' she shouted. ``Someone fill      it in!''       Ambition, in other words, is a sort of currency, and the      only one that really matters. In the five years since the      school opened, some of its students have already completed      law school, begun dentistry and pharmacy programs, and      started doctoral degrees. (The school's everybody-knows-your-     name mentality has already produced seven marriages.)       Of seven students who agreed to be interviewed, all said      they wouldn't stop studying until they had their Ph.D.s. Some      are already on their way. Andrea Eastes, who graduated this      year, spent her senior year studying DNA, specifically in      pursuit of a cure for tuberculosis. ``Everything you need to      take tissue cultures is in here,'' she says matter-of-factly,      just a few steps away from a canister of liquid nitrogen.       Gatton has its share of the usual adolescent issues, too.      Some students stress over their studies, others over friends      and romance. The school employs a full-time school      psychologist to work through these issues, and occasionally      more serious ones too, like broken families or eating      disorders. ``Every student comes to me for something,'' says      Christopher Bowen, Gatton's Converse-wearing psych counselor.      ``It's almost like, if you're not coming to see me, then we      think something's wrong.''       Gatton has received nods from high places. Kentucky Sen.      Mitch McConnell, the Senate's minority leader, stopped by      once to marvel; when he got back to Washington, he submitted      a statement into the Congressional Record exalting the      school.       But Gatton's administrators admit it's not a model for      every school. You need to have students who really want to      excel before you     can turn them into Steve Jobses. Unlike Gatton, most schools      have stragglers.       The key, says Gott, the school's director and a longtime      public-school teacher, is to add relevance to education.      Maybe every student can't study advanced engineering, but      there's something--from music to metalworking--that interests      every young person and answers the ``when will I ever use      this?'' question.       What's more, infusing more glory into education couldn't      hurt. ``Everywhere in this country we celebrate basketball      and football talent,'' says Julia Roberts, the school's      executive director, who petitioned the Kentucky statehouse      for 10 years to invest in Gatton. ``The talent we really need      to celebrate is math and science.''                          ____________________
