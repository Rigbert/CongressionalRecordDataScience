Speaker, I rise today to recognize an outstanding artist, William Krawczewicz, whose design was recently selected to appear on the back of the Maryland quarter, to be issued in March of 2000.  The U.S Mint will issue fifty different designs of the official quarter for the fifty different states, each quarter depicting features of its state. Mr. Krawczewicz's winning design features the state Capitol building in Annapolis, Maryland, the only statehouse that also once served as the Nation's Capitol. The design was chosen from among the approximately 280 designs depicting different aspects of Maryland.  This is not the first time Mr. Krawczewicz's artwork has been recognized. Over the years, he has won a number of awards and one of his designs was selected for a 1994 Olympic coin commemorative set. When he is not producing coin designs, Mr. Krawczewicz works as a graphic designer for the White House.  I would like to congratulate Mr. Krawczewicz for his artistry and for his contribution to the commemoration of the state of Maryland.                          ____________________
