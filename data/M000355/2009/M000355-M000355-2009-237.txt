 President, I say to my friend from Tennessee, he is absolutely correct. There are two obvious violations of the first amendment here. One is the right to speak freely and the other is the right to petition Congress for a redress of grievances.  Here you have an industry, the health insurance industry, at least one company of which is communicating with its customers the truth about this legislation and being threatened by a powerful Senator and a government agency to shut up.
