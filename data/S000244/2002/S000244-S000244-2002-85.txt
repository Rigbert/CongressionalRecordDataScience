Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, we would not be here today talking about Chapter 12 or the whole issue of bankruptcy reform had not former President Clinton pocket-vetoed the bankruptcy reform bill introduced by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Gekas) in the last Congress, which passed both Houses, and then President Clinton decided that he would let the 10 days go by after the adjournment of Congress, and the bill did not become law because of a pocket veto. Because of that pocket veto, we have been struggling with bankruptcy reform again during this Congress.  Now, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Gekas) has been a leader since 1998 in bankruptcy reform. He introduced the first bill to make Chapter 12 permanent. He introduced a bill in the last Congress to make Chapter 12 permanent. He has been the principal author of the bill in this Congress to make Chapter 12 permanent.  Now, maybe my other friend, the gentleman from Pennsylvania, maybe his farmers are a little different from Wisconsin farmers. Wisconsin farmers do not want to go bankrupt. Chapter 12 is not a very commonly used provision in the bankruptcy law, but it is a necessary provision in the bankruptcy law.  I appreciate the recent interest of the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Holden) in this issue. Unlike the other the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Gekas), he has not introduced a single bill on Chapter 12. He has cosponsored one, but that was just very recently.  So I hope that we can have a groundswell of support, and I welcome him aboard.
