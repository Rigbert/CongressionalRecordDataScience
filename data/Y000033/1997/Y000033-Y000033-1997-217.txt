Mr. Chairman, I just want to refute what the ranking member said. We did not repeal the Endangered Species Act, nor did we attempt to. We tried to rewrite it without any help from the minority at all, and this administration has been asked many times, and they sit on their fat never mind. No, I am not yielding any time. The gentleman said we repealed; we did not. We tried to do what is right.
