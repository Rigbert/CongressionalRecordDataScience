President, I very much appreciate the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts coming to the floor because he has done so much to help the consumer in this area. My concern--and I would be interested in the Senator's reaction--is I think the consumer is about to get hit by a perfect storm with the combination of failure to push OPEC, as the Senator has said, to try to help on the production issue, plus the refinery cutbacks that apparently are primarily to boost profits, plus filling the strategic petroleum reserve. With these factors coming together, it seems to me a perfect storm is going to push the consumers' gasoline price at the pump to $3 a gallon.  I would be interested in the Senator's reaction, and I am anxious to work with him in this effort to push the administration to go after OPEC.
