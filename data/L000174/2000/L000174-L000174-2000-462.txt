President, today I am pleased to recognize two outstanding Vermont journalists, both affiliated with my alma mater, St. Michael's College, and both recently elected to the New England Press Association Hall of Fame. This prestigious honor recognizes lifetime achievements in journalism. I am well acquainted with the work of both, and know that this recognition is well deserved.  The late John D. Donoghue was the first Public Relations/Sports Information Director at St. Michael's, the first chairman of the Journalism Department there, was a music and arts critic for 35 years at the Burlington Free Press, and Executive Editor of the Vermont Catholic Tribune. During histenure as professor and journalist, John Donoghue worked through his association with the New England Press Association and Vermont Press Association to improve professionalism within the industry, and fought for the public's right to know. He was a trailblazer among journalists from my home state, and his legacy continues in Vermont, across the United States, and in the foreign press, through his students who have successfully pursued journalism careers.  Michael Donoghue has served Vermonters for three decades as a journalist at the Burlington Free Press, and in the tradition of his father, teaches journalism at St. Michael's College. During Mike's tenure at the Free Press, he has been at the center of efforts to improve reporters' access to information, thus increasing Vermonters' access to their government. Mike helped lead the effort to allow cameras into Vermont courts, was a leader in efforts to improve the Vermont Public Records Law, has successfully fought to keep court records open, and recently was one of four Americans invited to Ireland to make presentations on Freedom of Information after that country adopted such a law. He is a past President of the Vermont Press Association, and active in several national journalism organizations. At the Burlington Free Press, he has proven to be among Vermont's most versatile reporters, covering everything from sports to politics to the court beat with expertise.  In honor of this outstanding father and son duo, I ask that the article Dedication Runs in the Family for Donoghues, from the Saturday, February 12, issue of the New England Press Association Daily News, be printed in the Record.               [From the NEPA Daily News, Feb. 12, 2000]              Dedication Runs in the Family for Donoghues                          (By Jaclyn Tammaro)       They have always said ``like father like son,'' and NEPA      board member Mike Donoghue and his late father, John D.      Donoghue, are a perfect example.       Both were honored by NEPA last night for their strong      commitment and contributions to community journalism.       Mike Donoghue, who lives in Vermont, has written for the      Burlington Free Press for 30 years, covering a variety of      news. Recently, he began specializing in sports reporting.       In what Donoghue calls his ``spare time,'' he teaches      journalism classes at St. Michael's College in Vermont. In 10      of the 15 years he has taught there, he has been a co-adviser      to the award-winning student newspaper, The Defender.       Aside from his work with NEPA, the Burlington Free Press      and St. Michael's College, Donoghue has also served as an      officer of the Vermont Press Association for 20 years, mainly      pressing the issue of camera use in Vermont's courtrooms.       The last 13 years, he has taken the position of volunteer      executive director. In this seat, he ran meetings and dealt      with newspaper comments.       ``I've tried to improve professionalism in Vermont and move      it to the rest of New England'' Donoghue said.       On a national level, Donoghue is state chairman of Project      Sunshine, a society for professional journalists. As      chairman, he has testified for the release of public records      and has tried to improve various laws.       His job as journalism educator at St. Michael's College has      allowed him to become a member of the Journalism Education      Committee.       A member of NEPA since 1996, Donoghue has served as      chairman of the Publications Committee, and has chaired the      legislative and membership services committees.       ``NEPA is a vital organization,'' he said. ``Approximately      1,500 people come to Boston each winter to hear topnotch      speakers and to see the best work in six neighboring states      being honored. The convention is a tribute to the      organization and a highlight of New England journalism each      year.''       Donoghue said he is strongly motivated by his wife, Ann      Marie. ``If it wasn't for her, I wouldn't be doing this,'' he      said.       Donoghue shared some memories about the contributions of      his father, John D. Donoghue. A former NEPA board member,      John Donoghue was an arts and entertainment critic for the      Burlington Free Press for 35 years. He also worked as an      editor for the Vermont Catholic Tribune for four years,      before retiring.       Involved in journalism education like his son, John      Donoghue served as the first chairman of journalism at St.      Michael's College.       Both father and son have shown a strong dedication to the      field of journalism and their contributions have been      recognized by NEPA's Hall of Fame.                          ____________________
