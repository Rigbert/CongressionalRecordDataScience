 President, today the Senate is continuing to consider S. 1, a bill to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline, and there are six amendments pending, three from each side. We will begin voting on those amendments as soon as Chairman Murkowski and Senator Cantwell work out an orderly schedule. Senators should expect votes throughout the day in relation to these amendments and any others in the queue.                          ____________________
