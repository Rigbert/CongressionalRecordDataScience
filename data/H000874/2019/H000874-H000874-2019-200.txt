Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Scalise) for yielding.  We can discuss all sorts of bills, but we discussed the appropriations process. And the gentleman expressed how they were able to pass 70 percent of funding of the government because they had the Defense bill and the Labor-Health, which are the two biggest bills, passed and signed by the President.  Why were they able to do that, Mr. Speaker, when it requires 60 votes in the Senate? They didn't have 60 votes in the Senate because Democrats acted in a bipartisan way to affect that end.  This year, we have had no opportunity to do that. We have had no opportunity to conference on our bills. Republicans lead the Senate, passed your bills, and if you can't get 60 votes, yes, you would have to compromise in the Senate.  You didn't compromise when you were in charge, frankly, on an awful lot of things that had closed rules, more than any other Congress, so we didn't have an opportunity to even amend.  But that aside, when you claim that you passed those bills you did, and the only reason you could do it is because the Democrats acted in a bipartisan fashion because you did not have the votes to pass them on your own, you needed Democratic votes. Democrats gave you those votes because we knew that in order to get things done you had to move in a bipartisan fashion.  That is the only way you were able to do it. We have not been given the opportunity in the United States Senate because there are no bills yet to consider, except for the last 3 days the bills came forward.  But for the first 9 months of the year, no bills came forward, Mr. Speaker, not one.
