  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, Congress would have adjourned one week ago after only 108 days work without an additional penny for public education, but the President held the Republican majority's feet to the fire, and so now, a week later, we have got $1.2 billion, new money for smaller class size; $871 million has been replaced for the Summer Jobs for Youth Program that they wanted to kill; $250 million for Youth Opportunities, and $160 million add-on to Head Start. This is a victory for Democratic priorities.  But unfortunately this gargantuan 4000-page budget bill further reflects the difference in the budget priorities of the Republicans and the Democrats. The Republicans in this are going to add $9.1 billion to an already bloated Pentagon budget, another $1 billion into the Star Wars fantasy where we have already dumped 50 billion with no results. Not a penny, not a penny here on earth, to help rebuild or build new schools, but another billion dollars for the Star Wars fantasy. That is a sad commentary on their priorities.                          ____________________
