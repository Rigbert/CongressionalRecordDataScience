 President, I thank my friend from Minnesota for his question.  I now turn to the Senator from Washington and ask him if he noted on the web site the suggestion about $1.3 million for the World Trade Organization's ministerial meeting in Seattle, WA, the Senator's State, and an exemption for the Crown Jewel mine in Washington State to deposit mining waste on additional land adjacent to the mine. Listed on the web site of Senator McCain are examples of ``pork barrel spending is a direct result of unlimited contributions from special interests.''
