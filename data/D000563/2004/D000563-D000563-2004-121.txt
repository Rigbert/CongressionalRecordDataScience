President, the second noteworthy event this week was, of course, the acknowledgement that we have lost over 1,000 soldiers in Iraq. It has touched my State of Illinois. Some 50 people from my State have been killed in the war in Iraq, hundreds seriously wounded.  I ask unanimous consent that an article from the Chicago Tribune dated September 9, 2004, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Chicago Tribune, Sept. 9, 2004]    Downstate Town Stung by Deaths; 2 Soldiers Dead, 15 Hurt in Iraq                (By Deborah Horan and H. Gregory Meyer)       Paris, IL.--The worst attack yet on Illinois Army National      Guardsmen serving in Iraq left two soldiers dead and 15      wounded, and it left the Downstate town where their unit is      based stung by the news and fearful for the safety of      survivors.       Mortar rounds pounded the 1544th Transportation Company      southwest of Baghdad late Sunday afternoon, killing Sgt.      Shawna Morrison, 26, of Paris and Spec. Charles Lamb, 23, of      Martinsville, said Lt. Col. Alicia Tate-Nadeau, a Guard      spokeswoman. Three of the 15 wounded were seriously injured,      she said.       In Paris a radio station has put patriotic songs on heavy      rotation while locals drive cars tied with yellow ribbons      saying ``Pray for our troops.'' Morrison was the unit's first      female fatality, and the first soldier from Paris to die in      Iraq.       ``This is the first one to hit our community,'' said Jim      Cooper, the father of a 20-year-old guardsman who is      stationed at the base that came under attack. ``It has really      brought this home. It opens up a lot of people's eyes. They      say, `Hey, I know so-and-so. He may be next.' ''       The deaths brought the unit's total fatalities to four as      the nation's total military deaths in Iraq since last year's      invasion edged past 1,000.       The 1544th, headquartered in a brick armory in this town of      9,000, contains about 260 soldiers from four states, Tate-     Nadeau said.       Shirley Furry had posted a message under the price board      outside her Citgo station in Paris reading ``In memory of      Shawna.'' The young woman worked there several years ago,      Furry said. Morrison's mother called Furry Sunday night.       ``I said, `Oh, no,' '' Furry recalled. ``She said, `Yeah,      she's gone.' ''       Morrison attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-     Champaign and worked two jobs, one as a waitress and the      other as a bartender, to put herself through school.       ``She's always been very independent,'' said her father,      Rick Morrison. ``She never asked us for a dime from day one      when she moved out.''       Morrison was called up in November, sent to Kuwait in      December and arrived in Iraq by February where she worked in      communications, her father said. And while she was nervous      before the deployment, she was most worried about rumors of      spiders the size of paper plates that could jump 6 feet.       ``We spent many hours looking for spider spray,'' her      father said. ``And she never saw one.''       Sgt. Scott Johnson, a member of the 1544th who was wounded      in Iraq in May, said Morrison and Lamb had contrasting      notions of comfort on base. ``Shawna, she was really looking      to settle in. She rounded up a couple of the nicer mattresses      to make sure she slept well at night,'' he said. ``Charles,      he would rough it. He was kind of an outdoorsman. He didn't      mind getting dirty.''       Lamb, who grew up in a rural area near Martinsville, about      25 miles southwest of Paris, was a ``farm boy,'' said Mark      Harris, his agriculture education teacher at Casey-Westfield      High School, where he graduated in 1999.       A live wire as a student, Lamb was active in the FFA,      formerly known as Future Farmers of America, and trained for      forestry, livestock and dairy competitions. A trip to Kansas      City for an FFA convention was a big deal to him.       ``I think one of the reasons he signed up for the service      was to help other people out, make a better life and see the      country,'' Harris said.       Before he was called up for active duty, he had worked as a      mechanic in Martinsville and had recently married, said a      former employer.       ``He was planning on coming back,'' said a shop co-owner,      Shirley Goodwin. In Iraq he also worked as a mechanic.       Cooper leads a support group for families of soldiers from      the 1544th. He said that when attacks take place, he's the      one who calls families whose sons and daughters weren't hurt.       ``I can tell them they're OK, but I can't give them any      guarantees,'' he said. ``The unit is still running out there.      It makes it scary.''       His son is also based at Logistical Base Seitz, the camp      outside Baghdad where Morrison and Lamb were killed, but he      was uninjured in Sunday's mortar shelling.       ``Everybody's upset,'' he added. ``It is hard to walk into      a store without somebody recognizing me and saying, `How's      your son?'
