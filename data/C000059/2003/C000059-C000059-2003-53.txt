Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to the community of Riverside, California are exceptional. Riverside has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Ramon Alvarez is one of these individuals. On October 16, 2003 he will be honored at a dinner hosted by the Boy Scouts of America in the City of Riverside as he is named the 2003 Distinguished Citizen.  Ramon moved to Riverside in 1995 from San Diego and quickly involved himself in the community. Ramon established his business, Alvarez Lincoln Mercury and Alvarez Jaguar Dealership, in Riverside and in 1996 the dealership was named Hispanic Business of the Year and the Greater Riverside Chamber of Commerce Business of the Year. Ramon also involved himself in the University of California, Riverside Entrepreneurial Program--inspiring young men and women to follow their entrepreneurial dreams.  Despite the demands of a successful business, Ramon always finds time to give back. He is a Board Member of the Greater Riverside Chamber of Commerce and of the Riverside Community Hospital. He is an Advisory Board Member of YMCA and a member of the Raincross Club. He serves on the Board of Trustees for the University of California, Riverside and as a Board Member of the March of Dimes. He is past president of the Riverside Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, the Riverside Auto Center Association, and a past member of the Riverside Community College Foundation. In 1999, Ramon was named the Ernst & Young Outstanding Entrepreneur and in 2001 he was the Vice Chairman of the Advisory Committee of the Ford Lincoln Mercury Minority Dealers Association.  Ramon is the current Executive Director of the Boy Scouts of America of Riverside, California. His tireless passion for business and community service has contributed immensely to the betterment of the community of Riverside, California. I am proud to call Ramon a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for his service and salute him as he is named the Boy Scouts of America of Riverside, California 2003 Distinguished Citizen.                          ____________________
