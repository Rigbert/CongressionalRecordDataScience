 President: It is widely recognized that the Coast Guard is the nation's principal defense against illicit drug shipping and must become a barrier to terrorist attacks in which explosives or weapons of mass destruction may be headed for an American city on a ship or fast boat. I join with the distinguished Chair of the Defense Subcommittee, in commending the Senator from Alaska for his leadership role in establishing the HITRON mission in the United States Coast Guard.  The current fleet of eight MH-68A helicopters is stationed in Jacksonville, Florida and is active in the Caribbean. The fleet was temporarily deployed at the U.S. Coast Guard Station in San Diego for a demonstration. It was a complete success and as a result, Congressman Bob Filner recently wrote the Commandant urging that he extend the current lease of eight or more MH-68A helicopters until a permanent DeepWater replacement is selected.  Both Congressman Filner and I agree there is a critical requirement for off shore drug interdiction along the Mexican-Southern California coastline. Further, these helicopters can add anti-terrorist protection for the Port of San Diego. Therefore, based on the assumption the Coast Guard has the legal authority to enter this lease, I urge my colleagues to support extension of 5-year lease for eight MH-68 helicopters.
