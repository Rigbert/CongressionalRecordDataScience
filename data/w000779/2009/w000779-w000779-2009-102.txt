President, If there is one environmental issue that divides us more than unites us, it's water, especially in the West.  Farmers, ranchers, cities, towns, all compete for limited supplies. Salmon and other economically and culturally important fish depend on its flow. If it is not water quantity, then it is water quality that makes what gets passed on to the next water user the source of contention.  The Clean Water Act has been enormously successful at making water users clean up the water that they use before it is discharged back into lakes, rivers, and streams, and, before it's used by the next person downstream. It has also helped ensure the survival of fish and wildlife.  Over the past 8 years, the U.S. Supreme Court has rendered two major decisions that have restricted the scope of the Act. As it is now being interpreted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Corps of Engineers, the Act no longer prevents the discharge of pollution or fill into many wetlands or intermittent streams, lakes and ponds. By some estimates, more than half the streams in Oregon could be classified as intermittent streams and no longer protected. Another estimate concludes that over one million Oregonians get their drinking water from sources that would no longer be fully protected by the Clean Water Act. I think this is the wrong thing to do.  Last year, I cosponsored S. 1870--the Clean Water Restoration Act--legislation which was intended to return the protections of the Clean Water Act to the way they were before these two Supreme Court decisions occurred. No more, and no less.  In my town hall meetings around Oregon, I have received questions and complaints about this legislation. The biggest concern that many people had was that this new bill was actually going to expand the reach of the Federal Government over water regulation in ways that would literally threaten the ability of farmers to farm and ranchers to ranch. People were also concerned that this legislation would not only regulate discharges into rivers and streams, but it would also regulate the quantity of water they use.  I am no supporter of Federal water grabs. I would not have cosponsored this legislation in the last Congress if it would threaten Oregon farmers' ability to farm or our ranchers' ability to ranch. I would have opposed it.  Ranchers and farmers and forest owners know how to be stewards of the land they ranch and farm and manage because their livelihoods depend on it,and if they are not careful about how they manage that land there will be nothing to pass on to the next generation. The same is true for how we must treat our rivers, streams and wetlands.  So over the past few months, my staff and I have worked with Senator Feingold, the primary sponsor of the bill, to clarify that intent of this legislation is to simply restore the interpretation of the Clean Water Act to what it had been before these Supreme Court decisions. No more, and no less.  Earlier this year, in response to my concerns about how the bill would impact rural Oregon, Senator Feingold reiterated in a letter to me his intent that the Clean Water Restoration Act not expand the scope of the law. Sen. Feingold also revised the text of the bill in a way that I believe makes it even clearer that the goal is not to expand the scope of the Clean Water Act beyond what it was in 2001 before the Supreme Court decisions.  First of all, the bill again includes a savings clause that clearly continues the existing exemption for irrigation return flows from Clean Water Act regulation. It continues the exemption for dredged or fill materials from normal farming, silviculture and ranching activities. It continues the exemption for construction and maintenance of farm or stock ponds or irrigation ditches and drainage ditches. It continues the exemption for construction and maintenance of farm roads or forest roads.  Second, the bill now contains a much more detailed set of findings that make it absolutely clear that the intent of Congress with enactment of the bill is to restore the regulatory system for the Clean Water Act to what it was before these two Supreme Court decisions. These findings also make it clear that the bill is not regulating ground water, only surface water, just as the Clean Water Act has always done. The findings make it clear that exclusions for prior converted cropland and manmade impoundments remain in place. They make it clear that the intent is to regulate water quality, not quantity or ownership.  If more changes are needed to ensure that the bill does what Sen. Feingold and I say it does, than I am certainly open to making more changes to make sure the Senate gets this crucial issue right.  Some people do not like the pre-2001 Clean Water Act regulatory system. Some believe that the Supreme Court did the right thing by removing many wetlands and intermittent streams and lakes from the protections of the Clean Water Act. I disagree. I think those protections are needed to protect our water supplies and our environment and wildlife habitat. Farmers and ranchers need those protections for their livelihoods. But I want to be absolutely clear, that I will not support expanding Federal authority in this area beyond what it was before 2001.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be placed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                                  Washington, DC, January 8, 2009.     Hon. Ron Wyden,     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Wyden: Thank you for your commitment to      reinstating longstanding Clean Water Act protections, which      have been unquestionably reduced and blurred by recent      Supreme Court decisions. I appreciate you contacting me on      behalf of your constituents with some important questions      about the intent and effect of my bill, the Clean Water      Restoration Act.       Like you, I am committed to restoring the scope of the      Clean Water Act of 1972 and strongly oppose efforts to roll      back the Act--which is happening and will continue to happen      until Congress acts. A recent investigation by the House      Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and the      Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure found that the      2006 Rapanos case and subsequent agency guidance are directly      responsible for ``a drastic deterioration of [the      Environmental Protection Agency's] Clean Water Act      enforcement program . . . hundreds of violations have not      been pursued.'' The investigation revealed that top EPA      officials warned that ``the difficulty in interpreting and      applying the Rapanos decision and the Inter-Agency guidance      has created a drain on [EPA] resources, caused delays and      uncertainty in compliance determinations. . . .'' According      to the EPA, over 50 percent of U.S. streams, 20 million acres      of wetlands, and the drinking water for 110 million Americans      remain in jeopardy of being polluted or destroyed as a result      of the Supreme Court decisions.       Since Congress is the only branch of government that can      reinstate protections and prevent a significant roll-back of      the Act. I introduced the Clean Water Restoration Act to do      just that, and only that.       The bill will not increase permitting and does not change      the requirements for what activities need a permit. The Clean      Water Restoration Act would only modify one term in the Act      and does not alter any other sections of law, including those      identifying what activities need a permit. Nevertheless, when      the bill was reintroduced in the 110th Congress, we added a      savings clause to make it explicitly clear that the      exemptions for agriculture, ranching, and forestry are      maintained. The Act was amended in 1977 to add these      permitting exemptions and my bill will not change those      exemptions, or existing exemptions in the regulations that do      not require permits for agricultural activities affecting      prior converted cropland or for wastewater treatment systems.       As you know, the Clean Water Act protects ``navigable      waters,'' which the Act broadly defines as ``waters of the      United States, including the territorial seas'' (though often      a source of confusion, the term ``navigable waters'' has a      very different meaning in the Clean Water Act than it does in      the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, which extends only very      narrow protections to commercially navigable waters).      ``Navigable waters'' and ``waters of the United States'' are      broadly defined, for purposes of the Clean Water Act, in the      Environmental Protection Agency and U.S. Army Corps of      Engineers' regulations to cover all waters necessary to      achieve the Act's water quality purposes. This includes such      so-called isolated wetlands as prairie potholes and playa      lakes, which have been jeopardized since the 2001 SWAIVCC      case, as well as intermittent streams, which remain      jeopardized by the 2006 Rapanos case and subsequent agency      guidance. In order to meet the intent and purpose of the      Clean Water Act of 1972, we must ensure all these waters      continue to be protected--which is why the Clean Water      Restoration Act defines ``waters of the United States'' using      the same list of waters.       In your letter, you asked about an exchange at a hearing on      the bill in 2008 where the former Administrator of the EPA,      Carol Browner, responded to a question about whether a      ``puddle'' is a ``wetland.'' Though the question was likely      intended in jest, there is a longstanding, scientific process      for determining and delineating a wetland. Professional      determinations are made, for purposes of Section 404 of the      Clean Water Act, using the Corps regulatory definition of a      wetland. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs,      and similar areas (33 CFR 328.3(b)).       Lastly, the Clean Water Act does not regulate water      quantity, only water quality. Its purpose is to ``restore and      maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of      the nation's waters'' (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.). I am pleased      to lead the effort to protect the Clean Water Act in the      Senate, and to have your support, as well as that of a range      of interested parties, including former EPA Administrators      from both Republican and Democratic administrations;      governors; attorneys general; state agencies; professional      societies and associations; labor and business professionals      and unions; farming organizations; and over 400 hunting.      fishing, recreational, and conservation organizations.       Thanks for your efforts to educate others about the      importance of this legislation and the true purpose of the      Clean Water Restoration Act. As always. I am committed to      working with you and others to restore historical protections      to the waters of the United States.           Sincerely,                                              Russell D. Feingold.                                 ______                                       By
