President, I would like to take a moment to honor the memory of a longtime journalist and true friend, Norman Runnion, who passed away in a Vermont hospital last month at the age of 85. Norm was many things to many people, but as they say of those in the newspaper business, he had ink coursing through his veins. Norm was born into a news family and he loved to tell stories of his early days spent in newsrooms, watching his father work the trade. But when tragedy struck home--Norm's father was killed after falling under a train--the younger Runnion dedicated himself to the profession.  From his gritty beginnings working the night cop beat on Chicago's South Side, Norm worked his way up as a reporter and editor with United Press International, covering the biggest stories of the day, including the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Warren Commission report. By the mid-1960s, Norm made the wise decision to ply his skills in Vermont and settled in at the Brattleboro Reformer. He soon made his way to the managing editor post, where he earned deep respect from his community and his State over the next two decades. When newspapers lost a bit of luster for Norm, he turned to the seminary and became an Episcopal priest, further dedicating his life in public service.  In retelling the path of his colorful news career, Norm suggested that fate led to his successes. ``I was really incredibly lucky,'' he told a younger reporter who he once mentored. ``Everywhere I went was one after another of the biggest news stories of the world. Those were the most monumental news stories of my generation.''  I believe it was far more than luck that made Norm Runnion the talent that he was. It was devotion to a trade that he believed was worthy of that commitment. And his readers were incredibly lucky for that. I feel fortunate to have spoken with Norm shortly before his passing. Although weak, his spirit was still very much evident. In honor of that spirit, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a remembrance of Norm Runnion, which appeared on VTDigger.org.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                   [From VTDigger.org, June 22, 2014]            Vermont Journalist Norman Runnion Dies at Age 85                          (By Kevin O'Connor)       Ask Norman Runnion for his life story and he'd point to a      newspaper.       Take the old Kansas City Journal-Post, where he played as a      child while his father pounded on a manual typewriter.       Or the Evanston (Ill.) Review, where he broke into      journalism pasting up the sports page for $5 a week.       Or Vermont's Brattleboro Reformer and The Herald of      Randolph, where he capped a globetrotting career covering the      world for wire service desks in New York, London, Paris and      Washington, D.C.       ``I'm a newspaperman, my father was a newspaperman--I love      that word, I grew up on that word. It would never have      occurred to me to be anything else.''       ``I'm a newspaperman, my father was a newspaperman--I love      that word, I grew up on that word,'' he said in 1989. ``It      would never have occurred to me to be anything else.''       Except an Episcopal priest, which he tried for a decade at      midlife. But Runnion eventually returned to writing, which he      did until shortly before his death Friday at Randolph's      Gifford Medical Center at age 85.       When Newfane mystery novelist Archer Mayor wanted an      interesting character name for his 1993 book ``The Skeleton's      Knee,'' he borrowed Norm Runnion's. But fiction was no match      for the real man's feats.       The lifelong scribe made his own headlines as recently as      two years ago, when he wrote a widely circulated column      recalling his work as Washington night news editor for United      Press International when President John F. Kennedy was      assassinated Nov. 22, 1963.       ``For those of us who were around on that searing day in      American history, it could have been yesterday, not 50 years      ago,'' he recalled of an event for which UPI's coverage won a      Pulitzer Prize. ``I can hear today the haunting sounds of the      muffled drums as they passed below our windows, leading the      solemn procession past the thousands of people who jammed the      sidewalks to watch and mourn.''       Runnion went on to write the main story about the 888-page      Warren Commission report on the shooting.       ``The report was embargoed for a later release to give      journalists time to absorb the contents instead of rushing      out with the first available tidbits,'' he wrote. ``But the      stark principal finding was right there: Oswald, acting      alone, had murdered America's beloved president.''       Ask Runnion what sparked his interest in journalism and      he'd rewind back to his birth in Kansas City, Mo., in 1929.      His mother was a teacher; his father, like his grandfather,      was a newspaperman.       ``I grew up in a newsroom--quite literally,'' he told this      reporter in a 1989 interview.       For Runnion, home was wherever his father worked. At age      12, his family moved to St. Louis and the Star-Times; in      1941, it was Chicago and the Sun.       Life changed in 1945 when Runnion's father fell underneath      a commuter train and was killed. The next day, Runnion, then      a high school junior, enrolled in a journalism course.      Eventually receiving a degree from Northwestern University's      Medill School of Journalism in 1951, he worked ``four god-     awful months'' at the Chicago City News Bureau, servicing a      half-dozen metropolitan papers with crime reports.       ``I was covering the night police beat in the south side of      Chicago, which had the second highest crime rate in the world      outside of Singapore at that time,'' he recalled. ``Earned 25      bucks a week for approximately an 80-hour week.''       Runnion went on to join United Press International,      reporting and editing in New York starting in 1953, in London      in 1955 (where he covered Winston Churchill), in Paris in      1957 (where he covered Charles de Gaulle) and in Washington,      D.C., in 1960.       ``Came in on the tail end of the '60 elections, spent the      next three years covering Kennedy, the civil rights movement,      covered Martin Luther King's march on Washington, got      assigned to cover the space program, covered Alan Shepard's      flight, covered John Glenn's flight,'' he recalled.       Runnion was also the lead writer of UPI's coverage of the      Cuban missile crisis.       ``I was really incredibly lucky,'' he said. ``Everywhere I      went was one after another of the biggest news stories of the      world. Those were the most monumental news stories of my      generation. What the hell more do you want?''       In 1966, Runnion decided he needed a break. Moving to      Vermont, he joined the Reformer in 1969 and became its      managing editor in 1971. Working in Windham County for two      decades, he both reported and made state news.       In 1983, for example, Runnion was the only journalist      invited to the wedding of then Vermont House Speaker Stephan      Morse--a ceremony presided over by then Gov. Richard      Snelling--with explicit instructions not to write a word.       If the bride and groom didn't suspect Runnion had other      thoughts when he arrived     with a camera, they knew it when they picked up the Reformer      the next publication day and saw their nuptials splashed as      an exclusive atop the front page.       Runnion, deemed by one competitor ``chief curmudgeon of the      Vermont press corps,'' surprised readers in 1990 by leaving      the paper to attend Virginia Theological Seminary, work as a      seminarian assistant at the all-black St. Luke's Episcopal      Church in Washington, and serve as rector of St. Martin's      Episcopal Church in Fairlee.       Invited to address several New England press associations,      the new priest condemned the media for ``growing ineptness''      he blamed on a loss of ethics and ``corporate obsession with      the bottom line.''       ``I don't think the First Amendment is a protective      umbrella for the kind of sin journalism we are seeing in our      culture today,'' he said at one event. ``I don't think      picturing violence for the sake of money is what Thomas      Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton had in mind. The fact is,      the public has a right not to know a lot of the junk that is      being tossed their way in the name of the `right to know.' ''       Runnion would retire from the church in 2001 and return to      journalism by writing for the weekly Herald of Randolph, near      his Brookfield home. His column on the 50th anniversary of      Kennedy's assassination was reprinted by the statewide news      website VTDigger.org, spurring a flurry of public comment.       ``Hey, Norm: Oswald did not do it,'' one reader posted.       ``Good point--I agree,'' Runnion replied. ``It was ET and      the aliens.''       Runnion will be remembered July 8 at a public service in      Randolph to be led by Vermont Episcopal Bishop Thomas Ely,      with specifics to come from that town's Day Funeral Home.      (``He wrote a partial obituary and said, `You can fill in the      blanks,' '' his wife Linda said Monday.) He'll also live on      through nearly seven decades of his published work.       ``I personally witnessed much of this history and believe      what I saw over what people who were not there claimed      happened 20 or 30 or 50 years later,'' he recently posted to      Internet readers sharing conspiracy theories. ``But hey, it's      differences of opinion that make the world go around. Cheers,      Norm.''                          ____________________
