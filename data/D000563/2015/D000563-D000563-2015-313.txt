President, I was necessarily absent for vote No. 204 on Tillis amendment No. 1506. Had I been in the Chamber I would have opposed this amendment. Section 136 of the underlying bill requires the Secretary of the Air Force in consultation with the Secretary of the Army to examine the daily training and contingency requirements of the C-130 fleet on this issue.
