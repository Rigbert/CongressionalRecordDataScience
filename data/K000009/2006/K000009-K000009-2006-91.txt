If you look back, they say to us, the Secretary of Treasury that just left, Mr. Snow says you know the real problem with China is the yuan. If we just vary the currency exchange rate, all of our problems will be solved. That is what they said to us back during the 1980s when Reagan was President. Don't worry about the trade deficit with Japan. When the yen-dollar exchange rates gets low enough our trade balance will just automatically come back into the black for the United States. Guess what? It never has because Japan is not an open market. China is not an open market. And if you look at who is, on the prior chart the gentleman had up there, if you look at who has lent us the most money, Japan, they are earning it off of us rather than opening their markets to U.S. automotive parts, to U.S. Maytag washing machines. You have got a closed market in Japan now using China as a back door for manufacturing with imported parts that are being put into everything. And we are not competing globally on a level playing field and it is killing our workers, and Washington refuses to respond.
