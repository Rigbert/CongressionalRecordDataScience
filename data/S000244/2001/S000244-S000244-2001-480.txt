Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 256. Chapter 12 is a form of bankruptcy relief only available to family farmers enacted on a temporary basis to respond to the particularized needs of farmers in financial distress. As a part of the Bankruptcy Judges, United States Trustees and Family Farmer Bankruptcy Act of 1986, chapter 12 has been extended several times since 1986 until it lapsed on July 1 of last year.  Absent chapter 12, farmers are forced to file for bankruptcy relief under the Bankruptcy Code's other alternatives. None of these forms of bankruptcy relief, however, work quite as well for farmers as chapter 12. Chapter 11, for example, will require a farmer to sell the family farm to pay the claims of creditors. With respect to chapter 13, many farmers would simply be ineligible to file under that form of bankruptcy relief because of its debt limits. Chapter 11 is an expensive process that does not accommodate the special needs of farmers.  In the last Congress, the House on two occasions passed legislation that would have extended chapter 12. Unfortunately, the other body did not act on these bills and chapter 12 expired on July 1, 2000 as a result. By virtue of H.R. 256, chapter 12 will be reenacted retroactive to July 1, 2000 and extended for 11 months to June 1 of this year. I must note, however, that H.R. 333, the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2001, a bill that will be considered on the floor tomorrow, will make chapter 12 a permanent fixture of the Bankruptcy Code for family farmers. I urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 256.                                                    U.S. Congress,                                  Congressional Budget Office,                                Washington, DC, February 26, 2001.     Hon. F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr.,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, House of          Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has      prepared the enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 256, a bill to      extend for 11 additional months the period for which chapter      12 of title 11 of the United States Code is reenacted.       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be      pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Lanette J.      Walker, who can be reached at 226-2860.           Sincerely,                                                 Barry B. Anderson                                   (For Dan L. Crippen, Director).       Enclosure.               congressional budget office cost estimate     H.R. 256--A bill to extend for 11 additional months the          period for which chapter 12 of title 11 of the United          States Code is reenacted       H.R. 256 would extend chapter 12 of title 11 of the U.S.      Code until June 1, 2001. Chapter 12, which was created by the      Bankruptcy Judges, United States Trustees, and Family Farmer      Bankruptcy Act of 1986 (Public Law 99-554), specifies      bankruptcy procedures available only to family farmers with      regular annual income and is intended to facilitate an      efficient and expeditious bankruptcy process. The      authorization for such bankruptcy proceedings expired July 1,      2000.       CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 256 would have no      significant budgetary impact. It would result in a small loss      of offsetting collections to the U.S. Trustee System Fund,      thus causing an insignificant increase in net outlays from      this fund in 2001. In addition, CBO estimates that enacting      H.R. 256 would result in a negligible loss of offsetting      receipts and revenues in 2001. Because H.R. 256 would affect      direct spending and governmental receipts pay-as-you-go      procedures would apply. The bill contains no      intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in      the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would impose no costs on      state, local, or tribal governments.       Based on information from the Executive Office of the      United States Trustees, CBO expects that, without the      temporary extension of chapter 12, family farmers filing for      bankruptcy would split their filings about evenly between      chapter 11 and chapter 13. Chapter 12 has a $200 filing fee      and does not require the bankrupt party to pay quarterly fees      to the government. Chapter 11, in contrast, requires an $800      filing fee as well as quarterly filing fees. (On average,      $1,000 is collected per case.) Chapter 13 requires only a      $130 filing fee.       Bankruptcy fees are recorded in three different places in      the budget. Portions of the fees are recorded as governmental      receipts (revenues), as offsetting collections to the      appropriation for the U.S. Trustee System Fund, and as      offsettting receipts to the Administrative Office of the      United States Courts (AOUSC). The percentage of the fees      allocated among these accounts varies by chapter. Because      only 300 to 400 bankruptcy cases are likely to be affected by      the bill, it would have only a small effect on the amount of      fees collected in 2001.       The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Lanette J.      Walker, who can be reached at 226-2860. This estimate was      approved by Robert A. Sunshine, Assistant Director for Budget      Analysis.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
