 I urge my colleagues to defeat this CR so we can send a message to those who control this Chamber that we have a responsibility to our country and to our people to adopt a balanced fiscal plan to reduce our debt and deficit and invest in the growth of the economy.  That is not what this bill does. I urge its defeat.
