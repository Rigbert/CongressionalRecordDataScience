Speaker, I rise today to recognize the centennial anniversary of Our Lady Queen of the Most Holy Rosary Cathedral in Toledo, Ohio. The parish and Toledo Diocese celebrated this milestone on August 28, 2015.  According to diocesan records, the Cathedral Chapel Parish was established on March 7, 1915, with the Most Reverend Bishop Joseph Schrembs named as pastor. Previous to that date, from the time the Diocese was established in April of 1910, St. Francis de Sales Church served as the cathedral. Shortly thereafter, land was purchased nearby on Collingwood Avenue and a Chancery, residence and school were built on the property in the ensuing years with completion in early 1915. Originally sponsoring both grade school and high school, the parish school soon grew too big. In 1920, Central Catholic High School was established, with most of its students coming from the Cathedral School.  After a storm delivered substantial damage to the building in 1920, it was determined a new church would be built. The plans were developed in 1922. Its original architect and the man who would complete his design envisioned a cathedral such as those built in Europe's Middle Ages and mirrored aspects of the cathedral in Toledo, Ohio's sister city of Toledo, Spain. Thus, Toledo's Catholic Cathedral is unique: there is no other cathedral in the Plateresque style quite like Toledo's. Plateresque is a romantic style developed in 16th Century Spain and Toledo's cathedral combined the Plateresque style with Romanesque and Saracan architecture for a structure that stands alone in style and beauty.  The Cathedral is truly an architectural wonder and treasure. Soaring above its Spanish style roof are twin towers Peter and Paul. Our Lady is carved out of a single block of limestone and is above the doorway. A window above the statue of Our Lady illustrates scenes from her life. The window was made possible by the pennies donated from the children in the Diocese. Other statuary depicting biblical scenes surround. The sanctuary features beautiful frescoes, murals and mosaics depicting stories and people from the Bible, the life of the Holy Family and the history of the church. The Cathedral is home to a grand pipe organ which was the culmination of the career of its creator, the famed Ernest Skinner. The pipe organ's sister resides in the Peristyle concert hall at the Toledo Museum of Art, home of the Toledo Symphony.  The Cathedral's cornerstone was laid on Sunday June 27, 1926. Sufficiently completed to begin services, the building was opened in 1931. Work on the structure continued until completion in 1940. A joyous two day celebration and consecration was finally held on October 1 and 2, 1940.  The Cathedral parish and school grew through the 1960s, but as Toledo's population moved to the suburbs and new parishes were established, the central city Cathedral parish and school saw a decline in families enrolled. Beginning in 1976, the Cathedral was to undergo extensive renovations to comply with the changes to the Mass brought by Vatican II. The renovations did not detract from the original design and the church was rededicated on September 18, 1979. In 2000, restoration was completed to remove the decades from the interior of the church and restore it to its early brilliance.  The spiritual home of Toledo area Catholics, the cathedral serves as the mother church of the Diocese's parishes. Though its home parish is smaller now, Catholics from throughout the city and its suburbs see the Cathedral as their own, celebrating Baptisms, First Communions, Confirmations, Marriages and Requiem Masses. Priests are ordained at the Cathedral and special Masses are celebrated through the year. In tradition harkening back to the days they were part of the original parish school, the students of Central Catholic High School walk in procession for a yearly Mass.  Though soaring vaulted ceilings, beautiful works of art, statuary, bell towers, giant wood doors and marble floors and ancient pews on which thousands have gathered over the years to celebrate Mass make the Cathedral a grand and glorious house of worship, at the same time it is intimate and peaceful. The faithful can always hear that ``still, small voice'' even among the grandeur. More important than the structure, though, are the people. We reflect on the early founders, those whose hopes, dreams and labors brought forth our stunning Cathedral, and in the present day we stand in solidarity with them. I was pleased to join in the celebration recognizing 100 years of faith in Our Lady Queen of the Most Holy Rosary Cathedral. Through our cherished Cathedral, we are one.                          ____________________
