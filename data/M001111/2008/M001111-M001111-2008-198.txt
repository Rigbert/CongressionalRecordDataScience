 President, I would like to express my sorrow regarding the tragic death of one of Washington's finest young environmental advocates Shannon Harps on December 31, 2007. She was killed by an unknown assailant as she was returning to her Capitol Hill apartment in Seattle from the grocery store. Shannon's death is a tremendous loss to our community and the many issues to which she devoted her life. I join with Shannon's family, friends, and colleagues in the Sierra Club in mourning the loss of this wonderful person and fine community organizer. Though her life was cut short, she was able to make a large impact on the quality of the Northwest environment.  Shannon came from her home State of Ohio to Seattle, WA, in February 2004 to join the staff of the northwest office of the Sierra Club. This move joined two of Shannon's strongest desires to work to protect our environment and to live in the Northwest where she could more vigorously pursue her strong love for the outdoors.  Shannon had a wonderful sense of humor and a style of working with people that immediately put them at ease and made it easy for them to join her in protecting our environment and quality of life. Shannon particularly enjoyed working with high school and college students to help them develop their interests and talents in working to create a better world. While Shannon's work was directly focused on protecting our environment, from wilderness to global warming, her values were deeply embedded in a strong sense of fairness and justice for all people.  In the 4 years that Shannon lived in Washington State she helped to protect some of our finest lands. Shannon worked with Sierra Club volunteers and staff from the many groups to help move the Wild Sky Wilderness proposal through the various steps of its arduous journey through the congressional process. She spent countless hours on the phone, in meetings, and on the trail helping to bring people together to advocate for protection of these spectacular wild lands. Shannon believed that people were better advocates if they had firsthand knowledge of the places they were advocating for. As part of this belief she led countless hikes into some of Washington's wildest lands.  Shannon's was a natural leader in the State of Washington and worked with colleagues around the country to help thwart the various efforts to open up America's Arctic Coastal Plain to oil and gas drilling. She was a lead organizer in the successful effort in 2006 to pass the renewable energy portfolio standard for Washington State. And, in the recent 2 years, much of her work focused on building relationships with local officials and creating public support so they would endorse the mayor's Climate Protection Agreement.  In her all-too-short life, she made contributions that benefited our community, State, and the world. She lived her life as an example of living lightly on the planet and engaged the people and world around her with grace, humor, kindness, and respect. Everyone who worked with her admired her style, tenacity, and sense of purpose, along with her sparkling smile and laugh.  Shannon loved living and working in the Northwest. She reveled in the outdoors and nothing made her happier than to participate in a competitive run, or hike our high mountain trails. Her death is a loss for us all. But her spirit still resides with all of those with whom she worked and walked the trails, and those who continue the struggle to protect our lands and environment and create a more just and fair world for us all.                          ____________________
