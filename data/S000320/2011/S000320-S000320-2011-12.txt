 President, I yield myself 1 minute. I urge my colleagues to vote against the Menendez amendment. If this amendment becomes law, taxpayers will be forced to subsidize individuals who make upward of $200,000 a year so they may buy homes worth nearly $1 million. That is what this is about. Increasing the loan limits will only benefit those who do not need Federal subsidies.  This is simply not a good use of scarce taxpayer dollars. Even the administration does not support higher loan limits here. It is a bad amendment.  I yield my time.
