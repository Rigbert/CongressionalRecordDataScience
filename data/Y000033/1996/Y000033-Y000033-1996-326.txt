Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to introduce a bill to amend the Indian Health Care Improvement Act to extend the demonstration program for direct billing for Medicare, Medicaid, and other third-party payors to September 30, 1998.  Section 405 of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act established a demonstration program to authorize up to four tribally-operated Indian Health Service [IHS] hospitals or clinics to test methods for direct billing for and receipt of payment for heath services provided to Medicare- and Medicaid-eligible patients. This program was established to determine whether these collections could be increased through direct involvement of the tribal health provider as compared with the current practice which required such billings and collections to be channeled through the IHS.  Currently, there are four tribal health care providers participating in this demonstration project, the Bristol Bay Area Health Corp. of Dillingham, AK; the Southeast Alaska Regional Health Consortium of Sitka, AK; theMississippi, Choctaw Health Center of Philadelphia, MI, and the Choctaw Tribe of Oklahoma of Durant, OK. All participants have unanimously expressed success and satisfaction with the demonstration program and report that dramatically increased collections for Medicare and Medicaid services, thereby providing additional revenues for Indian health programs at these facilities; significant reduction in the turn-around time between billing and receipt of payment; and increased efficiency by being able to track down their own billings and collections and thereby act quickly to resolve questions and problems.  The IHS is required to monitor participation and receive quarterly reports from the four participants. The law also requires the IHS to report to Congress on the demonstration program on September 30, 1996, the end of fiscal year 1996. This report is to evaluate whether the objective have been fulfilled, and whether direct billing should be allowed for other tribal providers who operate an entire IHS facility.  All four participants seek to extend the demonstration program authority for 2 more years to give Congress time to review the report IHS must submit on September 30, 1996, and determine the future of the program.  Without the extension, the four participants would have to close down their direct billing-collection departments and return to the old system of IHS-managed collections. This would mean the dismantling of highly specialized administrative staff and would have an immediate negative impact on revenue collection.  This is a technical amendment to extend the program in 2 more years so that the existing participants can continue their direct billing collection efforts while the required report from the IHS is reviewed.                          ____________________
