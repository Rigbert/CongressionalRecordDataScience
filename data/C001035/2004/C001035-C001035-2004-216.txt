The Acting Director of the CIA said it best. He talked about how cumbersome the current system is. He told us you first have to acquire the approval of the agency head, then you have to go to the department secretary, then you have to go to OMB, and then you have to go to Congress. We are keeping the OMB and congressional steps. I want to make that clear. But that process, he told us, typically takes 5 months, and, as he said--and I quote John McLaughlin:       So you can see that's not very agile to meet the needs of      today. My view is that the national intelligence director      ought to have the authority to move those funds.  I would also note that other provisions in the bill are opposed by the White House, and the amendment is opposed by the chairman of the Intelligence Committee.  I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.
