President, last week, Chicago lost a giant in media when Ken Smikle passed away at the too young age of 66. For over 40 years, Ken redefined coverage of the Black American experience and brought to light the economic potential of Black communities in the United States.  It is hard to believe that an audience with $1.2 trillion in buying power in 2017 did not have a publication geared toward understanding the African-American market 30 years ago, but that was the reality before Ken founded Target Media News in 1987. Ken saw the potential there throughout his career.  Hailing from Harlem, NY,--in 1974, Ken, his brother, Dawoud Bey, and friend, Gerald Gladney started a business that published two magazines. They did this with no financial backing besides savings from various jobs.  Ken wrote for several publications, including Essence Magazine and the National Leader Magazine. He went on to serve as the arts editor for Harlem's Amsterdam News, the Black music editor at Record World Magazine, and the editor of the Philadelphia Inquirer.  In 1983, Ken's life had a revolution. He became the senior editor at Black Enterprise magazine. Ken also met the love of his life, Renee Ferguson, who was among the first female African-American women to work at CBS Network News in New York. Both of them were dedicated to telling the untold story of African Americans. It was at Black Enterprise that Ken got the idea that no one was tracking what businesses were doing to market to Black consumers.  In 1987, Ken and Renee moved to Chicago. Ken founded Target Market News, while Renee worked as an investigative reporter for NBC5 News. Target Market News became the leading publication showing the research into marketing to African Americans. His work was pivotal in changing the way corporations viewed African Americans as an economic force. He published an annual ``Black Buying Power'' report for many years. For many years, Ken was the only one doing it, until Forbes and the University of Georgia Selig Center joined the bandwagon.  Ken was the expert quoted on marketing to African Americans in numerous publications. He cofounded the African American Marketing and Media Association, hosted annual conferences, and was a proud member of the National Association of Black Journalists.  In Chicago's Hyde Park's Kenwood community, Ken and Renee were staples for 30 years. They were neighbors to a young couple named Barack and Michelle Obama. Before Barack Obama was President Obama, he was Ken's friend at the Hyde Park co-op.  While trailblazing the marketing industry, Ken was a Little League basketball coach at the YMCA. He was a loving father to his son, Jason, going to his son's baseball, basketball, and swimming competition.  Ken loved his jazz and the music of life. His leadership and vision will be missed.  Ken leaves behind his wife, Renee, son, Jason, brother, Dawoud Bey, and sisters, Sandra Bernard and Georgianna Machicote.
