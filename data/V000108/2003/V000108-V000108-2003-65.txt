Speaker, it is my distinct pleasure to recognize and commend the members of the Gary branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). On Friday, May 9, 2003, the Gary NAACP will hold its 40th Annual Life Membership Banquet at St. Timothy Community Church in Gary, Indiana.  The Gary NAACP was organized in 1915 by a group of residents to monitor and defend the rights of African-Americans in Northwest Indiana. The national organization, of which the Gary branch is a member, focuses on providing better and more positive ways of addressing the important issues facing minorities in social and job-related settings. Like the national organization, the Gary branch of the NAACP serves its community by combating injustice, discrimination, and unfair treatment in our society.  The primary focus of the NAACP continues to be the protection and enhancement of the civil rights of African-Americans and other minorities. Today, that fight for equity and quality extends to many issues including health care for minorities. Thus, the theme for the evening is, Taking the Next Steps to Reduce Health Disparities. Long before it became a broad based public concern, efforts were underway to ensure that economic and social barriers would not lead to increasingly severe health crises in minority communities. The featured speaker, Dr. Willarda Edwards, National Health Director for the NAACP, will speak about how the NAACP has been leading the effort to inform and educate the community about health care costs; quality and access; disease prevention; health care professions and training; and youth and elderly issues.  Further, this year the Gary NAACP will honor two outstanding community leaders for their lifelong efforts to further equality in society as well as one sorority. Mr. John Betjeman, retiring CEO of Methodist Hospitals, will receive the Benjamin Hooks award and Dr. William Mays, CEO of Mays Chemical, will receive the Roy Wilkins award. Additionally, joining more than four hundred outstanding civil, community, and religious leaders of the region, the following distinguished individuals will be inducted as life members of the Gary NAACP in the categories indicated. Personsreceiving the vintage life membership include: Dharathula Millender, Dorothy Clark, Anna Connor, Dr. FranCina Conard, Delorise Webster, and Rev. Samuel Roberts. Those receiving silver life memberships include: Roosevelt Allen, Jr., Ella Bradford, Valerie Allen Broadnax, Jacqueline Hall, Esq., and Christina Sally. St. Timothy Community Church will be receiving the gold life membership and Steven Christopher Tinsley and the Youth Church at St. Timothy Community Church will receive junior life memberships.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in paying tribute to the new life members as well as the other members of the Gary NAACP for the efforts, activities, and leadership that these outstanding men and women have championed to improve the quality of life for all residents of Indiana's First Congressional District.                          ____________________
