 President, today I rise to commend and thank Mr. Richard Price of the Congressional Research Service, CRS, for his many years of outstanding service to the U.S. Congress. In June, Mr. Price is retiring from CRS after 32 years of service. For over three decades at CRS, Mr. Price has played a significant role in providing assistance to Congress in analyzing major health care legislation. In his position at CRS, he has been an invaluable asset not only through his own work analyzing health care legislation, but also in his tireless efforts to guide others in the Health Care and Medicine unit at CRS which he managed.  Over the past three decades, Mr. Price has worked on health care legislation across a wide array of health care policy and programs. Mr. Price is a recognized expert on the major U.S. health care financing programs--Medicare and Medicaid; his particular areas of expertise span most aspects of Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement policy, long-term care, Medicaid eligibility, nursing home reform, managed care, hospice care, skilled nursing home services, end stage renal disease, home health care services, and public health service programs, among many others. His contributions to the development of legislation in these areas have been substantial. Over his long career at CRS, he has helped hundreds of staff understand the effect of the legislative proposals being considered through thoughtful analyses, balanced presentations, and clear explanations. I wish to especially thank him for his work with the Senate Finance Committee and its staff.  In addition to his own analytic work on legislative analysis, Mr. Price has been responsible for management of a staff of CRS analysts who assist Congress across a wide spectrum of health care issues, including those related to Medicare, Medicaid, the Public Health Service, the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health, and the Veterans Administration. Mr. Price was instrumental in building the health care staff of CRS to a large team of senior analysts. In addition, Mr. Price has been involved in innumerable projects to develop the capacity of CRS analysts to evaluate and analyze health care data, including models to estimate the effect of various legislative changes in Medicare and other health care programs.  Other organizations that analyze issues related to health care policy have acknowledged Mr. Price's accomplishments and knowledge of U.S. health care policy. For example, Mr. Price is a member of the steering committee of the National Health Policy Forum, a nonpartisan organization that provides research to senior level health policy makers in Washington. Mr. Price is also a member of the prestigious National Academy on Social Insurance, NASI.  Mr. Price's service to Congress in the analysis and development of policy alternatives across a wide array of health care programs, his ability to conceptualize complex public policy issues, as well as his leadership of staff who work on many varied and complex health care issues, set the highest standards for assistance provided by CRS in service to the Congress. He will be missed, both here in Congress and across the street at the Library of Congress.                          ____________________
