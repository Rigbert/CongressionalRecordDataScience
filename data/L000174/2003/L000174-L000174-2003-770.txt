President, I am doing that because Professor Bender asked that this be made known to the Senate, especially as he has been quoted as having changed his mind. He still opposes Mr. Estrada. I will quote him again. He says:       I have not changed my opinion of the nomination, nor have I      ever said to anyone that I had changed my opinion.  He makes it very clear that he feels he has been misquoted on the Senate floor. He may feel it was done inadvertently. He said, ``Someone must have inadvertently given you incorrect information about this,'' making it very clear that he was misquoted.  I know what he means. It is easy to get misquoted around here. Earlier this week a Republican Senator misquoted me in the Senate Chamber.
