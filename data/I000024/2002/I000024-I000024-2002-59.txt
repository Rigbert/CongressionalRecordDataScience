President, first of all, I thank my colleague from New Mexico. I am happy to join him in proposing this amendment. I think it is very important for a number of reasons. I just came from the Senate Armed Services Committee, where we had all four of the chiefs of the services. We were talking about this war that we are prosecuting right now. We were talking about the Nation's security.  I can remember all the way back in the 1980s, when then-Secretary of the Interior Don Hodel and I went around the country and talked about the fact that an energy policy is something that is important to our Nation's security. It is a national security issue, not an energy issue. Consequently--and I said this a minute ago--this has not been a partisan thing. We tried to get President Reagan to come up with an energy policy. He would not do it. I thought George ``the first,'' coming from the oil fields, would have one, but he didn't do it either. The last administration didn't do it.  A national energy policy is really necessary for national security reasons. Right now, we are dependent upon foreign countries for 57 percent of our energy supply--something that is not acceptable, particularly right now in a time of war.  Where does this issue of hydraulic fracturing come in? I am from Oklahoma, and I understand we have a tremendous reserve down there in terms of marginal production. I started many years ago--probably before many fellow Members were born--in the oil fields in cable tool rigs--something they used before rotaries--the pounding method. I realized at that time how much this meant to the country and how much our shallow production meant.  When we talk about energy policy, we talk about nuclear, as we did in the last amendment, and we talk about ANWR--and it is necessary to get into some of the deep stuff.  In terms of marginal production--wells that have 15 barrels a day, or less, and a comparable amount for gas wells--this has a tremendous prospect to be an important ingredient in a national energy policy. If we had all of the gas wells that have been plugged in the last 10 years, or oil wells that have been plugged, producing today--marginal wells, producing 15 barrels or less--it would equal more than what we are currently importing from Saudi Arabia. So it is necessary to have these wells.  How does hydraulic fracturing fit into this equation? This system has been used--I remember using it myself--since the 1940s. In the 1940s, we had a system of injection in order to get maximum production in both oil and gas wells. Not one time in that period of time--after over a million wells have used this process--has there been any kind of damage to the environment. In the last 15 years, there have been over 100,000 wells using this, with no damage to the environment.  As the Senator from New Mexico points out, this is not a partisan thing. The Clinton administration supported this, the Bush administration supports this, and Carol Browner supported this when I served as chairman of one of the subcommittees of the Environment and Public Works Committee. This is necessary to have, and it does no harm to the environment.  I am honored to join my colleague, Senator Bingaman, in supporting this amendment and in saying this is a necessary part of the national energy policy.  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from Carl Smith Assistant Secretary, Office of Fossil Energy, of the Department of Energy be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                         Department of Energy,                                    Washington, DC, March 7, 2002.     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, U.S.          Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: As the Senate considers legislation to      address our growing dependence on imported oil and to      consider ways to promote the production on of our domestic      energy resources, I am concerned that the impact of possible      restrictions on the use of hydraulic fracturing, the most      commonly used technique to stimulate domestic oil and gas      wells, may not be well known or fully understood. Therefore,      I thought it would be useful to provide you with some      information on the essential role this technology plays in      today's oil and gas industry.       Hydraulic fracturing is used on approximately two thirds of      the onshore gas wells drilled in the United States today and      since its inception in 1947, it has enabled the production of      over eight billion barrels of North American oil reserves      that otherwise would have been unrecovered. It is estimated      that hydraulically fractured gas wells produce 10 Tcf of      natural gas annually, or nearly sixty percent of the gas      produced from domestic gas wells. Further, production of one      of our fastest growing sources of onshore natural gas      supplies, coalbed methane, would be seriously diminished if      hydraulic fracturing was unavailable. Approximately seventy-     five percent of the 1.5 Tcf of coal bed methane produced      annually comes from wells that were hydraulically fractured.       I would also point out that hydraulic fracturing offers      several environmental benefits. By increasing the production      of oil and gas from reservoirs that have lower flow rates,      hydraulic fracturing reduces the number of wells needed to      deplete the reservoir, thereby protecting the environment by      minimizing the waste volumes and surface disturbance      associated with oil and gas drilling. Also, by increasing the      amount of methane recovered from mineable coal seams prior to      the start of mining activities, hydraulic fracturing promotes      coal mine safety and lowers the amount of methane gas that      escapes during mining operations, a significant source of      greenhouse gas emissions.       On August 24, 2000, while still Secretary of Energy for the      State of Oklahoma, I had the opportunity to raise these      points at a workshop held here in Washington by the      Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Also speaking at that      workshop was Tom Stewart, Executive Vice President of the      Ohio Oil and Gas Association. I managed to find a copy of his      remarks on the internet and I thought you might be interested      in them. They mirrored many of the comments I heard from my      colleagues during the workshop. Tom noted that, ``With very      limited exceptions, hydraulic fracturing was used to complete      over 55,000 Ohio wells drilled since 1970. Exploitation of      the tight Clinton sand would not have been possible without      fracturing. The hydraulic fracturing process made the modern      Ohio oil and gas industry.''       In September 2001, the Department of Energy's concern with      the impact of proposed restriction on the use of hydraulic      fracturing, led the Office of Fossil Energy to ask the      National Energy Technology Laboratory's Strategic Center for      Natural Gas to conduct a study on, ``Quantifying the Impact      of Hydraulic Fracturing in Meeting U.S. Natural Gas Supply      Requirements''. The number and types of stimulation      treatments (hydraulic fracturing) will be quantified,      treatment costs will be identified, and natural gas      production and price relationships will be reviewed and      projected. Results of this study will be available in May of      this year but I anticipate that some useful information      regarding the important role of hydraulic fracturing will be      available over the next few weeks. I will provide this      information to you as it becomes available.       I welcome the opportunity to bring this very important      matter to your attention. If you need more information or      have any questions please contact Peter Lagiovane of my      office.
