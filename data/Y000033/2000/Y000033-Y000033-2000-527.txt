Mr. Speaker, I submit for the benefit of the Members a copy of the cost estimate prepared by the Congressional Budget Office for H.R. 4063, a bill to establish the Rosie the Riveter-World War II Home Front National Historical Park in the State of California, and for other purposes.                                                    U.S. Congress,                                  Congressional Budget Office,                                    Washington, DC, July 12, 2000.     Hon. Don Young,     Chairman, Committee on Resources,     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has      prepared the enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 4063, the Rosie      the Riveter/World War II Home Front National Historical Park      Establishment Act of 2000.       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be      pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Deborah      Reis.           Sincerely,                                                 Barry B. Anderson                                   (For Dan L. Crippen, Director).       Enclosure.               CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE COST ESTIMATE     H.R. 4063--Rosie the Riveter/World War II Home Front National          Historical Park Establishment Act of 2000       Summary: Assuming appropriation of the necessary amounts,      CBO estimates that implementing H.R. 4063 would cost the      federal government between $6.5 million and $10.5 million      over the next three years and about $0.8 million annually      thereafter. Because the act would allow the Secretary of the      Interior to collect and spend donations, pay-as-you-go      procedures would apply, but CBO estimates that any revenues      and resulting direct spending would be minimal and largely      offsetting.       H.R. 4063 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector      mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act      (UMRA). State and local governments could incur some costs as      a result of the legislation's enactment, but such costs would      be voluntary.       Major provisions: H.R. 4063 would establish the Rosie the      Riveter-World War II Home Front National Historical Park in      Richmond, California. The National Park Service (NPS) would      administer the park, which would consist of historical sites      related to the themes of Rosie the Riveter such as World War      II-era shipyards, housing and daycare centers, as well as a      number of local parks and memorials such as the Shimada Peace      Memorial Park. The act would authorize the NPS to acquire      some of these sites (including the daycare centers and a      nearby hospital), to protect these resources through      cooperative agreements with their current owners to provide      technical assistance, and in some cases to help interpret and      restore historic structures. It also would authorize the NPS      to lease the Ford Assembly Building to establish an education      center, which would serve as the primary visitor contact      facility for the new park.       H.R. 4063 would direct the NPS to develop a general      management plan for the park and make recommendations      concerning other sites that should be linked or added to the      park. The act also would require the agency to conduct a      theme study of the World War II home front to determine      whether other sites in the United States should be included      in the National Park System.       Section 5 of H.R. 4063 would authorize the appropriation of      whatever sums are necessary to (1) acquire specified      properties within the park's boundaries, (2) preserve and      interpret park resources (including funds to conduct oral      histories), and (3) provide visitor services. In addition,      the act would authorize the appropriation of $1 million for      the purchase of historical artifacts. Finally, the      legislation would authorize the NPS to accept and use      donations of funds, property, and services.       Estimated cost to the Federal Government: Based on      information provided by the NPS and assuming appropriation of      the necessary amounts, CBO estimates that the federal      government would spend between $6.5 million and $10.5 million      over the next three years to implement H.R. 4063. Most of the      funds would be used to develop the education center at the      Ford Assembly Building--between $2.7 million and $6.7      million--depending on the size of the facility and on the      availability of nonfederal funding. Other one-time costs of      about $2.4 million would be incurred to acquire, artifacts,      restore buildings, develop required plans and studies, and      other activities under cooperative agreements. Finally, we      estimate that it would cost $1.4 million to administer the      new park during the three-year development period. Once all      facilities have been developed, CBO estimates that ongoing      costs to operate and maintain the new park would be about      $0.8 million annually, beginning in fiscal year 2004.       Pay-as-you-go considerations: The Balanced Budget and      Emergency Deficit Control Act sets up pay-as-you-go      procedures for legislation affecting direct spending or      receipts. H.R. 4063 would authorize the NPS to accept and use      donations for the new historical park. Such donations are      recorded in the budget as governmental receipts, and spending      of the gifts would be considered new direct spending. Based      on information provided by the agency, CBO estimates that      both receipts and direct spending under this provision would      be less than $500,000 annually.       Estimate prepared by: Federal Costs: Deborah Reis and Ali      Aslam. Impact on State, Local, and Tribal Governments: Susan      Van Deventer. Impact on the Private Sector: Natalie Tawil.       Estimate approved by: Peter H. Fontaine, Deputy Assistant      Director for Budget Analysis.                               ____________________
