Mr. Speaker, for 75 years, Social Security has lifted millions of seniors and disabled Americans out of poverty. That is why I can't believe that Republicans would cut Social Security benefits and make it harder for people who worked all their lives to get benefits.  Social Security is a sacred trust. It is a trust between the American government and the American people. It is a trust between parents and children, between those working and those in retirement. It is the greatest example of the beloved community in America.  We will not allow anyone to cut Social Security. We will hold this sacred trust for generations yet to come.                          ____________________
