 President, I am joining Chairman Baucus today to introduce the Beneficiary Access to Care and Medicare Equity Act of 2002.  This legislation arrives at an important time for Medicare beneficiaries and the providers that care for them: October 1. Many provisions of the Medicare law that ensure adequate payment for providers, and in turn, beneficiary access to care, expire today. I urge the Senate to consider this legislation with all speed, as soon as possible.  Our bill addresses pressing needs. The clock is running out on Medicare payments to doctors, who are scheduled for yet another reduction in their fees for a second straight year, absent Congressional action. Skilled Nursing Facilities also face a major reduction in payment today. In other areas facing imminent payment cuts, such as home health and hospital services, our bill injects financial support that will stabilize these essential services our seniors rely on. The legislation also provides billions in aid to State governments, many of them facing steep budget deficits, so they can meet the needs of citizens who rely on the Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Programs.  In addition to ensuring continued access to quality care for Medicare beneficiaries, our bipartisan Beneficiary Access to Care and Medicare Equity Act makes long overdue improvements to health care in rural America. Our bill invests in States like Iowa, my home State, where small providers that practice efficient medicine are hurt by complex payment formulas that favor high-cost care in big cities.  The formulas also don't recognize special costs faced by smaller, more isolated physicians, hospitals and clinics. It obviously doesn't make sense to penalize States like Iowa who do more with less. That's why I'm so committed to fixing these formulas. The proposal I've put together with Senator Baucus would provide a tremendous infusion of cash to hard-pressed health care providers across Iowa and to other rural States. It takes money to ensure access to care for Iowans, and this will help make the federal government part of the solution instead of part of the problem.  Together, Senator Baucus and I have introduced our bill under Rule 14, which means the bill will be placed directly on the calendar two days from now, rather than referred to our own Committee, the Finance Committee. We agreed to take this extraordinary step because the Senate is basically tied up in knots right now. Well, our message is that Medicare fairness is too urgent to let this bill be a victim of gridlock. Our action today gives Senate Majority Leader Daschle the ability to call the bill up as early as Thursday. In short, there's no time to waste.                                 ______                                       By Mr. McCAIN:  S. 3019. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a special resource study of sites associated with the life of Cesar Estrada Chavez and the farm labor movement; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a special resource study of sites associated with the life of Cesar Estrada Chavez. Chavez is one of the most revered public servants in our history for his leadership in helping organize migrant farm workers, and for providing inspiration to the most oppressed in our society. It is important that we cherish his struggle and do what we can to preserve certain sites located in Arizona, California and other states that are significant to his life.  My fellow Arizonan, Cesar Chavez was born in Yuma. He was the son of migrant farm workers, and an exemplary American hero. He no doubt loved qualities of life associated with his family's heritage, but he will be remembered for the sincerity of his American patriotism. He fought to help Americans transcend distinctions of experience, and share equality in the rights and responsibilities of freedom. He made America a bigger and better Nation.  While Chavez and his family migrated across the southwest looking for farm work, he evolved into a defender of worker's rights. He founded the National Farm Workers Association in 1962, which later became the United Farm Workers of America. Essentially, he gave a voice to those that had no voice. In his words: ``We cannot seek achievement for ourselves and forget about progress and prosperity for our community . . . our ambitions must be broad enough to include the aspirations and needs of others, for their sakes and for our own.''  This legislation, almost identical to the House bill, H.R. 2966, introduced by Congresswoman Hilda Solis, D-CA, in September 2001, would specifically authorize the Secretary of the Interior to determine whether any of the sitesmeet the criteria for being listed on the National Register of Historic Landmarks. The study would be conducted within three years. The goal of this legislation is to establish a foundation for a future bill that will designate land for these sites to become Historic Landmarks.  Cesar Chavez was a humble man of deep conviction who understood what it meant to serve and sacrifice for others. He was a true American hero that embodied the values of justice and freedom this nation holds dear. Honoring the places of his life will enable his legacy to inspire and serve as an example for our future leaders.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3018       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
