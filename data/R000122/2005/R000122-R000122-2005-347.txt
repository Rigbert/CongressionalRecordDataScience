That is what strict liability is.  There is a difference between strict liability and negligence. The legislation we are considering is not about strict liability alone. It is about negligence. It goes way beyond that letter. If we were debating legislation that said essentially a company may not be held strictly liable for X, Y, and Z, this would be a different debate entirely.  This legislation goes way beyond strict liability. It says that negligence cases, those that you must show that, in fact, the manufacturer or the dealer had a duty and unreasonably failed to perform that duty, that is what you have to show. In fact, I think I accurately represented what was in the letter.
