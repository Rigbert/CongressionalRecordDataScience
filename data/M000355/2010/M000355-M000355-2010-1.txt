 Lula has been a force in every legislative effort we have engaged in since my tenure as Republican leader began, and long before that. I have come to respect her deep knowledge of the Senate rules and the important role she has played in advising Democratic Senators over the past 2 years. She is a constant presence on the floor and an important part of Senate life. We congratulate her on her professional success, from her days as a school teacher to her work on the floor of the U.S. Senate, and we wish her every happiness in the years ahead.
