Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 125th anniversary of the University of Toledo. Throughout its history and into the present, the University of Toledo has been cause for great pride and growth in our community, educating our citizens and providing brighter futures as a result. In its first 125 years, the University of Toledo has developed tremendously. UT is a nationally recognized public university with a wide range of undergraduate and graduate programs serving students across Ohio, all 50 States, and 98 countries. The University of Toledo is a leader in enrolling National Merit Scholars. In further testament to its success, it has grown from only one building on one campus to more than 60 on several campuses today.  The mission of the University of Toledo is manifold. UT strives for excellence in research and scholarship and is equally concerned with disseminating this knowledge through its academic programs. The University is highly committed to helping students achieve their highest potential by providing open access to the institution and challenging course work within its programs. Further the University of Toledo holds the promotion of pluralism, racial diversity, and gender representation as high priorities, making the University a place in which all types of people and viewpoints are valued. Renaissance writer John Heywood captured the spirit of UT's philosophy when he wrote, ``The very spring and root of honesty and virtue lie in a good education.'' The University's guiding principles of freedom of expression and social justice make clear that UT proudly operates by the same belief system.  I am pleased to join the community to recognize, with gratitude, the University of Toledo's 125 years of excellence in education. I know my colleagues join me in wishing the University a happy 125th anniversary.                          ____________________
