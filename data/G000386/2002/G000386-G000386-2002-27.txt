 President, I rise today to offer a bill on behalf of Sen. Baucus and myself to address the issue of inverting corporations that are awarded contracts by the federal government. Our bill is the ``Reclaiming Expatriated Contracts and Profits'', RECAP, Act.  Inverting corporations set up a folder in a foreign filing cabinet or a mail box overseas and call that their new foreign ``headquarters.'' This allows companies to escape millions of dollars of Federal taxes every year. In April of this year, Sen. Baucus and I introduced the ``Reversing the Expatriation of Profits Offshore'', REPO, Act to shut down these phony corporate inversions. Today, our REPO bill sits in the Care Act, awaiting Senate passage.  You would think that the ``greed-grab'' of corporate inversions would satisfy most companies, but unfortunately it is not enough. After these corporations invert and save millions in taxes, they then come back into the United States to obtain juicy contracts with the Federal Government.  Imagine the nerve. They create phony foreign headquarters to escape taxes and then use other peoples' taxes to turn a profit. That's really something, something that needs to be stopped.  Let's look at some of the numbers. Tyco had over 1700 contracts in 2001, worth over $286 million dollars. Accenture had contracts worth nearly $279 million. Ingersoll Rand left the United States for Bermuda, where it reportedly pays less than $28,000 a year to register its phony headquarters and receives $40 million in U.S. tax savings. Ingersoll Rand had more than 200 government contracts in 2001, worth over $12 million.  I was the first member of Congress to disclose that inverting corporations were receiving Federal contracts, back in March of this year. Out of respect for the committee system, I have waited for the committees with jurisdiction over government contracts to act on this issue. They have not. Instead, we have seen a series of politically-inspired amendments offered in Congress, all of which are ineffective, easily evaded, and, if enacted, could cost thousands of Americans their jobs. I then read in the paper last week that the Defense Appropriations conferees dropped one of those amendments, rather than try to rewrite it. I decided enough is enough. It is time for serious legislation on this issue.  Chairman Baucus and I offer our bipartisan RECAP bill as a compliment to our earlier REPO bill on corporate inversions. For future corporate inversions, our RECAP bill will bar the inverting company from receiving Federal contracts. For the inversions that have already gotten out before the REPO bill can be enacted, our RECAP bill will make them send back their ill-gotten tax savings by forcing them to lower their bids in order to obtain government contracts. The RECAP bill does not unwind Federal contracts that were legal when they were entered into. Therefore, unlike the other proposals, our RECAP bill will not throw thousands of Americans out of a job. The bill we submit today has only one objective: to permanently place corporate inversions on the endangered species list.  I am aware that many of my colleagues believe this measure is unnecessary because inverting corporations pay U.S. taxes on their profits from Federal contracts. It is generally true that profits earned from a Federal contract are taxable in the United States, but those profits are easily reduced when an inverter creates phony deductions through its inversion structure. For example, most inverted companies create phony interest deductions for interest that is fictitiously paid to the ``file folder'' foreign headquarters. Objections to this bill simply overlook the real insult to the American people: these inverted companies take other peoples' tax dollars to make a profit, but they won't pay their share of taxes to keep America strong. And that's just wrong.  So let me be clear to everyone developing or contemplating one of these inversion deals, you proceed at your own peril. We are not only going after thecorporate expatriation abuse, but also the abusers who seek big government contracts while skirting their U.S. tax obligations. I intend to pursue this issue throughout the remainder of this Congress and into the next.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3120       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Reclaiming Expatriated      Contracts and Profits Act''.     SEC. 2. RESTRICTIONS ON FEDERAL CONTRACTS WITH CERTAIN                    INVERTED ENTITIES.

(2) Mandatory reduction in contract evaluation of certain      entities.--       (A) In general.--If, during the restriction period for an      acquired entity to which this section applies, the entity      makes an offer in response to a solicitation of offers for a      contract with the United States, any officer or employee of      the United States evaluating the offer shall, solely for      purposes of awarding the contract, adjust the evaluation as      follows:       (i) In the case of a contract to be entered into with an      offeror selected solely on the basis of price, the price      offered by such acquired entity shall be deemed to be equal      to 110 percent of the price actually offered.       (ii) In the case of a contract to be entered into with an      offeror on the basis of two or more evaluation factors, the      quantitative evaluation of the offer made by such acquired      entity shall be deemed to be reduced by 10 percent.       (B) Application to certain contractors.--If a person other      than an entity to which this paragraph applies makes an offer      for a contract with the United States, and it is reasonable      to assume at the time of the offer that any portion of the      work will be subcontracted to such an entity, subparagraph      (A) shall be applied to such offer in the same manner as if      the person making the offer were such an entity.       (3) Application to related entities.--Paragraphs (1) and      (2) shall also apply during the restriction period for an      entity to--       (A) a member of an expanded affiliated group which includes      the entity, and       (B) any other related person with respect to the entity.       (b) Exceptions.--       (1) Presidential waiver.--The President of the United      States may waive the application of subsection (a) with      respect to any contract if the President determines that the      waiver is necessary in the interest of national security.       (2) Exception where no tax avoidance purpose.--       (A) In general.--This section shall not apply to a foreign      incorporated entity or an acquired entity if the entity      requests, and the Secretary of the Treasury issues, a      determination letter that the acquisition described in      subsection (c)(1)(A) with respect to the entity did not have      as one of its principal purposes the avoidance of Federal      income taxation.       (B) Procedures.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall      prescribe the time and manner of filing a request under this      paragraph.       (C) Stay of restriction period.--       (i) In general.--The restriction period with respect to an      entity filing a request under this paragraph shall not begin      until the Secretary of the Treasury notifies the entity that      it will not issue a determination letter with respect to the      request.       (ii) No action.--If the Secretary takes no action with      respect to a request during the 1-year period beginning on      the date of the request (or such longer period as the      Secretary and the entity may agree upon), the Secretary shall      be treated as having issued a determination letter described      in subparagraph (A). This clause shall not apply to a request      if the entity does not submit the request in proper form or      the entity does not provide the information the Secretary      requests to process the request.
