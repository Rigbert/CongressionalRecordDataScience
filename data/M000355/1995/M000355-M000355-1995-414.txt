 President, as most of my colleagues know, I have generally held the view that a President is entitled to the nominees of his choice, and the Senate's constitutional role of advice and consent is an inherently limited one.  At least until the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Robert Bork, it seemed to me that matters of ideology and politics should not figure prominently into the Senate's calculation when it reviewed a President's nominees. That standard may have been irrevocably transformed by the still-painful memories of the Bork nomination, but I think it still applies to less consequential presidential nominations.  Now that the White House is embroiled in yet another embarrassing battle over one of its nominees, it is attempting to raise the specter of unfair, ideologically driven opposition. Caught in a self-made web of contradictory statements and blatant falsehoods, the administration is now asserting that concerns about Dr. Henry Foster, its nominee for Surgeon General of the United States, are motivated entirely by moral conservatism, all engineered by the ``religious right.''  This smokescreen is an insult to the intelligence of every Member of this body.  Since when are ACT-UP and the National Organization for Women considered rightwing zealots? Yet both these organizations have serious reservations about Dr. Foster's record. I imagine that the Democratic Senators who have expressed misgivings about this botched nomination would be amused to hear themselves described as hard-line conservatives--agents of the religious right, no less. Yet that is what the White House wants us to believe.  Perhaps a little history is in order to set the record straight.  Ever since the President's nomination of Dr. Foster as Surgeon General, we have been subjected to yet another round of White House credibility bingo. When Senator Kassebaum first asked about Dr. Foster's abortion practices, the White House responded that he had performed only one. Then Dr. Foster announced that the number was ``under a dozen.'' Then 55 and 700 abortions popped up in public accounts of Dr. Foster's research on abortion-related procedures. Now, Dr. Foster has called bingo at 39.  One doesn't have to be against abortion to find it troubling that a nominee can't get his story straight about how many of them he has performed. After all, we're not talking about how many M&M's the man has eaten in his lifetime.  But the White House credibility game gets worse. Last weekend, it was disclosed that Dr. Foster also performed experimental sterilizations on severely retarded women. Leaving aside the serious issues of privacy rights and medical ethics which these incident raise, it is again troubling that neither the White House nor its nominee found them significant enough to mention at the outset. Perhaps they hoped no one would find out.  Mr. President, more is at issue here than one nominee. Because of this administration, we are struggling to salvage the public respect and dignity of the position of Surgeon General. Over the last 2 years, our Nation has been forced to sit and watch as this once-respected office was made an object of ridicule by the actions and remarks of the previous appointee. We cannot allow that to happen again--before or after a nominee is confirmed.  The White House just can't figure out that the business of the Surgeon General is public health--not politics. It is about fighting serious diseases and health risks, not promoting some leftwing, politically correct agenda. After the embarrassing controversies and ultimate removal of Dr. Joycelyn Elders, one would think the White House had finally learned its lesson.  But this is one administration that never quite seems to get it.The Nation's advocate for public health does not have a large staff at his or her disposal, or a large budget. Instead, the primary asset which a Surgeon General must use in protecting the public's health is the public's trust. If a Surgeon General is regarded as untrustworthy or ill-equipped by the public, that Surgeon General will be unable to perform his or her job in any meaningful way.  That is why the issue of credibility is so fundamental to this particular nomination. And on the question of credibility, this nominee has a serious problem--one which has been compounded by severe incompetence at the White House. As stated in a February 10 editorial in the New York Times:       Misleading statements by candidates for high position      simply cannot be condoned * * *. [T]he Administration put out      false information on the number of abortions performed by Dr.      Foster * * *. [B]oth he and the Administration made it look      as if their accounts were unreliable or designed to mask a      more troubling history.  Rather than admit the plain facts, the administration now wants to turn this nomination into a holy war over abortion. That is a gross distortion of reality and an evasion of the White House's responsibility for its negligent handling of this nomination.  [[Page S2667]] A number of Senators, newspapers, and outside interest groups--all of whom could be fairly characterized as pro-choice--have expressed deep concerns regarding this nomination, because of the credibility issue. In fact, I think it is fair to say that this nominee's problems have no more to do with abortion than Zoe Baird's problems had to do with antitrust policy.  We have had a number of controversial Surgeons General, some of whom I have disagreed with vehemently. But I have never seen, at least not since this administration, a Surgeon General who--by their own actions and statements--utterly squandered the public trust that is so essential to this job.  As I said at the outset, it is generally my approach to give the President wide latitude in appointing the various members of his administration. But with the facts that have come tumbling out about this nominee--many of them in direct conflict with each other--and given the excruciating history of the last Clinton administration official to hold this job, I must regrettably join with my colleagues who have called on the White House to withdraw the nomination immediately.  Every day that goes by will simply do more damage to a nominee who is, by all accounts, a decent and accomplished individual. What is more, every new report of withheld and false information will only serve to further erode the credibility of the office of Surgeon General, at a time when public esteem for the position is at an all-time low.  I think everyone in this body is ready to work with the President to find a new candidate for Surgeon General who would command the public's trust at the very outset. I may not agree with that new nominee on some issues, or even on most issues. But the point is to restore the integrity and dignity of the office, and that will require a nominee who comes untarnished by lapses in candor or allegiance to an extreme political agenda.  Playing the abortion card--as the White House is now doing so extravagantly--is merely a convenient dodge. The real issue is credibility: the credibility of the nominee, and the credibility of this administration.                          ____________________
