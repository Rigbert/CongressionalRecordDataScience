President, 2 weeks ago I came to this floor and spoke of an event that happened in the late 1930's in Montpelier, VT, the capital of Vermont, the city where I was born. I will recount that only briefly because we have the state of the Union message tonight. I hope it may be instructive to some.  In the late 1930's, then-President Franklin Roosevelt visited Vermont. To put this in context, during the Roosevelt landslide, President Roosevelt carried all States but two: the State of Maine and the State of Vermont. We were not a hotbed of Democratic action, Vermont.  The president of the National Life Insurance Co. of Vermont was standing on State Street. That building was directly across the street from where my family lived. He was standing next to my father, who was probably the lone Democrat in Montpelier.  President Roosevelt's car went by, and the president of National Life, an ardent, lifelong, fervent, and proud Republican, stood at attention, took his hat off, and held it over his heart as a mark of respect, as did other men on the street.  My father, who knew him well, chided him a little bit and said, ``I never thought I'd see the day you would salute Franklin Roosevelt.'' He turned to my father and said, ``Howard, I didn't salute Franklin Roosevelt. I saluted the President of the United States.'' As a child I remember that same gentleman repeating the story to me in my father's presence.  I mention this because he was also very proud of the fact that he was one of the ones who, as he said, voted for sanity when he voted for Alf Landon and not Franklin Roosevelt.  In a way it reflects a different time, but in many ways, a good time. The United States was, in the late 1930's, approaching our eventual entry into World War II, when we had to pull together. We also showed that we respected our institutions.  Tonight there will be some of us who agree and some of us who disagree with what President Clinton says in the state of the Union message. I hope that in expressing both our agreements and our disagreements we will resolve that there are three great institutions deserving our civil respect in this country: the institution of the Presidency; the institution of the Congress itself, which is demeaned when we do things that harm or degrade it; and the institution of the judiciary.  This great democracy exists because of the respect of its people for these three institutions. This great democracy is diminished if we, especially we in the Senate, diminish any of these. Debate, yes; but respect our institutions, also, yes.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
