Speaker, let me remind the leader that we passed the Dream Act through the House of Representatives. We brought it to the floor. We had a vote on it.  I know you and the Speaker said there was going to be a working task force on this issue, and it has been, I think, going on for nigh on to a month, but we haven't seen anything on the floor.  Mr. Leader, what I am saying is that I think we agree on this issue. Let us not confuse it with things on which we do not agree. Don't hold hostage these 800,000 young people who are positive--because if they are not positive they couldn't get into the Dream Act--I mean, they couldn't get into DACA. They had to have a sterling performance, be in school, be working, be in the Armed Forces. This is not a free pass to people.  We agree on this, I think. Maybe I am wrong on that, but it seems to me that we agree. The President seems to agree.  Wouldn't it be--as we have done in the past some bipartisan things, and we thought that was good for the institution and good for the American people to see us work in a bipartisan fashion. I think we agree on this issue.  Some of the things you want to attach to it, we are going to have disagreements on. Why don't we enact what we agree upon?  By the way, this has been pending for a long period of time, as opposed to your tax bill. I know you think we have had hearings on it, but, very frankly, that bill changed from Tuesday to Thursday of last week.                              {time}  1200  We think your bill is a pretty new bill and we would like to have hearings on it. But nevertheless, on DACA, I think we have an agreement. If you bring it to the floor, I think it will get a majority of the votes, a significant majority. I think it will get close to 300, if not over. So I would just urge my friend to see if he, as the majority leader--I was the majority leader--as the gentleman knows, I could bring a bill to the floor or I could keep it off the floor. This is a bill that ought to come to the floor. We ought to give peace of mind to these 800,000 of folks, and we ought to pass this bill and give the House an opportunity to work its will.  Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman does not want to say anything further, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________
