 Obviously, as one of the authors of this legislation, along with the distinguished Senator from Michigan, I would like to see the law in its present form. I just wanted to make sure, having spent enormous amounts of time with the Senator from Michigan and others to work out a compromise that allowed it to pass unanimously from this body. Had we not done otherwise, we would be in a position of having to make sure improvements made in this body were preserved within the legislation.
