 Chairman, I speak in support of the gentleman's amendment. I think he is raising a very important issue, but obviously, as you know, the issue goes well beyond propellers.  During the last 2 fiscal years, the U.S. Defense Department has spent at least $13 billion in American taxpayer money to buy goods and services from foreign suppliers. My strong hope would be that the gentleman and I and other people who are concerned about this issue can work together to put an end to these practices.
