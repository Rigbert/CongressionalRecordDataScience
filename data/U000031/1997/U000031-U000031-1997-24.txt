Chairman, I would just note in terms of the cost, the cost of this amendment is very small. For the most part these foghorns, many were installed in the early 1970s, have required virtually no maintenance at all. As far as I know, all of these ports, the lighthouses themselves are not manned, they are automatically timed as they should be, require very little maintenance, but in some cases, as is the case with the port at St. Joseph, a storm literally knocked the foghorn from the lighthouse itself. It went into the lake and efforts up to this point have not occurred where they would replace it. Whether it be in St. Joe or other ports that we list along Lake Michigan, I think this is a good exercise, a safe one that the Coast Guard is entrusted to do and at least in the near term, until the GPS technology is really readily on all boats, and maybe even required by various States and we have more boaters in Michigan than any other State in the Union, that this seems to be a prudent way of spending a few Federal dollars to make sure that safety is there for not only the boaters but their families, too.  Mr. Chairman, I urge that the House adopt my amendment.
