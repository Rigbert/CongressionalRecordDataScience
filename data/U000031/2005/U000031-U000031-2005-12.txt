Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Con. Res. 268. As a cosponsor of this resolution, I want to thank Mr. Doolittle, Mr. Boucher, and Mr. Goodlatte for their bipartisan leadership in introducing it. I also want to thank my chairman, Chairman Barton, and the House leadership for their willingness to expedite the consideration of this resolution on the floor this afternoon.  Today's Internet has resulted in a flow of information and commerce to the farthest reaches of the globe that was not imaginable even a little more than a decade ago. The Internet has evolved into the greatest global communication the world has ever seen, precisely because we have kept it free from the heavy hand of government control.  Currently, a private, nongovernmental, nonprofit organization called the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or ICANN, regulates and manages the Domain Name System under which IP addresses and registration of top-level domains like ``dot-org,'' ``dot-com,'' and ``dot-gov'' are assigned. ICANN operates under a contract through the Department of Commerce, U.S. Department of Commerce, and this relationship stems from the U.S. Government's original development and funding of what has become the Internet. While not everyone may agree with every decision that ICANN has made over the years, including myself, it is a model for Internet governance that has served the global Internet community quite well.  However, some countries have wanted to radically alter the way in which the Internet is governed. Rather than maintaining the current nongovernmental system and working to improve that successful model, these countries sought to scuttle ICANN and put the U.N. in charge. Putting the U.N.'s international governmental bureaucracy in charge of the Internet would have a disastrous consequence for the functioning and operation of the global free flow of information and commerce.                              {time}  1345  This resolution expresses the sense of Congress that it is incumbent upon the U.S. and other responsible governments to send clear signals to the marketplace that the current structure of oversight and management of the Internet's domain name and addressing service works and will continue to deliver tangible benefits to Internet users worldwide.  In the future, as well, the authoritative root server should remain physically in the U.S., and the Secretary of Commerce should maintain oversight of ICANN so that ICANN can continue to manage the day-to-day operation of the Internet's domain name and addressing system well and remain responsive to all Internet stakeholders worldwide and otherwise fulfill its core technical mission.  Mr. Speaker, last night I was very pleased to learn that our government's superb team at the World Summit on the Information Society in Tunisia successfully negotiated an agreement which was a complete vindication of the principles embodied in this very resolution before us today and is our government's position.  My understanding is that the agreement was unanimous among the more than 100 countries participating in the process, which means that the global consensus is now consistent with these principles as well. I want to especially commend our Secretary of Commerce, Carlos Gutierrez, originally from Michigan, I might add; Assistant Secretary for Communications and Information, Michael Gallagher; Fiona Alexander, the Office of International Affairs; and many others at the Commerce Department and the NTIA.  I also want to commend our Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice; State Department Ambassador David Gross; Richard Beaird; Sally Shipman; and many other wonderful, dedicated, hard-working staff members at the Department of State.  Mr. Speaker, to paraphrase from what Winston Churchill once said about democracy, it has been said that ICANN is the worst form of Internet governance, except all the others that have been proposed.  Mr. Speaker, I would urge all my colleagues to support this resolution.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
