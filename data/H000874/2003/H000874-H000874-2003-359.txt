 Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  As the gentleman knows, the Department of Defense authorization bill is a huge, huge piece of legislation, which includes providing for our national defense, fighting the war on terror, providing for the military and their families, particularly their quality of life. It is a very complicated, very important piece of legislation.  The gentleman is correct that some provisions were brought to some people's attention some 30 days ago, butthose two issues that the gentleman talks about, Mr. Speaker, are issues that have been worked on for a long time by a lot of people and have gone through regular order. Both the environmental issue and the personnel issue have been worked on by their respective committees, the Committee on Government Reform and the Committee on Resources, and have been voted on by those two committees to be sent out of those committees and put into the Department of Defense authorization bill.                              {time}  1400  I know that the chairman of the Committee on Rules is on the floor to make an announcement about the intentions of the Committee on Rules meeting and dealing with amendments and their submission to the Committee on Rules.  Again, it is very difficult to predetermine what type of rule would be written for the Department of Defense authorization bill, but I must say certainly this is vitally important to this country. We want to have a full and open debate about it, and I am sure the Committee on Rules will take a look at those amendments that will be offered and make a decision as to what kind of rule to write, but I do not think that will be done until next week.
