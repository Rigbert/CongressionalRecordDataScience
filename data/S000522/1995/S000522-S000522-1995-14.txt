Mr. Speaker, I would just like to ask my good friend, the gentlewoman from Maryland [Mrs. Morella], if she is aware that during the course of the Reagan and Bush years when the Mexico City policy was in effect that, yes, money went to foreign governments but it also went in record amounts to foreign nongovernmental organizations, including Planned Parenthood, Western Hemisphere, and other organizations that agreed to the Mexico City clause.  So it is untrue that the money will only be funneled through governments. It will also continue to go to nongovernmental organizations as it has in the past.
