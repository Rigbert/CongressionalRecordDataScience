President, I understand that it is the intent of paragraph 7 of section 171(b) of this legislation to require the Federal banking agencies, subject to the recommendations of the council, to develop capital requirements applicable to insured depository institutions, depository institution holding companies, and nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board of Governors that are engaged in activities that are subject to heightened standards under section 120. It is well understood that minimum capital requirements can help to shield various public and private stakeholders from risks posed by material distress that could arise at these entities from engaging in these activities. It is also understood and recognized that minimum capital requirements may not be an appropriate tool to apply under all circumstances and that by prescribing section 171 capital requirements as the correct tool with respect to companies covered by paragraph 7, it should not be inferred that capital requirements should be required for any other companies not covered by paragraph 7.
