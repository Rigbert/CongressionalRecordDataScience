On his point on the Pell grants, I remind us again that our States are suffering severe budget crises. Some people estimate as much as a $100 billion shortfall in our State legislative budget this year. Those State legislatures are going to have to look toward increasing revenue in their States at this difficult time because they have to balance their budget. Many of those States will do as my State has done--raise college tuition. At the same time, if we do not have Pell grants available to students under this appropriations bill presented to us, we are going to have kids say: I cannot afford to go to college. That is the wrong message for our students at this time in our Nation's history.
