President, when Senator Santorum introduced S. 3 on February 14, the leadership immediately placed the bill on the Senate Legislative Calendar, bypassing committee consideration of the bill. I rise today to support the motion to commit the bill for consideration by the Judiciary Committee.  Senators deserve the benefit of full consideration and vigorous debate before they are asked to cast a vote on such a significant and complicated issue. In fact, the Judiciary Committee has not had an opportunity to fully debate the pros and cons of this issue in a hearing since 1997. Since that time, we have welcomed many individuals to the Senate, and to the Judiciary Committee, who were not members of this body when the bill was last debated. In addition, since our last Committee hearing, there has been judicial review of similar legislation, including a Supreme Court decision, that should be fully vetted by the Judiciary Committee.  The committee referral process is there for a reason and we ought to respect it. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have repeatedly called for the Senate to follow these well-established practices.  For example, the distinguished senior Senator from Oklahoma complained in relation to the prescription drug bill last year: ``What happened to the committee process? Shouldn't every member of the Finance Committee have a chance to say, `I think we can do a better job?' Maybe we can do it more efficiently or better. No, we bypass the committee and take it directly to the floor.'' Other senior Republican Senators likewise complained about the need to involve Senate Committees and their expertise in development of prescription drug legislation, energy legislation and many other matters. Howquickly they have changed their position. I have some respect for the Senate's established procedures and processes. I urge all Senators to support the motion to commit this matter initially to the Judiciary Committee for a hearing and committee consideration. With Senator Hatch as the committee chair and with a majority Republican membership, I do not understand what the Republican majority fears by having fair proceedings before the committee before the Senate is asked to take final action.
