Speaker, last year the Congress, this Congress, authorized $25 billion to help the auto industry. But, as we know, an authorization is no good unless you appropriate the money.  The auto industry has to have access to that capital. This is not a bailout. It is a loan. It will be paid back, just like what happened with the Chrysler issue a couple of decades ago. And it impacts tens of thousands of workers across this country, certainly in the Midwest and around the balance of the country as well.  I appreciate the work of the leadership on both sides. They listened and they delivered. Our Michigan delegation, particularly with our leader, the Dean of the House, John Dingell, we worked together for weeks and weeks, many hours, and we used the strength of every Member, be it Republican or Democrat, to try and get the interests of the appropriators and the leadership to include it as part of this package, and they delivered.  We thank the administration, all of the Cabinet members. They understood the impact that would happen without the money being appropriated.  And we thank both candidates, Obama and McCain, for their support as well.
