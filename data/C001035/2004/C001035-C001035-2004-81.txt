President, I thank the Senator from Vermont for his cooperation on that last issue. As I have explained to my colleagues, the bill strikes a very delicate balance on the civil liberties board's power, and there were amendments to strengthen it as well as amendments to weaken it. I appreciate my colleagues' cooperation on both sides of the aisle. I am sure there will be more discussion of this issue as we go along.  I thank the Senator from Vermont and suggest the absence of a quorum.
