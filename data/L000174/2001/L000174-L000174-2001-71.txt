President, I urge all Senators to vote for Ms. Armijo.  I also thank both Senator Domenici and Senator Bingaman for working with the committee and with the President to help complete her confirmation. In fact, when she is confirmed, we will have confirmed as many district judges since July as we confirmed in the entire first year of the first Bush administration.  I thank the Senators for working together. It made our job much easier. Both Senators strongly support her.  I ask for the yeas and nays.
