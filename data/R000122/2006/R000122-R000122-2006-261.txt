President, the amendment proposed by the Senator from Iowa is my amendment. It would meet the supreme need of the military to reset, recapitalize, and rehabilitate $43 billion or more of equipment. The one big difference is that my amendment will pay for it. It will take the responsible step of actually paying to help our military. What I will use is dividend offsets. I will offer that later. But we have the responsibility to be responsible, not only give the troops what they need but pay for it so we do not increase the deficit. I hope we respond by supporting my amendment which takes care of the troops but does so in a responsible way by providing the resources to pay for this necessary equipment.
