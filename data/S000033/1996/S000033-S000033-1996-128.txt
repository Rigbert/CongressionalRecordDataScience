 Speaker, I know that there are some Members of Congress who believe they know everything about everything, but maybe once in awhile Members of this body might want to show a little humility. We are discussing a procedure which, as I understand it, is used in .01 of 1 percent of abortions, a situation which occurs only under the most tragic circumstances.  Day after day we hear from our conservative friends about how the big, bad Government should leave people alone and get off of the backs of people. I would urge our conservative friends to heed that advice on this occasion.  This is a tragic circumstance. Let the woman, let her family, let the physician make that decision, not the politicians in Congress.
