I would like to yield to Mr. Forbes.  And before doing so, I'd just remind our colleagues that a couple of years ago, Mr. Forbes and Mr. Lipinski brought a researcher from Brazil and a researcher from the United States who had another breakthrough, in this case cord blood, for type 1 diabetics. And some of the diabetics, virtually all except two, who had been given cord blood transplantation got off their insulin. They were no longer insulin dependent. And, again, so many people in this Chamber, so many people in the White House, and perhaps even HHS don't seem to get it; that the real progress, the real advances are being made in the realm of adult stem cells, and those kinds of advances are being made each and every day. And Mr. Forbes is the prime sponsor of some very, very important legislation dealing with adult stem cells, which I hope he will elaborate on.  I yield to Mr. Forbes.
