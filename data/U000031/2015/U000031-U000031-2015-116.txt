Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes.  I appreciate this amendment. It is a good amendment, and it builds on what a member of our committee, Bobby Rush, did in the full committee markup.  It directs the Secretary of HHS to perform outreach to Historically Black Colleges and Universities, to Hispanic-serving institutions, Native American colleges, and rural colleges to ensure health professionals from unrepresented areas are, in fact, aware of research opportunities under this act. It is a real complement to what was done before.  Mr. Rush, as I remember, grabbed me on the House floor literally during our markup process and was very supportive of a number of amendments through the night. In fact, we worked on those amendments and included them in the manager's amendment. I offered them the very next morning, and they were accepted on a voice vote. This is clearly a bipartisan amendment. It is essential that we include everyone as we find cures for all.  Ms. Jackson Lee and I have worked together on a number of health-related issues over the years, on date rape drugs and other issues that really strike to the heart. So I appreciate her value in adding this amendment, and I very strongly support it.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Fattah).
