Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 would prohibit the gruesome and inhumane procedure known as partial-birth abortion that unfortunately we are now all too familiar with. An abortionist who violates this ban would be subject to fines, a maximum of 2 years imprisonment, or both. This ban includes an exception for those situations in which a partial-birth abortion is deemed necessary to save the life of the mother.  After two Presidential vetoes, this ban will finally become law and the performance of this barbaric procedure will come to an end. I am pleased to bring this conference report, which is the product of a House and Senate conference meeting held earlier this week, before the House. This bill, nearly identical to this conference report, passed the House of Representatives this summer by a 282 to 139 vote, and language identical to H.R. 760 passed the House last year by a 274 to 151 vote.  A partial-birth abortion is an unsafe procedure that is never medically necessary and should be prohibited. Contrary to the claims of partial-birth abortion advocates, this brutal procedure remains an untested, unproven, and potentially dangerous procedure that has never been embraced by the medical profession. As a result, the United States Congress, after receiving and reviewing extensive evidence, voted to ban partial-birth abortions during the 104th, 105th, and 106th Congress, and at least 27 States enacted bans on this procedure. Unfortunately, the two Federal bans that reached President Clinton's desk were promptly vetoed.  In June 2000, the United States Supreme Court struck down Nebraska's partial-birth abortion ban, which was similar, but not identical, to bans previously passed by Congress. In Stenberg v. Carhart, the court concluded that Nebraska's ban did not clearly distinguish the prohibited procedure from other more commonly performed second-trimester abortion procedures. The court also held, on the basis of the highly disputed factual findings of the district court, that the law was required to include an exception for partial-birth abortions deemed necessary to preserve the health of a woman.  The conference report's new definition of a partial-birth abortion addresses the court's first concern by more clearly defining the prohibited procedure than the statute at issue in Stenberg. The conference report also addresses the court's second objection to the Nebraska law by including extensive congressional findings, based upon medical evidence received in a series of legislative hearings, that, contrary to the factual findings of the district court in Stenberg, partial-birth abortion is never medically necessary to preserve a woman's health, poses serious risk to a woman's health, and, in fact, is below the requisite standard of medical care.                              {time}  1130  The conference report's lack of a health exception is based upon Congress' factual determination that partial birth abortion is a dangerous procedure that does not serve the health of any woman. The Supreme Court has a long history, particularly in the area of civil rights, of deferring to Congress' factual conclusions. In doing so, the Court has recognized that Congress' institutional structure makes it better suited than the Judiciary to assess facts based upon which it will make policy determinations. Indeed, the Supreme Court has recognized that, as an institution, ``Congress is far better equipped than the Judiciary to amass and evaluate vast amounts of data bearing upon complex issues.'' As Justice Rehnquist has stated, the Court must be ``particularly careful not to substitute its judgment of what is desirable for that of Congress or its own evaluation of evidence for a reasonable evaluation by the legislative branch.''  Thus, in Katzenback v. Morgan, while addressing section 4(e) of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the Court deferred to Congress' factual determination that section 4(e) would assist the Puerto Rican community in gaining nondiscriminatory treatment in public services, stating, ``It is not for us to review the congressional resolution of the various issues it had before it to consider. Rather, it is enough that we are able to perceive a basis upon which the Congress might resolve the conflict as it did.''  Similarly, in Fullilove v. Klutznick, when reviewing the minority business enterprise provision of the Public Works Employment Act of 1977, the Court repeatedly cited and deferred to the legislative record the factual conclusions of Congress to uphold the provisions as an appropriate exercise of congressional authority.  The conference report's critics cite to Boerne v. Flores for support of their argument that the Court will strike this ban down. Yet Boerne addressed Congress' authority to determine the scope of rights protected by the Constitution, not the issue of whether Congress' factual determinations should be overruled by a court.  In Boerne, the Court explicitly confirmed that Congress' factual conclusion should be granted great weight, stating that it is for Congress in the first instance to determine whether and what legislation is needed to secure the guarantees of the 14th amendment and its conclusions are entitled to much deference, and that this judicial deference in most cases is based not on the state of the legislative record Congress compiles but on due regard for the decision of the body constitutionally appointed to decide.  Boerne does not stand for the proposition that Congress is bound to reach the same factual conclusions as the trial court did in Stenberg, particularly when Congress has reviewed extensive credible evidence, evidence that is more complete than the evidentiary record facing the Stenberg trial court, that directly contradicts the trial court's conclusions.  Substantial evidence presented and compiled at extensive congressional hearings, much of which was compiled after the District Court hearing in Stenberg and thus not included in the Stenberg trial record, demonstrates that a partial birth abortion is never necessary to preserve the health of a woman. The vast majority of partial birth abortions are performed on normal babies during normal pregnancies. Obstetricians who regularly treat patients suffering from serious medical complications during pregnancy or serious life-threatening fetal abnormalities utilize established, safe medical procedures, not the partial birth abortion procedure.  Previous bills that were nearly identical to this conference report enjoyed overwhelming support from Members of both parties precisely because of the barbaric nature of the procedure and the dangers it poses to women who undergo it. Implicitly approving such a brutal and inhumane procedure by choosing not to prohibit it will further coarsen society to the humanity of not only newborns but all vulnerable and innocent human life. Fortunately, we are only weeks if not days away from putting an end to partial birth abortions. I urge my colleagues to vote for this conference report.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
