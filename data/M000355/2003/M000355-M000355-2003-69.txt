 President, today the Senate will resume consideration of the VA-HUD appropriations measure. We were unable to reach an agreement for finishing the bill, and it is unclear how much further progress we can make on this bill. At this time, we will continue with the bill this afternoon and make a determination later today as to whether the Senate can complete action on this important measure.NOTICEIf the 108th Congress, 1st Session, adjourns sine die on or before November 21, 2003, a final issue of the Congressional Record for the 108th Congress, 1st Session, will be published on Monday, December 15, 2003, in order to permit Members to revise and extend their remarks.All material for insertion must be signed by the Member and delivered to the respective offices of the Official Reporters of Debates (Room HT-60 or S-410A of the Capitol), Monday through Friday, between the hours of 10:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. through Friday, December 12, 2003. The final issue will be dated Monday, December 15, 2003, and will be delivered on Tuesday, December 16, 2003.None of the material printed in the final issue of the Congressional Record may contain subject matter, or relate to any event that occurred after the sine die date.Senators' statements should also be submitted electronically, either on a disk to accompany the signed statement, or by e-mail to the Official Reporters of Debates at ``[emailÂ protected]''.Members of the House of Representatives' statements may also be submitted electronically by e-mail, to accompany the signed statement, and formatted according to the instructions for the Extensions of Remarks template at http://clerkhouse.house.gov/forms. The Official Reporters will transmit to GPO the template formatted electronic file only after receipt of, and authentication with, the hard copy, and signed manuscript. Deliver statements to the Official Reporters in Room HT-60 of the Capitol.Members of Congress desiring to purchase reprints of material submitted for inclusion in the Congressional Record may do so by contacting the Office of Congressional Publishing Services, at the Government Printing Office, on 512-0224, between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. daily.By order of the Joint Committee on Printing.                                                                ROBERT W. NEY, Chairman.  Under a previous order, beginning at 4:30 p.m. today, the Senate will begin 1 hour of debate prior to the vote on invoking cloture on the FAA reauthorization bill. It is hoped that cloture will be invoked and that the Senate can complete its work on the conference report today. Again, that vote is expected around 5:30 this afternoon.  Also later today, the Senate will conduct a 1-hour debate on the issue of jobs and the economy. There will be two Members from each side of the aisle engaged in that debate, and all Senators are encouraged to be present for the discussion.  As a reminder, two cloture motions were filed with respect to the nomination of Thomas Dorr to be Under Secretary of Agriculture for Rural Development. Those cloture votes will occur tomorrow morning, and Senators will be notified of the exact timing of those votes.  Finally, on behalf of the majority leader, I remind everyone this is expected to be a busy workweek in the Senate. There are a number of important conferences that have been completed and others that will be finished shortly. These legislative matters will be scheduled as soon as they are available so the Senate may adjourn at the earliest possible time. All Senators should adjust their schedules for a busy session as we approach what will very likely be the final week of this session.                          ____________________
