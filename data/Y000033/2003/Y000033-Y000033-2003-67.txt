Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time.  I have the greatest respect for the chairman, and I had hopes that the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Bereuter) would accept the suggestion of the chairman. I will say this respectfully, that sometimes in this game Members learn when to hold them and fold them.  But I also would support the gentleman's amendment. This business of archaeology is crucial. It has been proven that these two centers, one in the district of the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Boyd) and one in the district of the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Bereuter), are doing jobs beyond what is required by the Park Service. This is driven by OMB; I do not believe it is driven by the committee.  I hope Members understand it is important that we have this service available to us as professionals. These two agencies, these two centers, have done an outstanding job not only for the Park Service but for the military branches, for other branches within the government, and they are called upon because of their expertise.  This is a small amount of money. Like I said, the committee has done their job, and I understand the restrictions which they are under. I urge the committee to consider what the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Bereuter) and the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Boyd) have suggested. This is important enough to ensure that these monies are funded for and not cut back. I believe in a lot of privatization, but archaeology is a system that has to be addressed by professionals, and these people are truly professionals.
