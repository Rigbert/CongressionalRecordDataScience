Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Well, it is Groundhog Day again here on the floor of the House of Representatives. Much of the speech we just heard actually was read 3 years ago on the floor. Three years ago, we were in a different place. There was a new pending rule. There was tremendous uncertainty whether this would be an undue burden on individuals--no, in the end, it isn't at all--on individual farmers--no, except for the largest farms over 6,000 acres--or on forestry. And no, it has not been a problem, and I have a heavily forested State. So there was tremendous uncertainty, and the House Republicans moved this legislation. Of course, it went nowhere in the Senate.  Here we are 3 years later. We have been living under the permit and general permit process, and I am going to look forward to hearing some very specific problems, denials, or litigation from the other side--not maybe, there should have, could have, would have, might be stuff, because I am not aware of any. And we have asked.  Now, sure, my Farm Bureau supports this. Hey, whatever. That is great. Others say sure, but it is not anything that we really have on our priority list.  But, you know, here we are.  Fires are burning in the West. We don't have time for a hearing or a bill to get money to the Forest Service and the Interior Department, but we do have time to do pretend legislation that isn't going anywhere in the Senate again to deal with a problem that doesn't exist.  Why doesn't it exist? Well, first of all, all individuals and applications by farmers are exempt under a permit. You follow the label, you are fine. No one can sue you.  Then you have, if you are a bigger applicator, if you are like someone who is paid to apply pesticides and herbicides, you have to give notice under a general permit. That is all you have to do. You file it online. Not too burdensome. Most applicators, I think, have access to a computer.  Is there an approval process? No. Is there a waiting period? No. You just file it, and then you are exempt from litigation if you follow the label.  So why would we have this? Well, there have been a few instances of problems, and we want to be able to track where those problems originated. So if you have a general permit out there for an industrial application or a commercial application of a certain herbicide and it starts showing up downstream with dead fish, you know probably where it came from and you can trace it back and you will probably find out that they violated the label.  Now, why did this come about? Well, for a real reason: 92,000 steelhead were killed in southern Oregon because an irrigation district chose to use a powerful herbicide in its irrigation canals and they didn't follow the label in terms of the waiting period for it to degrade. They ran the water through and killed 92,000 fish. That is where this all started.  So we are not saying they can't use it, they can't apply it--you know, they can--but we want to know where it is coming from. In that case, it was pretty easy to track back. The trail of dead fish led right back to the irrigation canal.  In other cases of impaired waters--and I have a long list in my State, and I am sure there are other States--we are not quite sure how they got impaired or where they are being impaired, and we would have a better indication if we merely have this notice requirement.  Now, there will be a lot of fear-mongering here today: ``You won't be able to use stuff on your lawn.'' ``You will be liable.'' ``It won't be available.''  No, not true.  ``Farmers won't be able to apply their own herbicides and pesticides.''  No, not true.  ``Very large farms, commercial applicators will not be able to use it.''  No, not true, but they will need to put a notice online they are using it, and they are supposed to follow the label.  I really find it unfortunate that we are spending time on this instead of getting some additional allocation of funds to fight fires in the West. My State is burning up. Washington State is burning up. California is burning up. Other intermountain States are burning up. The Forest Service and BLM are going to run out of money this week or next.                              {time}  1445  They have got all their other budgets to pay for fighting fires because they can't stop fighting the fires. They can't stop.  But Congress has a bipartisan, bicameral bill agreed to by the President. There is nothing else like that in Washington, D.C., with the partisan activity around here, the conflict always between the House and the Senate.  Here is a bill agreed to by Democrats and Republicans--52 Rs, 52 Ds on the bill. Here is a bill that is pending in the House and the Senate, bicameral--it is also bipartisan on that side--and it is supported by the President.  But we can't find time to take action on that and get the Forest Service and BLM money this week because we aredoing stuff like this about pretend problems that don't exist and scaring people who use these products legitimately. It is a very sad waste of our time.  With that, I reserve the balance of my time.
