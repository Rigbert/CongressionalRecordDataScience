Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the bill. I would like to urge our colleagues to do everything possible to expedite this bill. The money for the Department of Defense that we provide in this bill is offset from the Department of Defense budget. There is no new money here. It is basically a transfer within the department's funding. But if we cannot get this done expeditiously, the operation and maintenance accounts, the training accounts for all of the services, are going to be severely affected.  I just urge our colleagues, however they intend to vote on the bill, help us expedite the consideration of this bill so we do not have to stand down any flight training or stand down any training on the part of any of the services, or affect any of the operations and maintenance, because that is what will happen if we do not get this funding resolution, this supplemental appropriations bills, through here quickly.
