President, I rise today to recognize the achievement of Western Coventry School of Coventry, Rhode Island, which was honored earlier this year as a U.S. Department of Education Blue Ribbon School.  It is a highly regarded distinction to be named a Blue Ribbon School. Through an intensive selection process beginning at the state level and continuing through a federal Review Panel of 100 top educators, many of the very best public and private schools in the nation are identified as deserving of this honor. These schools are particularly effective in meeting local, state, and national goals. However, this honor signifies not just who is best, but what works in educating today's children.  Now, more than ever, it is important that we make every effort to reach out to students, that we truly engage and challenge them, and that we make their education come alive. At the Western Coventry School, a kindergarten through sixth grade school, parent-teacher cooperation, through an award winning Parent Teacher Association (PTA), has helped to improve the quality of education. The school has instituted a mentoring program for at-risk youth and has made concerted efforts to ensure that students with special needs receive the assistance they require. In addition, teachers have taken an aggressive role in developing new approaches to teaching reading and math.  Mr. President, Western Coventry School is dedicated to the highest standards. It is a school committed to a process of continuous improvement with a focus on high student achievement. Most importantly, Western Coventry recognizes the value of the larger community and seeks its support and involvement. This school and community are making a huge difference in the lives of its students.  Mr. President, the Blue Ribbon School initiative shows us the very best we can do for students and the techniques that can be replicated in every school to help all students succeed. I am proud to say that in Rhode Island we can look to a school like the Western Coventry School. Under the leadership of its principal, Barry Ricci, its capable faculty, and its involved parents, Western Coventry School will continue to be a shining example for years to come.                          ____________________
