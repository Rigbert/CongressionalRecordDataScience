Speaker, remember when a little child would say to you, ``I am going to hold my breath until I turn blue in the face?'' That is exactly what is going on with the politicians here in Washington. Can you imagine for a minute that we are going to shut down the Federal Government, that our political egos are that colossal?  Think about this for a second: Tomorrow we are going to send 800,000 Federal workers home without pay, while Members of Congress still receive their paychecks. That is fundamentally unfair and wrong.  H.R. 2281, which I introduced with Senator Boxer of California, says no budget, no pay. If this train wrecks, then Speaker Gingrich and the train crew and all of the rest of us will not be paid until the train is back on the track and running again.  Mr. Speaker, Members of Congress should start focusing a little more on solving problems, rather than creating them, with no budget, no pay.  Mr. Speaker, I am sorry you left the Chamber. I am sorry that Speaker Gingrich is not here. My request to him is put whatever else is on the calendar aside. Pass no budget, no pay, and this crisis will be over.                          ____________________
