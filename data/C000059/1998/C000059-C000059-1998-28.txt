 Here we go again. We have been studying the Salton Sea now for well over 30 years. There have been many reports, many studies, many millions of dollars on how to save the Salton Sea. Today finally we are going to establish the groundwork to do exactly that; that is, to save the sea, the birds, the fish, and most importantly, we are going to save an opportunity for people to visit the Salton Sea. Not too many years ago more people visited the Salton Sea than they did Yosemite, on an annual basis, it is so close to so many millions of Americans in the southwest United States.  I as a young man, boy, would go waterskiing at the Salton Sea. It was probably the best waterskiing in all of California, and certainly, I think, throughout the southwestern United States. It is unfortunate that people do not have that same opportunity anymore, or at least not with the quality of water as it exists today.  The other gentleman from California, our esteemed friend from Imperial County, mentioned the New River and how polluted it is, and what is going on there. It is certainly horrible. We have a chance today. We have this rule. Sonny Bono certainly dreamed of this day. I think he is looking down on us right now wondering what we are going to do finally.  Sonny, we are going to pass this rule. Furthermore, we are going to pass this bill, and we are going to vote against the Miller-Brown substitute and move ahead.
