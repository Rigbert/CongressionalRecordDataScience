 What the Baucus amendment does is allow Members to put together that bipartisan effort that would encourage an approach that is within Medicare, with defined benefits, based on real marketplace choices, so there would be cost containment. I thank Senator Conrad and Senator Baucus for emphasizing the two key messages of this party.  First, our message of the last decade, which is that fiscal responsibility is paramount. One does that with the focus on debt reduction. Second, that we can have a handful of well-targeted investments in our country's future. That is what the Baucus amendment does. I am very pleased to be associated with both Senators' efforts.
