President, I am honored to be able to welcome my friend and great leader in our religious community in Rhode Island, Rabbi Leslie Gutterman. Rabbi Gutterman is the rabbi at Temple Beth-El, Providence, RI. He has been leading his congregation since 1970. He has become a leader in our community not just within the Jewish community but within all the communities in Rhode Island.  The Talmud says the Torah gives honor to those who study it. Rabbi Gutterman has studied it and has been honored for this study. He honors us by his wisdom, his wit, his compassion, his generous spirit, in all he endeavors throughout our community.  It is indeed an honor to be here today to welcome him, to hear his words of prayer and reflection, and to go forward knowing that he is not only a friend but also a powerful force in our State for tolerance and decency. I thank him for being here today.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
