 We tried to expand the background check, even through a compromise offered by Senator Manchin, but that effort failed. I remember that when the vote on the background check failed, the New York Daily News put the photos of the Newtown victims on the front cover. There were 20 young children, ages 6 and 7, and their educators, and the headline read: ``For Shame.''  It is time for us to stand up. It is time to force elected representatives to take action. We must expand background checks. We must make sure that the government can stop a gun from being sold to a known or suspected terrorist, and that is not too much to ask.  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.
