 President, I am pleased that today we offer a bipartisan energy tax incentives package for the 108th Congress. I have been joined in this introduction by not only Ranking Member of the Finance Committee, Senator Baucus, but also the Chairman and the Ranking Member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Senators Domenici and Bingaman as original sponsors of the Energy Tax Incentives Act of 2003, which we are introducing today.  This bill is substantially similar to the Energy Tax Incentives Bill which won overwhelming support on the floor of the Senate last April. It continues to represent a balanced package of alternative energy, traditional energy production and energy efficiency incentives. As we move forward towards a Mark-up of an energy tax bill by the Finance Committee, this bill represents a starting point. We hope over the next few weeks to be able to incorporate some of the new and improved versions of some of the provisions that we developed over the many months of conference during the last Congress.  I remain committed to diverse sources of energy and electricity, to include the production of electricity for wind and agricultural waste nutrients. In addition this bill reflects my continued interest in biodiesel and provisions to support small ethanol producers. I look forward to working with the Sponsors to craft a responsive bipartisan energy tax package.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 597       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
