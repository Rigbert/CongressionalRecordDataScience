Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleague and fellow co-chair of the bipartisan Congressional Ukraine Caucus, Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, to honor the dignified and illustrious life of Ukrainian democratic leader, Ivan Drach. A poet, author, politician, and lover of liberty for Ukraine, Ivan was a true leader who brought forward the edge of freedom for his nation. On June 19, Ivan passed away in Kyiv at the age of 81.  He first gained prominence with his poem, ``Knife in the Sun,'' and then later in 1988 helped found and led the ``Popular Movement for Ukraine,'' popularly known as Rukh. After his election to the Ukrainian Parliament, the Verkhovna Rada in 1990, he worked tirelessly to shine a light on wicked crimes of Russian-imposed communism, as well as to find commonality between all of Ukraine's ethnicities.  It is during these times that we look to his example of humble, yet powerful leadership. May we remember his sacrifice, and find inspiration in his unflagging commitment to a free and open Ukraine, and his pursuit for liberty.              Ivan Drach--Giant of Ukraine's Independence       Ivan Drach, a giant in Ukraine's movement to independence,      died June 19 in a Kyiv hospital at the age of 81.       Drach, a long-time member of the Writer's Union of Ukraine,      was a respected and award-winning poet and screenwriter. With      his poem ``Knife in the Sun,'' he first came into national      prominence during ``The Thaw''--a brief period of political      and cultural liberalization under then Soviet leader Nikita      Khrushchev.       Twenty years later, Drach again came to national and      international prominence as a political activist during the      Soviet Union's Perestroika period in the late 1980s and then      during the early years of Ukraine's independence. The numbers      of young men from Ukraine lost in the Soviet Union's war in      Afghanistan and the handling of the Chornobyl explosion led      to Ukraine's civil society becoming restless with directives      from what was euphemistically known as ``the center''      (Moscow) and were increasingly distrustful of leaders in the      Kremlin.       In what began in late 1988 as an initiative of the Writer's      Union of Ukraine, a year later had become a national      movement. In September 1989, at the founding congress of the      ``Popular Movement of Ukraine'' (Narodniy Rukh Ukrainy), a      grassroots opposition movement known worldwide simply as      ``Rukh,'' Drach was elected chairman and an Mykhailo Horyn, a      political dissident who had survived the Soviet Gulag, was      elected head of Rukh's secretariat. The pair combined focused      vision with determined leadership and guided the      organization, and civil society, through a tumultuous period      in history.       As Rukh's membership grew throughout Ukraine other      prominent dissidents, as well as representatives of major      ethnic and religious groups in Ukraine assumed leadership      roles. However, Drach, although often understated in his      actions, was the recognized leader. With the sensibility of a      writer, Drach was eloquent in his expression of Rukh's goals      and ideals, particularly emphasizing the inclusivity of Rukh.      He always spoke in terms of ``people of Ukraine,'' and not      ``the Ukrainian people.''       A recognized tool in the USSR's system of authoritarian      governance was routinely to create friction between      nationalities in order to weaken opposition. In contrast,      Drach and Rukh recognized and spoke to the common interests      of all citizens of Ukraine--Ukrainians, Russians, Poles,      Jews, Tatars, and others. At the founding congress of Rukh,      reflecting upon the principles of Rukh, Drach underscored the      importance of multi-ethnic respect within Ukraine stating,      ``Jews should live better and feel more comfortable in      Ukraine than in Moscow, Leningrad, New York, Tel-Aviv, and      Jerusalem.'' While at the helm of Rukh, he actively supported      the decision by Rukh's Council of Nationalities to help fund      the gathering of the Crimean Tatar Mejlis, the first to be      held in Crimea since the group's mass deportation by Stalin      in 1944.       In March 4, 1990, in the first politically contested      elections in Soviet Ukraine, 111 candidates, including Drach      and others from the Democratic Bloc, a political coalition      that included the Helsinki Watch Group, and the Green Party,      as well as Rukh, were elected to the Verkhovna Rada      (Parliament), breaking the Communist Party's monopoly on      political power.       The day after the election, March 5, Drach and other      leaders of Rukh, a number of whom, like Drach, were members      of the Communist Party, drafted and signed a statement      calling for Ukrainian independence, denouncing the Communist      Party and calling on the Communist Party to take      responsibility for the 1932-33 genocidal famine (the      Holodomor), deportations, repressions, the policy of      Russification, economic decline and ecological disasters.       In early August, 1991, Drach received international      attention at the time President George H.W. Bush came to Kyiv      to deliver a speech to the Verkhovna Rada in which he      cautioned Ukraine against ``suicidal nationalism.'' (Later      named the ``Chicken Kiev'' speech by the late New York Times      columnist Bill Satire).       Before President Bush arrived in Ukraine from Moscow, at a      Rukh rally in central Kyiv, Drach surprised the crowd and the      media by anticipating Bush's message and repudiating it in      advance. ``I am afraid that Bush has come here as a messenger      for the center . . . We are not a sample of Soviet culture .      . . . Our culture is the culture of Ukraine, the culture of      Ukrainians, Russians who live in Ukraine, Jews, Poles.      Ukraine will become independent despite the center. Like the      United States that cast off the British Empire, Ukraine will      cast off Moscow's Soviet Empire.''       One of Drach's most important contributions was his role      during the week between August 19, 1991, and August 24, 1991.      In response to a coup in Moscow during the early morning      hours of August 19, under the direction of Drach, Rukh      immediately issued a statement condemning the leaders of the      coup and the effort to return the USSR to hardline Communism,      away from glasnost and perestroika. Rukh feared a reverse in      the course of freedom that had been advanced. Rukh called for      a special session of the Verkhovna Rada to be held      immediately in order that a strategy be developed to distance      Ukraine from the coup in Moscow. Behind the scenes, the      leaders of Rukh pressured the members of the Communist      majority in parliament to agree to a vote for Ukraine's      independence on August 24, the date of the special session.      Then, by an almost unanimous vote, parliamentarians passed      Ukraine's Declaration of Independence conditioning the      declaration upon the vote of the people of Ukraine in a      national referendum that was held on December 1, 1991.      Ukraine was the only republic of the Soviet Union to      condition its independence on a vote of the people.       Drach continued to lead Rukh until the autumn of 1992, and      continued to serve in the Verkhovna Rada through several more      election cycles.       Born on October 17, 1936, in Enlightens, Kyiv Oblast,      Ukrainian SSR, Ivan Fedorovych Drach is survived by his wife      Mariya and daughter Maryana, who is the Director of the      Ukrainian Service of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty in      Prague. His son Maksym, who had worked as a member of a      medical team during the aftermath of Chornobyl, and later      suffered health consequences as a result, passed away in 2009      at the age of 44.       Although offered a prominent state burial, Drach declined      and was buried in his native village, next to his parents and      his son.       --Robert A.
