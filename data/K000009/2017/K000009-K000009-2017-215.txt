Speaker, today I rise to place in the Record a very important story from The Columbus Dispatch newspaper. It focuses on Steve Mnuchin, President Trump's nominee to be Treasury Secretary, and it raises issues of deep concern.              [From the Columbus Dispatch, Jan. 29, 2017] Trump Treasury Pick Mnuchin Misled Senate on Foreclosures, Ohio Cases                                   Show                 (By Alan Johnson and Jill Riepenhoff)       President Donald Trump's nominee for U.S. treasury      secretary was untruthful with the Senate during the      confirmation process, documents uncovered by The Dispatch      show.       Steve Mnuchin, former chairman and chief executive officer      of OneWest Bank, known for its aggressive foreclosure      practices, flatly denied in testimony before the Senate      Finance Committee that OneWest used ``robo-signing'' on      mortgage documents.       But records show the bank utilized the questionable      practice in Ohio.       ``The guy is just lying. There's no other way to say it,''      said Bill Faith, executive director of the Coalition on      Homelessness and Housing in Ohio.       The revelation comes with the committee's vote on whether      to confirm Mnuchin's nomination, currently scheduled for      Monday night.       Barney Keller of Jamestown Associates, who represents      Mnuchin, was asked to comment for this story but did not      respond before deadline. Jamestown Associates is a Washington      political consulting and advertising firm that represented      Trump in his campaign.       ``Robo-signing'' is the informal term for when a mortgage      company employee signs hundreds of foreclosures, swearing      they have scrutinized the documents as required by law when      in fact they have not.       ``OneWest Bank did not `robo-sign' documents,'' Mnuchin      wrote in response to questions from individual senators,      ``and as the only bank to successfully complete the      Independent Foreclosure Review required by federal banking      regulators to investigate allegations of `robo-signing,' I am      proud of our institution's extremely low error rate.''       But a Dispatch analysis of nearly four dozen foreclosure      cases filed by OneWest in Franklin County in 2010 alone shows      that the company frequently used robo-signers. The vast      majority of the Columbus-area cases were signed by 11      different people in Travis County, Texas. Those employees      called themselves vice presidents, assistant vice presidents,      managers and assistant secretaries. In three local cases, a      judge dismissed OneWest foreclosure proceedings specifically      based on inaccurate robo-signings.       The Dispatch found more than 1,900 OneWest foreclosures in      the state's six largest counties from 2009 to 2015.       Carla Duncan, a social worker from Cleveland Heights, was      snared by OneWest's robo-signing machinery.       On her way out of town for a short trip in 2010, Duncan      stopped by her home to get her mail and found a note from a      field inspector for her mortgage company saying that her      house was vacant and was going to be boarded up.       ``It wasn't vacant. I was living there,'' Duncan said.      ``There were curtains on the windows. The radio was playing      and the dog was there.''       What Duncan didn't know at the time was that OneWest had      begun foreclosure proceedings on her three-bedroom home even      though she was up-to-date on her payments. OneWest refused to      accept a loan modification approved by a previous lender that      had been purchased by OneWest, and it wanted to substantially      increase Duncan's interest rate and monthly payment and add      late fees. The company also put a lock box on a separate      rental property she owned in Cleveland.       After hiring former Ohio Attorney General Marc Dann, waging      a five-year court battle and filing personal bankruptcy,      Duncan was finally able to get the foreclosures dismissed and      keep her home and rental property. She said the experience      was devastating.       ``It's almost like being raped, like being emotionally      violated,'' Duncan said. ``It got to the point that I was      afraid to open my own door.''       Court records show that Duncan's mortgage was robo-signed      by Erica Johnson-Seck, vice president of OneWest's department      of bankruptcy and foreclosures. From her office in Austin,      Texas, Johnson-Seck robo-signed an average of 750 foreclosure      documents a week, according to a sworn deposition she gave in      a Florida case in July 2009.       Under oath, Johnson-Seck acknowledged that she did not read      the documents she was signing, taking only about 30 seconds      to sign her name. To speed up the process, Johnson-Seck said      she shortened her first name on her signature to just an      ``E.'' She said in the deposition that OneWest's practice was      to review just 10 percent of the foreclosure documents for      accuracy.       Dann, who now specializes in representing clients who have      problems with banks and other lenders after he was forced to      resign as attorney general nearly 10 years ago, said      Mnuchin's businesses were a ``major offender'' in problem      mortgages. Dann said Mnuchin's firms were known for dual      tracking (pursuing foreclosures simultaneously as they      allegedly worked with homeowners), fabricating documents and      other tactics ``that caused unbelievable devastation in      people's lives.''       In 2010, federal laws were changed, enabling borrowers      victimized by lenders to sue them. Dann said he worries that      Mnuchin, as treasury secretary, would quietly work to repeal      reforms, collectively known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street      Reform and Consumer Protection Act.       That appears to be the case.       ``It has been over six years since the passage of Dodd-     Frank and it seems like an appropriate time to review all of      the regulations from Dodd-Frank to understand their impact on      the market, investors, small businesses and economic      growth,'' Mnuchin said in a written answer to the Senate.       U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, grilled Mnuchin at his      recent hearing and in follow-up written questions.       ``Mnuchin profited off of kicking people out of their homes      and then gave false testimony about his bank's abusive      practices,'' Brown told The Dispatch. ``He cannot be trusted      to make decisions about policies as personal to working      Ohioans as their taxes and retirement.''       Faith, the homelessness coalition director, said      foreclosure practices by Mnuchin's companies and others like      them ``created havoc.''       ``People were bamboozled into signing these mortgages,''      Faith said. ``We watched this train wreck happen. It's been      devastating, not only to the people who got caught in this      kind of scheme, but also to people who happened to live in      the neighborhood . . . . It's scary that he's going to be      treasury secretary.''       The Dispatch analysis showed thousands of Ohio homeowners--     including 245 in Franklin County--found themselves in      OneWest's crosshairs when they defaulted on their loans, the      majority of them with high interest rates. Many mortgages had      terms that housing and financial experts view as predatory:      prepayment penalties, interest-only loans and no-money-down      loans.       In addition to OneWest, which was born in 2009 from the      collapse of subprime mortgage giant IndyMac, Mnuchin's      banking group also acquired Financial Freedom, a subsidiary      of Lehman Brothers that went bankrupt because of its toxic      mortgage portfolio. The firm specialized in loans to senior      citizens cashing in on their homes' equity.       Mnuchin was labeled by critics at the time as the      ``Foreclosure King.''       Of the nearly four dozen foreclosure cases filed by OneWest      in Franklin County in 2010 that were analyzed by The      Dispatch, a quarter were filed within three years of the      homeowner taking out the loan, typically a red flag that      there was a problem with the mortgage terms and/or vetting      the borrowers.       Thirteen of the borrowers had double-digit interest rates,      ranging from 10 percent to 17.31 percent, largely because of      adjustable-rate mortgage terms.       In the cases in which the houses were sold at an auction,      two-thirds ended up in the hands of the federal government,      which had backed those loans. Collectively, more than $4      million was due on those loans.       Only seven borrowers were able to get a loan modification,      even though former President Barack Obama's administration      had been pushing since 2009 for lenders to help Americans      keep their homes by lowering interest rates and, in some      cases, the principal balance.       Mnuchin does have supporters, including the American      Bankers Association, which sent a letter to the Senate      committee saying Mnuchin's ``public statements as well as his      career in finance bring us optimism with regard to the      outlook for public policies focused on growth and      prosperity.''       Grover Norquist, head of Americans for Tax Reform, released      a statement supporting Mnuchin's nomination, in part because      of his stated intention to roll back some of the Dodd-Frank      legislation: ``Mr. Mnuchin has made it clear that reforming      the Dodd-Frank Act will be his `number one priority on the      regulatory side' once he becomes secretary of the treasury.''
