 President, I join Senator Glenn in offering an amendment to Section 1003 of the bill.  Section 1003 establishes a new account at the Department of Defense [DOD].  The new account is called the ``Defense Modernization Account.''  When I was first told about the Defense Modernization Account, I was very concerned.  The alarm bells went off.  Right away, I thought I could see another slush fund like the infamous $50 billion M accounts in the making.  Subsection (B)(3) is what really set me off.  This is what it says:       Amounts credited to the Defense Modernization Account shall      remain available until expended.  To me that sounds like a permit to open a laundry operation to break down the integrity of appropriations.  That sounds like another honey pot where unlimited amounts of no-year money could be stashed for a rainy day.  Like the M accounts, I fear this money could be used to cover cost overruns and other unauthorized projects beyond the purview of Congress.  Clearly, this is not the intended purpose of section 1003.  But in my mind, it is a potential problem. Bureaucrats at the Pentagon might abuse the new authority.  I also think section 1003 may be inconsistent with various parts of title 31 of the United States Code and most particularly the M account reform law enacted in November 1990.  I am afraid that section 1003 might be used to undermine strict procedures for closing appropriation accounts that were established by the M account reform law.  That law set up expired accounts.  When the period of availability of an appropriation ends--as fixed by annual appropriation bills, those moneys are placed in an expired account--where they remain for 5 years.  While in the expired accounts, the fiscal year and appropriation account identity must be maintained.  At the end of 5 years, accounts must be closed and all remaining balances are canceled.  It is important to maintain the integrity of appropriation accounts.  And it is important to respect the period of availability set in the appropriations bills.  But my concerns are not incompatible with the purpose of the Defense Modernization Account.  The Defense Modernization Account is supposed to encourage the Defense Department to save money and to use savings to meet critical modernization shortfalls.  The periods of availability in expired accounts plus the availability provided in annual appropriations bills means that procurement moneys--the primary focus of section 1003--are available for 8 years or more.  That's more than enough time to identify savings and reallocate them into top priority modernization programs--with congressional approval.  Senator Glenn has crafted an amendment that addresses all of my concerns.  His amendment brings the Defense Modernization Account into line with current law.  Above all, his amendment protects the integrity of the appropriations accounts and all moneys involved.  I thank Senator Glenn for making such an important contribution to financial management at the Pentagon.                          ____________________
