NELSON of Florida. The Senator is correct. As a matter of fact, it is something the Federal Government has been doing for over two decades in the Veterans Administration. The Veterans Administration buys prescription drugs in bulk. As a result, the cost to veterans is $7 per month for their prescription drugs. Using the law of economics in the private free marketplace, buying drugs in bulk, you can negotiate the price down. But when this body passed the prescription drug bill 3 years ago, Medicare, the Federal Government, was prohibited from purchasing in bulk and negotiating the price down.
