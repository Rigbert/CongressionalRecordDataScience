 President, this is one more example of the bipartisan cooperation we have had on this bill. I hope my colleagues will look at this amendment and that it will not become controversial and we can adopt it. When the overall bankruptcy legislation becomes law, we will have appropriate protection, beyond the protection we give to creditors and debtors in this legislation, for the needs of patients as well.  We should not have these traumatic experiences that happened in ResedaNursing Home in San Fernando Valley and the over 100,000 patients who were in jeopardy in the example of the Senator from New Jersey.  I yield the floor.
