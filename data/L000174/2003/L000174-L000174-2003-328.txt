I know he wishes to speak. As soon as he is prepared, I will, of course, yield the floor.  Last night we were able to move five of President Bush's judges, to get them confirmed in a matter of about 20 or 30 minutes. I thank those who worked with me to make that possible. Senator Lott from the other side of the aisle was very helpful in moving those forward. Senator McConnell was very helpful in moving those nominees forward, as well as a number of Senators on this side of the aisle. Senator Harry Reid, Senator Tom Daschle worked with me, along with Senator Lott and Senator McConnell, to move them. So we were able to move them, actually, in a matter of 20 or 30 minutes.  I mention that because there was a consensus on these nominees. They were not sent up here to divide us but, rather, they were the rare ones who were sent to unite us.  I mention that because we have now confirmed 145 judges for President Bush. We stopped three. This stands in tremendous contrast to the time of President Clinton, when the Republican leadership stopped 60 of President Clinton's nominees.  For very good reasons, because of their ideology, their obvious intent to politicize the courts, we have stopped three. So we have confirmed 145 and stopped three. Those who are worried that we have politicized this, I would point out, we have stopped three. When President Clinton was there, they stopped 60, usually because one Republican, one, would object. So they were not allowed to have a hearing or vote.  I see my friend from West Virginia, and I yield the floor. I thank the Senator from West Virginia for his usual courtesy.
