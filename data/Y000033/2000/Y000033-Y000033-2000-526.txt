Mr. Speaker, I am proud to introduce legislation for the establishment of a new national museum in Washington, DC, celebrating the contributions of the Jewish people to the United States and to the world generally. The museum will be called the National Museum of Jewish Heritage. It will profile the role played by Jews in the aesthetic, cultural, and intellectual history of Western Civilization.  The new museum will offer to Jews and non-Jews alike a source of knowledge and information on a people whose contribution to a world we all share has been remarkable, and remarkably disproportionate to their numbers. The museum will offer to all an accessible doorway into the many facets of the Jewish legacy.  Currently there is no museum in Washington, DC, and few, if any, elsewhere in the world, dedicated to presenting the full range of contributions made by Jews over the ages, and the relationship of those contributions to the civilization of which we all partake on a day to day basis.  There is, of course, the U.S. Holocaust Museum in Washington, DC. It is however, devoted only to a most taumatic and anguished period of the Jewish experience. The new museum would offer a balance to that uniquely dark narrative. I believe that it would indeed be unfortunate for the rich Jewish history to be defined by that tragic chapter alone. The new museum will see that that does not occur. It will do so by profiling the many happy chapters of that history. It is a history to revere, and to learn from, and this new museum will allow this to happen in the Nation's Capital.  The new museum will accomplish its important goals by creating galleries that sweep from the archaeological artifacts of antiquity to contemporary painting and sculpture, to music, literature, cinema, sports, science, military, education and, in general, to the world of creative ideas. The museum would mount the kinds of exhibits that reflect the diverse involvement and attainments of Jews across history and geography--from Einstein and Salk to Freud and Marx.  The proposed legislation makes it clear that this will be a private initiative. No appropriated funds are being nor will be authorized. The role of the Government is highly limited. The President will appoint members of the Board of Directors. Honorary members will be appointed by congressional leaders. Other national museums may lend works or art and other objects to the new museum. The National Park Service will assist the museum in finding a site in the Nation's Capitol, which could be provided by the U.S. Government. The legislation will, however, offer the recognition and appreciation of the Government of the United States.  I am proud of the contributions made by the Jewish people to the civilization we all enjoy. I am all the more proud to sponsor this legislation.                          ____________________
