 Let me conclude this amendment debate by saying how important it is for our States that are struggling today with $75 billion or $80 billion in debt, that we do everything we can to get the economy going in a true economic stimulus package to provide funds for those States to assure they do not lose people off health care, that their education systems are intact, and they have the ability to deal with their budget crisis and we don't add to it with fiscally irresponsible tax cuts that preclude them from being able to provide the services that are so critical today.  I ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment.
