Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Let me respond to two points.  First of all, I will tell my colleague that there would be no shortage of people who would be President of General Motors if they paid at $100,000. We could get a president of General Motors, perhaps not a very good one.  There would be no shortage of players to play on the Washington Wizards for $100,000. Now, the fact is, the gentleman and I both know they would not win any games, ever, but there would be five players on the court.  So I would make that point. We are not recruiting anybody if we paid them zero.  Let me make another point. The gentleman talks about former Presidents. President James Carter, who was relatively wealthy when he came to the office, that is correct, but there is a perfect example of someone who has used his time in a voluntary way to make life better for his fellow citizens here and around the world.  So I understand the gentleman's point, and people do different things. Both President Bush and President Reagan did make a lot of money in speeches. Maybe this President and future Presidents will do the same. But I think we ought to, nevertheless, appropriately compensate them relative to what the rest of us in government make.  Because if an individual had the responsibility that the President of the United States has, they would be paid millions and millions of dollars in the private sector for comparable responsibility. I do not think we ought to do that. That is not appropriate, the gentleman is right. People should not seek this to become millionaires.
