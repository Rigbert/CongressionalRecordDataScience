 Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Porter) for his thoughts, but I respectfully disagree. And here is the bottom line: the bottom line is that as a result of taxpayer-funded support, very important and wonderful drugs are developed. But the problem, Mr. Chairman, is that millions of Americans who paid for the research to develop those drugs cannot afford the product.  I think it is totally responsible for the United States Government to say to the private companies we are giving you important research. But in return, we have to make some guarantees to the public that we are going to serve the public interests in terms of controlling the prices that are charged. I think that that is something that the taxpayers of this country deserve.
