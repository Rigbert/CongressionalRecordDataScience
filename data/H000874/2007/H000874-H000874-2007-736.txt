Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  On Monday, Mr. Speaker, the House will not be in session so that Members can join with their communities in observance of the birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr.  On Tuesday, the House will meet at 12:30 p.m. for morning hour debate and at 2 p.m. for legislative business. We will consider several bills under suspension of the rules. You will be getting notice of those, hopefully, by the end of the day. We will consider several bills under suspension. There will be no votes before 6:30 p.m., as has been our practice.  On Wednesday and the balance of the week, the House will meet at 10 a.m., although let me say to my friend that I may well be requesting again, as I did for today, unanimous consent that we meet at 9 on Friday. It has historically been the practice to wait until about May, the middle of May, when we get into heavy legislative business, to meet at 10 on Fridays if we were in on Fridays. My view is, however, and I want to say to all the Members, that it will be my intent to make every effort possible to have us adjourn on Fridays prior to or no later than 2 p.m. in consideration of Members' need to get back to their districts where they have events that are going on where they need to be. I want to tell my friend that we will, therefore, quite possibly ask for unanimous consent to come in at 9 rather than 10 next Friday.  In addition to other Suspension Calendar business, and all suspension bills, as I said, will be announced later today, the House will consider H.R. 5, a bill to cut in half the interest rates on student loans; and H.R. 6, a renewable energy bill.  In addition to that, I want to give notice to the House, and I have discussed this with Mr. Blunt and have discussed it with the leader, Mr. Boehner, that Nancy Boyda of Kansas is introducing a bill which will provide that Members who commit felonies while Members of Congress and in the course of their duties will be precluded from receiving pensions.                              {time}  1430  If they are receiving pensions, they will have those pensions discontinued.  That is obviously legislation which I think is appropriate. We have passed similar legislation that the majority proposed in the past. I believe this will pass with bipartisan support.  Mr. Boehner and I and Mr. Blunt all agree we need to look at this carefully, even though it has already passed, and so we have talked to Ms. Slaughter from the Rules Committee, and we will speak to Mr. Dreier and give him notice. I have not personally spoken with Mr. Dreier. But they will be considering this legislation on Wednesday, and we expect to have this bill on the floor next Friday.  In addition, it is quite possible again the House Administration Committee, and I am perhaps anticipating Mr. Blunt's question, has jurisdiction over the Page Board, we will also have, we hope, on the floor on Friday legislation that will deal with the Page Board, oversight of the page system, and the various procedures we can put in place to make sure that our pages are protected and treated with the respect and care that they deserve and that their parents expect.  I tell my friend, that is the anticipated schedule for next week. As I said, we will make every effort and it will be my very strong commitment to the Members that every effort will be made to adjourn on Friday no later than 2 p.m.
