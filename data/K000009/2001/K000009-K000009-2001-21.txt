Speaker, this week, while our troops are in the field in the Middle East and Central Asia, President of the United States George Bush issued an executive order to expand the United States' Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and I emphasize the words ``petroleum reserve,'' to maximize, as the President said, long-term protection against oil supply disruptions. And again I emphasize the word ``oil.''  With all due respect to the President, at this time in our country's history, I think he is moving in exactly the wrong direction. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve's name should be changed to the Strategic Fuels Reserve. And in lieu of what is happening, we should begin to move our country in a new, nonpetroleum direction. We have to go beyond the petroleum age.  Under the President's executive order, our Energy Secretary, Spencer Abraham, was ordered to increase the current reserve from its level of 545 million barrels, because it is not filled up, to 700 million barrels, calling the reserve an important element of our Nation's energy security. Indeed, having a strategic fuels reserve is in the Nation's security interests. However, the President needs to think about moving America toward energy independence, not keeping us wedded to the petroleum age.  And let me just reference this chart. If we look back to the 1980s, the amount of petroleum that is used annually has slowly been rising. The share of petroleum that comes from foreign nations has been rising until this year, and last year we will be over half. One-fifth of it comes from the oil-producing nations of the Middle East, one-fifth; and the rest from places like Nigeria, not exactly known for its love of democracy, and other points on the globe.  I think that the President is half-right. The President is right to try to assure energy security here at home, but the way he is doing it is wrong.  Now, some Americans have gotten the right message. In fact, this week in Maryland, and I would like to enter into the Record a story from the Washington Post, a mom-and-pop Chevron station in Laurel, Maryland, became the first station in that State, and only the second one in the mid-Atlantic region of our country, to offer E85, a mixture of gasoline and alcohol fuel distilled from corn or other grains. They understand we have to move America beyond the petroleum age, using ethanol as one of the most important new fuels of the future.  In this article they talk about aiming to reduce petroleum consumption and greenhouse gas emissions by boosting the use of ethanol fuels; and they are selling the gasoline up there in Maryland for $1.33 a gallon and they figure, if nothing else, it will bring more consumers to the part of the business that turns a profit.  Arianna Huffington wrote a story in the L.A. Times today. She also got the right message. She has a can-do spirit for America. She basically says, ``We can all make simple adjustments to wean our country from our dependence on foreign oil.'' She says, ``In practice, what are we really being asked to do in this war as individual Americans? We are being asked to shop till we drop, we are being asked to eat out, and to visit Disneyland.  ``Given our ability to play hardball with nations that harbor terrorists is going to be seriously compromised by our foreign oil habit, shouldn't we be doing everything we can to reduce that dependence starting, say,'' she says, maybe yesterday? ``America cannot go on consuming 25 percent of the world's oil while being only 5 percent of the global population.''  Then, in The New York Times this week, Thomas Friedman says the predicament the free world faces is due to oil money and the fact that we are so wedded to those systems; and, in fact, oil being the major reason for those economies of the Middle East even being able to survive.  The New York Times a month ago had an editorial and I quote, entitled ``Reconsidering Saudi Arabia. Washington's embrace of the Saudi royal family dates back to the era of Franklin Roosevelt. It has always been primarily about oil.''  And then Seymour Hersh, in the October 22 issue of The New Yorker, says the following: `` `The United States is hostage to the stability of the Saudi system,' a prominent Middle Eastern oil man reported to me. `The war was declared by bin Laden, but there are thousands of bin Ladens. The fabulous military machine America has is completely useless to the enemy you face.' ''  The article goes on, ``The Saudi regime,'' he says, `` `will explode in time. If they do a similar operation in Saudi Arabia has they did in New York, the price of oil will go up to $100 a barrel, more than four times what we pay today.' ''  I commend to my colleagues our bill, H.R. 3099, which asks that the President exchange 2,100,000 barrels from thecurrent petroleum reserve and convert it to the purchase of ethanol and biofuels in order to move America toward energy independence. It is time.  Mr. Speaker, I submit for the Record the article entitled ``Hoping to Fuel Demand With Supply,'' which I referred to earlier:               [From the Washington Post, Nov. 15, 2001]                   Hoping to Fuel Demand With Supply                           (By Anita Huslin)       For nearly a decade, state and federal governments have      been buying fleets of vehicles capable of running on a      cleaner-burning mixture of gasoline and ethanol.       Few of the vehicles, however, have ever had a drop in their      tanks because the blend is available at just 101 fuel      stations nationwide--most of them in the Midwest.       Yesterday, a mom-and-pop Chevron in Laurel became the first      fuel station in Maryland and only the second in the mid-     Atlantic region to offer E85, a mixture of gasoline and an      alcohol fuel distilled from corn and other grains. The blend      has been touted as an alternative to foreign oil and as being      gentler on the environment, though the environmental claim      has been debated.       Maryland Energy Administration officials hope to open E85      pumps in Annapolis, Gaithersburg and Baltimore in the next      year.       At a pump festooned with red, white and blue flags, beaming      auto manufacturing representatives and farmers applauded as      the first state vehicle--a standard-issue white Ford Taurus--     was filled with the blend of 85 percent ethanol, 15 percent      gasoline.       ``If you want people to use the fuel, you've got to provide      the stations where they can buy it,'' said Richard F. Pecora,      deputy secretary of the Maryland General Services      Administration.       Aiming to reduce petroleum consumption and greenhouse gas      emissions by boosting the use of alternative fuels, the      federal Energy Policy Act of 1992 required that vehicles      capable of running on alternative fuels make up 75 percent of      state government fleets.       Under a U.S. program to encourage development of such      vehicles, auto manufacturers have received credits for      producing ethanol-burning cars, trucks and sport-utility      vehicles. Those credits allow the companies to build more      vehicles that get lower average gas mileage. But because      ethanol fuel is sold in just 20 states and, consequently,      many alternative fuel vehicles are burning regular gasoline,      the program has actually increased pollution, a U.S.      Department of Transportation draft study concluded this year.       ``Given the slow rate of growth in the alternative fuel      infrastructure, it does not appear likely that any energy      conservation and environmental benefits will be realized      through .  .  . 2008 unless strong financial incentives are      put in place,'' the report said.       After talking for more than a year with oil companies, none      of which expressed any great interest in opening an E85 pump      in Maryland, officials came upon Kevin Falls' Chevron Service      Center.       It's a modest two-bay repair and fuel station just up the      road from Fort Meade and the National Security      Administration, two federal installations with growing fleets      of alternative fuel vehicles. Officials lined up a U.S.      Energy Department grant that would cover the cost of      installing the pump, so Falls agreed.       He is selling E85 for the same price as premium gasoline--     $1.33 a gallon--and figures that if nothing else, it will      bring more customers to the part of his business that turns a      profit.       ``The more people you get at the pump, the more jobs we get      in the [repair] bays,'' Falls said. ``I figure this'll only      help with that.''       Jobs are what farmers from the Maryland Grain Producers      Association see in Falls's E85 pump. They tout the fuel as a      way to boost demand for corn, soybeans, and other grains.      ``It's going to mean money in our pockets with an increase in      grain prices,'' said Donnie Tennyson, association president.       The group is looking into building the East Coast's first      ethanol production plant in Maryland, in the same way it has      been done in the Midwest. There, farmers have raised money to      build and operate plants that convert their corn, soybeans      and other crops into ethanol, which is then mixed with      gasoline and sold at service stations primarily in Illinois,      Iowa and Minnesota.       Officials estimate that as many as half a million vehicles      in the Washington region can run on an ethanol fuel mix. Only      one other station in the region sells E85--the Navy Annex      Citgo in Alexandria, near the Pentagon.       With the opening of the E85 pump in Laurel, local auto      dealerships said they will begin notifying customers who have      bought alternative fuel vehicles. They also said their      salespeople will make the fuel option part of their pitch.       ``If you have the motivation and the fuel, we have the      vehicles,'' said Michael Paritee, manager of alternative      fuels and government sales for General Motors. Several of its      vehicles--including the 5.3-liter Suburban, Tahoe, Yukon and      Yukon XLS and S-10 pickups--can run on E85.       There is some debate over the environmental benefits of      E85. Advocates tout its ability to reduce carbon monoxide      emissions, but opponents note that when ethanol is blended      with gasoline, the fuel evaporates at a higher rate,      producing smog. Environmentalists also say distilling corn      starch into ethanol is an energy-intensive process, often      involving coal.       Even so, local groups welcomed the opening of the Laurel      pump.       ``I'd like to think that 10 years from now our farmers will      be growing a lot of our energy,'' said Michael Heller, of the      Chesapeake Bay Foundation. ``Not just corn and barley, but      warm-season grasses that can soak up nutrient pollution, then      be harvested and turned into fuel.''                          ____________________
