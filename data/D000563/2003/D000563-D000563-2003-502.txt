I say to my friend and colleague from Oregon, I think it is a disservice to the medical profession of America not to concede there is a medical malpractice insurance crisis affecting some specialties in some States. I do not argue that point. I have seen those doctors face to face. Maybe my colleague from Oregon has, too.  It is interesting, I might say to my friend from Oregon, as I listened carefully to the explanation on the other side as to how to deal with this crisis, I waited in vain to hear any suggestion that insurance companies should be brought in as part of this conversation. To the other side of the aisle it appears the only thing we need to do is to make sure the victims of medical malpractice have a limitation on what they can recover in court, no matter whether we are dealing with children or elderly people, no matter how serious the injuries. I do not think that is a complete and honest approach to an extremely complicated problem.
