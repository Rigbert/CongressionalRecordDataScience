 President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session to the consideration of Executive Calendar No. 23; that the nomination be confirmed and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; that any statements thereon be printed in the Record; that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action; and that the Senate return to legislative session.
