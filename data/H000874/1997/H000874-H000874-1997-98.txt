Speaker, I thank my friend, the gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. Obey], the distinguished ranking member of the Committee on Appropriations, and I rise to congratulate the gentleman from Louisiana [Mr. Livingston], the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations, and the ranking member.  Clearly, for those of us who represent large numbers of Federal employees, September 30 is always a traumatic day for them to face. In fact I think both sides of the aisle have agreed that we are not going to put them at risk as we move through the appropriations process trying to get our work done on time, and I just wanted to come to the floor to say that I, for one, and I know all of the other Members on both sides appreciate the fact that we are moving on when nobody intends to shut down the Federal Government, to do our business, to resolve our differences in an orderly and productive fashion. I thank the chairman and I thank the ranking member for this time.
