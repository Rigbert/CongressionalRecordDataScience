Margaret's Episcopal School, that not only excels in academics but is also distinguished on the football field. The St. Margaret's football team won the 2009 California Interscholastic Federation, CIF, Small Schools State Championship for the fourth consecutive year. In the championship game, St. Margaret's defeated Ontario Christian 12 to 6.  The football team is an outstanding example of hard work, determination and perseverance. After 4 straight years of being on top, they have certainly earned the title ``Champions.'' The members of the winning football team include:  Matt Duenes, Houston Agan, James Murayama, Mike Schmall, Andrew Torok, Fernando Almejo, Brennan Smith, Joey Sego, Jon Gencarella, Chris Adams, Chris Bauer, Chase McClure, Scott McGowan, Davis Edwards, Mark Olivier, John Carpenter, Adam Miyawaki, Nolan Lynch, Byran Flores, Leo Garcia, Chase Steuber, Jake Dappen, Jeff Askin, Brett Nicholas, Freddy Valencia, Will Findiesen, Matt Kloss, Connor McClure, Max Carpenter, and AJ Rovsek.  The team is led by Head Coach Harry Welch; Assistants Rod Baltau, Sean Coen, Hiram Johnson, Jay Noonan, Brent Ward, and Butch Ward.  It is an honor to represent such a fine group of young people with a strong dedication to teamwork and academics. I know each one of them will treasure the memories of their fourth championship season, and I commend them, and the entire St. Margaret's community, for this truly great achievement.                          ____________________
