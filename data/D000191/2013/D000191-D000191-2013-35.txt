 Wow, the Republicans just figured out that their irresponsible activities of shutting down the government for political purposes have led to some unpopular things, like closing the national parks. They saw it on television. So, okay. They're going to try to put a bandaid on the national parks.  What about other natural resource agencies? I'm pleased that you're going to do something for the parks. But what about Fish and Wildlife? What about all of our national wildlife preserves? What about the U.S. Forest Service campgrounds, BLM campgrounds?  Today I just met with the chief of the Forest Service. He is suspending all activity for emergency recovery and repairs and anything for restoration on the Rim fire in California and on other fires throughout the West. And he has suspended all activities on any possible potential salvage. This impact is even bigger.  Then what about someone who has just turned 66 and wants to go down and get their Social Security benefits? Well, they can sign up, but they can't get it because they can't process it. What about somebody who is due for treatment at the National Institutes of Health? They're dying of cancer. Well, sorry. They're not taking any more patients.  So you want to put a bandaid on a few things that are getting on television, a few things that sound good. But you don't want to back off your unbelievably irresponsible, politically motivated shenanigans here about a full closing down of the government of the United States, which is having a real impact to accomplish ends you couldn't accomplish in the last election.  We don't have a system where one-half of one branch of the government gets to dictate to the Senate and the President of the United States and the courts. And that is what you are trying to do.
