 President, the bottom line is that this tax on Social Security income is as high as it is because, in 1993, all except one Senator now serving on the other side of the aisle imposed a tax in the first place. I believe we should have an opportunity to repeal this tax. However, as my colleagues are aware, the revenue from this tax goes into the Medicare hospital fund without other changes in Medicare. Repealing this tax would bankrupt the Medicare trust fund. We should consider this in light of other Medicare legislation, and it ought to be done in the Finance Committee.  This language is not germane to the measure now before the Senate.
