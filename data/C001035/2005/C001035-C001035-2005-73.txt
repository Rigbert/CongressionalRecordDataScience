President, I am pleased to introduce today the teacher tax act of 2005, which I am offering along with my good friends, Senator Warner and Senator Landrieu. Our bill increases to $400, and makes permanent, the tax deduction available to teachers who incur out-of-pocket expenses to purchase classroom supplies. It would also allow this above-the-line deduction for expenses related to professional development.  This bill builds upon the $250 tax deduction established by legislation we authored in 2001, which became law as part of that year's tax relief package.
