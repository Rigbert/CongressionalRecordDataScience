Mr. Chairman, let me say very closely that the DeLay amendment does not force the accreditation council to change its accreditation standards, but it does say that in determining who can receive Federal benefits, the Federal Government will not be guided by an organization that discriminates against institutions which do not offer, quote, experience with induced abortion as a standard part of their medical training.  Mr. Chairman, this amendment would deny doctors the right to choose not to do abortions. This is a very heavy-handed push by the abortion industry because fewer and fewer residents and members of the medical profession are going into the abortion industry. This is a heavy-handed effort to use the power of the Federal purse to coercion, to force, to pressure.  Yes, there is some opt out language, but this would mainstream the killing of unborn children on demand for any reason whatsoever, and to coerce these individual residents and their residency programs to be a part of that. This is a part of the abortion industry's push. I hope that this amendment gets rejected.
