President, the Senator has the right to make his whole argument, and I don't want to interfere with that. Unfortunately, because this is something that we have had no hearings on, we haven't had the discussions in the appropriate committees--Intelligence, Armed Services, and Judiciary--we are somewhat limited in opposition. I will not cite numerous examples of situations which I think would make clear that we do not have the limitations. I know the concern the Senator from Arizona has. I don't question his concerns. But in open session, I am restrained from going into some of the very specific things where concerns he raised have been responded to in the law by our country. I will not. But that is why I would suggest something like this to the Armed Services Committee which has the ability to go easily into closed session, and often does. It would be able to look at it and make a recommendation to the Senate.  Our committee would be able to make a recommendation to the Senate, which can be done relatively quickly, and the Intelligence Committee.  I would feel far more comfortable voting on something like this if these various committees not only had a chance to look at it but that President Bush's administration--the Attorney General, the Director of CIA, the Secretary of Defense--would have the opportunity to let us know their views on it. I would feel far more comfortable with that. I worry that we may run into the situation where--all of us have joined together in our horror at these despicable, murderous acts in New York and at the Pentagon--we do not want to change our laws so that it comes back to bite us later on.
