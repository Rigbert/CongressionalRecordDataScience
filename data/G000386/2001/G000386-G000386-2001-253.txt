 I think in the proper time and place, such as on the Work Opportunity Training Act or things of that nature, it would be a good thing to do and for us to take a look at it. I will be glad to take a look at it. But at this point I am going to have to ask the amendment be defeated.  I raise a point of order, but it needs to be defeated because of the changes it makes in the tax rates. We are working on a tax bill. We have a well-balanced, well-crafted bipartisan bill. We have had 40 votes on amendments. There is too much effort, regardless of the good faith of this person in offering a good idea, to stall, stall, stall. I think we have to get this bill passed and get tax relief to the American people.  I raise a point of order. The point of order is against the amendment under section 305(b)(2) of the Budget Act.
