President, a year ago, when we were considering this same bill, the language of the bill that was presented to us had a pilot program that would temporarily look at privatizing five commissaries. We elected not to do that.  We had an amendment at that time with 25 cosponsors, and it was not necessary to actually have a rollcall vote, and it overwhelmingly was passed that we would not do that until we had a study of DOD with an assessment by GAO on privatization. That has not happened yet. The initial report came out from GAO and it is negative on having the privatization language at this point.  I reserve the remainder of my time.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Ayotte). The Senator from Rhode Island.
