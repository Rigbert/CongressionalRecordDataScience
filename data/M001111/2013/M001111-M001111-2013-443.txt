 Senators have been very good in helping us work through our list on both sides. We will have some more amendments to be offered in a unanimous consent in a short while once we work through these four.  Again, I would ask all Senators to please work with the leader on your side, Mr. Sessions on the Republican side, and myself. We need to know which amendments you have to have votes on so we can start letting Senators know where we are going to end up here. I would ask everybody to continue cooperating with us. I appreciate everybody who has been working so hard.                           Amendment No. 366
