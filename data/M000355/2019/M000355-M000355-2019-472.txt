 Burr, Mr. Graham, Mr. Inhofe,         Mr. Risch, Ms. Collins, Mr. Barrasso, Mr. Rubio, Mr. Isakson,         Mrs. Blackburn, Ms. McSally, Mr. Blunt, Mrs. Capito, Mr. Cruz,         and Mr. Wicker):  S.J. Res. 59. A joint resolution expressing the sense of Congress on the precipitous withdrawal of United States Armed Forces from Syria andAfghanistan, and Turkey's unprovoked incursion into Syria; read the first time.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                              S.J. Res. 59       Whereas the Islamic State of Iraq and al Sham, better known      by its acronym ISIS, flourished in the chaos unleashed by the      civil war in Syria and at one point controlled extensive      territory in Iraq and Syria;       Whereas ISIS murdered thousands of innocent civilians,      including Americans, and sought to ethnically cleanse the      territory it controlled of religious minorities;       Whereas the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, which is      composed of Kurdish and Arab fighters, remains an essential      United States partner in the successful campaign to destroy      ISIS' so-called ``caliphate'';       Whereas, backed by the United States and United States      allies, the Syrian Democratic Forces liberated millions of      Syrians from ISIS' terrorist regime, and sustained      approximately 11,000 casualties in the fight;       Whereas ISIS, al Qaeda, and their affiliates have proven      resilient and have regrouped when the United States and its      partners have withdrawn from the fight against them;       Whereas Turkey's unprovoked incursion into northeastern      Syria, which began on October 9, 2019, has displaced more      than 166,000 civilians, according to the United Nations High      Commissioner on Refugees, and dozens of civilians have been      killed on both sides;       Whereas, as a result of Turkey's incursion into      northeastern Syria and the withdrawal of United States Armed      Forces, the Syrian Democratic Forces have turned to Russia      and the brutal Assad regime for support, while more than a      hundred ISIS-affiliated detainees have escaped from detention      facilities; and       Whereas the Assad regime is responsible for murdering at      least 500,000 civilians and displacing at least 12,000,000      Syrians, or roughly half the country's population at the time      that the civil war began in 2011, and the regime's return to      northeastern Syria through its new partnership with the      Syrian Democratic Forces will allow the regime to extend its      murderous campaign and again subjugate the Kurdish, Sunni      Arab, and religious minorities of northeastern Syria: Now,      therefore, be it       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the      United States of America in Congress assembled, That      Congress--       (1) condemns in the strongest terms the Government of      Turkey's escalating hostilities against Kurdish partners of      the United States in Syria, while recognizing the Government      of Turkey's legitimate humanitarian, economic, and security      concerns emanating from the conflict in Syria;       (2) calls upon the United States Government to pressure the      Government of Turkey, including through sanctions, to act      with restraint, provide accountability for human rights      abuses conducted by militias acting in support of Turkish      military operations, and curtail its hostilities against      United States partner forces in Syria;       (3) reiterates United States opposition to the forced      repatriation of refugees from third countries into Syria, and      calls upon all refugee returns to be safe, dignified, and      voluntary;       (4) urges the President to rescind his invitation to the      White House to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan until a      more enduring cease-fire has been established between Turkish      and Kurdish forces in northeastern Syria;       (5) calls upon the United States Government to continue      supporting liberated Syrian Kurdish and Arab communities in      northeast Syria through humanitarian support, including those      displaced or otherwise affected by ongoing violence in Syria,      and calls upon other nations to increase support to      stabilization efforts in northeastern Syria;       (6) strongly opposes any abandonment of our Kurdish and      Arab partners in Syria;       (7) calls for a halt to the withdrawal of United States      Armed Forces from Syria where practical, and calls for the      continued use of air power to target ISIS and provide      protection of ethnic and religious minorities in northeastern      Syria;       (8) expresses support for a continued United States      military presence in Iraq, along with efforts to help Iraqi      forces control their border, protect their sovereignty, and      counter ISIS;       (9) recognizes the continuing threat to United States and      United States allies posed by al Qaeda and ISIS, which      maintain an ability to operate in Syria and Afghanistan;       (10) warns that a precipitous withdrawal of United States      forces from the ongoing fight against these groups, without      effective, countervailing efforts to secure gains in Syria      and Afghanistan, could allow terrorists to regroup,      destabilize critical regions, and create vacuums that could      be filled by Iran or Russia, to the detriment of United      States interests and those of our allies;       (11) recognizes that an unbroken chain of Iranian-     controlled territory across Syria poses a significant threat      to Israel;       (12) reiterates support for international diplomatic      efforts to facilitate peaceful, negotiated resolutions to the      ongoing conflicts in Syria and Afghanistan on terms that      respect the rights of innocent civilians and deny safe havens      to terrorists;       (13) encourages close collaboration between the executive      branch and the legislative branch to ensure continuing      strong, bipartisan support for United States military      operations in Syria and Afghanistan; and       (14) calls upon the President to certify whether conditions      have been met for the enduring defeat of al Qaeda and ISIS      before initiating any further significant withdrawal of      United States forces from the region.                          ____________________
