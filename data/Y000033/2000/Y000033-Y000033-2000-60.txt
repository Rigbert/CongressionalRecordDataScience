Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, S. 748 directs the Secretary of the Interior to complete and submit a report within 6 months after enactment of this act on the progress the Department has made in implementing section 1307 and 1308 of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, called ANILCA.  Since ANILCA was enacted, the Department has failed to implement these two sections of the bill. This bill further requires the Secretary to include a detailed action plan for the implication of ANILCA section 1307 and 1308 to consult with Alaska Native Corporations formed under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, nonprofit organizations, and tribal entities in the immediate vicinity of the park units. It further requires the Secretary, to the extent possible, to involve such groups in developing materials and pilot programs.  I urge an aye vote on this important legislation for the Alaska Natives.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
