President, earlier this week, for the second time in less than 3 years, King Gyanendra of Nepal dismissed the multiparty government and declared a state of emergency suspending fundamental constitutional rights. Apparently, he will assume the duties of the deposed Prime Minister and appoint a new cabinet.  Throughout its troubled past, Nepal has suffered from the neglect and often violent and corrupt misrule of many monarchs. For that reason, those familiar with its history may not be completely surprised by this unfortunate development.  Yet one would have thought that in the 21st century, this type of thing would, by now, be a distant memory. At a time when a vicious Maoist insurgency is gaining ground in Nepal, it would be hard to conceive of a worse time for the King to repeat his past mistake.  There is no military solution to this conflict. Nepal is a place where, not unlike Afghanistan, a handful of extremists with rifles and explosives can wreak havoc and easily disappear into the rugged countryside. By terrorizing rural villagers and exploiting the Government's neglect of them, the Maoists have steadily extended their reach to large areas of the country.  The Nepalese army, while somewhat more effective than a few years ago when it performed little more than ceremonial duties, has likewise alienated much of the rural population by arbitrarily arresting, disappearing and killing civilians suspected of sympathizing with the Maoists. Today, the army, rather than defending democracy, is defending the King. It is clear that the King and the army concocted this together, despite having assured the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights last week that concerns about violations of human rights would be addressed.  This year, the United States plans to provide some $40 million in economic aid to Nepal. Much of this is channeled by USAID through nongovernmental organizations. But we are also providing support to the Nepalese government, as well as training and equipment to the Army. In fact, several months ago we approved the transfer of $1 million in fiscal year 2004 military equipment that had not initially been appropriated for Nepal.  The Indian government, to its credit, issued a strong statement critical of the King's actions. The State Department has also called for the immediate restoration of multiparty democracy. King Gyanendra is on notice that he will be held responsible for infringement of the rights of free speech and assembly, or abuses of citizens who have defended human rights and democracy.  The State Department should also make clear that unless democratic government and fundamental rights are promptly restored, the United States will cut off aid to the government and the army under Section 508 of the Foreign Operations Act which was designed to deter and punish this type of act. Regardless of whether or not the King may have acted within his authority under Nepal's constitution, and I do not know if he did or not, that is not the issue. The intent of our law to safeguard democracy is clear. The price is losing U.S. aid. Furthermore, if the $1 million in military equipment previously transferred has not yet been delivered, it should be withheld.  Everyone who has followed Nepal's recent history would agree that its 10 year ``experiment'' with democracy has not been easy. Democracy is never easy, and no one should minimize the threat the Maoists pose. But the answer is not to undermine democracy. The answer, as President Bush expressed in his Inaugural Address, is to work, with help from the international community, to strengthen democracy. The United States Congress would welcome that opportunity.  King Gyanendra has made a tragic blunder. He still has time to prevent a momentary crisis from becoming a disaster for his country and perhaps for the monarchy itself.                          ____________________
