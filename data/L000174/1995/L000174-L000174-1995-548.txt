President, for the last two decades, our Federal employees seem to be handy scapegoats for anything that goes wrong with Government. Whenever anyone on this floor mentions ``those Federal bureaucrats,'' the syntax is generally pejorative and the reference, unflattering. The collective term ``bureaucracy'' is uttered in the same tone of revulsion reserved for former leaders of the ``evil empire.''  So it was refreshing to read an editorial in last Saturday's Times-Argus, which serves our State capital of Montpelier, VT.  The editorial simply reminds us that many victims of the Oklahoma City bomb explosion were ``our friends, neighbors, brothers, and sisters who work for the Federal Government.''  It seems to needful reminder in these times to be a little more respectful of the effort we get every day from millions of these men and women who work for us in every capacity, from guarding our national security to protecting our rights as citizens, from fighting crime to enforcing public health and safety standards, from exploring space to cleaning up our air and water here on Earth.  I ask that this editorial be reprinted in the Congressional Record. I am not suggesting that criticism of Government operations is off limits. I am only asking that it be fair. The hundreds of Federal workers in my State of Vermont, are among the most dedicated and hard working men and women, in public or private life, in our country. Let us stop careless impugning of their professional integrity.  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                  [From the Times Argus, May 6, 1995]                           Neighbors, Friends       One of the results of the bombing attack on the federal      building in Oklahoma City has been to put a human face on the      entity known as the ``federal government.''       The people whose job it was to hand out Social Security      checks, to enforce the laws about drugs and firearms, or to      recruit people for the military were the neighbors, friends,      brothers, sisters of the people of Oklahoma City.       In Vermont the federal government consists of Forest      Service rangers and office workers, agriculture specialists,      the Marine recruiter, the Social Security workers, the court      personnel and others who live every day among us. These are      our neighbors, friends, brothers, sisters.       And yet to hear the more virulent strains of attack      emanating from anti-government extremists, these people are      an exotic combination of Nazi, Communist and Genghis Khan.       A Colorado talk show host, responding to a caller who      thought it was a good idea to shoot members of Congress,      advocated ``armed revolution.''       A talk show host in Arizona suggested that Sarah Brady, the      gun control advocate and wife of President Reagan's former      press secretary, ought to be ``put down'' the way a      veterinarian puts down a lame horse.       And, of course, the advice of Watergate burglar G. Gordon      Liddy to shoot for the head when confronted by federal agents      has become a famous example of the antigovernment rhetoric      that has become so common.       Imagine for a moment that it was the Rev. Jesse Jackson or      Ralph Nader or Patricia Ireland who was advising people to      shoot government workers. Would conservatives hesitate for a      moment in pointing out that such violent language may be less      than conducive to the good of the public weal? Yet when      President Clinton made the rather tentative suggestion that      this language was really not so helpful, media incidiarists      whined that they were being unfairly attacked.       Back in the 1960s anti-war dissenters, black power      advocates, and other dissatisfied souls said a lot of stupid      things that embarrassed even those who opposed the war or      supported the civil rights struggle. Talk then of armed      revolution was a naive delusion that was taken all too      seriously by a few people, who sometimes ended up getting      innocent people killed.       A lot of stupid things are being said again about our      friends, neighbors, brothers, sisters who work for the      federal government. In the West, there are soreheads with a      grievance about the way the federal government manages public      lands who are preventing federal workers from doing their      jobs.       Everybody ought to remember that federal lands in the West      do not belong only to the people who live there. They belong      to all of us. We have people working for us to manage our      lands. And people who don't like the way they are being      managed have a democratic process to avail themselves of to      change things.       It wasn't true in the 1960s, and it isn't true now: Our      government is not a dictatorship, and armed revolution is not      justifiable. The government in Oklahoma, in Boise or in      Montpelier consists of our friends, neighbors, brothers and      sisters, who, like the rest of us, are not always right about      everything they do. But that's the great thing about      democracy: We have peaceful methods for making      [[Page S6240]] changes. We also have the duty to hold      accountable those who break the law in an effort to attack      our system.                               ____________________
