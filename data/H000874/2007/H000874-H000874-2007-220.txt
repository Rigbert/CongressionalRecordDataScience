We have a heavy responsibility. We have great differences. I understand that everybody's sensibilities are taut. I predicted that last Tuesday, that that would be the case. I regret it.  I regret what happened last night which has generated this. But we do have business to do. All I am saying is I don't want to have a question about this vote, because we cannot assure ourselves, as the gentleman said, that the list I have in front of me or the screen that you have projected to you is projecting the accurate information.  Therefore, I suggest, given that, that we give the technicians an opportunity to facilitate fixing it. I think that's a reasonable request.  I would hope that everybody in the House would think it's a reasonable request.
