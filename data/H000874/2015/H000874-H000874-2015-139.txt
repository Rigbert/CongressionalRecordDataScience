 Let me ask him further as he knows what is happening in the Senate and whether they can take those bills up: Does the gentleman contemplate, as the majority leader, or does he know whether the Speaker contemplates any effort to come to a bipartisan agreement as was done when Mr. Ryan and Senator Murray met and came to grips with a resolution and a compromise on what otherwise would be the sequester 302(a) allocations on discretionary spending, which the chair of the committee, as you know, Chairman Rogers, has called ill-conceived and unrealistic?  Does the majority leader know whether there is any plan to try to get us from the gridlock, which we are apparently in one more time on the appropriations process, to a place asRyan-Murray got us where we moved ahead in a bipartisan way and, in fact, funded the government?  Although, it was not until December, and we had a stopgap measure in there. Is there anything scheduled to discuss that or to pursue that compromise?  I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  As the gentleman knows, there is no gridlock here. We have passed half of the appropriation bills already. We have started the process earlier than ever before. As the gentleman knows, with just the bill before--very bipartisan--more than 46 Democrats joined us in repealing the medical device tax.  I would probably tell the gentleman that his question really goes to the minority leader on the Senate side, Harry Reid. In reading some of his statements, he wants to create a shutdown, which I think would be wrong for the American people.  I think the best way forward is for the Democrats and the Republicans in the Senate to take up DOD appropriations and move that to the President's desk.
