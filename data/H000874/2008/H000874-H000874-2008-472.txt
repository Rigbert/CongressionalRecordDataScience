Today, however, I'd like to recognize another, perhaps lesser known, side of Hal--his more than 30-year commitment to the men and women of the fire service.  Recently, Hal Bruno announced that he was stepping down as Chairman of the National Fallen Firefighters Foundation, the organization established by the Congress to honor our fallen heroes and assist their families and coworkers. It was with deep regret that the board of directors accepted his resignation. Since 1993, Hal has served with distinction on the board of directors, the last seven as chairman. For Hal and his lovely wife, Meg, the Foundation is that ray of light that has guided family members of fallen firefighters through their dark journeys.  When a firefighter falls in the line of duty, Hal likens it to losing a family member. Long after the death, Hal has always been there to provide comfort and assistance to the family members, no matter how long it takes for them to regain their strength and move ahead with their lives. The Foundation and the fire service, itself, are fortunate to have had a leader with such compassion and dedication as my friend, Hal Bruno.  Always humble, Hal has always been one to credit the professional staff of the Foundation for the positive impact the Foundation has made on the people it serves--family members of our fallen heroes. But Hal, through his leadership, inspiration and selfless dedication--set the course of the Foundation in a new direction, resulting in a tremendous growth of the Foundation's programs during his years as chairman. Those of us involved with the fire service are pleased to hear that he will continue to serve as an active member of the board of directors.  To both Hal and Meg Bruno, I extend my personal thanks and the thanks and gratitude of the Congressional Fire Services Caucus, for their dedication to our first responders, and, especially, the National Fallen Firefighters Foundation. I ask my colleagues to join with me in paying tribute to Hal and congratulating him upon his retirement and a job well done.                          ____________________
