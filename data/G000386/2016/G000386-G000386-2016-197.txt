 President, I respect the Senator from Arkansas. In the short time he has been in the Senate, he has been an outstanding leader on very important issues. He is a good Senator. I have watched him over the period of time he has been in the Senate, and I think this is the first time I felt he was wrong. But he has his rights.  Juvenile judges are the ones who originally requested that Congress include a valid court order, or ``VCO,'' exception in the Federal juvenile justice statute, and they now are asking us to repeal it. We accorded great weight to the opinion of the National Council of Family and Juvenile Court Judges because their members are the ones who invoke this exception.  As further noted this week by Elizabeth Pyke of the National Criminal Justice Association: ``No one on the state government side is arguing to keep the VCO. . . . All agree that the VCO is the wrong tool to get a child's attention. Holding them in detention for a status offense is no longer considered the best practice for scaring a kid into going straight . . . So parsing the language to allow judges to continue to use the VCO for punishment doesn't really make sense. And, again, no one in the states has argued for that.''  Detaining status offenders is not good public policy. We don't support a further language change because locking up these adolescents will make them worse, expose them to violent offenders who have committed serious crimes, and increase the likelihood they will become serious offenders themselves.  Remember that we are talking about juveniles who have committed infractions that would not be crimes if committed by adults. Curfew violations. Truancy. Underage tobacco use.  Status offenders often come from broken homes or homes with family conflicts. Many have had traumatic childhoods or suffer from mental health issues.  Strikingly, girls are 16 percent of the detained population but comprise 40 percent of status offenders. In the case of girls, the root cause for commission of a status offense may be severe forms of child abuse, including child sex trafficking.  In truancy cases, placing a status offender in detention only ensures that the juvenile will miss even more school without ever resolving the issue motivating the truancy. Even a brief time in detention may make it harder for the child to keep up with school work. Yet truancy is one of the status offenses that frequently results in a status offender's detention in Arkansas. We need to resolve the issues that lead these children to skip school so that they can succeed.  Judges have more effective and less costly tools at their disposal to ensure these juveniles' accountability. For example, they can suspend their driver's license; impose fines; send the juvenile to live with another family; order the juvenile into counseling. Judges also may ask parents to undergo counseling or take parenting classes.  Finally, as already noted, locking up status offenders costs the taxpayers a lot of money, even though these juveniles typically don't pose a public safety risk. In Arkansas, housing a child in detention costs hundreds of dollars per day. Community-based programs cost a lot less, but they ensure the judge receives periodic status updates and enable the judge to increase sanctions if the child remains unstable.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record some of the letters we have received in support of the bill's passage.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                 National Criminal                                          Justice Association,                                    Washington, DC, July 27, 2015.     Hon. Charles Grassley,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Sheldon Whitehouse,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Grassley and Whitehouse: We are pleased to      support S. 1169, the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency      Prevention Reauthorization Act (JJDPA) of 2015. Members of      the National Criminal Justice Association (NCJA) include the      state, territorial and tribal chief executive officers of      criminal justice agencies charged with managing federal,      state, and tribal justice assistance resources. About half of      these administer the programs authorized by the JJDPA.       NCJA members applaud the goals of S. 1169 to preserve and      strengthen the prevention, youth development and      rehabilitation purposes of the JJDPA, and are committed to      achieving the reforms envisioned by the bill. In particular,      the bill focuses on employing evidence-based and promising      practices to promote alternatives to detention and provide      for the diversion from, and the safe and effective treatment      for, youth in confinement. It also would further the progress      we have made as a nation in keeping youth out of contact with      adult offenders, from the time of arrest through confinement.       The promise of the JJDPA is federal support for innovative      state approaches to reforming the juvenile justice system and      improving the treatment of juveniles under the state's care.      S. 1169 will add to states' responsibilities by substantially      expanding the activities under the core requirements,      increasing data collection, and potentially requiring states      to establish new facilities to house youthful offenders and      increase the number of facilities states are required to      monitor. Yet, since the last reauthorization in 2002, funding      for JJDPA programs has dropped by more than 60 percent. This      means that the resources available to states for juvenile      delinquency programming and compliance with the core      requirements are substantially dropping at a time when the      requirements on states are substantially increasing.       It is for this reason that NCJA members appreciate the      flexibility and spirit of partnership embedded in the bill      which will help all states reach a common standard of      protection and service for children in the juvenile justice      system even when resources are scarce.       NCJA members also believe the bill will help continue to      rebuild the partnership between OJJDP and the state agencies      responsible for carrying out the purposes of the Act. The      bill includes new training and technical assistance      opportunities for state agency administrators, offers a new      opportunity for state agencies to partner with OJJDP in      research and the sharing of best practices, and holds the      promise of improving transparency.       We are effusive in our praise and thanks for Evelyn Fortier      and Lara Quint. Throughout the bill development process,      Evelyn and Lara have been thoughtful, professional,      welcoming, patient, collaborative, and kind. They have      listened to our concerns and     worked hard to craft language that supports the role of the      state administering agencies while keeping pressure on the      states to strengthen our juvenile justice systems.       Thank you for your leadership, for your commitment to      improving the outcomes for youth, and for supporting state      efforts to prevent and reduce juvenile crime.           Sincerely,                                                     Jeanne Smith,     President.                                  ____                                       Act 4 Juvenile Justice,                                 Washington, DC, January 25, 2016.     Hon. Chuck Grassley,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Sheldon Whitehouse,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Grassley and Senator Whitehouse: We, the      undersigned--representing more than 200 national, state, and      local organizations and hundreds of thousands of      constituents--thank you for your leadership in sponsoring S.      1169, the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention      Reauthorization Act of 2015. The bill strengthens and updates      the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act (JJDPA),      which has provided States and localities with federal      standards and supports for improving juvenile justice and      delinquency prevention practices and contributed to      safeguards for youth, families and communities for more than      40 years, and we are grateful that you have made it a      priority this Congress.       Despite a continuing decline in youth crime and      delinquency, more than 60,000 young people are held in      detention centers awaiting trial or confined by the courts in      juvenile facilities in the U.S. For these confined youth, and      the many more kids at-risk of involvement in the justice      system, the JJDPA and programs it supports are critical.      Youth who are locked up are separated from their families,      and many witness violence. These youth struggle when they get      out, trying to complete high school, get jobs, housing, or go      to college. Aside from the human toll, the financial costs of      maintaining large secure facilities have also made it vital      to rethink juvenile justice in every community.       Premised on research-based understandings of juvenile      justice and delinquency prevention, S. 1169 reaffirms a      national commitment to the rehabilitative purpose of the      juvenile justice system; one that supports developmentally      appropriate practices that treat as many youth as possible in      their communities. It advances important improvements to the      JJDPA, its core requirements and its central purposes,      provides enhanced safeguards for youth in the system,      increases community safety, and ensures progress toward      racial fairness.       Since the last JJDPA reauthorization was approved in 2002,      there have been many developments in the field of juvenile      justice that significantly impact practitioners' work. S.      1169 recognizes and addresses many of these developments in      several key ways. Specifically, we are pleased that the bill:       1. Strengthens the Deinstitutionalization of Status      Offenders (DSO) core requirement by calling on states to      phase-out use of the Valid Court Order Exception that      currently causes non-offending youth/status offenders to be      locked up.       2. Extends the adult Jail Removal and Sight and Sound      Separation core requirements to apply to juveniles held      pretrial, whether charged in juvenile or adult court.       3. Gives States and localities clear direction on the      Disproportionate Minority Contact (DMC) protection to plan      and implement approaches to ensure fairness and reduce racial      and ethnic disparities, and to set measurable objectives for      reduction of disparities in the system.       4. Encourages States to eliminate dangerous practices in      confinement and to promote adoption of best practices and      standards.       5. Recognizes the impact of exposure to violence and trauma      on adolescent behavior and development.       6. Encourages investment in community-based alternatives to      detention; encourages family engagement in design and      delivery of treatment and services; improves screening,      diversion, assessment, and treatment for mental health and      substance abuse needs; allows for easier transfer of      education credits for system-involved youth; and calls for a      focus on the particular needs of girls either in the system      or at risk of entering the justice system.       7. Promotes fairness by supporting State efforts to expand      youth access to counsel and encouraging programs that inform      youth of opportunities to seal or expunge juvenile records      once they have gotten their lives back on track.       8. Reauthorizes the Juvenile Accountability Block Grant      (JABG) program which helps states and localities reduce      juvenile offending by providing judges and other juvenile      justice officials with a range of age/developmentally-     appropriate options to both hold youth accountable and get      them back on track so they are less likely to reoffend.       9. Encourages transparency, timeliness, public notice, and      communication on the part of OJJDP, its agents and the      States.       10. Increases accountability to ensure effective use of      resources, to provide greater oversight of grant programs,      and to ensure state compliance with federal standards.       Given the significant gains reflected in S. 1169, we are      pleased to endorse the bill and look forward to continuing to      work with you and your colleagues toward final passage in the      114th Congress.                                  ____                               Human Rights Project for Girls,                                 Washington, DC, January 30, 2016.     Hon. Chuck Grassley,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Grassley: Rights4Girls is a human rights      organization focused on gender-based violence against young      women and girls here in the U.S. We write to thank you for      your leadership and commitment to our youth in sponsoring the      Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Reauthorization      Act (JJDPA) this Congress. We believe this bill strengthens      the existing law by providing critical updates needed to      protect youth, families, and communities.       We write to express our support for the JJDPA, which has      not been reauthorized in over a decade. Despite an overall      decline in youth crime and delinquency, more than 60,000      children are held in detention centers across the United      States. We also know that girls are now the fastest growing      segment of the juvenile justice population, requiring a more      gender-responsive lens when looking at issues related to      delinquency and justice-involvement. The research shows that      the vast majority of girls in the justice system enter with      extensive histories of sexual and physical abuse. Nationally,      over 70% of girls in the justice system report histories of      sexual and physical violence, but in some states it can range      anywhere from 80-93%. For youth and especially young girls in      the system or at-risk of involvement in the system, the JJDPA      and the improvements in this year's language are vital.       For example, we know that each year more than 1,000      American children are arrested for prostitution, despite not      being old enough to consent to sex and despite the existence      of federal laws that define them as victims of trafficking.      The JJDPA protects child trafficking victims by providing for      the screening of youth upon intake for child trafficking and      promoting services and alternatives to detention for such      victims. The JJDPA will also grant greater protection for      pregnant girls behind bars by restricting the use of      shackles. Because shackles can greatly increase the      likelihood of falls, the JJDPA limits the use of restraints      on pregnant girls in the system, which will better protect      the life and health of both these young women as well as      their unborn children. Another critical way in which the      JJDPA will benefit young girls is in phasing out the Valid      Court Order (VCO) exception. Since girls are      disproportionately charged with and detained for status      offenses, closing this loophole would particularly benefit      girls--many of whom are arrested and detained using the VCO      exception for offenses that are directly correlated with      suffering abuse and trauma.       We are grateful for your commitment to this issue and to      these youth. As a human rights organization dedicated to      protecting the rights of vulnerable young women and girls, we      urge the Senate to swiftly take up and pass this critical      piece of legislation.           Sincerely,                                                     Rights4Girls,     Washington, DC.                                  ____                                  Fight Crime: Invest in Kids,                               Washington, DC, September 17, 2015.       To All Members of Congress: We are members of Fight Crime:      Invest in Kids, a national organization of nearly 5,000 law      enforcement leaders nationwide, including chiefs of police,      sheriffs, prosecutors, and other law enforcement executives.      We write to express our strong support for S. 1169, the      bipartisan reauthorization of the Juvenile Justice and      Delinquency Prevention Act (JJDPA). This reauthorization      supports proven programs that can prevent youths from      engaging in criminal activity or rehabilitate youths starting      to offend. These programs provide a critical support for law      enforcement and an important investment in those young      people. We urge your support for this important      reauthorization.       Recidivism remains a serious problem, draining law      enforcement resources and damaging public safety. Past      studies have shown that if a youth 14 years old or younger      becomes a second-time offender, their likelihood of future      run-ins with law enforcement spikes to 77 percent; and      nationwide, almost half of youths who come before juvenile      court (40 percent) will come before the court at least one      more time. More needs to be done to ensure that if a youth      offends, their first contact with the justice system is also      their last.       The bipartisan Senate bill to reauthorize JJDPA would      provide federal support for evidence-based programs to combat      youth recidivism. Many states have expanded the use of these      intervention programs in recent years, and additional support      through the JJDPA reauthorization would help states continue      this work. Research has shown that effective community-based      intervention programs for youths and their families can      significantly reduce the likelihood that the youth will get      into trouble again. By reasserting family and personal      responsibility, and coaching parents and children in the      skills they will need to change the youths' behaviors,      juvenile offenders are much more likely to engage in more      pro-social behavior and avoid future run-ins with the law.       This reauthorization strengthens the evidence-based      standard, ensuring the federal investment will go to programs      that have demonstrated significant effectiveness. It also      encourages continued growth in the     anti-recidivism field by allowing a small portion of funds to      go to promising programs, thus encouraging innovation and      yielding the greatest results for the community.       A study of one intervention program that works with      troubled youth and their families, Functional Family Therapy      (FFT), found that youth whose families received FFT coaching      were half as likely to be rearrested as those whose families      did not. Another study found FFT reduced subsequent out-of-     home placements by three quarters. Further, because of the      reduced costs associated with crime and contact with the      justice system, FFT was found to save the public $27,000 per      youth treated. Another intervention that works with the      families of serious juvenile offenders, Multisystemic Therapy      (MST), found juvenile offenders who had not received MST were      62 percent more likely to be arrested for another offense,      and more than twice as likely to be arrested for a violent      offense.       One effective, research-based program, Multidimensional      Treatment Foster Care (MTFC) provides specially selected and      trained foster parents for seriously troubled youth who      cannot stay with their parents. While the youth are in foster      care learning crucial skills, their parents are receiving      coaching so they can continue the process of directing their      children's behavior in more positive ways once the youths      return home. In studies, MTFC has been shown to cut juvenile      recidivism in half and save the public an average of $9,000      for every juvenile treated. Each of these programs can be      used successfully either in place of residential facilities,      or as after-care upon leaving a facility.       As these programs help to reduce youth recidivism, there      also needs to be a clear sense of the progress being made and      areas for continued improvement. We support the National      Recidivism Measure within this reauthorization that instructs      the Administrator to establish a uniform measure of data      collection that states can voluntarily adopt, or not, as      another tool to evaluate data on juvenile recidivism. The      option of measure some re-offending outcomes in the same way      could help states compare results and share best practices.       Law enforcement nationwide remain committed to doing what      is necessary to protect public safety, and we know that      families and communities have an important role to play. We      support the reauthorization of JJDPA, which will provide      support for family-centered and community-based      interventions, like FFT, MST, and MFTC. This is a strategic      investment in public safety. Changing the behavior of a      teenager is more likely than changing the behavior of an      adult career criminal. This not only benefits those youths,      but also law enforcement, the taxpayer, and the community.       We urge Congress to pass the reauthorization of JJDPA that      will prioritize evidence-based programs to get troubled kids      back on track and improve public safety.
