 President, this Republican budget fails to reflect the priorities of families across America.  If this budget were submitted in any math class--it would get an F--because the numbers just don't add up. The reality doesn't match the rhetoric.  And while Republicans are talking about how great their budget is, when you do the math the things Americans care about--improving education, reducing the debt, saving Social Security, strengthening and modernizing Medicare--have all been left behind.  The things that matter to families have been sacrificed in the name of an irresponsible tax cut.  Mr. President, I am disappointed that this budget abandons the progress we have made since 1993. Since I first joined the Budget Committee, our nation's financial strength has grown dramatically. Through the hard work of the President, the Vice President, and others, we have turned deficits into surpluses.  And we learned two important lessons. First, budgets must be realistic--they have to take into account what our nation needs and what we are capable of providing.  Second, budgets must be responsible. A responsible budget meets our obligations. It makes sure that Social Security, Medicare and other existing commitments aren't left hanging.  But, Mr. President, this budget fails both tests--it is neither realistic nor responsible. This budget fails to provide the necessary investments in education, health care and prescription drug coverage. Instead, this Republican budget sacrifices our priorities for $200 billion in tax cuts.  This tax cut could eat up all of the on-budget surplus. Given this Congress' track record on tax cuts, it is fair to assume when we see the specifics they will be similar to Governor Bush's plan and to the tax bill Republicans tried to pass last year.  In both of those Republican plans, the top 10% of the people, get more than 60% of the benefits. The President and the American people rejected that tax plan last year, and I expect they will reject it again.  Mr. President, so far the majority has expressed interest in two specific tax provisions. Unfortunately, their efforts have been misguided.  First, the Majority has moved to repeal the marriage penalty. I support making sure that families in America are not penalized by our tax code. In fact, I am a cosponsor of S. 8, which would eliminate the marriage penalty. Our bill addresses a real problem--too many lower and middle income families are penalized by the current system.  But the majority's proposal--by giving further tax relief to those who already enjoy a marriage bonus--simply creates new inequities while still burdening lower and middle income families with a marriage penalty.  Mr. President, the Republicans have a second proposal--related to small businesses. Democrats fought to pass a minimum wage increase, which some of America's hardest workers desperately need. But the majority would only go along if their tax proposal was included.  What did we end up with? A minimum wage increase over 3 years instead of 2--so workers would have to wait an extra year to get the full benefit--and a tax plan that kept growing. While I support targeted tax cuts that will really help small businesses, I do not support the majority's approach, which abandons fiscal responsibility by the sheer size of their combined proposals.  Mr. President, I do want to take just a moment to mention three important positive statements we were able to include in the budget resolution.  I am pleased that my amendment placing a high priority on the unique needs of women in the Social Security debate was adopted in committee. This amendment recognizes the economic safety net of social security for women and puts the Senate on record in support of using the reform process to improve the economic condition of women.  This resolution also includes my amendment regarding the urgency of reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act and the need to support full funding for these programs. We are facing a deadline on reauthorization--I want to make it clear that we will not abandon battered women and children during this short, legislative year. Regardless of the actions of Congress or the courts, we will work to continue funding for VAWA programs.  The third positive statement included in this budget resolution is my amendment on pipeline safety--which was adopted unanimously by the Budget Committee. My amendment says that pipeline safety efforts should be funded at the levels called for in my bill, S. 2004--the Pipeline Safety Act of 2000.  While I am proud that we were able to win concessions for these three important areas, overall this budget still puts tax cuts above vital investments.  Mr. President, while Republicans are saying that their budget funds key priorities, their rhetoric doesn't match the reality of their budget. The reality is that to make room for their tax cut, Republicans shortchange the investments that matter to the American people. In fact, in key areas, this budget doesn't even keep up with inflation.  Let me give you a few examples of how this misguided budget leaves America's priorities behind. The bad decisions in this budget will be felt in classrooms across America. This budget would decimate the progress we have made reducing overcrowded classrooms. Over the past two years, we've hired 29,000 new, fully qualified teachers to reduce class size. And today 1.7 million students are learning the basics in a disciplined environment. We should be building on our progress, but this Republican budget abandons our progress.  This budget tells students--``sorry, you'll have to sit in an overcrowded classroom next year because under the Republican tax plan--you are not a priority.''  Mr. President, it's a priority that we save Social Security while our economy is so strong. We shouldn't wait until later to fix what we know needs to be changed. But this budget tells every American who will rely on Social Security in the years to come--``sorry, this budget won't save Social Security for you because under the Republican tax plan--you are not a priority.''  Mr. President, it's a priority that we pay down our national debt--instead of passing that burden along to our children. But this budget tells every young American--``sorry, you better start saving money now to pay off the national debt--because under the Republican plan--you are not a priority.''  Mr. President, it's a priority that we strengthen and modernize Medicare. It's a priority that seniors get help buying the medicine they need--because no one should have to choose between buying medicine and buying food.  But this budget tells seniors--``sorry, you can't get the prescription drug coverage you need because under the Republican tax plan--you are not a priority.''  Mr. President, the American people want real budgets--not gimmicks. They want to know that our nation's vital priorities are being treated like priorities. They don't want the things that matter in their lives to be squeezed out by unbalanced tax cuts that would benefit only a few people.  Unfortunately, the driving force of this resolution has been tax cuts--tax cuts that explode in the outer years and jeopardize our fiscal strength. We should be using the surplus to honor our commitments to our children and our seniors. Now is the time to address the long-term solvency of Social Security and Medicare and to provide resources to local communities to make our classrooms ready for the 21st century. Those are the things a responsible budget does.  But as I look at this budget, the only priority I see is this exploding tax cut. Who gets left behind in this budget?  Students--who could lose the smaller classes they need; every American who will depend on Social Security; young people--who will still be burdened with our national debt; and seniors--who rely on Medicare and need prescription drug coverage.  They all get left behind, and that is wrong. I'm on the floor to say that they are priorities, and we will fight for them.  Mr. President, we should pass a budget that reflects the priorities of the American people and one that is realistic. This budget fails the American people on both counts, and therefore I must oppose it. Let's give the peoplewe represent a responsible budget that meets their needs.          emergency agriculture assistance for seed producers
