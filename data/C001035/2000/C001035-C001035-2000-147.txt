President, today, Thursday, April 13, is National D.O. Day. I therefore want to take this opportunity to recognize the 45,000 osteopathic physicians (D.O.s) across the country for their contributions to the American healthcare system. For more than a century, D.O.s have made a difference in the lives and health of Americans everywhere. They have treated presidents and Olympic athletes. They have helped to keep children well and have contributed to the fight against AIDS. Today, members of the osteopathic medical profession serve as U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, the chief medical officer for the U.S. Coast Guard, and the Surgeon General of the U.S. Army.  As fully licensed physicians able to prescribe medication and perform surgery, D.O.s are committed to serving the health needs of rural and underserved communities. They make up 15 percent of the total physician population in towns of 10,000 or less. In addition, 64 percent of D.O.s practice in the primary care areas of medicine, fulfilling a need for more primary care physicians in an era marked by the growth of managed care. Their contributions have been particularly important in rural states like Maine.  More than 100 million patient visits are made each year to D.O.s. D.O.s approach their patients as ``whole people.'' They don't just treat a specific illness or injury. D.O.s take into account home and work environments, as well as lifestyle, when assessing overall health. This approach provides Americans with high quality healthcare--patients seen as people, not just an illness or injury.  From the state-of-the-art healthcare facility in a major city to a clinic in a rural Maine community, D.O.s continue to practice the kind of medicine that Andrew Taylor Still envisioned over 100 years ago when he founded the profession.  It was my pleasure to meet today with two representatives of the osteopathic medical profession visiting our Capitol from Maine. The University of New England, College of Osteopathic Medicine (UNECOM), in Biddeford, is the only medical school in my home state. To the more than 400 osteopathic physicians in Maine, the approximately 1,100 graduates of UNECOM, and the 45,000 D.O.s represented by the American Osteopathic Association--congratulations on your contributions to the good health of the American people. I look forward to working with you to further our mutual goal of improving our nation's health care.                          ____________________
