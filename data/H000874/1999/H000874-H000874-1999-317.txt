Speaker, those of us who have the great privilege of serving in this body because of our election from our constituencies come to this floor every day and walk the halls of this Capitol which we revere. Every day we see the faces of and know the names of some who serve this institution so well. They are individuals who care as deeply for their country as those of us who are elected to serve in this body, and their quiet, unassuming competence adds to the quality of service that we give to the American public.  Mr. Speaker, I rise to note sadly, as others have done, the passing of a friend, the passing of a servant of this House, a servant of the people, as we are all servants of the people. His name was Charles ``Bill'' Malry. Some of my colleagues may not know the name, but they saw him in the Speaker's Lobby. They would see him in the cloakroom. He facilitated the operations of this House.  He was born May 6, 1936, in Greer, South Carolina, and was raised in Washington. He served in the Army until 1962. After his return from the Army he worked at the O Street Market here in Washington, D.C.  In 1966, 32 years ago, he started working here in the Capitol, where he worked until his death the very night the President delivered his State of the Union message. Billy was in the cloakroom, on duty, assisting Members, facilitating our work. God took him home.  Billy enjoyed entertaining people as well as music and photography. He was a real person, a warm person, a caring person. He cared about each one of us. Those of us who had the privilege of being his friend will never forget him.  He was the father of five children: Renee, Charles, Charles Jr., Michael and Tonya. His mother, Frances Malry Allen, nine grandchildren, as well as four brothers and seven sisters are left behind.  Mr. Speaker, I had the privilege of going to the church here in Washington, and I talked to his mother, and I congratulated her for raising a son who had done so much for his country and so much for each of us. Billy's smile and warmth and service will be missed. Bill Malry served his country well.                          ____________________
