 President, one of the managers' amendments we will be voting on--actually approving on a voice vote at some point during the debate--relates to our friends in Egypt. I want to make a few observations about the current relationship between the United States and Egypt.  Since the Camp David accords were signed in 1979, United States foreign assistance to Egypt has topped $42 billion. While some progress has been made in the last 16 years, I think it is important to point out the obvious, which is Egypt's role has changed and changed significantly.  Let me review the record so there is a better sense of why the bill reported from the committee did not include the longstanding earmark for Egypt.  First and foremost, Senator Leahy and I tried this year to get our aid program off autopilot. Our domestic agencies and programs have been put through the budget ringer to determine where we could reduce spending. Foreign aid obviously should not be exempted from this critical appraisal. As we conducted this review, we established very simple tests for evaluating performance. Does the program serve U.S. interests in stability, democracy, and market economies? Are U.S. resources well invested and well spent?  The basic principle which has guided the provision of support in the Middle East has been a shared commitment to the Camp David accords and the promotion of peace. Unfortunately, Egypt's record over the last 2 years indicates a shift away from that commitment.  Let me begin by referring to a letter sent by 25 Senators to President Mubarak last July following an Arab summit convened in Cairo.  I ask unanimous consent that the letter and the communique issued at the summit be printed in the Record following my remarks.
