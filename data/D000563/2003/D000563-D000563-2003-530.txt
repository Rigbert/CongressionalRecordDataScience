President, I rise today to honor Al Braiman, graduate of DePaul University's Class of 2003. Al was the oldest graduate of DePaul's Class of 2003 when he graduated on June 14. Al completed a degree in liberal arts at DePaul's College of New Learning with a grade point average of 3.92 out of a possible 4.0.  Born in Kiev, Russia, in 1920, Al immigrated to the United States at the age of one. His family took up residency in Chicago, where he lived most of his life. After high school, Al turned down an academic scholarship for college to support his family. Al joined the Army and served with distinction in World War II, spending most of his time on Guadalcanal.  After leaving the Army, Al owned and operated Lakeview Grocerland until the mid 1960s when he became an insurance salesman with Equitable LifeInsurance Company. He became a certified life underwriter and chartered financial consultant. Al won many awards in the industry, including induction into the Equitable Hall of Fame.  After retiring in 1985, Al decided to earn a college degree, something he promised his mother earlier in his life. Al's interest in politics led him to take many political science and history courses at DePaul University. Some of his favorites included a class on American presidents and a course on race relations. He also enjoyed learning many new things such as use of the Internet, photography, and art. Al has proven that it is never too late to learn and we could all learn a great deal from his perseverance.  I know my fellow Senators will join me in congratulating Al Braiman, DePaul Class of 2003. His story contains all the elements of a great American life and I am honored to share it with my colleagues in the Senate.                          ____________________
