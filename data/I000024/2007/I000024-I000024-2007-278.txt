President, it is going to be my intention in just a moment to bring up and ask for the immediate consideration of my amendment, No. 955.  We are working on a modification to make sure those on the Finance Committee will find it to be acceptable. I have discussed this with the leadership and the minority. However, it will take a minute to get the language up.  Essentially, what the amendment will say is, notwithstanding any other provision of the law, no Federal funds shall be provided to any organization or entity that advocates against tax competition or U.S. tax competitiveness.  Now, I cannot think of anything that would be more significant in a competitiveness bill than to have this language.
