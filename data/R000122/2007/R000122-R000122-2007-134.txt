Also, I would like to thank the ranking member of our subcommittee, Senator Hutchison, for her support and assistance, her knowledge and experience on the subcommittee, and her dedication to veterans and the military have been tremendous assets in developing this bill. I am particularly pleased to bring the bill to the floor today in anticipation of welcoming Senator Johnson back. He is our subcommittee chairman. He will return tomorrow. This bill is a testament to Senator Johnson's tenacity in the face of adversity and to his leadership, even though as he recuperated, he was involved in the process and proceedings and he too shared the deep concerns of the Nation's military families and our Nation's veterans. I am deeply honored to be managing this bill on the floor for him.  I yield to the Senator from Texas.
