President, first I thank the senior Senator from Missouri, Mr. Bond, for his hard work and for being so articulate. It is interesting that we have heard from Senator Thune from South Dakota, a donee State, and Senator Bond from a donor State, and they are both equally enthusiastic about the fact that we have something that should work, and yet we know that any change in any part of a formula is going to have an effect on all the rest of the States. It does not happen in a vacuum.  I will yield the floor to Senator Bond to respond to a question. I ask the Senator, would he enlighten this body as to, according to HAWA, which two States in America have the worst bridges in terms of their state of disrepair?
