President, today I wish to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the City of Saco, ME, one of the oldest communities in New England and one that exemplifies the determination and resiliency of its people. In 1617, 3 years before the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth, the English explorer Richard Vines established a test winter settlement along a sheltered cove on the coast of Maine. That settlement where the Saco River meets the sea, grew, prospered, and eventually was incorporated in 1762.  The name ``Saco'' is derived from the Abenaki word for ``mouth of the tidal stream,'' and the sheltered cove, known today as Biddeford Pool, had been a thriving center of Native American villages and cultivated fields dating back to prehistoric times. Although some 37 English families--fishermen, traders, lumberjacks, and farmers--relocated there within 20 years of Mr. Vine's exploration, growth was stifled by frequent armed conflicts with the French during those early colonial times.  The conflicts subsided and in 1716 a young merchant named William Pepperrell purchased 5,000 acres along the Saco River for a lumber operation. The small village began to prosper. In 1752, Sir William Pepperrell, by then a war hero and the first person born in America to be made an English baronet, donated a parcel to be a village common, burial ground, and site for a meetinghouse. Ten years later, the settlers incorporated as the town of Pepperrellborough, in honor of their benefactor.  In 1805, the long name was replaced with the much shorter Abenaki word, but the vision and energy of William Pepperrell lived on. First with water power and then with steam, Saco and its sister city across the river, Biddeford, became leading manufacturing centers of the industrial age in North America. At Saco Falls, 17 sawmills supplied Maine's shipbuilders. On Factory Island, Saco Iron Works opened in 1811, followed shortly by foundries, harness makers, and machine shops. With the arrival of the railroad came the great engine of the community's economy--vast, bustling textile mills.  That Saco is a city built by the skilled hands of past generations is evident in the fine architecture cherished by the residents of today. Nine properties are listed on the National Register of Historic Places, including the First parish Congregational Church, City Hall, and many homes in the Georgian, Federal, Greek Revival, and Victorian styles.  The decline of American manufacturing in the late 20th century presented Saco with one of the greatest challenge in its history. It is a challenge that is being met with the same strength demonstrated by its early settlers. The abandoned mills on Factory Island are undergoing a transformation with residential, educational, and business uses, bringing an economic renessaince to the downtown. Today, Saco is a center for tourism, education, and the arts. Its skilled workers keep the city on the forefront of high-tech manufacturing, including invaluable contributions to our Nation's security in the defense industry. A community that once used waterfalls to power sawmills now uses clean, renewable wind energy to light its beautiful passenger rail station.  Mr. President, the yearlong celebration now underway is not merely about the passing of time. It is about human accomplishment. We celebrate the people who for more than 2\1/2\ centuries have pulled together, cared for one another, and built a great community. Thanks to those who came before, Saco, ME, has a wonderful history. Thanks to those here today, it has a bright future.                          ____________________
