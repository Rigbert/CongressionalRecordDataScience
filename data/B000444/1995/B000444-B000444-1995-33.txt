 I will once again compliment the Attorney General. Find me a cop in your State or in the State of California, New Hampshire, or South Carolina representative of Senators on the floor, or Colorado, who calls the process burdensome; the one-page application, No. 1. No. 2, of the applications every single month there are more applications than there is money. They would probably be able to sustain 200,000 more cops. I am pulling that number out. I do not know for a fact. I know there are more applications than there is money.  Since my time is running out, I only have 3 minutes left, I am told, may I conclude rather than answer, on another question?  I would like to reiterate that in its breadth the 1984 crime law reflects the lessons that have been learned over the past decade as we studied crime and law enforcement, and have worked on passing this law. And in its approach, as well as in its many specifics, the law was a result of bipartisan efforts. We should not retreat on this tough but smart crime package. It already is hard at work preventing violent crime across the country. We should not retreat on the 100,000 cops program that we insisted on just a few months ago.  Let me point out that the $30 billion crime trust fund that uses the savings from cutting 272,000 Federal bureaucrats--160,000 have already left--pays for every cop, for every prison cell, and for every shelter for a battered woman and child. That is provided for in this crime bill without adding to the deficit or requiring 1 red cent additional in taxes. That was the deal we made right here on the Senate floor 1 year ago.  Now my Republican colleagues are trying to block out what we did, and back out of the deal by refusing to write the checks for next year's funding of the crime law. The money is there in the trust fund.  I have tried today to outline my objections to the Republican retreat represented by this conference report on the key provisions of the anticrime law last year.  So I urge my colleagues to consider very carefully whether this is the right form, the right idea, to dismantle these vital parts of the already successful and highly popular crime bill.  In the end I suspect that the merits will speak for themselves, and the American people will decide whether it is a good idea to take this trust fund money and spend it on 100,000 cops and the other programs here, or reduce it and send it out in block grants. And $525 million in applications are out there as we speak. Already, as of November 16, the Justice Department has received applications for an additional 9,100 cops under the 100,000 cops program beyond the 26,000 that have already been granted.  This is concrete evidence that the 100,000 cops program is working, is necessary, is local, and is needed. The shift to a block grant is wrong for many reasons. The 9,100 additional police that are all ready to go and waiting for us only to finish this political debate, is the most important reason why to shift the block grant is the wrong thing to do. Let us not try to change horses in midstream. This program is working.  If my Republican friends need to be able to say they have a Republican crime bill so that they can meet their contract pledge, let them pass the antiterrorism bill that we passed. It is the Hatch-Biden bill. Let us call it the Hatch-Republican bill. Let that be your crime bill. You can go back to your Republican conservative friends and say, ``You have a crime bill''--in order to meet a pledge that no one signed on to to dismantle one of the few big Federal programs that is working, working well, working without additional bureaucracy, and to do the job.  Let me say in final conclusion, if you doubt what I am saying, I challenge you to go home and find out that for every new cop that this new bill has in fact funded so far, just ask the police chief, or the commissioner of police, for whom that cop works, to list the number of dollars that cop has made. Then go get the names of the people that police officer has collared, has arrested--the criminal who he gets who names the victims. And then you go ask those victims whether or not this crime law made any sense.  This all comes down to the little tiny things, and the little tiny things here are making sure there are fewer victims of crime, and that those victims are in fact getting their day if court, and that they find the bad guy. That is why we need more cops.  Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Department of Justice appropriations in this conference report and the attempt by my Republican colleagues to rewrite anticrime legislation on an appropriations bill.                         Procedural objections  It is, in my view, a terrible idea to rewrite crime policy--wiping out major programs the senate created only last year and replacing them with new programs without review or debate--on an appropriations bill. It is unnecessary and completely contrary to how the Senate has traditionally worked.  We all know the Republicans want to change the crime law now at work. They said so in their Contract With America. House Republicans passed a new bill.  Here, Senators Dole and Hatch introduced their bill to change the 1994 crime law. They have every right to try to do so.  But they have not chosen to do so. Their bill has never been acted on by the Senate, or even had one hearing. Instead, what we now have with this conference report is an attempt to change the current law by lifting entire parts of the crime bill passed in the House and attaching them to this appropriations bill. That House crime bill has already been rejected by the Senate when we amended the appropriations bill to restore the 100,000 cops on the beat program a couple of months ago.  This blatant attempt to sidestep the usual deliberative process of this body is, I believe, a terrible way to make law.  This bill is, of course, dead. It will be vetoed because, among other reasons, it eliminates the commitment the President and Congress made to the American people to get 100,000 cops on the beat. And it will continue to be vetoed until my Republican colleagues get the message that there will be no new crime bill without the 100,000 cops on the beat program. The Senate has already rejected this bill without the 100,000 cops program and it should do so again.                 Overview of the problems with the bill  Notwithstanding that we'll be right back here doing this again in a few days, I'd like to list and then explain some of the major changes this conference report proposes.  First, as I've mentioned, it would eliminate the 100,000 cops program established 1 year ago in the crime law and maintained in the Senate appropriations bill.  The 100,000 cops on the beat program has already funded more than 25,000 new police officers across the country in its first year alone. And police departments across the Nation have already applied for more than one-half of a billion dollars in fiscal year 1996 to fund more than 9,000 new police. These pending applications are now threatened by this conference report.  In its place is a law enforcement block grant program that is written so broadly that the money could be spent on everything from prosecutors to probation officers to traffic lights or parking meters--and not a single new cop.  This block grant has never been authorized by the Senate.  Let's be clear on what is being done here. What this conference report does is take a crime bill that has been passed only by the House, whose funds have been authorized only by the House, whose block grant idea has already been rejected by the Senate, and incorporate it into the appropriations bill so it is passed and funded--all in one fell swoop.  I will speak more about the 100,000 cops program in a minute, but let me note that, in addition, the bill would completely eliminate or severely restrict other programs set up by the 1994 crime law--programs like: the drug court system, the rural drug enforcement grant program, the law enforcement scholarship program, the SCAMS Program fighting telemarketing fraud against senior citizens, and tried and tested programs that fight youth violence, for example, by putting boys and girls clubs in housing projects.  Under the 1994 crime law, these programs were targeted for separate funds in addition to the funds for the 100,000 cops program. But under the conference report, mayors would have only the amount of the block grant--out of which all efforts would have to be funded.  The result will be that proven crime-fighting programs that the Congress voted to support last year would be effectively eliminated, all without any consideration by the Judiciary Committee or the full Senate as to the wisdom of these changes. And all with the strong opposition of the Nation's law enforcement community.  Mr. President, if we are going to legislate by fiat like this, then we might as well do away with committees, with hearings, with subcommittee markups, with full committee markups, and with careful consideration of authorizing legislation.  We could simply do all the Senate's business on appropriations bills.  I, for one, happen to believe that's a terrible way to proceed and I believe that's reason enough to oppose this bill. The American people are not well served when major policy changes are made under the time limits facing us on these appropriations bills.  If the Republicans want to change the crime bill, they have the right to try--but let's do it the right way and then let's vote on it. Wiping out major pieces of the most significant anti-crime legislation ever passed by the Congress on an appropriations bill makes a mockery of our Senate process. The importance of the programs we are considering, not to mention the perception of our institution, demands better.  But, given that we are here, I will insist on a full opportunity to debate with my colleagues the merits of last year's crime law programs affected by this bill.  Before I do that, I first want to briefly point out that another Republican plan in this conference report is to drastically cut Federal law enforcement. This conference report cuts the FBI by $112 million below the President's request--so new FBI agents will not be hired; cuts the Drug Enforcement Agency by $5 million below the President's request; cuts interagency drug enforcement by $15 million below 1995 and $19 million below the President's request; and cuts Federal prosecutors by $13 million below the President's request.  Let me address these cuts to federal law enforcement. The president requested an increase of $337 million for FBI agents and other FBI activities--but the Republicans cut $112 million from that request.  We frequently hear claims in Congress of how much we support law enforcement.  But, as the saying goes, talk is cheap. Talk--without the commitment of dollars--is meaningless. The Republicans on the conference have failed to fund the President's request for Federal law enforcement, despite all the talk about being for law enforcement.  Let's look at these cuts to Federal law enforcement: the conference report cuts $5 million from the $54 million boost requested for Drug Enforcement Agency agents by the President.  Again, we hear a lot of talk about how we need to do more to fight illegal drugs, and there is much finger-pointing about how the administration should do more--but in the end it is the Congress that fails to fund the drug enforcement requested by the President.  In yet another important area, let's review what has happened in inter-agency drug enforcement. The organized crime and drug enforcement task forces combine the efforts of the FBI, Drug Enforcement Agency, U.S. Attorneys, Immigration and Naturalization Service, Marshals' Service, Customs Service, U.S. Coast Guard, and the Internal Revenue Service--all working together in 13 regional task forces to target and destroy major narcotics trafficking organizations.  The President requested $378 million for this program--but the Republican conference cut this amount by $19 million. This means that we will cut this important drug-fighting capability below the 1995 level.  In other words, we are not talking about less of an increase--we are talking about cutting a significant part of this program.  Let me also point out that the Republican conference report cuts the President's budget request for U.S. attorneys--our Federal prosecutors--by $13 million. The President requested an increase of $86 million to boost Federal prosecutors, but the conference report backed away from this commitment.  In short, this conference report cuts the President's request for Federal law enforcement. So our Federal effort against crime and drugs will be fought by--fewer FBI agents; fewer DEA agents; and fewer Federal prosecutors.  What is one to conclude from the efforts of the Republicans to gut the 100,000 cops on the beat program and severely reduce Federal law enforcement? Is it that tax cuts to a few are more important than protecting the safety of average Americans?  Now I'd like to return to the merits of the 1994 crime law.                     The 1994 Crime Law is working  The passage of the major $30 billion anticrime package last year capped a 6-year effort to launch a bold, comprehensive, and tough attack on violent crime and its roots in American communities.  And as we pass the 1-year mark, it is already clear that the major programs of the bill are working even beyond expectation.  Consider the 100,000 cops program. If this had been a typical grant program, the Federal Government would just now--at the end of the first fiscal year of funding--be preparing to issue the first awards.  The better part of a year would have been consumed drafting regulations and preparing application forms before money could finally be disbursed at the end of the year.  The implementation of the 1994 crime law stands in stark contrast to that typical scenario. Instead of requiring burdensome applications that often filled entire binders, one-page applications were developed. Instead of waiting until the end of the year to disburse the funds, the money was awarded in batches beginning only weeks after passage of the law.  As a result, we find ourselves at the end of the first year with nearly all the fiscal year's money out the door--all of the funds have already on their way to the States--and with more than 25,000 out of 100,000 cops already funded in every State in the Nation. In a word, the law is working.  In addition to the new police, the law's provisions combating violence against women are also working.  The first criminal has been tried and convicted under the new Federal violence against women statute, resulting in a life sentence for Christopher J. Bailey, who kidnaped and beat his wife nearly to death.  In addition--charges have already been filed in another case.  Every State has received a grant to increase police, prosecutors, and victim services to combat family violence.  Rape shield laws have been extended to protect more victims.  And women no longer have to pay for medical exams to prove they are raped--the victims of rape are finally being treated like the victims of any other crime.  These long overdue measures mean that women are now being protected--instead of further victimized--by the criminal justice system.  Another major accomplishment under the 1994 crime law is the military-style boot camp prisons: crime law dollars are already at work helping 27 States plan, build, and run military-style boot camp prisons for non-violent offenders.  Boot camp prisons allow States suffering from overcrowding problems to move non-violent prisoners into cheaper space--boot camps cost about one-third the price per bed than conventional prisons--thereby freeing up space for most violent offenders.  Yet another effort that is already underway is the drug court program--a long overdue program to finally crack down on the 600,000 drug-abusing offenders who are on our streets today, subject to no random drug testing, no mandatory treatment, and no threat of punishment.  The Justice Department has already funded efforts to help local officials plan 52 new drug courts, begin 5 new drug courts, and to expand 8 other drug court programs (including one in my home State of Delaware.)  Despite this concrete record of success, the conference report would eliminate the separately targeted $150 million drug court program and require states to fund drug courts, if at all, out of the money that could be spent on hiring cops on the beat. In real terms, this could mean that about 85,000 drug abusing offenders will not be subject to drug testing and mandatory treatment.  Other provisions of the 1994 Crime Law that are not affected by this bill are also proving to be very effective in combating crime, such as the provisions against sexual offenders, the death penalty provisions, the Brady Law, and the criminal alien provisions.  So, Mr. President, last year's crime bill has achieved an extraordinary measure of success during its first year in operation.  Yet, despite all of these accomplishments under the 1994 Crime Law, the anti-crime law is still under attack by the Republicans. Just as the entire scheme of anti-crime initiatives is taking hold, they would eliminate or dismantle many of the law's critical programs and reverse the progress that is being made.   So while it is important to note the success we are having in implementing the act, that is not enough.  We must also review at this point why the 1994 Crime Law represents the right approach to reducing the problem of violent crime in this country and why Republican proposals would prematurely divert us off the right track and unwisely point us in the wrong direction.                    The merits of the 1994 Crime Law  During the six-year period it took to enact this law, we undertook a major study and evaluation of the current system to pinpoint the weaknesses in anti-crime approaches. And for the first time, the Federal Government made a major commitment to help states and localities--where 95 percent of crime occurs and is prosecuted--redress the greatest shortcomings of our system.  In the course of the crime study, six key shortcomings of our current system became evident:  1. Most importantly, we do not have enough police out on the streets and in our neighborhoods.  2. We do not have enough prison cells for violent offenders --so they end up serving, on average nationwide, only 46 percent of their sentences.  3. We have not come up with an effective response to criminals who abuse drugs.  4. We do not treat family violence as serious crime.  5. Our police are outgunned by criminals.  6. And our nation's troubled children--who are growing up in a world of illegal drugs, guns, crime and violence--don't have safe places to go and lack positive activities to motivate them toward productive endeavors.  The comprehensive anti-crime bill passed by the congress last year was designed to address each of these key shortcomings.  This law is now providing an unprecedented infusion of Federal dollars to states and localities--to help them attack crime both at the back end--with more money for law enforcement and prisons; and at the front end--with more money for prevention programs that can help keep would-be criminals off the road to ruin in the first place.  The Crime Law reflects the primary lesson learned over the last decade as we studied crime and law enforcement--that all of the shortcomings in our system must be addressed together, that correcting one without the others is futile--because crime offers no single, easy answer.  I had hoped to spend this year watching over the smooth and speedy implementation of the law, while turning my focus to those substantial crime-related issues still before us--including a renewed fight against illegal drugs, and reform of our juvenile justice system as it struggles to deal with violent young criminals the current system was never designed to handle.  But instead of building upon the success the crime law already is having and moving forward to critical new challenges, the Congress of the United States is in full retreat. The House has already dismantled the crime law, and now the Senate will decide whether it will follow suit.  This premature about-face after finally putting in place the most comprehensive and carefully crafted set of anti-crime programs in our history is not only foolish but irresponsible.  We owe it to the American people to follow through with the measures we promised them and which they demanded for the past several years.  Let me address the merits of these programs.                       The 100,000 police program  Let me turn first to the central provision of the new law--the 100,000 cops on the beat program that I will fight with all my might to preserve.  I do not know a single responsible police leader, academic expert, or public official who does not agree that putting more police officers on our streets and in our neighborhoods is the best way to fight crime.  Community policing enables police to fight crime on two fronts at once--they are better positioned to respond and apprehend suspects when crime occurs, but even more importantly, they are also better positioned to keep crime from occurring in the first place.  I've seen this work in my home State of Delaware, where community policing in Wilmington takes the form of foot patrols aimed at breaking up the street-level drug dealing that had turned one Wilmington neighborhood into a crime zone.  These efforts successfully put a lid on drug activity, without displacing it to other parts of the city. In practice, community policing takes many forms, but regardless of the needs of particular communities, the reports from the field are the same--it works.  The 1994 crime law targets $8.8 billion for states and localities to train and hire 100,000 new community police officers over 6 years.  Now, we all remember the criticism last year of the 100,000 police program. The cops program won't work, Republicans in Congress said. They got Charlton Heston to say in national television ads that it would never happen, that we would never see more than 20,000 cops.  Well ``Moses'' could not have been more wrong. We already have 25,000 new local police officers on the streets of America--after only 1 year under the new law. And because of the way we've set it up--with a match requirement and spreading out the cost over a period of years--the money will continue to work, keeping these cops on the beat and preventing crime in our communities far into the future.  But that progress will come to a screeching halt if my Republicans colleagues get their way.  They have proposed and incorporated into this conference report a new law enforcement block grant--which has loopholes so big that it would permit all the money to be spent without hiring a single new police officer. Not one.  Read their proposal. Money is sent not to police but to mayors, and the money may be used not only for cops but also for other types of law enforcement officers or for many other purposes or initiatives. Moreover, the money could be used for other vaguely defined purposes such as ``equipment, technology and other material.''  Let me repeat--under the Republican proposal the dollars can be diverted to prosecutors, courts, or other law enforcement officials.  These may be worthy causes, but nothing in the Republican bill requires that even $1 be used to hire a single new police officer--and the one thing we know is that more community police officers means less crime.  Look at the language of this bill. Not even one new cop is required. All it says is that ``recipients are encouraged to use these funds to hire additional law enforcement officers.'' That's it. Encouraged.  Mr. President, American communities don't need our encouragement. They need more police.  We should not encourage the States to keep the commitment this Congress made to the American people. We should keep our word.  What this conference report does is take money that has been designated for cops on the beat and allows it to be used for a whole host of disparate purposes. That means only one thing for sure--the money will be wasted on things the Federal Government should not be funding. The great benefit of the 1994 crime law was that it gave States enough choice but also gave them enough direction. That direction is what differentiated this crime law from the failed crime laws of the past, yet that direction is precisely what this block grant throws out the window.  That is the major flaw of the Republican block grant.  I believe that the single most important thing our communities need when it comes to fighting crime is more police, and the current law guarantees our money will be used for just that purpose.  We should not abandon it 1 year after enacting it. We must save the 100,000 cops program to ensure that the money for police is used only for police.                             Prison grants  The second major shortcoming in the current system is prison space, and the prison program in the crime law we passed last year was designed to meet two goals:  First, to help States increase--and then use to maximum advantage--their supply of prison space; and second, to encourage States to adopt the kind of truth-in-sentencing system that has been instituted at the Federal level.  Today, prison systems in 34 States are under court order due to overcrowding.   Because there are not enough prison cells, many States are keeping violent criminals behind bars for only about half their sentences--46 percent is the nationwide average.  Worse yet, 30,000 offenders who, each year, are convicted of a violent crime are not even sentenced to prison.  The 1994 crime law is helping States respond to this problem with a $9.7 billion grant program.  Under the 1994 law, States can use the money to build and operate additional secure prison cells for violent criminals--or for boot camp prisons for non-violent offenders, thereby freeing up secure prison spaces for violent criminals.  Let me tell you about these boot camps. Today, 160,000 young, nonviolent, minor offenders are behind bars in costly prison cells. That just does not make sense.  So the law encourages States to make the most efficient use of existing prison cells--by putting violent offenders in the most expensive cells, and housing nonviolent, minor offenders at one-third the cost of conventional prison space in military-style boot camps.  I am encouraged that the Republicans' prison proposal permits States to use this funding for boot camp prisons--that is an important change from the house-passed appropriations bill.                Key problems with conference prison plan  One key problem with the Republican prison plan is that the plan permits States only to build or expand prisons--leaving out the ability to spend these funds to operate prisons.  This just does not make sense, when the 1994 prison provisions were written, we heard several States had already built prisons, but could not open these prisons because of a lack of operating funds.  A close look at the fine print of this bill reveals what I believe is one of its most troubling aspects. While $617 million is appropriated for the prison grants in the conference report, the Republican conferees raided $200 million of that to fund prisons in just 7 or 8 States.  Let me explain--the bill directly funds $300 million to reimburse States for the costs of housing criminal aliens in State prisons. This was a provision included in the 1994 crime law, and I support this goal. But, on top of that $300 million in direct appropriations to reimburse States for incarcerating criminal aliens, language was slipped into the bill so that an additional $200 million was shifted from the general prison grants for all states to the criminal alien reimbursement program.  So I point out to my colleagues--if you are not from Arizona, Florida, Texas, Illinois, New York, New Jersey, California, or Michigan--funds that should have gone to building prisons in your State have been stolen by this conference report.  This is outrageous, I support the need to reimburse States for these costs, but the 1994 crime law recognized that crime is plaguing all states not just a few of our Nation's largest border States.                      Fighting drug related crime  The third major shortcoming of our current system is the failure to limit drug-related crime.  The new law provides money for specialized drug courts to target low-level drug offenders who are out on the streets breaking into cars and stealing to support their habits.  In most communities, these offenders are now largely ignored by our system. They do not go to prison and they are not required to comply with drug testing or get treatment.  Most are simply sent right back out on the streets on largely unsupervised probation--and they go right back to the cycle of drug use and crime to support their drug use.  The heart of the problem is that, just like the prison populations, the probation and parole populations have exploded. More than 3.5 million offenders--half of them drug addicts--are now living in their communities under the nominal supervision of courts or corrections officers.  According to the Justice Department, of the roughly 1.4 million drug-abusing offenders on probation, only 800,000 are subject to some drug testing or drug treatment. The remaining 600,000 drug-addicted offenders are on our Nation's streets each day, unsupervised, untested, with no fear of punishment. They are accidents waiting to happen.  Many of these probationers are high-rate offenders. Hard-core addicts are estimated to commit up to 200 crimes a year to support their habits.  As the number of probation officers has not kept pace with the growth in the probation population, probation caseloads now average 118 offenders.  In some areas, caseloads can exceed 200.  With so many offenders, officers are able to conduct only minimal supervision at best--perhaps 15 minutes a week.  We know who these people are. Judges and probation officers have their names and addresses. So why do we ignore them?  Drug courts are designed to take these offenders and their crimes seriously--offenders face random drug testing and mandatory treatment. And, if they slip back into drugs--they go to jail.  Yet the Republican proposal totally eliminates drug courts. The bill wipes out all funding. We must preserve the necessary money to fund the drug courts.                          Prevention programs  I turn now to an issue that has been the subject of more misinformation and outright mischaracterization than perhaps any other in the crime debate--whether we should work to prevent crime before it happens, instead of waiting until after the shots are fired, until after our children become addicted to drugs, until after more Americans' lives are ruined.  The anticrime law enacted last year answered that question unapolo-getically.  In addition to fighting crime, the law made a commitment to preventing crime--a commitment supported by virtually every criminologist, every legal scholar, every sociologist, every psychologist, every medical authority, and simple common sense.  Those who study this issue agree that breaking the cycle of violence and crime requires an investment in the lives of our children--with support and guidance to help them reject the violence and anarchy of the streets in favor of taking positive responsibility for their lives.  Prevention is also what cops want--what virtually everyone in law enforcement wants.  Every police officer I have talked to, every prosecutor, every prison warden, every probation officer, says the same thing--we can't do it alone. And we can't do it all after the fact.  And listen to local officials--the very people the Republicans say they want to give greater voice: Republican mayors Giuliani of New York and Riordan of Los Angeles say this: [B]y funding proven prevention programs for young people, the crime bill offers hope--hope that in the future we can reduce the need for so many police officers and jails.  Listen to Paul Helmke, the Republican mayor of Fort Wayne, IN: [I]t's a lot less expensive to do things on the prevention side than on the police side.  This unity among law enforcement was the force that drove the prevention programs into the 1994 crime law and into the appropriations bill as passed by the Senate just a few months ago. We need to give these programs a chance. If after a few years the prevention programs in the anti-crime law do not work, I will be first in line to change it.  The 1994 crime law sets aside $5.4 billion to give States money--and flexibility--to implement many types of crime prevention programs that have proven track records of success.  As part of that money, $30 million is allocated to fund crime prevention programs such as TRIAD and boys and girls clubs and other local initiatives.  The TRIAD programs are the joint efforts of sheriffs, police chiefs and senior citizens--practical cooperation that helps combat crime against our elderly citizens.  In hundreds of public housing projects across the country, boys and girls clubs give kids a safe place to hang out after school--a place with positive activities and positive role models.  A recent, independent evaluation has reported that housing projects with clubs experience 13 percent fewer juvenile crimes, 22 percent less drug activity, and 25 percent less crack use, than do projects without clubs.   Other local prevention programs are having great success as well. For example, in honolulu, professionals identify families at risk for neglect or abuse when children are born and then visit their homes regularly over several years to help parents learn to care for their children. In Houston, TX, a core of professionals provides one-on-one counseling, mentoring, tutoring, job training and crisis-intervention services to students at risk of dropping out.  Although many communities are putting their best foot forward, the need and demand for prevention programs far outpace the supply.  And yet the Republicans have eliminated the separately targeted funding for these programs and thrown them into the block grant--a move some charge is cold-hearted and mean. But I say it's just plain dumb.  The prevention money in the crime law is an investment in our future that we simply cannot afford not to make--not when we are spending $25 billion to lock people up every year.  And there are issues here even more important than money, because the commitment that we make today will define us as a nation tomorrow.  Prisons, though essential, are a testament to failure: they are the right place for people gone wrong.  On the other hand, when a life about to go wrong is set back on the right track--that is a testament to hope.  We build hope by showing children that they matter, by challenging disaffection with affection and respect, and by contrasting the dead-end of violence with the opportunity for a constructive life.  That's why we need to restore the separate funding for these prevention programs, in addition to the funding for the 100,000 cops program.                               Conclusion  In concluding, I want to reiterate that in its breadth, the 1994 anticrime law reflects the lessons learned over the last decade as we studied crime and law enforcement and worked on passing this law.  And in its approach, as well as in many specifics, the law was the result of bi-partisan efforts.  We should not retreat now on this tough but smart crime package that already is hard at work in preventing violent crime across the country. And we should not retreat on the 100,000 cops program that we insisted on just a few months ago.  Let me also point out that the $30 billion crime law trust fund that uses the savings from cutting 272,000 Federal bureaucrats (160,000 have already left) pays for every cop, every prison cell, every shelter for a battered woman and her children that is provided for in the crime law--without adding to the deficit or requiring new taxes.  That was the deal we made right here on the Senate floor 1 year ago. Yet now my Republican colleagues are trying to back out on the deal by refusing to write the checks for next year's funding of the crime law.  I have tried today to outline my objections to the Republicans retreat--in this conference report--on the key provisions of the anticrime law enacted last year.  So I urge my colleagues to consider very carefully whether this is the right forum and the right idea to dismantle these vital parts of the already successful and highly popular crime law.  In the end, I suspect that the merits will speak for themselves and the american people will decide whether it is a good idea to debilitate the Crime Law just as it is showing clear signs of success.  This program is a very bad idea. I expect we are going to get to debate this again. So in light of that, and in light of the fact I have no more time--I am sorry. My staff is now fired. They gave me a note saying before I had 3 minutes, and now I see it is 30 minutes. But I will yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.
