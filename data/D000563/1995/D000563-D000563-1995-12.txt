Speaker, when the Republicans failed to pass the necessary appropriations bills, they precipitated a crisis last month which led to the longest Government shutdown in our Nation's history. The Government shutdown cost American taxpayers $100 million a day because Mr. Gingrich and the Republican leaders failed to pass a spending bill to keep the Government open. That sort of tragedy should not be repeated, and yet, tomorrow, it may be.  We now have another threat from the Republican leadership to close down the Government again, this time to send home some 300,000 Federal employees and once again leave the American taxpayers holding the bag.  Mr. Gingrich insists that closing down the Government and sending home these employees is a matter of principle. Let me suggest something to the Speaker. It is a matter of principle if your paycheck is on the line, not if the paychecks of 300,000 Federal employees are on the line.  Mr. Gingrich, you can put your paycheck on the line by supporting my bill: No budget, no pay. If Congress fails to keep the Government open, Congress does not get paid.  Mr. Gingrich has killed this bill five times. We have to push forward to make sure that Congress does the responsible thing.                          ____________________
