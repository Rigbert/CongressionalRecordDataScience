 Personally, I have always appreciated John's candor and clear advice. He possesses something crucial--the ability to understand the world the way it is. He knows that there are many threats to American interests and that those threats will not recede if we retreat. He understands that American leadership is essential to keeping these threats and enemies at bay and that our partners and allies rarely act without us.  John appreciates the need to stand up to adversaries like Putin's Russia, to approach them from a position of strength, and to hold them accountable for their lies and their misdeeds.  I wish him well wherever his career next takes him.  Of course, the President deserves to choose his own team, and he has assembled a strong one. He and our Nation are well served by leaders such as Secretary Pompeo, Secretary Esper, and Director Haspel.  I hope the President selects a National Security Advisor who will work well with these seasoned national security leaders who have been chosen by the President and confirmed by the Senate.                          ____________________
