 President, I rise today to honor Elizabeth Snyder, a longtime civic leader who helped pave the way for women to assume positions of leadership in California. She died in Los Angeles on August 26, 1998.  Elizabeth first came to national attention in 1954, when she was elected Chair of the California Democratic Party, becoming the first woman in the United States to be elected chair of a major political party in any state. In a career that spanned more than half a century, Elizabeth worked prominently in the California presidential campaigns of Harry Truman, Adlai Stevenson, and Lyndon Johnson and served as the California Co-Chair of President Jimmy Carter's 1976 Presidential campaign.  Born on April 8, 1914, in Minnesota of immigrant parents, Elizabeth and her family moved to San Diego in the early 1920s. Following the collapse of her father's business at the outset of the Great Depression, Elizabeth, her mother and two brothers relocated to East Los Angeles where life was, in her words, ``lean, precarious and hard.'' Elizabeth graduated with honors from Garfield High School in 1931. She studied at Los Angeles City College and graduated as a political science major from the University of California at Los Angeles in 1933. She went on to become one of the first two doctoral candidates in UCLA's political science department.  After World War II, Elizabeth became involved in the first of many Congressional campaigns on behalf of her lifelong friend and mentor, Congressman Chet Holifield. In 1959, she co-founded one of California's first political campaign management firms, Snyder-Smith. Although she remained committed to what she believed were the true ideals and principles of the Democratic Party, Elizabeth never hesitated in non-partisan races to support Republicans whom she believed to be best qualified to serve in office.  None of her political activities was more important to Elizabeth than her lifelong effort to bring about greater participation by women in the political arena. During the 1970s, Elizabeth devoted herself to the mentoring of Los Angeles women in politics, holding weekly luncheon meetings of The Thursday Group at her Bunker Hill apartment.  Her dedication to improving our society extended beyond the realm of politics. She was especially proud of her work on the prevention of fetal alcohol syndrome which culminated in ordinances requiring the restaurants and bars to post warnings to women regarding the dangers of alcohol consumption during pregnancy. In addition to all her varied civic activities, Elizabeth will be remembered fondly by the literally thousands of men and women to whom she provided comfort and assistance in overcoming the adversities of alcoholism and substance abuse.  In 1994, she received the prestigious CORO Public Affairs Award in recognition of her lifelong commitment to the reform of the American system of government in which she so deeply believed. As Elizabeth herself once wrote, In the last analysis, the most significant single political activity is not winning elections and defeating opponents, it is improving, expanding and correcting government structure, so that democracy works.  On behalf of my colleagues in the Senate, I extend my heartfelt condolences to her husband, Nathan, and her daughter, United States District Judge, Christina A. Snyder.                          ____________________
