 Since the enactment of the King Range Act in 1970, property owners Linda Smith Franklin and Mary Smith Etter have been granted access to their land by the Bureau of Land Management via the Smith-Etter Road. This legislation has designated the Smith-Etter Road as providing access to private property owners and their invitees. It is my understanding that nothing in this act should in any way alter the access currently granted to Franklin and Etter under existing policies. I believe that Franklin and Etter should continue to receive the access that they currently enjoy.  On the subject of fire suppression in this same area, I note that this act provides the land management agencies with the necessary flexibility to conduct fire suppression activities to protect human life and property. For example, in the King Range Honeydew fire in 2003, which resulted in 14,000 acres of fire damage in the King Range Conservation Area, the Bureau of Land Management authorized a fire truck and a 3-member crew to be stationed at the bottom of Telegraph Ridge, within a four mile range of the Franklin property in order to allow easy, quick access to the Franklin property in the event that fire suppression activities were warranted. As a result, firefighters were able to fend off the fire and prevent damage to the Franklin property. It is my understanding that nothing in this Act would prevent BLM from continuing this practice when so warranted by fire danger.  Do my colleagues share my understanding of these access and fire suppression issues in the King Range?
