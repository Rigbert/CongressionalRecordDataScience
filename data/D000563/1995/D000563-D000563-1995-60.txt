Speaker, there are many items and subjects debated on the floor of the House, as the previous speaker indicated, from the O.J. Simpson trial to some items that are considered to be very parochial, very regional, very specific.  But there will be a debate on the floor of the House this week which I am afraid has not caught the attention of the American people. The reason I have this fear is because of the gravity and importance of this debate, not only to tens of millions of senior citizens across America, but to all of their families as well.  You can measure the importance of an item in the U.S. House of Representatives by the time we dedicate to that item, in most cases, but not when it comes to this Gingrich Medicare reform. Take a look at this chart as an indication of the time that we have spent in committee hearing on the Medicare reform plan of Newt Gingrich.  Well, we spent 10 days looking into Ruby Ridge. We spent 10 days looking into Waco. We have spent 28 days of committee hearings on Whitewater. And how many days have we spent on a $270 billion cut in Medicare? Look closely. One. One day.  The fact of the matter is that even as of this weekend, we are just learning what is included in this bill; a bill which will literally affect every family in America.  My mother is 86 years old. She lives by herself. She has had some medical problems. Thank goodness for Medicare. It's been there when she needed it, and that story is told over and over again. She is happy, but equally important, her family is happy.  As her son, and my brothers, we are all very content that she is under Medicare and has quality health care available to her and a quality of life, which was not around 30 years ago.  So, the Republicans come to the floor and say, We are just trying to preserve Medicare. Well, excuse me if I am skeptical. Medicare was created by the Democrats. A person like Bob Dole voted against the Medicare plan when it was originally proposed, and many Republicans did as well.  This plan for Medicare has been in place for 30 years, a creation of the Democrats, has worked and worked well. We fear, many of us on the Democratic side of the aisle, that the Gingrich Medicare reform plan is a disaster.  Mr. Speaker, I think the Republicans know it as well. They will not bring it out in the light of day. They will not let us see the details of it. They will not let us have committee hearings. They will not even let us offer but one amendment, one substitute. They are talking about maybe 2 hours of debate on the floor of the House for something that could literally affect American families for decades to come.  Let me tell my colleagues several of the things they should know about it. The Republicans want to cut $270 billion out of Medicare spending. They say that is to save Medicare. That is not what the trustees say.  The trustees say we need to reduce spending by $90 billion, one-third of the amount. Why did they triple the cuts to increase premiums for seniors, to reduce the services available? They need the money for other purposes, and the purposes are very clear. They want to create a tax-break package. A package which, frankly, goes way beyond what working families need.  It is a tax-break package primarily for the wealthiest people in this country: $245 billion dollars. Nothing new. This is the old Republican philosophy. The big business philosophy. The trickle-down philosophy. If you give enough money to the wealthiest people in this country, the Republicans believe that somehow it will eventually get down to working families.  Well, I applaud them for their consistency, even though they have been proven wrong historically and economically. But here they go again. To find the money for it, they want to cut Medicare.  The other thing that troubles me greatly is if you talk to people who receive Medicare payments, the providers, you will find that by and large they are honest and ethical people who are working hard to provide good quality health care, and God bless them for their hard work.  But they will also acknowledge that there are a lot of wrongdoers as well. One to two percent of the people who turn in bills to Medicare are frankly trying to rip-off the Government through fraud and waste and abuse. We know it and we know it costs us dearly.  We estimate 10 percent of all Medicare billing each year is fraudulent; $18 billion lost that should be spent to help people and reduce our deficit. We have had some tough laws on the books. They should get tougher. But know what? The Gingrich Republican approach on Medicare reform lightens the load; makes it harder to prove fraud on the part of those who would try to rip-off the system.  They say it is a sweetheart deal which the Speaker cut with some of the interest groups. I do not know if it is or not, but the bottom line is the Federal prosecutors who have looked at the Republican Medicare reform plan have come to the conclusion that it is going to make it tougher to go after the wrongdoers. That is not fair and it is not fair to the seniors and it is not fair to the taxpayers.  Mr. Speaker, I hope the people of the United States will tune into this debate this week. The Republicans have tried to keep it under wraps. Now it is time to bring it out into the light of day and make sure America knows what is in store for them if these Gingrich Medicare reform plans go through.                          ____________________
