 President, I rise as a cosponsor of this amendment. Very simply, this amendment will change the name of the Walla Walla Veterans Medical Center in Walla Walla, WA to the Jonathan M. Wainwright Memorial VA Medical Center.  General Wainwright was born at Fort Walla Walla and was a member of the 1st cavalry after graduating from West Point. He served in France during World War I and was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor in 1945 by President Truman for his service in World War II. He spent nearly 4 years in a prisoner of war camp in the Philippines and was known as the hero of Bataan and Corregidor. General Wainwright was a true war hero and won the praise and respect of all Americans.  Mr. President, the people of Walla Walla, WA want this name change to honor a war veteran and local hero. In May, they are dedicating a statue in his honor and would like to dedicate the name change of the hospital at the same time. The entire Washington State congressional delegation supports this change. And all of the veterans service organizations in Washington State support the change.  I urge my colleagues to support changing the name of the Walla Walla Veterans Medical Center to the Jonathan M. Wainwright Memorial VA Medical Center, and to allow this war hero the recognition he so rightly deserves.
