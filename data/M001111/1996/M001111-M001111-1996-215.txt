  While Congressman Roberts continues to push for his proposal to decouple farm payments, I am committed to maintaining a safety net for our farmers. Coupling payments to both production and the marketplace is a good way to preserve the safety net. Farm payments should occur when prices are low so our farmers can sustain their capacity to produce. When prices are high, the market can and will sustain our farmers.  Payments should also be tied to production. Farm payments should be given to those working the land today, not simply to those who have received payments in the past. When Congress authorized the 1990 farm bill it was understood that the program was voluntary. That is to say, you only needed to be farming in order to be eligible to participate. Now the Republican proposal requires participation over the last 5 years in order to continue participating. The farm programs would not longer be open to anyone currently farming, but only to those who had participated between 1990 and 1995, regardless of whether or not they were still farming.  I also think we should preserve the permanent authority for farm programs embodied in the 1949 agriculture law. In my opinion, repeal of the 1949 law sends a clear message that our historic commitment to the farmers of our Nation is ending. We must preserve this law as a constant reminder of our ongoing commitment to maintaining a stable food supply for our Nation. Preserving permanent authority for farm programs also recognizes the vital role that agriculture plays, and will continue to play, in this Nation's economy.  I am frustrated that Congress has failed to recognize the vital importance of agriculture to our economy. We must maintain our commitment to farmers, and farm programs must be tied to production and marketplace. I am willing to work with my fellow Members to act quickly on a farm bill that provides certainty and security to our farmers, both now and in the future.  In addition, I feel the farm bill should not be broken up so that food stamps and conservation programs are not addressed in conjunction with the commodity programs. The simultaneous consideration of these areas of farm policy represent a balanced approach that recognizes the obligations of our Nation not only to our farmers, but also to our poor and our environment. While the farm bill is designed to enhance and ensure the bountiful production of food from our land, it must also address the distribution of that bounty to those of our Nation in need. With all the food we produce, we must make sure it gets to the millions of hungry mouths in our cities and towns. While we help farmers to cultivate their land, we must also encourage them to preserve it when and where appropriate. USDA's Conservation Reserve Program is twice the size of the USFWS National Wildlife Refuge Program. The contributions of this program to the preservation of wetlands, woodlands, and wildlife cannot be understated.  As the debate over the farm bill continues, I am committed to working for these principles and to look out for the best interests of the hard working families on the farms of my great State of Washington.                          ____________________
