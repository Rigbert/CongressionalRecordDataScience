This is an environmental rider that is part of the Interior appropriations bill. The administration said that it is 1 of the 13 riders--I think there are 9 remaining--which would be the basis of a veto of the legislation. I want to make sure the Record is clear and ask the Senator from Washington several questions.  In every instance when she referred to mining, are we talking about mining on public land?
