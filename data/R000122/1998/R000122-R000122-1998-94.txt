President, I rise today to submit an editorial on U.S. policy toward Cuba written by my esteemed predecessor, the Honorable Claiborne Pell. The editorial was printed in the May 5, 1998 edition of the Providence Journal Bulletin.  Senator Pell served in the United States Senate for thirty-six years. While in the Senate, he served as Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations for eight years. Senator Pell's remarkable career also included eight years of service as a State Department Official and Foreign Service Officer as well as the United States Representative to the 25th and 51st Sessions of the United Nations General Assembly. Senator Pell's positions have taken him to Cuba on three occasions, most recently in early May. Senator Pell's observations of American foreign policy toward Cuba have led him to the conclusion that continuing the 38 year embargo on Cuba will not destabilize the Castro regime and is hurting the Cuban people.  In his editorial, Senator Pell makes a number of insightful points. I hope all my colleagues will take the opportunity to read this piece by an expert in foreign relations and seriously consider his observations regarding relations with our neighbor.  Mr. President, I ask that the editorial from the Providence Journal Bulletin be printed in the Record.  The editorial follows:          [From the Providence Journal-Bulletin, May 5, 1998]                     Our Cuba Policy Has Not Worked       One can only hope that the small but significant changes in      U.S. policy toward Cuba that President Clinton announced in      late March portend more sweeping changes in the months ahead      toward a more rational, more self-interested and more      effective U.S. policy.       Having just returned from a five-day visit to Cuba with a      distinguished group of Americans, I am more convinced than      ever that our existing policy, built around the 38-year-old      embargo of Cuba, simply doesn't work.       The embargo upsets the Cuban government and hurts the Cuban      people, but, from our discussions with an array of Cuban      government officials, religious and dissident leaders and      foreign diplomat observers, one thing emerged clearly: The      Cuban economy is strong enough to limp along for the      foreseeable future. There is no evidence at all to suggest      that U.S. economic sanctions are any more likely to      destabilize the Castro regime in the near future than they      have been over the past 38 years.       Cuba is now some six years into what the regime      euphemistically calls the ``special period,'' the time of      economic distress that began with the collapse of the Soviet      Union. Cuba lost its preferential trading arrangement with      Moscow and the other former communist republics of Eastern      Europe, and was left to fend for itself.       If U.S. economic pressure was ever to work, that was the      time. But Cuba has muddled through. In moves that must have      been bitter pills for Castro to swallow, Cuba ``dollarized''      its economy, allowed private farmers' markets and other      small-scale private enterprises, and offered more favorable      terms for foreign investment.       As a result, the Cuban economy, in free fall during 1993,      has started to come around. The evidence abounds in Havana.      Not only tourists, but all Cubans can purchase an array of      consumer goods in ``dollar stores'' that are prevalent in      Havana. When we asked one government official how Cubans with      no access to dollars can survive, he shot back: ``Who doesn't      have dollars?''       One exquisite irony is that this dollar-focused Cuban      economy is now in part propped up by an annual deluge of      dollars, estimated at $600 million to $1 billion, that      arrives in Cuba from the United States, primarily from Cuban-     Americans anxious to make life easier for their relatives.      Whatever pain the embargo causes is offset by this dollar      flow, which they will likely increase with the restoration of      legal remittances.       Tourism has expanded greatly since I last visited Cuba 10      years ago, and brings both much needed hard currency and less      desirable consequences, including prostitution, which seems      widespread in parts of Havana after dark. Our delegation      visited only Havana and we were told that times are tougher      in the smaller cities and the countryside. But the Cuban      economy has clearly recovered and, while it could benefit      from many more reforms, there is no sign it will collapse.       Cuba is still very much an authoritarian state with tight      state control over all aspects of society, including public      debate. One day, I visited a showplace medical campus where      very interesting neurological research is being conducted.      The center was equipped with what appeared to be      sophisticated computers and has its own ``web site.''       Next, I sat with a group of dissidents and asked about      their access to the Internet. ``We can't use the Internet,''      one said. ``We cannot even have computers; they just take      them away.''       Yet I felt a much greater openness in Havana this time than      in my last visit, and certainly than in 1974, when Sen. Jacob      Javits (the late U.S. Republican senator from New York) and I      were among the first members of Congress to visit since the      revolution. Back then, we were shadowed everywhere we went,      were confident our hotel rooms were bugged, and sensed a real      oppressiveness in the city. In those days, the infamous      Committees for the Defense of the Revolution were an      effective neighborhood spy network; today, they seem more a      network of aging busybodies. Havana is certainly not a free      city, but it has a liveliness and verve that startled me.       On this trip, everywhere we went people still were abuzz      about the visit of the Pope. Church leaders do not know yet      whether the visit, of which virtually all Cubans seemed      immensely proud, will lead to much greater openness. But      colleagues of mine went to Mass on Sunday at a Jesuit church      in a rundown section of the city, and described a vibrant      community with an abundance of     young adults worshipping with pride and intensity. The      dissidents we met reported that a substantial number of      political offenders have been freed and the atmosphere seems      to them ``more relaxed.''       Cuba's repressive communist regime has survived, if not      thrived, for 38 years in economic isolation from the United      States. When a policy has failed that long, isn't it time to      try something else? In my view, a policy of contact, trade,      cultural exchanges and dialogue, just as we had with the      communist states of Europe, could well lead to a more open,      free-market economy and more political diversity in Cuba.      Even if it doesn't, it won't be any less effective than the      policy we've been following these past 38 years.                          ____________________
