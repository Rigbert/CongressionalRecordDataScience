 When the President put his deficit reduction package down, the three of us voted for it but we could not get anybody else to vote for it because we did not dare to say we were raising taxes on the very wealthy among us, we did not dare to go back and say we were going to cap spending for social programs, et cetera. So it was easier to let the debt accumulate and the incentive was to shunt it off to our children.  My question is this: Will we not just be supplanting that incentive to shove off onto our children debt that we do not want to meet and instead shove off on our children the lack of the infrastructure they are going to need to be able to compete?  How many people in here are going to go home and say in New Jersey, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, wherever, ``By the way, the reason why I voted against providing more money for education is because we think that the Port of Wilmington and the Port of Camden need an investment of 12 new cranes which are going to cost a half-a-billion dollars, because in order for us to be able to compete with the Germans, we have to be able to export more to Europe of the automobiles that we are building.  How many people are going to find that their town meeting folks are going to say, ``Now let me get this straight, you mean to tell me my kid is not going to have as much money for school this year or for a college loan program this year or for tuition this year because you are telling me you invested so my grandkid will be able to compete with the Germans 10 years from now?''  Has anything in the political experience of the Senator from New Jersey led him to believe that will be the norm for American politicians?
