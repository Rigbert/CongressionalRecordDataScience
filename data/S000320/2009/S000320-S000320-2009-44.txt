 President, today I pay tribute to John A. Garrett, an honorable Alabamian and a good friend of mine. On Sunday, May 10, 2009, John A. will celebrate his 100th birthday.  John A. was born in 1909 in Bay Minnette, AL. He graduated from Alabama Polytechnic Institute, now known as Auburn University, in 1936, the same year that he married the love of his life, Katherine Virginia Stowers, at the Snowdoun United Methodist Church in Montgomery. Together, they have two daughters, Kitty Walter Dawson and Mary John, a son-in-law Sim Byrd, three grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.  Most people in Alabama know John A. for his many contributions to Alabama's agriculture industry. During the 1950s, he served as the State director of commodity services for the Alabama Farm Bureau. Later, he would go on to own and operate Cherokee Builders, an industrial and commercial construction business.  In 1969, he was appointed by President Nixon to serve as the director of the Alabama Farmer's Home Administration, a position he would hold until 1977. In the early 1970s, John A. became a nationally recognized leader on agricultural and water issues. Later, at the age of 68, John A. established the Alabama Rural Water Association, an organization of which he served as executive director for 17 years.  An avid leader, John A. is the recipient of many honors and awards. In 1970, John A. was designated an Honorary State Farmer by the Future Farmers of America. Two years later, he relieved the ACTION Federal Employee Distinguished Voluntary Service Award for his extraordinary volunteer service. In 1985, Auburn University honored John A. for his outstanding services on the Montgomery County Auburn Committee. He was named Alabama Arthritis Foundation Humanitarian of the Year in 1989 and was inducted into the Alabama Senior Citizens Hall of Fame in 1991.  John A. is also known for his wit and wisdom. In addition to authoring numerous poems, John A. penned the secrets to a wonderful life: a positive attitude and thinking, clean living, and ``Toddy Time'' every afternoon. Indeed, Congress should live by his rules.  Today, John A. remains very active in his community. He attends the monthly meetings of the Snowdoun community, Snowdoun Volunteer Fire Department, Montgomery County Alfa, and the Alabama Cattlemen's Association. John A. can also frequently be found greeting the visitors at his gift shop on Mulberry Street or riding on his farm and tending to his cattle.  On the day of his 100th birthday, John A. will be celebrated by his friends and family, and honored for his dedication and many contributions to Alabama. I wish him much luck in his future endeavors, and I ask this entire Senate to join me in recognizing and honoring the life of my good friend John A. Garrett.                          ____________________
