 I am talking about the McCain amendment. The Senator from Virginia was making the point that even if it were otherwise a desirable thing to do, this is the wrong place to do it and runs the risk of having this bill blue-slipped in the House.  On the substance of the McCain issue, virtually everybody in the Senate is in favor of enhanced disclosure, greater disclosure. That is hardly a controversial subject. But to single out 527s only, I would say to my colleagues--to single out 527s only leaves out such groups as the Sierra Club and the AFL-CIO, which do not operate under section 527.  I have long believed we ought to have broad, comprehensive disclosure. I would be in favor of addressing this issue this year. But we ought to do it in a comprehensive way, I say to my friend from Virginia, not leave out some of the major players on the American political scene, many of whom are on the airwaves right now, beating up Republican candidates for the Senate.  From the more comprehensive approach, it is my understanding the Senator from Virginia may well have an alternative to offer that would give all of us an opportunity to go on record in favor of a more evenhanded, comprehensive, across-the-board disclosure provision that would not eliminate some of the principal players on the American political scene--ironically, most of whom are hostile to Republicans.
