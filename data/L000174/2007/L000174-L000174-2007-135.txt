President, I spoke last week in this Chamber about the political crisis in Burma where thousands of Buddhist monks, joined by an estimated 100,000 other Burmese citizens, peacefully protested for an end to military dictatorship.  Despite appeals for restraint by governments around the world, as well as the U.N. Secretary General, they were met with brute force. Soldiers firing live bullets and wielding clubs killed and injured an undetermined number of unarmed civilians, including at least one foreign journalist, and there are reports that hundreds, and possibly thousands, of monks have been beaten, killed or jailed.  The atrocities perpetrated by the Burmese generals are crimes against humanity. They should be indicted and prosecuted by the International Criminal Court.  Sooner or later they will be made to pay for the appalling brutality that has been witnessed on television by hundreds of millions of people around the world.  The United States has imposed economic sanctions on the Burmese government for many years, thanks in large measure to the tireless efforts of Senator McConnell who, for the better part of two decades, has called for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi, Burma's rightful leader.  Additional sanctions were announced, belatedly, by President Bush last week. But far more pressure is needed, particularly to convince Burma's trading partners, like China, India and Thailand, to cut their economic ties to Burma. It is thanks in large part to them that the Burmese generals owe their power and wealth.  The crisis in Burma today tarnishes any government that values its financial interests over freedom for the Burmese people. For two decades, they have chafed under the iron grip of a clique of corrupt generals who have shown, year after year, that they belong in the category of ruthless despots who will stop at nothing, including mass murder, to perpetuate their control.  Lasting economic, social and political stability in Burma can only begin once the Burmese generals relinquish power. How that comes about is their choice. We have seen the results of peaceful protest. Not even civil disobedience, just peaceful protest. Time and again it has been met with deadly force.  Those Nations that continue to do business with Burma make a mockery of their own professed commitment to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. There is no truer test of their commitment to those fundamental principles than how they respond to the slaughter of unarmed monks and civilians by a regime that is apparently unconcerned that their crimes are being televised to the world.  Whether this year, next year, or thereafter, the Burmese junta's days are numbered. Where do Burma's trading partners want to be then--on the right side of history, or having propped up an illegitimate regime until its last gasps?  No government can claim perfection in its respect for human rights, including my own government. We have made mistakes, and it has damaged our credibility as a nation that was instrumental in the creation of the Universal Declaration.  But our own shortcomings are no excuse for other governments' actions to block U.N. resolutions condemning the crackdown in Burma or their refusal to join us in imposing economic sanctions that could deal a death blow to a tyrannical regime.  And it is certainly no excuse for continuing to do lucrative business deals with a government whose officials pocket the profits for themselves while they starve, imprison and murder their people.  It is a testament to the spirit of the Burmese people, and to the courage of Aung San Suu Kyi, that despite so many years of repression, they remain as defiant and as dedicated to the ideals of democracy as ever. Our moral responsibility, the world's responsibility, is to support them.                          ____________________
