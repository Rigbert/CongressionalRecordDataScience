I want to offer my praise for him because we are going to vote on final passage of the fiscal year 2020 Senate Commerce, Justice, and Science appropriations bill, the Agriculture appropriations bill, the Interior appropriations bill, and the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development appropriations bill. I urge all Members to vote aye.  These are good, bipartisan bills. They show that despite whatever political atmosphere we operate in, the Appropriations Committee can put partisan politics aside and do our work on behalf of the American people.  These bills make responsible investments that build on what we were able to accomplish in fiscal year 2019 while strongly rejecting the shortsighted cuts the Trump administration proposed. They back up our commitment to invest in rural communities and farms, law enforcement, and the environment.  We have reached this point because we worked together quietly during evenings and weekends to get it done. I want to thank the chairs and the ranking members of the subcommittees for their work: Senators Hoeven and Merkley, Senators Murkowski and Udall, Senators Collins and Reed, and Senators Moran and Shaheen.  I have often said that Senators are merely constitutional impediments to their staff, and Senator Shelby and I are lucky to have such a staff. They have worked very long days and nights.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the list of the staff, both Republicans and Democrats, who deserve our thanks.       There being no objection, the material was ordered to be      printed in the Record, as follows:   Vice Chairman Leahy List for H.R. 3055 (Minibus #2) Staff for the                                  Record       Charles Kieffer, Chanda Betourney, Jessica Berry, Jay      Tilton, Hannah Chauvin, Olivia Matthews, Dianne Nellor, Jean      Toal Eisen, Rachael Taylor, Dabney Hegg, Adrienne      Wojciechowski, Bob Ross, Teri Curtin, Jennifer Eskra, Blaise      Sheridan, Elisabeth Coats, Ryan Hunt, Melissa Zimmerman,      Faisal Amin, Jessi Axe, Christina Monroe, Shannon Hines,      Jonathan Graffeo, David Adkins, Margaret Pritchard, Morgan      Ulmer, Hamilton Bloom, Emy Lesofski, Clare Doherty, Patrick      Carroll, Elizabeth Dent, Anna Lanier Fischer, Amber Beck,      Allen Cutler, Matt Womble, Sydney Crawford, Lucas Agnew, Nona      McCoy, Gus Maples, Rajat Mathur, LaShawnda Smith, Jason      Woolwine, Courtney Young, Valerie Hutton, Elmer Barnes, Penny      Myles, Karin Thames, Bob Putnam, Jenny Winkler, Christy      Greene, George Castro
