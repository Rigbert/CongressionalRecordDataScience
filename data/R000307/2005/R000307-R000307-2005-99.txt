The Senator knows me well enough to know that when I say I am not accusing him personally of anything that would be inappropriate, I have stated I am talking about open discussion of intelligence information, quite frankly, not only in this nomination process but in the Intelligence Authorization Act in regard to a whole series of other subjects I will not go into, that many people have spoken to on the floor, many people have talked to the press about, and I do not think it is appropriate.  I will say again, I am not accusing the Senator of anything inappropriate. I think from the whole standpoint of this body, subjects such as this should be done in executive session. I think that because of all the problems we have had in regard to leaks and in regard to information that is not helpful to our national security. That is about as far as I will go with it. I could go through quite a laundry list of concerns I have of things that have been made public and what has happened in regard to our adversaries, what has happened in regard to our intelligence capability, and I worry about it. So my concern was basically the continued open discussion of things of this nature, not the Senator from Connecticut.
