Speaker, reclaiming my time.  I appreciate the majority leader's response. There obviously is a difference of view of how soon that those dollars could flow from the ranking member of the subcommittee and the ranking member of the full committee.  You mentioned days. I would certainly hope it could be days. Because I think we would all be advantaged in a bill, particularly if we could pass it with the overwhelming majority that was received both in the subcommittee and in the full committee.  Moving on, Mr. Leader, in addition to the bills you have listed for next week, do you anticipate any Hurricane Katrina-related legislation will come to floor? And if so, will those bills go through the committee of jurisdiction and be considered under rules on the floor that allow full debate?  You mentioned, as a preface to that, obviously almost all of us voted for the $52 billion. But I think everybody on the floor was concerned about the level of information we had about what had been spent of the $10 billion, how much was going to be spent, on what, of the $52 billion.  In that context I ask that question.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield?
