 President, I don't think it is fair to take a 30-percent cut in 1 year when you have the largest number of HIV/AIDS victims in the history of the epidemic in a city that has suffered such as no other city in America. I am not saying there shouldn't be cuts. I voted for the reauthorization knowing there would be cuts. What I am talking about is the level of cuts and the way these cuts fall because they decimate programs in an area that was ground zero on AIDS in the United States.  If you are going to take cuts, take those cuts so the communities involved in fighting HIV with prevention, with education, with care, with treatment, with drugs, with all of it, can essentially meet the mandate, which is to prevent the suffering of AIDS in HIV patients and also to prevent the disease from spreading. That is not easy to do, I can tell you that firsthand.  You take a 30-percent cut in 1 year and you decimate these programs. That is why the House put the stop-loss in. Take a moderate cut, and we will stand up like men and women and we will take that cut. Take a third cut and it is much more difficult and you affect services to people. That is all I am saying.  So I would very much hope the Senate would understand the need and the compassion to defeat this amendment and, once again, I would urge a ``no'' vote.
