President, I rise to introduce S. 2248, a bill that would clarify the States' sole authority to regulate the process of hydraulic fracturing at the State level as opposed to the Federal level.  I am pleased to be joined by Senators Murkowski, Vitter, Sessions, Cornyn, Risch, Hoeven, and Lee as cosponsors.  The reason for this bill is the State jurisdiction of a process called hydraulic fracturing, which has taken place since 1949. In 1949, the first hydraulic fracturing well took place in Duncan, OK. It is interesting that there has not been one documented case, in over a million wells using this process--in 60 years--of groundwater contamination.  As a matter of fact, numerous studies, including reports by the Groundwater Protection Council, the EPA, and recently the Energy Institute at the University of Texas at Austin, have found no evidence of hydraulic fracturing posing a risk to water wells or groundwater. A lot of people believe--and I am among them--that the reason to take it over at the Federal level is to do away with hydraulic fracturing. It is interesting that, recently, with some of the shale deposits and discoveries that have been made in the United States, we have been able to get in there, using this process, and come up with huge reserves and start producing these reserves.  In every case, without exception--in fact, I will go so far as to say you cannot get one cubic foot of natural gas out of a type formation without using hydraulic fracturing. The process is and will continue to be a safe process. Despite the evidence, in President Obama's recent campaign rhetoric, this administration continues to wage an all-out war on domestic oil and gas development. During the State of the Union Message--it was interesting because, apparently, now because of the high price of gas at the pump, the President is feeling political pressure, so he is coming out and saying: No, I am not against all fossil fuels, even though he has been for 4 years. And he started talking about clean, plentiful, cheap natural gas. I agreed with that; that is what it is. However, at the same time, if he could have that rhetoric and be able to make the case that the Federal Government needs to take over the process of hydraulic fracturing to be under his control and he can stop that process, he can cut off almost all production altogether.  According to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service--and this is one that came out this month--since 2007, ``about 96 percent of the [oil production] increase took place on nonfederal lands.''  A recent study also found that 93 percent of shale oil and gas wells are on private and State lands. The Department of Interior is in the process of issuing rules which will further discourage production on Federal lands and federally regulate disclosure of fracking fluids, well integrity, and waste water. According to Secretary of Interior Ken Salazar, these are rules which they hope will serve as a model for future regulation of State lands.  The Obama EPA alone is looking to regulate hydraulic fracturing through its offices of Water, Air, and Toxics.  What does this legislation do? It is simple. It makes clear that the States have the sole authority to regulate hydraulic fracturing on any land within their borders. This would include Federal lands within the borders of a State.  It also requires hydraulic fracturing on Federal lands to comply with the State laws of which the Federal lands are located.  Activities related to hydraulic fracturing are already regulated at the Federal level under a variety of environmental statutes, including portions of the Clean Water Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Clean Air Act.  States better understand their unique geologies and interests. I happen to be from Oklahoma, which is an oil State, and it varies from State to State. Louisiana deposits are found at a different level than ours in Oklahoma. Recently, people think of all these deposits being located in the West. However, the Marcellus discoveries that have been made are actually in New York State and Pennsylvania, so their local regulations are much more applicable than it would be if you did it at the Federal level.  I invite cosponsors. Here we are in the United States with more recoverable reserves in oil, gas, and coal than any other country in the world. We can be completely self-sufficient from the Mid Eastern oil if we get politics out of the way and use our own resources. We are the only country in the world that doesn't develop its own resources. This is the answer to the problem--the answer to the price of gas at the pump. It is one more option. We need to get out of the way of this process called hydraulic fracturing.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2248       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Fracturing Regulations are      Effective in State Hands Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds that--       (1) hydraulic fracturing is a commercially viable practice      that has been used in the United States for more than 60      years in more than 1,000,000 wells;       (2) the Ground Water Protection Council, a national      association of State water regulators that is considered to      be a leading groundwater protection organization in the      United States, released a report entitled ``State Oil and      Natural Gas Regulations Designed to Protect Water Resources''      and dated May 2009 finding that the ``current State      regulation of oil and gas activities is environmentally      proactive and preventive'';       (3) that report also concluded that ``[a]ll oil and gas      producing States have regulations which are designed to      provide protection for water resources'';       (4) a 2004 study by the Environmental Protection Agency,      entitled ``Evaluation of Impacts to Underground Sources of      Drinking Water by Hydraulic Fracturing of Coalbed Methane      Reservoirs'', found no evidence of drinking water wells      contaminated by fracture fluid from the fracked formation;       (5) a 2009 report by the Ground Water Protection Council,      entitled ``State Oil and Natural Gas Regulations Designed to      Protect Water Resources'', found a ``lack of evidence'' that      hydraulic fracturing conducted in both deep and shallow      formations presents a risk of endangerment to ground water;       (6) a January 2009 resolution by the Interstate Oil and Gas      Compact Commission stated ``The states, who regulate      production, have comprehensive laws and regulations to ensure      operations are safe and to protect drinking water. States      have found no verified cases of groundwater contamination      associated with hydraulic fracturing.'';       (7) on May 24, 2011, before the Oversight and Government      Reform Committee of the House of Representatives, Lisa      Jackson, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection      Agency, testified that she was ``not aware of any proven case      where the fracking process itself has affected water'';       (8) in 2011, Bureau of Land Management Director Bob Abbey      stated, ``We have not seen evidence of any adverse effect as      a result of the use of the chemicals that are part of that      fracking technology.'';       (9)(A) activities relating to hydraulic fracturing (such as      surface discharges, wastewater disposal, and air emissions)      are already regulated at the Federal level under a variety of      environmental statutes, including portions of--       (i) the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251      et seq.);       (ii) the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300f et seq.);      and       (iii) the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.); but       (B) Congress has continually elected not to include the      hydraulic fracturing process in the underground injection      control program under the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C.      300f et seq.);       (10) in 2011, the Secretary of the Interior announced the      intention to promulgate new Federal regulations governing      hydraulic fracturing on Federal land; and       (11) a February 2012 study by the Energy Institute at the      University of Texas at Austin, entitled ``Fact-Based      Regulation for Environmental Protection in Shale Gas      Development'', found that ``[n]o evidence of chemicals from      hydraulic fracturing fluid has been found in aquifers as a      result of fracturing operations''.     SEC. 3. DEFINITION OF FEDERAL LAND.       In this Act, the term ``Federal land'' means--       (1) public lands (as defined in section 103 of the Federal      Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1702));       (2) National Forest System land;       (3) land under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of      Reclamation; and       (4) land under the jurisdiction of the Corps of Engineers.     SEC. 4. STATE AUTHORITY.       (a) In General.--A State shall have the sole authority to      promulgate or enforce any regulation, guidance, or permit      requirement regarding the underground injection of fluids or      propping agents pursuant to the hydraulic fracturing process,      or any component of that process, relating to oil, gas, or      geothermal production activities on or under any land within      the boundaries of the State.       (b) Federal Land.--The underground injection of fluids or      propping agents pursuant to the hydraulic fracturing process,      or any components of that process, relating to oil, gas, or      geothermal production activities on     Federal land shall be subject to the law of the State in      which the land is located.                                 ______                                       By
