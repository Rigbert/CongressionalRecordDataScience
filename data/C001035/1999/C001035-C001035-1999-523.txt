President, I would like to announce for the information of the Senate and the public that the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Committee on Governmental Affairs, will hold hearings entitled ``Deceptive Mailings and Sweepstakes Promotions.'' These hearings are the first of an anticipated series of hearings the subcommittee plans to hold regarding deceptive mailings. The focus of these first hearings will be an examination of the use of sweepstakes by mass marketers and how these mailings impact consumers.  The hearings will take place on Monday, March 8th and Tuesday, March 9th, at 9:30 a.m. each day, in room 342 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building. For further information, please contact Timothy J. Shea of the subcommittee staff at 224-3721.                          ____________________
