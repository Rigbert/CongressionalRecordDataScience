 President, to pick up on some of the observations of the majority leader, bipartisan accomplishments have been altogether too rare this year, but we do have an opportunity here in the next 2 weeks, as he has indicated, to do some good work on a bipartisan basis, and a good example of that will be later this morning.  I commend Senator Kennedy, and particularly Senator Enzi, for their leadership on this higher education bill. That is a classic example of how we ought to operate more often in the Senate, and I hope we will reach that high standard more frequently for the balance of the year.                          ____________________
