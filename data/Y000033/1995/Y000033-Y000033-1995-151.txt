Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  May I suggest nothing has been embarrassing. We have worked well over these years, and only the length of time that he and I have served.  May I suggest that his area has been hardest hit. We thought we were doing great things in 1976, and we did. We worked to try to Americanize our fleet. Unfortunately, along the line, we did some things, or they did some things, that have damaged our fishing areas around our Nation very harmfully, ``they'' being our ownselves. So we have to address this legislation. This is a step in the right direction.
