President, today, I have joined with Senator Cornyn to reintroduce the ``Openness Promotes Effectiveness in our National Government Act--or the OPEN Government Act--the first major reform to the Freedom of Information Act, FOIA, in more than a decade. The Senate passed this historic FOIA reform legislation, S. 849, before adjourning for the August recess. But, sadly, this measure has been stalled in the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee for several months, preventing these long-overdue FOIA reforms from being enacted into law.  Despite the unfortunate delay of this bill, I remain deeply committed to enacting FOIA reform legislation this year. Because time is of the essence, I am requesting that this legislation be immediately placed on the Senate Calendar and that the Senate promptly take up and pass this bill by unanimous consent, so that it can be sent to the House.  The version of the bill introduced today includes ``pay/go'' language that has been requested by the House and eliminates the provision on citations to FOIA exemptions. After needlessly delaying the enactment of this bill for several months, I hope that the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee will promptly take up this important measure, so that the House can enact this legislation and send it to the President before the end of the year.  As the first major reform to FOIA in more than a decade, the OPEN Government Act will help to reverse the troubling trends of excessive delays and lax FOIA compliance in our government and help to restore the public's trust in their government. This bill will also improve transparency in the Federal Government's FOIA process by: restoring meaningful deadlines for agency action under FOIA; imposing real consequences on federal agencies for missing FOIA's 20-day statutory deadline; clarifying that FOIA applies to Government records held by outside private contractors; establishing a FOIA hotline service for all Federal agencies; and creating a FOIA Ombudsman to provide FOIA requesters and Federal agencies with a meaningful alternative to costly litigation.  Specifically, the OPEN Government Act will protect the public's right to know, by ensuring that anyone who gathers information to inform the public, including freelance journalists and bloggers, may seek a fee waiver when they request information under FOIA. The bill ensures that Federal agencies will not automatically exclude Internet blogs and other Web-based forms of media when deciding whether to waive FOIA fees. In addition, the bill also clarifies that the definition of news media, for purposes of FOIA fee waivers, includes free newspapers and individuals performing a media function who do not necessarily have a prior history of publication.  The bill also restores meaningful deadlines for agency action, by ensuring that the 20-day statutory clock under FOIA starts when a request is received by the appropriate component of the agency and requiring that agency FOIA offices get FOIA requests to the appropriate agency component within 10 days of the receipt of such requests. The bill allows Federal agencies to toll the 20-day clock while they are awaiting a response to a reasonable request for information from a FOIA requester on one occasion, or while the agency is awaiting clarification regarding a FOIA fee assessment. In addition, to encourage agencies to meet the 20-day time limit, the bill requires that an agency refund FOIA search fees if it fails to meet the 20-day deadline, except in the case of exceptional circumstances as defined by the FOIA statute. To address pay/go concerns, the bill requires that these refunds come from annual agency appropriations.  The bill also addresses a relatively new concern that, under current law, Federal agencies have an incentive to delay compliance with FOIA requests until just before a court decision is made that is favorable to a FOIA requester. The Supreme Court's decision in Buckhannon Board and Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Dep't of Health and Human Resources, 532 U.S. 598, 2001, eliminated the ``catalyst theory'' for attorneys' fees recovery under certain Federal civil rights laws. When applied to FOIA cases, Buckhannon precludes FOIA requesters from ever being eligible to recover attorneys' fees under circumstances where an agency provides the records requested in the litigation just prior to a court decision that would have been favorable to the FOIA requestor. The bill clarifies that Buckhannon does not apply to FOIA cases. Under the bill, a FOIA requester can obtain attorneys' fees when he or she files a lawsuit to obtain records from the Government and the Government releases those records before the court orders them to do so. But this provision would not allow the requester to recover attorneys' fees if the requester's claim is wholly insubstantial. To address pay/go concerns, the bill also requires that any attorneys' fees assessed under this provision be paid from annually appropriated agency funds.  To address concerns about the growing costs of FOIA litigation, the bill also creates an Office of Government Information Services in the National Archives and creates an ombudsman to mediate agency-level FOIA disputes. In addition the bill ensures that each Federal agency will appoint a Chief FOIA Officer, who will monitor the agency's compliance with FOIA requests, and a FOIA Public Liaison who will be available to resolve FOIA-related disputes.  Finally, the bill does several things to enhance the agency reporting and tracking requirements under FOIA. Tracking numbers are not required for FOIA requests that are anticipated to take 10 days or less to process. The bill creates a tracking system for FOIA requests to assist members of the public and the media. The bill also establishes a FOIA hotline service for all federal agencies, either by telephone or on the Internet, to enable requestors to track the status of their FOIA requests. The bill also clarifies that FOIA applies to agency records that are held by outside private contractors, no matter where these records are located.  The Freedom of Information Act is critical to ensuring that all American citizens can access information about the workings of their government. But, after four decades, this open government law needs to be strengthened. I am pleased that the reforms contained in the OPEN Government Act will ensure that FOIA is reinvigorated so that it works more effectively for the American people.  I commend the bill's chief Republican cosponsor, Senator John Cornyn, for his commitment and dedication to passing FOIA reform legislation this year. I also thank the many cosponsors of this legislation for their dedication to open government and I thank the Majority Leader for his strong support of this legislation. I am also appreciative of the efforts of Senator Kyl in helping us to reach a compromise on this legislation, so that the Senate could consider and pass meaningful FOIA reform legislation.  But, most importantly, I especially want to thank the many concerned citizens who, knowing the importance of this measure to the American people's right to know, have demanded action on this bill. This bill is endorsed by more than 115 business, public interest, and news organizations from across the political and ideological spectrum, including the American Library Association, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, OpenTheGovernment.org, Public Citizen, the Republican Liberty Caucus, the Sunshine in Government Initiative and the Vermont Press Association. The invaluable support of these and many other organizations is what led the opponents of this bill to come around and support this legislation.  I hope that by once again passing this important FOIA reform legislation, the Senate will reaffirm the principle that open government is not a Democratic issue or a Republican issue. But, rather, it is an American issue and an American value. I encourage all of my Senate colleagues, onboth sides of the aisle, to unanimously pass this historic bill.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2427       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Openness Promotes      Effectiveness in our National Government Act of 2007'' or the      ``OPEN Government Act of 2007''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds that--       (1) the Freedom of Information Act was signed into law on      July 4, 1966, because the American people believe that--       (A) our constitutional democracy, our system of self-     government, and our commitment to popular sovereignty depends      upon the consent of the governed;       (B) such consent is not meaningful unless it is informed      consent; and       (C) as Justice Black noted in his concurring opinion in      Barr v. Matteo (360 U.S. 564 (1959)), ``The effective      functioning of a free government like ours depends largely on      the force of an informed public opinion. This calls for the      widest possible understanding of the quality of government      service rendered by all elective or appointed public      officials or employees.'';       (2) the American people firmly believe that our system of      government must itself be governed by a presumption of      openness;       (3) the Freedom of Information Act establishes a ``strong      presumption in favor of disclosure'' as noted by the United      States Supreme Court in United States Department of State v.      Ray (502 U.S. 164 (1991)), a presumption that applies to all      agencies governed by that Act;       (4) ``disclosure, not secrecy, is the dominant objective of      the Act,'' as noted by the United States Supreme Court in      Department of Air Force v. Rose (425 U.S. 352 (1976));       (5) in practice, the Freedom of Information Act has not      always lived up to the ideals of that Act; and       (6) Congress should regularly review section 552 of title      5, United States Code (commonly referred to as the Freedom of      Information Act), in order to determine whether further      changes and improvements are necessary to ensure that the      Government remains open and accessible to the American people      and is always based not upon the ``need to know'' but upon      the fundamental ``right to know''.     SEC. 3. PROTECTION OF FEE STATUS FOR NEWS MEDIA.       Section 552(a)(4)(A)(ii) of title 5, United States Code, is      amended by adding at the end the following:       ``The term `a representative of the news media' means any      person or entity that gathers information of potential      interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial      skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and      distributes that work to an audience. The term `news' means      information that is about current events or that would be of      current interest to the public. Examples of news-media      entities are television or radio stations broadcasting to the      public at large and publishers of periodicals (but only if      such entities qualify as disseminators of `news') who make      their products available for purchase by or subscription by      or free distribution to the general public. These examples      are not all-inclusive. Moreover, as methods of news delivery      evolve (for example, the adoption of the electronic      dissemination of newspapers through telecommunications      services), such alternative media shall be considered to be      news-media entities. A freelance journalist shall be regarded      as working for a news-media entity if the journalist can      demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through      that entity, whether or not the journalist is actually      employed by the entity. A publication contract would present      a solid basis for such an expectation; the Government may      also consider the past publication record of the requester in      making such a determination.''.     SEC. 4. RECOVERY OF ATTORNEY FEES AND LITIGATION COSTS.       (a) In General.--Section 552(a)(4)(E) of title 5, United      States Code, is amended--       (1) by inserting ``(i)'' after ``(E)''; and       (2) by adding at the end the following:       ``(ii) For purposes of this section, a complainant has      substantially prevailed if the complainant has obtained      relief through either--       ``(I) a judicial order, or an enforceable written agreement      or consent decree; or       ``(II) a voluntary or unilateral change in position by the      agency, provided that the complainant's claim is not      insubstantial.''.       (b) Limitation.--Notwithstanding section 1304 of title 31,      United States Code, no amounts may be obligated or expended      from the Claims and Judgment Fund of the United States      Treasury to pay the costs resulting from fees assessed under      section 552(a)(4)(E) of title 5, United States Code. Any such      amounts shall be paid only from funds annually appropriated      for the Federal agency against which a claim or judgment has      been rendered.     SEC. 5. DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS FOR ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS                    REJECTIONS OF REQUESTS.       Section 552(a)(4)(F) of title 5, United States Code, is      amended--       (1) by inserting ``(i)'' after ``(F)''; and       (2) by adding at the end the following:       ``(ii) The Attorney General shall--       ``(I) notify the Special Counsel of each civil action      described under the first sentence of clause (i); and       ``(II) annually submit a report to Congress on the number      of such civil actions in the preceding year.       ``(iii) The Special Counsel shall annually submit a report      to Congress on the actions taken by the Special Counsel under      clause (i).''.

The 20-     day period shall not be tolled by the agency except--       ``(I) that the agency may make one request to the requester      for information and toll the 20-day period while it is      awaiting such information that it has reasonably requested      from the FOIA requester; or       ``(II) if necessary to clarify with the requester issues      regarding fee assessment. In either case, the agency's      receipt of the requester's response to the agency's request      for information or clarification ends the tolling period;''.       (2) Effective date.--The amendment made by this subsection      shall take effect 1 year after the date of enactment of this      Act.

(B) Public liaison.--Section 552(a)(6)(B)(ii) of title 5,      United States Code, is amended by inserting between the first      and second sentences the following: ``To aid the requester,      each agency shall make available its FOIA Public Liaison, who      shall assist in the resolution of any disputes between the      requester and the agency.''.       (2) Effective date and application.--The amendment made by      this subsection shall take effect 1 year after the date of      enactment of this Act and apply to requests for information      under section 552 of title 5, United States Code, filed on or      after that effective date.

(b) Effective Date and Application.--The amendment made by      this section shall take effect 1 year after the date of      enactment of this Act and apply to requests for information      under section 552 of title 5, United States Code, filed on or      after that effective date.
