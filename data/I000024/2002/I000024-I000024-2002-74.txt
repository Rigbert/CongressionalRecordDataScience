President, when the Senator from Montana referred to me as a producer, he was referring to the State of Oklahoma which is a production State. I don't think inadvertently he also referred to me as a producer. And I was.  I started out at the age of 17 in the oil fields. At that time, I was a tool dresser. Not many people know what a cable tool rig is. I was a tool dresser on a cable tool rig. There is no harder work in the world than being a tool dresser on a cable tool rig. That was before rotaries. Mostly, they were marginal wells--shallow wells.
