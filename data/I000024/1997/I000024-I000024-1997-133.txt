President, I rise today to congratulate Courtney Wheeler of Beckley, WV, who celebrated her 100th birthday on May 29, 1997.  Courtney Wheeler was born in 1897 in Summers County, WV, the oldest of 13 children born to Thomas Joseph and Rosa Belle Berkley. She married her husband, Roy Wheeler in 1913 and the two of them had six children before he passed away in 1936. Courtney has shown tremendous courage in life in dealing with the loss of her husband at an early age and the loss of four of her children. She has been an inspiration to all who know her on how to deal with life's tragedies in a strong and graceful manner.  In addition to her six children, Courtney Wheeler has a total of 94 descendants. She has 22 grandchildren, 36 great grandchildren, 29 great-great grandchildren and 1 great-great-great grandchild. She has definitely been blessed with a large and loving family.  Throughout her life, Courtney has been a loving and caring person to her family and friends. She has always maintained a cheerful spirit and has been an example to all. She has been an avid gardener of both flowers and vegetables her entire life, and is known far and wide for her cooking skills. I encourage my colleagues to join with me in congratulating Courtney Wheeler on this milestone birthday.                          ____________________
