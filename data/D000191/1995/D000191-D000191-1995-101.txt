In fact, the Republican budget, which passed the House here, would do away with the corporate alternative minimum tax. That means we go back to the days when a corporation like AT&T, as they did from 1981 to 1985, earned $1.3 billion in profits and not only not paid taxes--we all understand about loopholes and avoidance but--actually demanded and received a $200 million tax refund for taxes they did not pay. That is other Americans, people who work for wages, went to work every day, paid their taxes, and guess what? Part of their pay check went to give a $200 million tax giveaway to a corporation which had made $1.4 billion in the same years, and now we are being told that is what will take care of the problems of middle-income Americans. The Republican tax break bill repeals the corporate alternative minimum tax, and that will put Americans back to work at higher wages; give me a break.
