I want to thank my friend and colleague for yielding.  Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to extend unemployment benefits now.  It is amazing that we have time to debate this farm dust bill. We are polluting our air, but we don't have time to create jobs or to help people who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own. It is our moral obligation to give just a little bit of hope, a little bit of justice to help people survive these cold, difficult, hard times.  During this holiday season, I ask each and every one of you to take a deep, hard look within and ask yourselves: Is this how I wish to treat my mother? my father? my sister? my brother? my son? my daughter or my neighbor?  The unemployed lost their jobs through no fault of their own. They don't want handouts. They want jobs. This small amount of money is just enough to squeeze by while they continue to look for jobs. Help them. Please help them keep roofs over their heads, shoes on their feet, food on their tables, and heat in their homes.  Madam Speaker, this is the least we can do. It is the right thing to do. It is the fair thing to do. Fairness cannot wait. Give them just a little bit of hope in the name of those elected to serve them. Let's come together. Let's put politics aside and just get it done. Vote ``no'' on this rule, and extend unemployment insurance here and now.
