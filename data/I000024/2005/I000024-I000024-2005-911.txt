President, I appreciate the comments, even though I disagree with them, of the Senator from New Jersey. I know he is sincere. I know there is a problem and he is trying to correct the problem and there is an honest difference of opinion.  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce opposing the Corzine amendment, a letter from the American Road & Transportation Builders Association opposing the Lautenberg-Corzine amendment, and also a letter from the Transportation Construction Coalition, which is, I believe, almost every labor union in the United States, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                        Chamber of Commerce of the                                     United States of America,                                     Washington, DC, May 10, 2005.     Hon. Daniel Akaka,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Akaka: As the Senate continues debate on H.R.      3, the reauthorization of the Transportation Equity Act for      the 21st Century (TEA-2l), the U.S. Chamber of Commerce      strongly opposes an amendment by Senators John Corzine (D-NJ)      and Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ) that attempts to change federal      competitive highway and transit contracting rules.       For over 25 years, federal law has forbidden states from      implementing ``pay-to-play'' provisions for state highway and      transit construction contracts (23 USC Sec. 112). Federal      highway and transit contracts are awarded in an open-bid      environment, and it is unnecessary to have an individual      state attempt to change these federal contracting rules.       In November 2004, the state of New Jersey passed an      executive order with language that included federal highway      and transit contracting in the state's ``pay-to-play''      provisions. On January 21, 2005, the U.S. District Court for      New Jersey ruled against the state and reaffirmed the federal      statute, which led to New Jersey's final ``pay-to-play'' law      continuing the longstanding exemption of ``pay-to-play'' for      federal competitive highway and transit contracting.       Supporting the Corzine/Lautenberg amendment would adversely      affect the ability of business leaders to support candidates,      and thus, undermine the importance of allowing business      executives and their employees the ability to legally      participate in the political process, while other groups      would not be impacted.       The U.S. Chamber of Commerce will consider using votes on      or in relation to this issue for inclusion in our annual      ``How They Voted'' ratings. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is      the world's largest business federation representing more      than three million companies and organizations of every size,      sector and region.           Sincerely,     R. Bruce Josten.                                  ____                                    American Road & Transportation                                         Builders Association,                                      Washington, DC, May 9, 2005.       Dear Senator: As the Senate continues debate on H.R. 3, the      federal surface transportation program reauthorization bill,      the American Road & Transportation Builders Association      (ARTB) urges you to oppose an amendment by Senator Frank      Lautenberg that would modify federal transportation      procurement standards to allow states to penalize      transportation construction firms that participate in the      political process.       The Lautenberg amendment would allow states to preclude      individuals who have made financial campaign contributions to      state and local officials from competing for federal-aid      highway and transit construction work. By excluding      individuals who exercise their right to participate in the      political process, the amendment would contradict the open      competitive bid system of procurement that has been a      hallmark of the federal transportation programs for almost 50      years. Under this system, contracts are awarded to the lowest      qualified bidder. Political contributions, or the lack      thereof, have no role in the awards outcome.       An ARTBA analysis of Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)      bid data for the period 1958 to 2003 found that winning      highway contractor bids on federally-funded projects have      averaged 6.7 percent below the government's own internal cost      estimates for the advertised jobs. In total over the 45-year      period, the winning contractor bids have come in $22.8      billion under estimated cost.       This analysis proves that the low-bid system works in the      public interest. It also shows that highway contractors have      been giving the public outstanding value for their tax      dollars. Transportation construction industry contractors      routinely build highways and bridges that meet exact      government specifications for materials, quality, durability      and environmental protection for substantially less than the      government expects to pay.       Consequently, we urge you to protect the integrity of the      open competition, low-bid system for transportation      construction work and oppose the Lautenberg amendment to H.R.      3.       Sincerely,                                                   T. Peter Ruane,     President & CEO.                                  ____                                       Transportation Construction                                                    Coalition,                                                      May 9, 2005.       Dear Senator: The 28 national associations and construction      unions of the Transportation Construction Coalition (TCC)      urge you to oppose the Lautenberg amendment to H.R. 3, the      highway and transit program reauthorization bill. The      Lautenberg amendment would restrict competition for federal      highway and transit work and apply a nationwide solution to a      state-specific issue.       The Lautenberg amendment would allow states to prevent      companies from performing federal-aid highway and transit      work funded by this bill if they made legal contributions to      state and local elected officials. The amendment is based on      a New Jersey law that significantly limits competition for      transportation construction work by blocking any individual      that made political contributions of more than $300 from      bidding on any contract that exceeds $17,500.       The ``pay to play'' laws of other states typically focus      only on no-bid contracts. The New Jersey version, however,      applies to a much broader class of projects. Highway and      transit projects are typically procured using the lowest      competitive bid method, which requires an objective and      public evaluation of sealed bids.       Congress has specifically stated in past highway and      transit reauthorization bills that states should encourage      fair and open competition. States accomplish this objective      by cultivating the broadest group of competent qualified      applicants to perform transportation construction work and by      excluding companies that have acted illegally. The low bid      system was used to build the nation's highway system and      provides the highest quality product at the lowest possible      price.       We urge you to oppose the Lautenberg amendment to H.R. 3.      The amendment would significantly undermine the federal      commitment to the competitive bid system.
