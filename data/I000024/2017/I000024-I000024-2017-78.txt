President, let me add one additional thing to the statement that was made by the Senator from Florida; and that is, what does the House version do?  I would like to first of all make it very clear that what we are going to see and ultimately vote on is what the House has right now. They have a starting place. But it does some things that I think are significant. One, it repeals the mandate and the Obama taxes. It changes the regulations back to the State--where most individuals prefer they be in--from Washington. HSAs are part of this plan. Preexisting conditions are there. It converts Medicaid.  So I think we need to keep our powder dry. We need to look and see. I think most of the people in my State of Oklahoma consider ObamaCare to be a disaster, and it needs to be changed and it is going to be changed.                          ____________________
