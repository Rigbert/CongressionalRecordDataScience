Speaker, pursuant to clause 2 of rule IX, I hereby give notice of my intention to offer a resolution which raises a question of the privileges of the House.  The form of the resolution is as follows:       Whereas, Loretta Sanchez was issued a certification of      election as the duly elected Member of Congress from the 46th      District of California by the Secretary of State of      California and was seated by the U.S. House of      Representatives on January 7, 1997; and       Whereas A Notice of Contest of Election was filed with the      Clerk of the House by Mr. Robert Dornan on December 26, 1996;      and       Whereas the Task Force on the Contested Election in the      46th District of California met on February 26, 1997 in      Washington, D.C. on April 19, 1997 in Orange County,      California and October 24, 1997 in Washington, D.C.; and       Whereas the allegations made by Mr. Robert Dornan have been      largely found to be without merit: charges of improper voting      from a business, rather than a resident address; underage      voting; double voting; and charges of unusually large number      of individuals voting from the same address. It was found      that voting from the same address included a Marines barracks      and the domicile of nuns, that business addresses were legal      residences for the individuals, including the zoo keeper of      the Santa Ana zoo, that duplicate voting was by different      individuals and those accused of underage voting were of age;      and       Whereas the Committee on House Oversight has issued      unprecedented subpoenas to the Immigration and Naturalization      Service to compare their records with Orange County voter      registration records, the first time in any election in the      history of the United States that the INS has been asked by      Congress to verify the citizenship of voters; and       Whereas the INS has complied with the Committee's request      and, at the Committee's request, has been doing a manual      check of its paper files and providing worksheets containing      supplemental information on that manual check to the      Committee on House Oversight for over five months; and       Whereas the Committee on House Oversight, subpoenaed the      records seized by the District Attorney of Orange County on      February 13, 1997 and has received and reviewed all records      pertaining to registration efforts of that group; and       Whereas the House Oversight Committee is now pursuing a      duplicate and dilatory review of materials already in the      Committees possession by the Secretary of State of      California; and       Whereas the Task Force on the Contested Election in the      46th District of California and the Committee have been      reviewing these materials and has all the information it      needs regarding who voted in the 46th District and all the      information it needs to make judgements concerning those      votes; and       Whereas the Committee on House Oversight has after over      nine months of review and investigation failed to present      credible evidence to change the outcome of the election of      Congresswoman Sanchez and is pursuing never ending and      unsubstantiated areas of review; and       Whereas, Contestant Robert Dornan has not shown or provided      credible evidence that the outcome of the election is other      than Congresswoman Sanchez's election to the Congress; and       Whereas, the continuation of this investigation discourages      full participation of American voters in the electoral      process.       Whereas, the Committee on House Oversight should complete      its review of this matter and bring this contest to an end      and now therefore be it;       Resolved, That unless the Committee on House Oversight has      sooner reported a recommendation for its final disposition,      the contest in the 46th District of California is dismissed      upon the expiration of November 7, 1997.                              {time}  2100
