 President, this has been a very disappointing moment. Senator Collins is asking to pass an amendment that would not seem to be terribly controversial. As we have heard my colleagues state this afternoon, the Alexander-Murray-Collins-Nelson proposal would lower health insurance premiums--dramatically, in some cases--for American individuals and families. This assistance would be especially helpful to the middle-class families whom ObamaCare has hit the hardest.  How do my colleagues propose accomplishing this worthy goal? Through another top-down, one-size-fits-all scheme cooked up here in Washington? No, their legislation is designed to encourage new thinking and creative policymaking at the State level, through the expansion of section 1332 State innovation waivers and high-risk pools. It would end the practice of silver-loading, which unnecessarily costs the taxpayers tens of billions of dollars. It includes Hyde amendment language that has been commonplace for decades, going back to the 1970s, preventing taxpayer dollars from funding abortions. Apparently, that commonsense provision is suddenly just a bridge too far for some of our friends across the aisle.  For months, my colleague from Maine has led a bipartisan effort to bring common sense back to Americans' healthcare. Along with Senator Alexander, she has brought together Senators with different viewpoints and made real progress toward fixing the glaring failures of the current system. It is especially disappointing that their efforts are being blocked precisely when they stand the greatest chance of helping millions of Americans. It is not entirely surprising that my colleagues across the aisle are happy to talk the talk about lowering premiums for working families, but they refuse to actually walk the walk when given a golden opportunity. But it sure is disappointing.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be added as a cosponsor to the Collins-Alexander amendment.
