Chairman, I yield myself 6 minutes.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 333, the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2001.  Mr. Chairman, this bill is a bipartisan, balanced, and comprehensive package of reform measures pertaining to both consumer and business bankruptcy cases. The purpose of the bill is to improve bankruptcy law and practice by restoring personal responsibility and integrity in the bankruptcy system, and to ensure that the system is fair to both debtors and creditors.  With respect to its consumer provisions, H.R. 333 responds to several significant developments. One of these developments was the dramatic increase in consumer bankruptcy filings during the 1990s and the losses associated with those filings. Based on data released by the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, bankruptcy filings increased by more than 72 percent between 1994 and 1998. Mr. Chairman, for the first time in our Nation's history, bankruptcy filings exceeded 1 million in 1996. In calendar year 1997 alone, bankruptcy filings increased by more than 19 percent over the prior year. By 1998, the number of bankruptcy filings, according to the AO, reached an all-time high of more than 1.4 million cases. Although the most recent reporting periods indicate the filings have somewhat decreased, the Administrative Office states they remain well above the 1 million mark. Paradoxically, this dramatic increase in bankruptcy filing rates has occurred during a period when the economy was generally robust, with relatively low unemployment and high consumer confidence.  Coupled with this development was the release of a study estimating that financial losses attributable to bankruptcy filings in 1997 exceeded $44 billion. The committee received testimony in the last Congress stating that this figure, when amortized on a daily basis, amounts to a loss of at least $110 million a day.  Please note, those of us who pay our bills as we have agreed end up having to absorb these losses through higher costs and bank fees and interest rates.  Various other studies which thereafter became available concluded that some bankruptcy debtors can in fact repay a significant portion of their debts.  The heart of H.R. 333's consumer bankruptcy provisions is the implementation of an income-expense screening mechanism, usually referred to as a means-based or means test reform.                              {time}  1130  These provisions are designed to ensure that debtors repay creditors the maximum they can afford.  In addition, the bill institutes significant consumer protection reforms, including mandatory credit counseling requirements and specific disclosures in connection with certain credit transactions.  The reforms are aimed to help debtors understand their rights and obligations with respect to reaffirmation agreements are also included in the legislation.  In addition, the legislation substantially expands the debtor's ability to exempt certain tax-qualified retirement accounts and pensions. It also creates a new provision that allows a consumer debtor to exempt certain education IRA and State tuition plans for his or her child's postsecondary education from the claims of creditors.  Most importantly, H.R. 333 requires debtors to participate in credit counseling programs before they file for bankruptcy relief, unless special circumstances do not permit such participation. The legislation's credit counseling provisions are intended to educate consumers about the consequences of bankruptcy, such as the potentially devastating effect it could have on their credit rating, and to provide them with guidance about how to manage their finances so that they can avoid future financial difficulties.  Mr. Chairman, the bill also makes extensive reforms pertinent to business bankruptcies. Many of these provisions are intended to heighten administrative scrutiny and judicial oversight of small business bankruptcy cases. In addition, the bill includes provisions designed to reduce systemic risk in the financial marketplace and to clarify the treatment of tax claims in bankruptcy cases. H.R. 333 also creates a new form of bankruptcy relief for transnational insolvencies and includes provisions regarding family farmer debtors and health care providers.  It should be noted that this bill is a product of more than 3 years of congressional consideration of bankruptcy reform legislation. As reported, H.R. 333 is virtually identical to the conference report on H.R. 2415, the Gekas-Grassley Bankruptcy Reform Act of2000, which passed the House by a voice vote last October 12 and passed the other body on December 7 by a vote of 70 to 28. But for former President Clinton's December 19 pocket veto, this legislation would have been become law.  It should also be noted that support for bankruptcy reform legislation in the last two Congresses has been overwhelming and bipartisan. In the 105th Congress, for example, the House passed both H.R. 3150, the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1998, and the conference report on that bill by veto proof margins. In the last Congress, the House passed H.R. 833, which is the successor to H.R. 2415, by a veto-proof margin of 313-108.  This bill is the product of extensive negotiation and compromise, as well as an exhaustive and amendatory process. In the last Congress alone, the House and Senate engaged in nearly 7 months of negotiations to reconcile the differences between their respective bills. The product of these exhaustive efforts was the conference report on H.R. 2415, which is virtually identical to this bill.  Mr. Chairman, this is a balanced, bipartisan and comprehensive reform measure, which will prevent the costly exploitation of our bankruptcy system, while protecting those debtors truly in need of bankruptcy protection.  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
