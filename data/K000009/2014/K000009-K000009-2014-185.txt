Speaker, I rise today to recognize a significant milestone in the life of St. Nicholas Byzantine Catholic Parish of Lorain, Ohio in my District. The parish will celebrate its 100th anniversary on Sunday, September 14, 2014.  The parish history recounts that on September 14, 1914, the first Byzantine Catholic bishop, Bishop Soter Ortinsky, dedicated St.Nicholas Church. The pastor at that time was Father Basil Beretz. The people who were members of the parish had actually initiated plans for a church of the Byzantine Rite Catholics a number of years before that time. St. Nicholas' founders emigrated from a region of the Austro-Hungarian Empire which is today the easternmost part of Czechoslovakia and arrived in Lorain, Ohio in the last part of the 19th century and the beginning of the twentieth century. They attended St. Michael Hungarian Byzantine Rite Catholic Church and for a brief time services were held in Kohlmyer's Hall in Lorain.  The church history characterizes the years from 1900 to 1914 as the formative years of St. Nicholas Parish: ``In 1905 a committee of Byzantine Rite Catholics of Rusyn origin sought the advice and counsel of the late Bishop Joseph Schrembs, Bishop of Cleveland. In 1907 the faithful of the future St. Nicholas Parish solicited funds for the purchase of lots on Toledo Avenue, Lorain, the former site of the church and rectory. The parish would then relocate in 1982 to 2711 W. 40th Street, the present site of the St. Nicholas Byzantine Catholic Church complex. An historical mural retained in the old church for many years contained the list of the following contributors for the lots: Andrew Kakos, Andrew Ksenich, Andrew Karahuts, George Ksenich, Michael Lascisky, Michael Rusinko, George Demchik, John Danko, George Vajda, Vasil Pavelvach, Peter Yureck, John Kocak, Joseph Kokinda, Peter Kekel, John Taraka, Stephen Lascisky, Elek Ksenich, John Kvasnak, Nicholas Ksenich, Vasil Teleha, Peter Hazlak, Mike Rericky, Peter Hrinda, George Maczik, Mike Kizak, Jacob Andraska, John Jeresko. Stephen Ksenich, Joseph Suster, John Moroznak, George Tomcso, Frank Kablinka, John Szalag, Daniel Demjanovich, Mike Koscs, Mike Koczak, Joseph Szasz, Joseph Gluvna, John Naaymik and John Maylik. The purchase of the aforementioned lots was consummated through the Cleveland Chancery in the name of Bishop Schrembs and held by him in trust for the St. Nicholas Parish. In this manner St. Nicholas Parish was constituted as a Catholic parish under a Catholic bishop.''  The church continued to grow and expand, both physically and in membership. A rectory was added in 1919 and a second story of the original church was dedicated on July 16, 1928, by Bishop Basil Takach, the first bishop of the Byzantine Rite Catholic Exarchate of Pittsburgh. Renovations continued and in 1946 the mortgage was paid off.  Under the stewardship of Father Andrew Pataki who later became the bishop of Parma, a parochial school was built. On Sunday, June 12, 1960, a festival was held and Bishop Nicholas T. Elko blessed a newly renovated St. Nicholas Church and the new St. Nicholas School. Sisters under the Order of St. Basil the Great came to Lorain to begin teaching at the school in 1962. A small house was purchased nearby and remodeled by parishioners as a convent.  On Dec. 14, 1964, St. Nicholas' celebrated its golden jubilee with bishop Nicholas T. Elko officiating at the pontifical Divine Liturgy assisted by the former pastors Fathers Andrew Pataki and George Simchak.  By the late 1970s it was apparent the church had outgrown its original buildings and, in ``a beautiful testimonial to the generosity and the love that our parishioners have for their church'' according to the history, the substantial funds needed to build a new building were raised. A ground-breaking ceremony was held on Sunday, Jan. 25, 1981. During the ceremony, the history notes, ``the sound of axes could be heard ringing from the nearby woods. The St. Nicholas wood-chopping crew had a lot of land to clear and they did not have time to attend the ceremony. Additionally, a ``hearty band of volunteers worked throughout the year of 1981 and painted the entire interior of the complex, laid all the floor tiles (estimated at over 10,000 tiles), sanded and stained all the woodwork and contributed thousands of cost-free hours of labor. As a result of their physical contribution, the interior of the convent was finished as well as many other items that were not in the original contract. By early spring, the new complex was nearing completion and an appeal was made for volunteers to purchase the pews, certain kitchen items and the appointments in the church. The response was overwhelming. The parishioners of St. Nicholas, the Greek Catholic Union Lodge, the Russo-Slav Club and other fraternal organizations associated with the church had come through once again.  The church history records that ``the last service to be held at the old St. Nicholas Church was on Palm Sunday, April 4, 1982, and many a tear was shed as the last song was sung. Finally, on Holy Thursday evening, April 8, 1982, Father Felock blessed the new altar and church and the first service was held.'' The life of the parish continued in its new location through the 1980s, 1990s and into the new century. The school was closed in 2007 and the parish embarked on a mission of renewal as the new century dawned.  Today, the members of St. Nicholas Church's focus is on its future even as they honor its past. Standing on the shoulders of its founders and the families who established the parish as a cornerstone of its community, the parishioners of today's St. Nicholas Byzantine Catholic Church are proud of its rich history. Yet, as they celebrate a century of parish life, the congregation of St. Nicholas' looks toward the next century with hope and faith. Onward!                          ____________________
