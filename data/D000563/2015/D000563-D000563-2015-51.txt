. immigration headquarters andthen in some cases referred for additional review, extensive in-person interviews with Homeland Security officers, and then--and only then--could Homeland Security approval be required. At that point the potential refugee is screened for contagious diseases, goes through a cultural orientation class, matched with an American resettlement agency, goes through a multiagency security check before leaving to enter the United States, and then faces a final security check when they arrive at an American airport.  I am entering this into the Record because those who are suggesting that we are taking Syrian refugees without appropriate screening are not aware of the reality. It is a process that takes 18 to 24 months, and in the 4 years we have accepted about 2,000 Syrian refugees, not a single one has been found to be involved in a terrorist activity.  We accept about 70,000 refugees in the United States each year, and I am glad that we do because for some people in some parts of the world, it is the only place they can turn to.  The public reaction against the House action that bars Syrian refugees is interesting. There was a Congressman, and I don't know him personally, but his name is Congressman Steve Russell of Oklahoma.  This is according to the POLITICO article:       He voted for the bill with serious reservations but in the      hopes of affecting the debate as it moved ahead. If the      existing bill were to come before the House again, ``I would      vote against it,'' Russell said. ``I think it creates      impossible barriers to refugees.''  Just 2 weeks ago, he voted for it, but he has thought it over. Why? This article says:       For Russell, the issue is personal. One of his close      friends is an American citizen who was trying to get his      mother out of Syria. The mother died this past summer before      she could leave that war-torn country. Out of respect for his      friend's privacy, [Congressman] Russell [of Oklahoma], a      retired Army lieutenant colonel, declined to offer specifics,      including exactly what happened to the woman. But he said:      ``I'm certain had he been able to get her to the United      States, she would still be alive.''       [Congressman] Russell urged [his fellow] Republicans in the      Senate to think carefully before supporting the House bill,      saying they should not get refugees confused with the broader      issue of immigration. He pointed out that in the past the      U.S. has denied entry to people in need of help, including      Jews [who were] fleeing the Nazis [in Europe during World War      II].       ``We have had dark periods when we have done this in the      past,'' he said. ``History never judges it kindly--never.''  That was a quote by Congressman Russell, a Republican from the State of Oklahoma.  I think it is important to note, too, that ``in a letter to lawmakers released [yesterday], a group of national security experts, including figures prominent in Republican circles such as former Secretary of State [Henry] Kissinger, retired Gen. David Petraeus and former Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff, urged [us] to stop the House bill.''       ``Refugees are victims, not perpetrators of terrorism,''      the signatories wrote. ``Categorically refusing to take them      only feeds the narrative of [the Islamic State] that there is      a war between Islam and the West, that Muslims are not      welcome in the United States and Europe, and that the      [Islamic State] caliphate is their true home.''  Perhaps the saucer is cooling the tea, and perhaps the Senate will have the good sense not to follow the action of the House of Representatives in passing this provision.  I have two other items to add to the Record before I yield the floor to my colleagues who have gathered here today.  The first is an article that comes out of the city of Chicago, which I am honored to represent. I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Chicagoist.com, Dec. 1, 2015]Meet the Nuns Who Are Preparing Their West Ridge Home To Take in Syrian                                 Refugees                            (By Tony Boylan)       Three nuns living in West Ridge plan to take in a Syrian      refugee family not just with the blessing of their local      community, but at its urging.       Despite Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner's decision last month to      join a number of other state governors in vowing to make it      tougher for Syrian refugees to resettle in the U.S. in the      wake of a recent terrorist attack on Paris, these women are      preparing their home to make life a little easier for a      refugee family.       The sisters, part of the Society of Helpers, live in a      historic home once owned by the Dr. Scholl's Family with a      finished basement they in the process of turning into a      family apartment. The Society is an international order with      progressive values based on the teachings of St. Ignatius. In      other words, they get their hands dirty working with lots of      issues other people of faith aren't always quick to embrace;      the homeless, addicts, teenage mothers, domestic violence and      those most in need of support and assistance.       From their mission statement: ``As contemplatives in      action, we don't just pray for social justice and for peace--     we make it our life's work.''       Putting their faith in action, the sisters moved swiftly to      ready themselves to provide shelter to a refugee family they      think could be with them as soon as January. Political      leaders can debate and demagogue on the issue all they'd      like, but the sisters don't care about that. Their faith      declares what it declares, they say, and offering help is      their faith.       ``We would rather not make our decision on fear, we would      rather make our decision on compassion,'' said Sister Mary      Ellen Moore, a registered psychologist and one of three nuns      who lives in the house. ``We were certainly disappointed in      Gov. Rauner's statement on this issue. That kind of mentality      if frightening and we know what it's led to in Europe and in      other places in the past. It's really very sad.''       The plan predates the attacks in Paris, which have somehow      been blamed on refugees--the same people trying to flee the      horrific powers behind the carnage. The nuns and the members      of St. Gertrude's parish in Edgewater took to heart the      Pope's call for every congregation in America to help ease      the international crisis and find a way to accommodate      refugees.       The sisters do find it important to note that this isn't an      entirely free ride. Refugee families from Syria, or anywhere      else, are required as part of their status to obtain work      almost immediately after getting settled. Catholic Charities      will assist them with that. The family will also be asked to      contribute something for electricity and other utilities in      due time, and after a store of donated food is exhausted, the      family will rely on its own income and some help from charity      for food.       In this case, though, a family couldn't ask for hosts more      qualified and prepared to help them assimilate. And the      sisters think the multicultural nature of their      neighborhood--near Devon Avenue and Loyola University--will      be helpful.       Members of the parish, where the sisters attend church, but      have no official attachment, almost immediately began      collecting donations of money, furniture, bedding, kitchen      supplies, and all the mundane things a family starting over      with nothing might need to get by. (There still is a need for      everything except clothing, which will wait until they know      who is coming and can collect items appropriate to ages and      size. Any help is appreciated and can be donated through      either the Society of Helpers Facebook Page or website.       It's not as if the parishioners or sisters are entering      into this without thinking through any potential risks. It's      just that they know the risks are being wildly overstated and      their mission is clear.       A letter written by parishioner John Neafsey was circulated      among church members recently read, in part:       ``Security concerns are understandable in the aftermath of      the Paris attacks. But our understanding is that there is      already a thorough and lengthy screening process in place for      checking the backgrounds of refugees (agreed upon between the      UNHCR and host countries, including the U.S.) prior to      approving them for resettlement to the United States. We      believe that an arbitrary refusal to allow Syrian refugees to      come to our state is unnecessary, unfair, and un-Christian.      This would needlessly scapegoat and penalize innocent men,      women, and children who are fleeing violence and persecution.      It deprives them of the chance to get a new start in a safe      place where they are welcome. The motto of our parish is `All      Are Welcome.' For us, ``all'' includes Syrian refugees,      whether they are Christian or Muslim.''       While neither the church members nor the sisters want this      matter to be political, they understand the climate that has      been created.       ``It's very sad people just jump to judgement because      people are different,'' said Sr. Jean Kielty, Director of the      House of Good Shepherd and a social worker who has aided the      homeless for a quarter century. She shares the house with      Sister Mary Ellen, Sister Anna Maria Baldauf, and their dogs,      Mocha and Snowball.       ``This is just a different kind of homelessness--a more      tragic one.''       There is a one ramification Sister Jean is concerned about,      though: ``I'm not sure if my family will come visit me      anymore.''       Here's a little more information about the nuns behind this      initiative and the residence where they are providing a      basement apartment to a refugee family next year:                            Jean Kielty, SH       As a social worker, Jean's ministry has focused on      addressing homelessness in the Chicagoland area for more than      25 years. She     has served as Director of Interim Housing with Catholic      Charities of the Archdiocese of Chicago and is currently the      Executive Program Director of the House of Good Shepherd.      Jean is the founder and current chairperson of the board for      Casa Esperanza, a transitional housing program for women and      their children located in South Chicago. Jean is one of three      leaders of the U.S. Province of the Society of Helpers and      resides in her West Ridge home with two other Helpers and      their dogs.                      Mary Ellen Moore, SH, Ph.D.       Mary Ellen is a registered psychologist and co-founder of      Claret Center in Hyde Park that offers psychotherapy,      workshops, and professional development that support      wholeness in mind, body, and spirit. In addition to her      advisory role at Claret Center, Mary Ellen provides      psychotherapy and supervision to clients and students and is      the director of training for the practicum at ``The Circle,''      a Helpers-sponsored resource center for Latina immigrant      women in Brighton Park. Mary Ellen served served two previous      terms as the Helpers' U.S. Provincial from 1985-1995 and      another term from 2008-2014.                            The Miller House       This West Ridge modified Georgian Colonial Revival was      built by the Hutchins Brothers in 1911. In 1923, the Hutchins      family sold the home to Frank Scholl, brother of Dr. William      M. Scholl who founded the company Dr. Scholl's. Frank joined      the business in 1910 and oversaw European operations.      Featured on the 1996 Annual Fall House Tour and the 2013      Annual House Tour, this historical home boasts 5000 square      feet with 5 bedrooms, 5.5 bathrooms and related living      quarters.       Although this ``large home'' has undergone changes with      each of the five previous owners, it maintains many qualities      of its original historic charm. The Society of Helpers      purchased the home in 2014, planning to utilize its space to      welcome other Helpers visiting from around the world. They      were thrilled to be able to offer the related living quarters      to a Syrian refugee family when their parish, St. Gertrude,      and Catholic Charities provided an opportunity to present a      family in need of a safe home.
