II. Closed sessions and confidential materials       1. Procedure. All meetings and hearing shall be open to the      public unless closed. To close a meeting or hearing or      portion thereof, a motion shall be made and seconded to go      into closed discussion of whether the meeting or hearing will      concern the matters enumerated in Rule II.3. Immediately      after such discussion, the meeting or hearing may be closed      by a vote in open session of a majority of the Members of the      Committee present.       2. Witness Request. Any witness called for hearing may      submit a written request to the Chairman no later than      twenty-four hours in advance for his examination to be in      closed or open session. The Chairman shall inform the      Committee of any such request.       3. Closed Session Subjects. A meeting or hearing or portion      thereof may be closed if the matters to be discussed concern:      (1) national security; (2) Committee staff personnel or      internal staff management or procedures; (3) matters tending      to reflect adversely on the character or reputation or to      invade the privacy of the individuals; (4) Committee      investigations; (5) other matters enumerated in Senate Rule      XXVI (5)(b).       4. Confidential Matter. No record made of a closed session,      or material declared confidential by a majority of the      Committee, or report of the proceedings of a closed session,      shall be made public, in whole or in part or by way of      summary, unless specifically authorized by the Chairman and      Ranking Minority Member.       5. Broadcasting:       (a) Control. Any meeting or hearing open to the public may      be covered by television, radio, or still photography. Such      coverage must be conducted in an orderly and unobtrusive      manner, and the Chairman may for good cause terminate such      coverage in whole or in part, or take such other action to      control it as the circumstances may warrant.       (b) Request. A witness may request of the Chairman, on      grounds of distraction, harassment, personal safety, or      physical discomfort, that during his testimony cameras, media      microphones, and lights shall not be directed at him.     III. Quorums and voting       1. Reporting. A majority shall constitute a quorum for      reporting a resolution, recommendation or report to the      Senate.       2. Committee Business. A third shall constitute a quorum      for the conduct of Committee business, other than a final      vote on reporting, providing a minority Member is present.      One Member shall constitute a quorum for the receipt of      evidence, the swearing of witnesses, and the taking of      testimony at hearings.       3. Polling:       (a) Subjects. The Committee may poll (1) internal Committee      matters including those concerning the Committee's staff,      records, and budget; (2) other Committee business which has      been designated for polling at a meeting.       (b) Procedure. The Chairman shall circulate polling sheets      to each Member specifying the matter being poled and the time      limit for completion of the poll. If any Member so requests      in advance of the meeting, the matter shall be held for      meeting rather than being polled. The clerk shall keep a      record of polls, if the Chairman determines that the polled      matter is one of the areas enumerated in Rule II.3, the      record of the poll shall be confidential. Any Member may move      at the Committee meeting following a poll for a vote on the      polled decision.     IV. Investigations       1. Authorization for Investigations. All investigations      shall be conducted on a bipartisan basis by Committee staff.      Investigations may be initiated by the Committee staff upon      the approval of the Chairman and the Ranking Minority Member.      Staff shall keep the Committee fully informed of the progress      of continuing investigations, except where the Chairman and      the Ranking Minority Member agree that there exists temporary      cause for more limited knowledge.       2. Subpoenas. Subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses or      the production of memoranda, documents, records, or any other      materials shall be issued by the Chairman, or by any other      Member of the Committee designated by him. Prior to the      issuance of each subpoena, the Ranking Minority Member, and      any other Member so requesting, shall be notified regarding      the identity of the person to whom the subpoena will be      issued and the nature of the information sought, and its      relationship to the investigation.       3. Investigative Reports. All reports containing findings      or recommendations stemming from Committee investigations      shall be printed only with the approval of a majority of the      Members of the Committee.     V. Hearings       1. Notice. Witnesses called before the Committee shall be      given, absent extraordinary circumstances, at least forty-     eight hours notice, and all witnesses called shall be      furnished with a copy of these rules upon request.       2. Oath. All witnesses who testify to matters of fact shall      be sworn unless the Committee waives the oath. The Chairman,      or any member, may request and administer the oath.       3. Statement. Any witness desiring to make an introductory      statement shall file 50 copies of such statement with the      Chairman or clerk of the Committee 24 hours in advance of his      appearance, unless the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member      determine that there is good cause for a witness's failure to      do so. A witness shall be allowed no more than ten minutes to      orally summarize his prepared statement.       4. Counsel:       (a) A witness's counsel shall be permitted to be present      during his testimony at any public or closed hearing or      depositions or staff interview to advise such witness of his      rights, provided, however, that in the case of any witness      who is an officer or employee of the government, or of a      corporation or association, the Chairman may rule that      representation by counsel from the government, corporation,      or association creates a conflict of interest, and that the      witness shall be represented by personal counsel not from the      government, corporation, or association.       (b) A witness is unable for economic reasons to obtain      counsel may inform the Committee at least 48 hours prior to      the witness's appearance, and it will endeavor to obtain      volunteer counsel for the witness. Such counsel shall be      subject solely to the control of the witness and not the      Committee. Failure to obtain counsel will not excuse the      witness from appearing and testifying.       5. Transcript. An accurate electronic or stenographic      record shall be kept of the testimony of all witnesses in      executive and public hearings. Any witness shall be afforded,      upon request, the right to review that portion of such      record, and for this purpose, a copy of a witness's testimony      in public or closed session shall be provided to the witness.      Upon inspecting his transcript, within a time limit set by      the committee clerk, a witness may request changes in      testimony to correct errors of transcription, grammatical      errors, and obvious errors of fact, the Chairman or a staff      officer designated by him shall rule on such request.       6. Impugned Persons. Any person who believes that evidence      presented, or comment made by a Member or staff, at a public      hearing or at a closed hearing concerning which there have      been public reports, tends to impugn his character or      adversely affect his reputation may:       (a) file a sworn statement of facts relevant to the      evidence or comment, which shall be placed in the hearing      record;       (b) request the opportunity to appear personally before the      Committee to testify in his own behalf; and       (c) submit questions in writing which he requests be used      for the cross-examination of other witnesses called by the      Committee. The Chairman shall inform the Committee of such      requests for appearance or cross-examination. If the      Committee so decides; the requested questions, or paraphrased      versions or portions of them, shall be put to the other      witness by a Member or by staff.       7. Minority Witnesses. Whenever any hearing is conducted by      the Committee, the minority on the Committee shall be      entitled, upon request made by a majority of the minority      Members to the Chairman, to call witnesses selected by the      minority to testify or produce documents with respect to the      measure or matter under consideration during at least one day      of the hearing. Such request must be made before the      completion of the hearing or, if subpoenas are required to      call the minority witnesses, no later than three days before      the completion of the hearing.       8. Conduct of Witnesses, Counsel and Members of the      Audience. If, during public or executive sessions, a witness,      his counsel, or any spectator conducts himself in such a      manner as to prevent, impede, disrupt, obstruct, or interfere      with the orderly administration of such hearing the Chairman      or presiding Member of the Committee present during such      hearing may request the Sergeant at Arms of the Senate, his      representative or any law enforcement official to eject said      person from the hearing room.     VI. Depositions and commissions       1. Notice. Notices for the taking of depositions in an      investigation authorized by the Committee shall be authorized      and issued by the Chairman or by a staff officer designated      by him. Such notices shall specify a time and place for      examination, and the name of the staff officer or officers      who will take the deposition. Unless otherwise specified, the      deposition shall be in private. The Committee shall not      initiate procedures leading to criminal or civil      enforcement proceedings for a witness's failure to appear      unless the deposition notice was accompanied by a      Committee subpoena.       2. Counsel. Witnesses may be accompanied at a deposition by      counsel to advise them of their rights, subject to the      provisions of Rule V.4.       3. Procedure. Witnesses shall be examined upon oath      administered by an individual authorized by local law to      administer oaths. Questions shall be propounded orally by      Committee staff. Objections by the witnesses as to the form      of questions shall be noted by the record. If a witness      objects to a question and refuses to testify on the basis of      relevance or privilege, the Committee staff may proceed with      the deposition, or may at that time or at a subsequent time,      seek a ruling by telephone or otherwise on the objection from      a Member of the Committee. If the Member overrules the      objection, he may refer the matter to the Committee or he may      order and direct the witness to answer the question, but the      Committee shall not initiate the procedures leading to civil      or criminal enforcement unless the witness refuses to testify      after he has been ordered and directed to answer by a Member      of the Committee.       4. Filing. The Committee staff shall see that the testimony      is transcribed or electronically recorded. If it is      transcribed, the witness shall be furnished with a copy for      review. No later than five days thereafter, the witness shall      return a signed copy, and the staff shall enter the changes,      if any, requested by the witness in accordance with Rule V.6.      If the witness fails to return a signed copy, the staff shall      note on the transcript the date a copy was provided and the      failure to return it. The individual administering the oath      shall certify on the transcript that the witness was duly      sworn in his presence, the transcriber shall certify that the      transcript is a true record to the testimony, and the      transcript shall then be filed with the Committee clerk.      Committee staff may stipulate with the witness to changes in      this procedure; deviations from the procedure which do not      substantially impair the reliability of the record shall not      relieve the witness from his obligation to testify      truthfully.       5. Commissions. The Committee may authorize the staff by      issuance of commissions, to fill in prepared subpoenas,      conduct field hearings, inspect locations, facilities, or      systems of records, or otherwise act on behalf of the      Committee. Commissions shall be accompanied by instructions      from the Committee regulating their use.     VII. Subcommittees       1. Establishment. The Committee will operate as a Committee      of the Whole, reserving to itself the right to establish      temporary subcommittees at any time by majority vote. The      Chairman of the full Committee and the Ranking Minority      Member shall be ex officio Members of all subcommittees.       2. Jurisdiction. Within its jurisdiction as described in      the Standing Rules of the Senate, each subcommittee is      authorized to conduct investigations, including use of      subpoenas, depositions, and commissions.       3. Rules. A subcommittee shall be governed by the Committee      rules, except that its quorum for all business shall be one-     third of the subcommittee Membership, and for hearings shall      be one Member.     VIII. Reports       Committee reports incorporating Committee findings and      recommendations shall be printed only with the prior approval      of the Committee, after an adequate period for review and      comment. The printing, as Committee documents, of materials      prepared by staff for informational purposes, or the printing      of materials not originating with the Committee or staff,      shall require prior consultation with the minority staff;      these publications shall have the following language printed      on the cover of the document: ``Note: This document has been      printed for informational purposes. It does not represent      either findings or recommendations formally adopted by the      Committee.''     IX. Amendment of rules       The rules of the Committee may be amended or revised at any      time, provided that not less than a majority of the Committee      present so determine at a Committee meeting preceded by at      least 3 days notice of the amendments or revisions      proposed.                          ____________________
