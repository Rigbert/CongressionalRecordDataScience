Chairman, shipbuilders in my home State and others have stressed the criticality of the LPD 17 Program to their workforce over the next six to eight years as they strive to transition successfully between maturing programs and the construction of the next generation of ships. I am concerned that any delay in the LPD 17 schedule may, in fact, affect the rates and costs of the various Navy shipbuilding programs and cause workers to lose their jobs. How have you addressed these concerns in this bill?
