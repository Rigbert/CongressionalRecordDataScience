Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4417. The Visa Waiver Program allows travelers from certain designated countries to come to the United States as temporary visitors without having to obtain a non-immigrant visa. There are currently more than 10 million foreign visitors entering the United States every year under this program.  Since its creation in 1986, the program has greatly facilitated travel to the United States from participating foreign countries. Through reciprocal arrangements, American international travelers also benefit with greater ease of travel.  The Visa Waiver Program was established on the premise that nationals from participating countries pose little security risk or threat of overstaying their period of admittance, which under the current program is a maximum of 90 days. After the tragic events of September 11, we recognize that a traveler from a visa waiver country can pose a serious threat, especially when the country of origin differs from the country that issues the passport used to enter our country.  It was, in part, to address threats like this that I offered the Enhanced Visa Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002. The act requires the VisaWaiver Program countries to certify that they have established systems to issue their nationals machine-readable passports that are tamper-resistant and incorporate biometric identifiers that comply with the biometric identifier standards established by the International Civil Aviation Organization.  The act sets a firm deadline of October 26, 2004, after which anyone applying for admission to the United States under the program, with passports issued after that date, must present a passport that meets these standards or otherwise obtain a visa from a United States embassy or consulate overseas.  This requirement will close several security loopholes. First, it will allow the Department of Homeland Security inspectors at ports-of-entry to determine whether a passport properly identifies its bearer. This will combat terrorist imposters and prevent them from defeating lookout lists on which they are posted.  Second, it will make passports much harder to alter or counterfeit.  Third, in conjunction with the installation of scanners at ports-of-entry to read these passports and the completion of exit controls, the DHS can track the arrival and departure of travelers and identify those who overstay their visas.  My goal as author of this act in selecting the October 2004 deadline was to compel countries to act promptly to modernize their passports. I have written to the foreign governments participating in the Visa Waiver Program to ascertain how soon they will be ready to issue biometric passports. I regret that most visa waiver countries will not meet the October 2004 deadline.  However, many are making significant progress and have indicated that the October 2005 deadline is reachable. An example is Belgium, which had one of the weakest passport regimes in Europe, and now has so completely revised its approach that it is the first visa waiver country to meet the new biometric requirements. Belgium has also recently won the Interpol award for the best passport security. Likewise, Austria, Denmark and Slovenia have working prototypes of biometric passports and will begin issuing them as soon as the European Union sets its internal standards for member countries.  Nonetheless, the Secretaries of Homeland Security and State have testified before the House Committee on the Judiciary that most visa waiver countries are still resolving privacy issues, chip durability concerns and production and procurement delays. Accordingly, they asked for legislation to extend the biometric passport deadline.  To minimize the risk of extending the deadline, the administration has initiated security procedures that begin in September of this year. Specifically, the Department of Homeland Security will begin fingerprinting each traveler from the Visa Waiver Program countries so as to strengthen current abbreviated inspection process for visa waiver travelers.  H.R. 4417 simply extends the October 26, 2004, deadline by one year. While this extension provides more time to meet the requirement, this additional breathing space should not lead visa waiver countries nor our own government to become complacent.  The committee will conduct bipartisan oversight to ensure that the Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security are working as hard as they can to get their own systems ready to validate biometric passports when they are presented at ports-of-entry. While the visa waiver countries are committing their resources and intellectual talent to comply with our new requirements for identity, our own government should do no less.  I also expect that the State Department will step up pressure on visa waiver countries to meet the new October 2005 deadline instead of providing erroneous assurances that Congress will again provide an extension should they fail to meet the new date.                              {time}  1645  On the other hand, it is also crucial that we enact this legislation expeditiously in order to provide our own travel and tourism industry the certainty they need to plan events for the coming months that involve large numbers of travelers from the visa waiver countries.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.
