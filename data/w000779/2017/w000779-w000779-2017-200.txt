 Part of the reason that many Republicans want these tax cuts for the fortunate few is arcane to people, pretty complicated. What they really want to do is get them now, to put them in the budget baseline in order to open up the opportunity when tax reform comes along to have even more tax breaks for the fortunate few. So, yes, Medicare and Medicaid are going to face real challenges.  In fact, as my colleagues know, the Affordable Care Act had a modest additional tax on people who earn over $250,000 a year, and it was to go just to Medicare. You see your paycheck--everyone gets a paycheck--and the Medicare tax is right on it. The only people under these Republican plans who would get the Medicare tax cut would be couples who make over $250,000 a year.  When my colleague from Vermont asks ``What does this mean for Medicare?'' it isn't necessarily about some bill far off in the future. It is about right now. By the way, taking that money away--the money that comes just from the modest additional tax on couples over $250,000--reduces Medicare solvency by several years. It actually reduces Medicare solvency, which breaks yet another Trump promise not to in any way injure Medicare.
