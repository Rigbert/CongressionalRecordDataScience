Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding.  I support this amendment. I think it merely restates the fact that people who are not involved in criminal or terrorist activities have nothing to fear from the PATRIOT Act. The first amendment protects free speech. It protects political association. As long as the political association is not involved in criminal terrorist activities, we ought to encourage it even if their views are something that we disagree with.  The gentleman from Texas has done a very good service to this bill with this amendment, and I hope it is adopted overwhelmingly.
