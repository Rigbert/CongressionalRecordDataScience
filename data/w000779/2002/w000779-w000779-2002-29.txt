 I note that the New York Times this morning points out that on the homeland security bill--and I am going to quote from an editorial in the New York Times:     . . . the Democrats have made key concessions on personnel      management for the department in recent weeks that give the      administration almost everything it wants.  It is clear Senators on this side are very anxious to attack the serious questions that are before this country. This editorial really sums it up.
