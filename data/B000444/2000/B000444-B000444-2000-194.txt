 President.  Let me rephrase it. The President of the United States, President Gore or President Bush, and whatever operative date it ends up being, October or July, sends a report to the Congress and says: I wish the 5,600 troops to remain in Kosovo.  That is the first part. He has done that. He says: I want them to stay.  What happens if the Senate says: We are not even going to vote on it? Can the troops stay?
