 President, it is my pleasure to pay tribute to a distinguished elder of the Makah Indian Tribe in Washington state, Ms. Ruth E. Claplanhoo, whose 100th birthday was March 15, 2002.  Ms. Claplanhoo was born on March 15, 1902 in Neah Bay, Washington, where she still resides. Throughout her life, she has made many meaningful contributions to the Makah Tribe and to the community by selflessly serving others. Through her service, she has demonstrated her strong commitment to family, her cultural identity, and education.  An experienced tribal elder, Ms. Claplanhoo has shared her knowledge of Makah culture with many other people. At an early age she learned the art of basket weaving, which she used to supplement her family's income during the Depression. Her basket weaving skills are so highly regarded that she once traveled to the Smithsonian Institute in Washington, D.C. to demonstrate her gift. Ms. Claplanhoo is also fluent in the Makah language. During the 1960s she taught the language to students at the Neah Bay School. Many of these students still continue the tradition of the Makah language passed on to them by Ms. Claplanhoo.  In addition to teaching, Ms. Claplanhoo worked continuously in other ways to help young people succeed and prosper. While raising her own family, Ms. Claplanhoo also raised many foster children, whom she still cherishes as her own.  As the last of the elders who can remember taking a dugout canoe to the harvest fields, Ms. Claplanhoo continues to preserve the Makah culture by sharing her knowledge of tribal history and language with the Makah Museum.  It is with tremendous respect and appreciation that I send Ruth Claplanhoo my best wishes and congratulations for a century of service to her family, community and country.                          ____________________
