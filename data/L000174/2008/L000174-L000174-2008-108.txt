. Parole Commission by 3 years. Without quick action by Congress, the Commission will expire onOctober 31, 2008. Senate passage is an important first step to ensure this does not happen.  The U.S. Parole Commission is responsible for granting or denying parole for incarcerated Federal and DC prisoners who were sentenced before the Federal and DC governments abolished parole. The Commission was created and empowered to consider the requests of these ``old law'' Federal and DC inmates, but it also has jurisdiction over DC offenders who are on supervised release from prison.  Originally slated to expire in 1992, Congress has extended the life of the Commission four times. Another extension is necessary to ensure the orderly administration of the law, and to avoid the risk of premature release of offenders. If the authorization lapses, the law requires the Commission to set release dates for all parole-eligible Federal prisoners. In addition, there is no mechanism to handle DC parolees who are on supervised release from prison.  A limited extension will avoid these potential problems, and will give the Justice Department time to evaluate whether any changes to the Commission are necessary.  I urge the House to work quickly to pass this bill and send it to the President so that it can be effective before the Commission's authorization expires in October.
