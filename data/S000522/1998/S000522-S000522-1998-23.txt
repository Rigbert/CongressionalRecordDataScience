Mr. Speaker, given the lateness of the hour, I will be very brief.  I do want to thank the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne) for authoring this legislation. I think it sends a very clear and unmistakable message about the Lord's Resistance Army. One has to wonder what Lord they are serving with the kind of atrocities that are committed, stealing upwards of 10,000 kids and then forcing kids, as was pointed out in the resolution, as young as 8 years of age, to carry weapons and to commit atrocities and to try to overthrow the government. It is absolutely appalling.  We have had hearings in our Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights and have heard from some witnesses who spoke firsthand about these atrocities committed by the Lord's Resistance Army. Humanitarian aid workers as well. This resolution is very timely, and again I want to commend my good friend from New Jersey for authoring it and bringing to the full House's attention this terrible situation.
