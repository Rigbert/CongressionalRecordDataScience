 Since 1858, Lawton firefighters have bravely served their fellow village residents, working endlessly to promote the health, safety, and well-being of their community. In addition to providing protection and emergency relief services, the department has actively invested itself in the Lawton community, positively impacting those lives they seek to protect.  I am proud and fortunate to represent the citizens of Southwest Michigan because we believe in continually striving to improve our quality of life. Because of the fine work of courageous men and women at the Lawton Fire Department, Michigan is truly a better place to live.  Again, it is my honor to stand today in recognition of the Lawton Fire Department for its 150 years of outstanding and selfless service to the residents of Lawton, Michigan.                          ____________________
