 Charlie passed away last month at the age of 94, and I thank the gentlewoman from Cleveland for organizing this special order in his memory.  Charlie Vanik was a beautiful person. In many ways, he was the quintessential Clevelander--born of Czechoslovakian ancestry, he represented Cleveland's east side and eastern suburbs and did so with distinction and with class. He was learned and determined. As Dick Feigler, the well-known journalist in Cleveland said of Charlie, ``It was all about hard work and humility.'' Charlie Vanik was a showman, but he wasn't a showoff. He was charming and he was humble.  He threw himself into public service with a style and gusto that his constituents enjoyed and appreciated. He took his responsibilities seriously, but he didn't take himself seriously. He rose to a position of prominence on the Ways and Means Committee. In fact, he became chairman of the trade subcommittee.  But make no mistake: Charlie Vanik never sold out. He never succumbed to the seduction of what the pundits call ``Gucci Gulch.'' Charlie never forgot where he came from: 55th and Broadway had a different values set than Gucci Gulch. Still does.  So Charlie Vanik fought tooth and nail against tax loopholes for big business. He never forgot where he came from. Charlie Vanik may have retired from Congress, but his heart and mind kept working for America everyday.  On a regular basis, I would get phone calls from Charlie, just to say hello. He was never representing a client for monetary compensation--he always just kept working for America, and wanted to share his great ideas. He gave away his ideas--Marcy, he would say, Congress needs more strong voices to protect consumers in our nation, or on another occasion he would call to remind me to replace the sand on the public beaches of the Great Lakes that had either washed away or been used by construction companies over the years. Early on in my career, he advised me to visit many of the foreign embassies located in Washington to link to diplomats and scholars. He shared his love of life, and always called with an enthusiasm that revealed his joyful, encouraging and caring nature. His humanity was underscored by the manner in which he watched over his wife as she became ill. He never lost his way.  His name was attached to one of the landmark pieces of legislation from the Cold War era: the Jackson-Vanik Amendment. In truth, Senator Henry Jackson and Representative Charlie Vanik were actually ahead of theirtime. In an era that predated Bill Clinton's decoupling of human rights and trade, Scoop Jackson and Charlie Vanik insisted that the Soviet Union respect human rights before it could receive most favored nation trading status. Because of Scoop Jackson's and Charlie Vanik's courage and commitment, hundreds of thousands of oppressed people--mainly Soviet Jews--were able to leave tyranny behind and start new lives as free people.  Madam Speaker, it is no longer fashionable to talk about the linkage between human rights and trading privileges. But, if anything, the issue is even more relevant today than when Charlie Vanik stood up for oppressed people. That's why I say Charlie Vanik was ahead of his time.  Just ask Wei Jing Sheng, who continues to fight for human rights for the millions of oppressed people in China. Ask the family and friends of Santiago Rafael Cruz, who was murdered earlier this year in Monterrey, Mexico, where he fought hard to get human rights for peasant workers.  We see the trafficking in human beings from Mexico to the United States. But the proponents of free trade fundamentalism still deny any linkage between trade and human rights. We see the gross human rights abuses in China and the growing unrest among rural people there. Yet we're told there's no connection between trade and human rights.  Despite all the abuses that perpetrated against poor people around the world in the name of globalization, the free trade crowd refuses to acknowledge any connection between trade and human rights.  We see all these things and we can't help but wish for more Charlie Vaniks--for more Members like him--genial, compassionate and humble public servants who have the eyes to see injustice and the heart to do something about it.                          ____________________
