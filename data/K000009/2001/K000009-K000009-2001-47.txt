Speaker, as one Member, I feel a particular obligation at this time in our country's history to help provide information and insight to the American people, and indeed to the people around the world, who are looking to us for leadership and for an explanation of enduring freedom, the roots of the engagement in which we now find ourselves involved with a growing coalition around the world. From time to time I will be coming to the floor, as I did last week and now again, to talk about some of the events in past years that have created the context for the conflict in which we as a Nation have now been placed in dead center.  Last week we talked a bit about the economics of the Middle East and America's over-reliance on imported oil and the fact that each of the economies of the larger region in which this conflict is occurring make money primarily from oil, with Saudi Arabia being the largest supplier of petroleum to the United States.  In Toledo today, where I just flew from, gas prices are down to 99 cents to $1.01 a gallon. Do not tell me there is no relationship between the desire of the oil-producing countries to have America win this battle and therefore to manipulate a bit on the spot market and the price of petroleum. I am sure Americans in the short term think that is probably a good thing, but in the long run what it does is it connects us to a very unstable part of the world.  Indeed, 52 percent of the petroleum that we consume is imported from Saudi Arabia, from Nigeria, from Venezuela, from Mexico. America now consumes three times more in imported petroleum than she did 20 years ago. Oil and our inability to make ourselves energy self-sufficient here at home, simply because we have not had the will, is our major strategic vulnerability; and again we are faced with major unrest in the Middle East, this time some of that being brought to our own shores.  I wanted to talk a bit tonight about a wonderful book that I read 15 yearsago and I have been rereading over the last few days called ``Sacred Rage,'' by a very well known journalist in our country, Robin Wright, who is both courageous and I think has shades of genius. The subheading of this book is ``The Wrath of Militant Islam.''  I just finished the chapter on Kuwait. Last night I was reading about Lebanon. I cannot go into the entire book this evening, but I will reference one of the beginning chapters that deals with Iran and the turning point as she, the author, would view it in the Middle East back in March 1982 when over 300, nearly 400 mullahs, religious leaders from that part of the world, convened at a conference in Tehran in the Revolutionary Nation of Iran at that point, and Iran was turning from a monarchy to a theocracy, and the men that came together at that time, and I will quote from the book, because it is very insightful and it bears on what is happening today, agreed to several common goals.  They agreed, first, that religion should not be separated from politics. This is a very foreign thought to people of the United States in this democratic Republic.  Second, they agreed that the only way to achieve true independence was to return to their Islamic roots.  Third, they agreed there should be no reliance on superpowers or other outsiders in their region, and the region should be rid of them.  Fourth, they recommended that the Shia, which is one sect of Islam, should be more active in getting rid of foreign powers.  Now, the Persian Gulf War a few years after that, of course, engaged the United States in trying to hold the border of Kuwait as Iraq attempted to move into that country. After that particular war, the Persian Gulf War, which was largely fought for oil, in my opinion, and the preservation of those oil supply lines through the Persian Gulf to the United States, I do not think that was a moral goal, but it was a goal that this Congress voted for and the American people supported, but after that the American people kind of forgot. It was over. Sure, we deal with the veterans in our districts and the people that served over there, but we became more and more hooked through the decade of the 1990s on imported fuel.  Not everyone has ignored this unfortunate development; and today, or actually yesterday, a brilliant writer, Rob Nixon, who resides in Madison, Wisconsin, a professor at the University of Wisconsin, wrote an editorial entitled ``A Dangerous Appetite for Oil,'' and I am only going to quote a couple sentences of it. I will enter it into the Record this evening.  He advises the most decisive war we can wage on behalf of national security and America's global image is the war against our own oil gluttony. He talks about the fact that for nearly a century, oil has been responsible for more of America's international entanglements and anxieties than any other industry. Oil continues to be a major source of America's strategic vulnerability and of its reputation as a bully in the Islamic world and beyond. Frankly, America made friends and supported regimes that could continue the oil lifeline to this country, and part of the ``Sacred Rage'' relates to the exclusionary manner in which the governments of those nations dealt with their own populations and the rather maldistribution of wealth that occurred.  Now, that is not America's fault; but we should be focused on those forces that create some of the rage that is directed against us and those forces that we contain here at home we should be about doing. One of those forces is to make ourselves energy self-sufficient here at home. That is what Rob Nixon writes about.  He talks about outside the West, the development of oil resources has repeatedly impeded democracy and social stability. The oil extraction industry typically concentrates wealth and power and provides many incentives for corruption and iron-fisted rule. In most oil exporting countries, the gap between rich and poor widens over time; and from the perspective of local people beneath whose land the oil lies, the partnership between oil transnationals and repressive regimes has been ruinous, destroying subsistence cultures while offering little in return. In fact, he quotes then the Nigerian writer, Ken Saro-Wiwa, who was hanged in 1995 for leading protests against such destruction and dubbed that process ``genocide by environmental means.''  Mr. Nixon writes, ``Oil and related extractive industries have arguably done more to tarnish America's image abroad than any other commercial pursuit. By scaling back our reliance on foreign oil, we could reduce a major cause of anti-American feeling while simultaneously decreasing our vulnerability to oil embargoes and price spikes,'' and I might add the manipulation of the market which is occurring inside our borders today.                              {time}  2015  But we will never be able to drill our way out of this. In fact, even if we were to drill in the Arctic Wildlife Refuge, we would get about 140 days worth of supply for this country. And he, like many others across this country, talks about encouraging more quickly advances in developing wind and wave power, biomass research, which is something I so strongly support, particularly with the development of ethanol and biodiesel so I can buy it and you can buy it; transport fuels based on renewable oilseed crops, and photovoltaic modules that can convert, even diffuse, light into electricity, such as is being done by Solar Cells, a new company in my district.  We can do this. We can do this in the United States. We just have not had the will to do it. As far as having oil as our chief proxy of our foreign policy in the Middle East, what a dangerous dependence. What a dangerous dependence this has proven to be for our people.  Robin Wright, in her book Sacred Rage, was given many, many commendations by well-known Americans, one of them Roger Mudd from NBC News who said, ``If ever there was the right book on the right subject for the right readers at the right time, Sacred Rage is it. The Kansas City Star wrote, when the book was published, ``Robin Wright manages against all odds to get a fix on a phenomenon that is complex, elusive, and kaleidoscopic. Moreover, her style of writing is so vivid that the book reads like a novel.'' I know that those who are listening can also get this at local libraries.  Mr. Speaker, if one looks at page 69, one will see a poster from the Party of God, which is one of the groups operating, in this case in Lebanon at that time, and it shows a powerful image of how those who were engaged in this particular sect felt about the West. It is important for Americans to understand who is actually trying to exert this negative force against us and to understand why, because once the why is understood, we can begin to move the world forward.  Today in The New York Times, there was an editorial by Thomas Friedman, which I will also enter into the Record, called Drilling for Tolerance. And again, he talks about why there is such instability in that part of the world, the role of oil in shaping our foreign policy to too great an extent and, again, he proves the point that trade has not brought freedom. He talks about how little many who should have known here in the United States understand about the internal politics of Saudi Arabia, and, in fact, some of the very schools that are educating youth to hate us. He talks about all public schools, the religion classes in Saudi Arabia, students being required to learn the following, and it states, ``It is compulsory for the Muslims to be loyal to each other and to consider the infidels their enemy.'' That is, anyone who is a non-Muslim is an infidel, someone who is an enemy. Imagine this being taught to 10-years-olds, 12-year-olds. He goes on to talk about how it is time to tell the truth. He says he was always for getting rid of oil imports before September 11, but now even more. He says, Why should we continue to purchase oil from countries like Saudi Arabia when they are using the very proceeds to buy textbooks to teach this kind of wrath to their youth?  So I just this evening very much want to urge the American people to have courage in these moments. The depth of this democracy of our great Republic will weather us again. We have educated all of our people. We believe in helping both men and women move forward in our country. We believe very much in free enterprise. Weare not a monarchy. We believe in helping to distribute the resources of this land to all who work hard, and for those who are unfortunate and cannot, we try to take care of them as well. Those strengths, along with our military and with the great patriotism we have, will carry us through.               [From the Foreign Affairs, Oct. 30, 2001]                         Drilling For Tolerance                        (By Thomas L. Friedman)       In April 1988 Saudi Arabia asked the U.S. to withdraw its      newly appointed ambassador, Hume Horan, after only six      months. News reports said King Fahd just didn't like the U.S.      envoy. What the Saudis didn't like about him, though was that      he was the best Arabic speaker in the State Department, and      had used his language skills to engage all kinds of Saudis,      including the kingdom's conservative religious leaders who      were critical of the ruling family. The Saudis didn't want      someone so adroit at penetrating their society, so--of      course--we withdrew Mr. Horan.       Ever since then we've been sending non-Arabic-speaking      ambassadors to Riyadh--mostly presidential cronies who knew      exactly how to penetrate the White House but didn't have a      clue how to penetrate Saudi Arabia. Yes sir, we got the      message: As long as the Saudis kept the oil flowing, what      they taught in their schools and mosques was not our      business. And what we didn't know wouldn't hurt us.       Well, on Sept. 11 we learned just how wrong that view was.      What we didn't know hurt us very badly. On Sept. 11 we      learned all the things about Saudi Arabia that we didn't      know: that Saudi Arabia was the primary funder of the      Taliban, that 15 of the hijackers were disgruntled young      Saudis and that Saudi Arabia was allowing fund-raising for      Osama bin Laden--as long as he didn't use the money to attack      the Saudi regime.       And most of all, we've learned about Saudi schools. As this      newspaper recently reported from Riyadh, the 10th-grade      textbook for one of the five required religion classes taught      in all Saudi public schools states: ``It is compulsory for      the Muslims to be loyal to each other and to consider the      infidels their enemy.'' This hostile view of non-Muslims,      which is particularly pronounced in the strict Saudi Wahhabi      brand of Islam, is reinforced through Saudi sermons, TV shows      and the Internet.       There is something wrong with this picture: Since Sept. 11,      the president of the United States has given several speeches      about how Islam is a tolerant religion, with no core      hostility to the West. But the leader of Saudi Arabia, the      keeper of the Muslim Holy places, hasn't given one.       The truth is, there are at least two sides to Saudi Arabia,      but we've pretended that there's only one. There is the      wealthy Saudi ruling family and upper middle classes, who      send their kids to America to be educated and live Western-     style lives abroad and behind the veil at home. And there is      an Islamist element incubating religious hostility toward      America and the West, particularly among disaffected,      unemployed Saudi youth.       It is said that truth is the first victim of war. Not this      war. In the war of Sept. 11, we've been the first victims of      our own inability to tell the truth--to ourselves and to      others. It's time now to tell the truth. And the truth is      that with the weapons of mass destruction that are now easily      available, how governments shape the consciousness, mentality      and imagination of their young people is no longer a private      matter.       We now have two choices: First, we can decide that the      Saudi ruling family really is tolerant, strong and wants to      be part of the solution, and thus we can urge its members to      educate their children differently and ensure that fund-     raising in their society doesn't go to people who want to      destroy ours. If so, I don't expect the Saudis to teach their      kids to love America or embrace non-Muslim religions.       But if countries want good relations with us, then they      have to know that whatever religious vision they teach in      their public schools we expect them to teach the ``peaceful''      realization of that vision. All U.S. ambassadors need to make      that part of their brief. Because if tolerance is not made      universal, then coexistence is impossible. But such simple      tolerance of other faiths is precisely what Saudi Arabia has      not been teaching.       If the Saudis cannot or will not do that, then we must      conclude that the Saudi ruling family is not really on our      side, and we should move quickly to lessen our dependence      upon it. I was for radical energy conservation, getting rid      of gas-guzzlers and reducing oil imports before Sept. 11--but      I feel even more strongly about it now.       ``Either we get rid of our minivans or Saudi Arabia gets      rid of its text books,'' says Michael Mandelbaum, the Johns      Hopkins foreign policy specialist. ``But one thing we know      for sure--it's dangerous to go on assuming that the two can      coexist.''                                  ____                [From the New York Times, Oct. 29, 2001]                      A Dangerous Appetite For Oil                             (By Rob Nixon)       ADISON, Wis.--For 70 years, oil has been responsible for      more of America's international entanglements and anxieties      than any other industry. Oil continues to be a major source      both of America's strategic vulnerability and of its      reputation as a bully, in the Islamic world and beyond.       President Bush recently urged America to reduce its      reliance on foreign oil. We can take his argument further: by      scaling back our dependence on imported oil, we cannot only      strengthen national security but also enhance America's      international image in terms of human rights and      environmentalism.       Importing oil costs the United States over $250 billion a      year, if one includes federal subsidies and the health and      environmental impact of air pollution. America spends $56      billion on the oil itself and another $25 billion on the      military defense of oil-exporting Middle Eastern countries.      There are additional costs in terms of America's      international reputation and moral credibility: our appetite      for foreign fossil fuels has created a long history of      unsavory marriages of convenience with petrodespots,      generalissimos and formenters of terrorism.       The United States currently finds itself in a coalition      with Russia, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the Northern      Alliance. Their human rights records range from bad to      heinous. This is a conjuncture familiar to oil companies.      From the Persian Gulf states to Indonesia, Turkmenistan,      Kazakhstan, Colombia, Angola and Nigeria, they have cozied up      to dubious, often brutal regimes that allow corporations to      operate with few environmental or human rights constraints.       Outside the West, the development of oil resources has      repeatedly impeded democracy and social stability. The oil-     extraction industry typically concentrates wealth and power      and provides many incentives for corruption and iron-fisted      rule. In most oil-exporting countries the gap between rich      and poor widens over time. From the perspective of local      people beneath whose land the oil lies--Bedouins in the      Middle East, the Huaorani in Ecuador, Nigeria's Ijaw and      Ogoni, the Acehnese of Indonesia--the partnership between oil      transnationals and repressive regimes has been ruinous,      destroying subsistence cultures while offering little in      return. The Nigerian writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, hanged in 1995 for      leading protests against such destruction, dubbed the process      ``genocide by environmental means.''       Oil and related extractive industries have arguably done      more to tarnish America's image abroad than any other      commercial pursuit. By scaling back our reliance on foreign      oil we could reduce a major cause of anti-American feeling      while simultaneously decreasing our vulnerability to oil      embargoes and price spikes.       Long before the Sept. 11 attacks, President Bush adopted      the slogan, ``National security depends on energy security.''      How can America best come closer to energy self-     sufficiency? To date, the Bush administration has changed      our relationship to fossil fuels primarily by deregulating      and decentralizing controls, while advocating increased      drilling. Interior Secretary Gale Norton supports opening      up many wilderness study areas, national monuments and      roadless national forests for oil and gas leases.       But we will never be able to drill our way out of even our      short-term energy problems, much less our long-term ones.      America consumes 25 percent of the world's oil while      possessing less than 4 percent of global oil reserves. Even      opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling would      provide a mere 140 days' worth of fuel. Such modest new      supplies would take an estimated seven years to reach the      consumer and would be more costly than imported oil.       We have to be more inventive about easing our reliance on      all oil, foreign and domestic. A good start would be to      reverse the administration's rollbacks in financing research      into fuel efficiency and renewable, clean energy sources. We      need to build on the encouraging advances in developing wind      and wave power, biomass research, transport fuels based on      renewable oilseed crops, and photovoltaic modules that can      convert even diffuse light into electricity. Some of the most      promising progress has been in energy efficiency: household      appliances that require half the energy they did a decade      ago; cars that can get 70 miles per gallon.       Changing public attitudes is going to be an even steeper      challenge. Yet is it too much to hope that the S.U.V. will      come to be viewed as an unpatriotic relic of the 90's, when      America's dependence on foreign oil spiked by over 40      percent? Is it unreasonable to believe that with commitments      from Detroit and government, hybrid cars could become not      just more sophisticated but sexier, narrowing the gap between      fashion and conscience while saving us money at the pump?      Could hybrids and fuel-efficient vehicles emerge as the cars      of choice for a more patriotic and worldly America?       Redesigning hybrids is one thing; the business of      remodeling American consumer desire is an undertaking      altogether more ambitious. But we do have precedents:      remember the beloved Oldsmobile 88's and Ford LTD's that lost      their appeal after the 1973 Arab oil embargo? With a      combination of pocketbook incentives, government stimulus and      industry inventiveness, perhaps we could tart uncoupling      America's passion for the automobile from our dangerous and      doomed appetite for oil. The most decisive war we can wage on      behalf of national security and America's global image is the      war against our own oil gluttony.                          ____________________
