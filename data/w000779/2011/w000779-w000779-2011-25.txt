President, I am pleased today to be joined by Senators Ayotte, Begich, Heller, Merkley, and Shaheen to submit a simple but important bipartisan resolution. Our resolution simply expresses a sense of the Senate that the government should not sack small online businesses with any new tax collecting mandates that would hurt their competitiveness, hurt economic recovery, hurt competition, and harm consumers.  The Internet is transforming the way that commerce is conducted. It is leveling the playing field so that the marketplace--whether for goods and services or for ideas--is less and less dominated by the big and by the powerful. The Internet is democratizing information, speech, and making it easier to exchange ideas as well as goods and services.  The legal regime that the United States currently has in place, which facilitates e-commerce, must be protected. Our Constitution and laws such as the Internet Tax Freedom Act and section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which I championed and protect e-commerce platforms from litigation and small e-commerce businesses from being crushed by layers and layers of state and local taxes, are the pillars that support America's e-commerce platforms and online entrepreneurs' ability to compete.  Everyone in this body recognizes that small businesses are the engines of our economy. They are responsible for the bulk of innovation and job creation in this country--job creation that is so desperately needed right now. In this difficult economic period, however, many State and local governments are facing budgetary shortfalls. It is a difficult challenge that I am sure all of my colleagues recognize, but State budget gaps should not be filled by imposing new tax collecting mandates on the very types of businesses that we rely on to innovate and create the new jobs of tomorrow. But that is what some people are suggesting that Congress allow. I am opposed to that right now, especially given the economic challenges that we face.  Let me give just one example of why we shouldn't upset the legal regime that is currently working to foster innovation, encourage e-commerce and interstate economic activity and which supports jobs. Without the regime that we have in place, a small online retailer, whether it is someone that is selling new merchandise or used merchandise, would be responsible for collecting sales tax for up to 15,000 different sales tax jurisdictions. That is just not a reasonable thing to expect. That is not a reasonable thing to expect particularly, say, from a stay-at-home parent who sells household goods online to supplement the family's income. Or a college student who buys and sells used merchandise online to help finance the increasingly higher costs of attending college. We don't want to saddle online entrepreneurs like these with new tax collecting responsibilities that will, in effect, put them right out of business.  I look forward to working with my Senate colleagues to build support for this resolution and to ensure that we keep the policies in place that enable small businesses, including online businesses, to have a policy environment that allows them to innovate and create good American jobs.                          ____________________
