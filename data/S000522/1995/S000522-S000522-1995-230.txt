Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights, which I chair, held a hearing on the upcoming Fourth International Conference on Women, currently scheduled to be held in Beijing later this summer.  Numerous eloquent witnesses called attention to certain features of the draft document that this conference will almost certainly adopt. While there is much that is positive in the document, there is also a systematic denigration of marriage, childrearing, and family. As was pointed out at our hearing by Cecilia Royals of the National Institute of Womanhood, the document disparages a central life experience of 90 percent of the world's women, and attempts to turn women who emphasize family life into a new marginalized class.  I would like to put before my colleagues the testimony of another witness: Diane Knippers, president of the Institute on Religion and Democracy, and cochair of the Ecumenical Coalition on Women and Society [ECWS] Beijing team. Ms. Knipper's testimony offers several reasons for doubting the draft document's effectiveness as a tool for promoting the human rights of women.                     Testimony of Diane L. Knippers       The adoption of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights      in 1948 gave the world a powerful mechanism for holding      nations accountable for the basic rights of all persons.      Sadly, in recent years we have seen efforts to erode these      basic standards as authoritarian governments argue that human      rights are not universal, but are culturally relative. But      another form of erosion is more subtle, more insidious, and      more dangerous. It is the trend toward defining every      conceivable social goal as a human right--whether or not      these social goals are properly the responsibilities of      governments and whether or not they are even obtainable. The      result is obvious. When everything is considered a right,      finally nothing can be defended as a right.       The Fourth World Conference on Women and its draft Platform      for Action offer prime examples of this erosion. The adoption      of this platform will undermine the pursuit of basic human      rights. Even more troubling, it will also sacrifice efforts      on behalf of women whose rights are the most repressed and      abused in favor of the controversial social goals of Western      gender feminists. This is a tragedy.       Let me cite several examples of the human rights flaws in      the draft Platform for Action and the conference itself.       A. The draft Platform's commitment to universality is      unsure.       Every reference to universal human rights is bracketed. If      this document does not affirm universality it will mark a      serious regression in the progress toward human rigths within      the international community.       B. The call to address the basic rights of women is blurred      and minimized in the draft Platform's context of social      engineering and expansive and questionable goals.       Serious abuses of rights of women, even when mentioned in      the document, are diminished in the context of grandiose      plans for re-engineering society. For example, achieving for      all women the basic right to vote and participate in      elections is a much more urgent task than working to      ensure equality of outcomes such as equal numbers of men      and women in all parliaments.       Let me offer examples of abuses of women that are mentioned      in the draft Platform, but diminished by the larger context.      There is the urgent need to combat prostitution and      pornography, particularly involving children. A recent report      of a religious group which operates ministries in Thailand to      young women who have been forced into prostitution tells of      girls as young as 12 sold to brothels. One child said the      brothel owner would beat her to make her stop crying while      she was ``entertaining'' customers.       Another example is slavery, which has not been eradicated      but is still practiced in nations such as Mauritania and      Sudan. A recent fact-finding team organized by Christian      Solidarity International reports that local officials      estimate that some 1,000 women and children have been taken      into slavery in the last five years from one Sudanese town      alone. Team members met a 14-year-old Sudanese girl who had      been kidnapped and sold into slavery when she was seven. Yet      the atrocity of human slavery gets only passing mention in      the 121-page Platform for Action.       Such blatant and egregious human rights abuses are      trivialized in the context of a document that takes on the      grandiose aim to redefine gender roles in every society with      no reference to biological differences between men and women.       C. The Platform will result in the expansion of the      coercive and intrusive powers of governments and      international agencies in the lives of individuals and      families.       The goals of the draft Platform for Action--particularly      (1) defining equality as outcome rather than opportunity and      (2) obliterating any distinctive male or female roles--will      lead inexorably to the expansion of the coercive power of      governments. There is no question that this will contribute      to anti-democratic practices. It will also undermine the      rights of individuals and families (beginning with the rights      of parents to train their own children).       D. Serious human rights abuses, such as religious      repression, are ignored.       The most serious omission in the draft Platform is any      acknowledgement of freedom of conscience or of religion for      women. Throughout the document, religion is cited as a source      of repression of women. There is only one brief (and still      bracketed) acknowledgement of the spiritual needs of      women. But nowhere in 121 pages does the document call for      religious freedom for women.       Women should have the right to engage in religious      practice, to change their religion, and to propagate their      religious faith, particularly to their children. Women who      change their religion should be free of the threat of state-     imposed divorce or the threat of having their children taken      from them. The irony is that this conference on women is      being held in a country which currently imprisons women for      practicing their faith.       E. Holding the Fourth World Conference on Women in China      also serves to undermine international human rights      standards.       The Ecumenical Coalition on Women and Society is calling      upon the U.S. government to boycott the Beijing women's      conference unless two conditions are met. The first is that      Harry Wu must be freed from prison. The second is that our      government must obtain assurances from the Peoples Republic      of China that U.S. citizens and other UN conference      participants will enjoy the basic rights of freedom of      conscience, freedom of opinion and expression, and freedom of      peaceful assembly as guaranteed in the Universal Declaration      of Human Rights.       Women in non-governmental organizations going to Beijing      are being told that they risk interrogation if they meet in      groups of more than five, that they cannot meet in hotel      rooms, they can't unfurl banners, they can't take in      religious literature, they can't engage in corporate prayer      outside a special tent, they can't take unregistered      computers or fax machines into hotel rooms. How can we begin      to discuss human rights in a climate in which those rights      are ignored and abused? It would be unconscionable for the      United States to participate in such a sham.                               conclusion       Women are brutally denied basic human rights in many parts      of the world. Women suffer denial of educational      opportunities and property rights, forced abortion and forced      sterilization, genital mutilation, prostitution, rape, female      infanticide, the threat of execution for apostasy or      blasphemy, slavery--the list goes on and on.       The campaign to combat the truly horrible abuses of women      is undermined by linking women's rights with highly      questionable economic, social, and environmental theories.      The Beijing agenda goes far beyond basic rights for women. The draft      Platform claims that peace and development cannot be achieved      unless women represent 50 percent of all national and      international political and economic agencies. How or why      women are uniquely capable of bringing in this utopia is      never explained.       The danger of the Beijing women's conference is that it      attempts sweeping and unnecessary social change--change that      will undermine rather than enhance the rights of women. The      draft Platform for Action equals or surpasses the Marxist-     Leninist experiment in its ambition. The draft Platform for      Action calls for the most intrusive, arrogant, and radical      restructuring of the social order in human history--all on      the baseless assumption that this will produce a just,      prosperous, and peaceful world. I'm convinced of the      opposite. It is the road to tyranny and oppression for women      and for men.                               ____________________
