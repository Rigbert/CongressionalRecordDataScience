President, I congratulate all those who participated in our recent Federal and State elections. In Vermont 63 percent of registered voters went to the polls and voted. In other States it was a bit more, in some a bit less.  The 2000 presidential election reminds us all that every vote counts. State electoral votes for President and Vice President may be decided in some States by the fewest in history, literally a handful of votes. In New Mexico, the counting continues and the outcome is very close. In Florida, the counting continues and the outcome is very close.  Likewise in Washington State, the vote for the Senator from Washington is still being counted and is very close. A number of House congressional races remain very close and final results may have to await recounts and the outcome of protests and challenges. The results of the Senate and House elections are such that the House and Senate themselves will have equal numbers or almost equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans.  I want to commend all those who participated. I welcome our newest Senators-elect. Many are in town this week. I welcome Jean Carnahan, Debbie Stabenow, Tom Carper, Jon Corzine, Mark Dayton, Ben Nelson, Bill Nelson, and Hillary Rodham Clinton. In addition, we may be joined by Maria Cantwell. We will be joined by George Allen, and John Ensign. All will add greatly to our ranks and, I hope, to the Senate's ability to find answers to the problems of the American people.  The Congress will be confronted with a number of challenges. We will need to find ways to work together. In the Senate, the possibility of a Senate equally divided among Democrats and Republicans has prompted the Democratic Leader to make the suggestion that we consider new and less confrontational organizational principles that would include equal membership ratios on our Committees and equal staffing and equitable sharing of resources. Those are suggestions that should be seriously considered. I look forward to working with all Senators in the coming days: Senators in this Congress as we complete our work before adjourning sine die and Senators in the next Congress as we organize for our work in January.                          ____________________
