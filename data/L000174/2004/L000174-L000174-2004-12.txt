President, I am pleased that the House has voted to pass the Cooperative Research and Technology Enhancement Act, the CREATE Act of 2004, sending this important and needed legislation to the White House for the President's signature. This past March, I joined with Senator Hatch, Senator Kohl, and Senator Feingold introducing the CREATE Act, which will provide a needed remedy to one aspect of our Nation's patent laws.  In 1980, Congress passed the Bayh-Dole Act, which encouraged private entities and not-for-profits such as universities to form collaborative partnerships that aid innovation. Prior to the enactment of this law, universities were issued fewer than 250 patents each year. Thanks to the Bayh-Dole Act, the number of patents universities have been issued in more recent years has surpassed 2,000--adding billions of dollars annually to the U.S. economy.  The CREATE Act corrects a provision in the Bayh-Dole Act which, when read literally, runs counter to the intent of that legislation. In 1997, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled, in Oddzon Products, Inc. v. Just Toys, Inc., that non-public information may in certain cases be considered ``prior art''--a standard which generally prevents an inventor from obtaining a patent. The Oddzon ruling was certainly sound law, but it was not sound public policy, and as a result some collaborative teams have been unable to receive patents for their work. As a consequence, there is a deterrent from forming this type of partnership, which has proved so beneficial to universities, the private sector, the American worker, and the U.S. economy.  Recognizing Congress' intended purpose in passing the Bayh-Dole Act, the Federal Circuit invited Congress to better conform the language of the act to the intent of the legislation. The CREATE Act does exactly that by ensuring that non-public information is not considered ``prior art'' when the information is used in a collaborative partnership under the Bayh-Dole Act. The bill that the House passed today also includes strict evidentiary burdens to ensure that the legislation is tailored narrowly so as only to achieve this goal that--although narrow--is vitally important.  I also wish to draw attention to Senator Hatch's statement of June 25, 2004, in which he explained some of the more complex issues surrounding the CREATE Act. I agree entirely with his comments, which I will prove useful for those seeking a background understanding of this legislation.  Again, I thank the House for moving to pass this legislation as the 108th Congress drew to a close, and I would also like to thank in particular Senator Hatch, Senator Kohl, Senator Feingold, Senator Grassley, and Senator Schumer for their hard work in gaining this bill's passage.                          ____________________
