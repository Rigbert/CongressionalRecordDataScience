Isn't it true that Harry Truman, a Democratic Senator from Missouri, initiated this investigation into what he called profiteering during the war at the expense of soldiers and taxpayers, and was literally examining the practices of a Democratic President, Franklin Roosevelt, with that commission, so that here he was, a Democrat, saying he had a higher responsibility to the taxpayers and soldiers. He was going to investigate the activities of the War Department under a Democratic President. I ask the Senator, was that not the case?
