 President, most people in America work 5 days a week. It is 1 o'clock on a Thursday. What is the problem? We have broad bipartisan agreement about the approach we ought to take with regard to the Iran sanctions issue. The leaders on my side are all standing on the floor of the Senate and are anxious to be involved in working out the language.  I say to my friend, he said it is a sentence in the resolution. A sentence can sometimes change the entire meaning. How this is crafted is not irrelevant. Rather than us standing out here on the Senate floor pointing fingers, it is only 1 p.m. on a Thursday afternoon; let's sit down and work out the differences and pass something we can agree on and try to make a difference.
