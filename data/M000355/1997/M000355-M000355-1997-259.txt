 President, my friend and colleague, Senator Leahy, the ranking Democrat on the subcommittee, is detained down at the White House for the time being. I see his colleague, Senator Dorgan, standing in for him. We will, while Senator Dorgan is here, by mutual agreement, take care of several managers' amendments here at the outset of the discussion of this year's foreign operations bill.  There are a list of eight managers' amendments, which I will refer to and then send to the desk en bloc.  There is the McConnell-Leahy amendment requiring a report on the management of the Russia enterprise fund and prohibiting establishment of a private-public entity to manage the defense enterprise fund activities; a Leahy amendment establishing credit authority for AID; a Leahy amendment allowing funds to be transferred to the Export-Import Bank for NIS activities; a Leahy technical corrections amendment to section 571; a McConnell-Leahy amendment providing authorities to DSAA for the costs associated with the transfer of EDA to Central and East European countries and use of less expensive commercial transport and stockpiles in Thailand and Korea; a McConnell-Leahy amendment providing DSAA authority to obligate funds upon apportionment; a McConnell-Leahy amendment to provide a date for the report on Ukraine; and a Leahy amendment with a technical change on page 92.
