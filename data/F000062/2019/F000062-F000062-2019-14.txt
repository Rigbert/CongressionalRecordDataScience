 President, today, along with every other Senate Democrat, I am proud to introduce the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2019.  This bill passed the House by a vote of 163-158, with 33 Republicans supporting it.  It was written by the people on the front lines helping victims. It is not a Democratic bill or a Republican bill, it is a bill crafted by and for survivors who know exactly what's need in the real world. In other words, it is the survivors' bill. As I stated before, any reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act must do two things.  First, it must preserve the advancements made when it was last reauthorized in 2013. And second, it must include meaningful improvements to the law.  The meaningful legal improvements in this bill are particularly important, and I would like to highlight three. First, this bill preserves the anti-discrimination protections that were made in 2013. These protections are particularly important to the LGBT community. According to the Center for Disease Control, along with 35 percent of heterosexual women, 44 percent of lesbian women, and 61 percent of bisexual women experience rape, physical violence, or stalking by an intimate partner.  Similarly, the 2015 U.S. transgender survey found that 47 percent of transgender people have been sexually assaulted. Simply put, these protections are important and we should not only be preserving them, we should be doing more to strengthen them. This bill also makes meaningful improvements to the law to address domestic violence in Indian country. For example, it expands jurisdiction over non-Indians for crimes against children, elders, and law enforcement.  A 2016 Justice Department report explained that ``more than four in five American Indian and Alaska Native women have experienced violence in their lifetime.''  The report also found that 56 percent have experienced sexual violence, 56 percent have experienced violence at the hands of an intimate partner, and 9 percent have been stalked. For me, these numbers are even more upsetting because California has the largest Tribal population in the United States. We must continue to respect Tribal sovereignty and ensure that we are doing the most to protect the most vulnerable among us, particularly children. Finally, this bill also keeps guns out of the hands of domestic abusers.  Guns are the most likely way for domestic violence to take a woman's life. Women in the United States are eleven times more likely to be murdered by a firearm than in other high-income countries. The presence of guns in domestic violence situations increases the chances that a woman will be murdered by 500 percent. This bill makes modest, but necessary, improvements to the law to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers.  For example, the bill amends current law so that people convicted of stalking cannot possess firearms.  Yet, the National Rifle Association opposes it. 33 Republicans still voted for the House bill, and I hope my Republicans colleagues in the Senate will do the same. It's the right thing to do. The different parts of the Violence Against Women Act are all linked.  For instance, preserving the non-discrimination advancements made when VAWA was reauthorized in 2013 will help protect the LGBT community, but keeping guns out of the hands of domestic abusers will help protect LGBT victims as well.  This bill takes this sort of comprehensive approach by, for example, preserving the advances made to non-discrimination protections and improving the law in the areas of Tribal protections and gun safety. There is no simple way to stop domestic violence, but we have a duty to do all that we can.  I thank the president, and I yield the floor.                                 ______                                       By
