Speaker, the question of the day is ``Where are the jobs?'' I will tell you where they're not. They're not in Michigan. Our unemployment is 15.2 percent. And sadly, in this House, we passed an awful energy bill a couple of weeks ago called cap-and-trade. That bill will add nearly a trillion dollars to the cost of businesses and homes across this country. Does that help with jobs? Absolutely not.  In fact, one of my constituents in Michigan said their utility increases, their electricity costs will go up by nearly 40 percent by the year 2024. Is that going to help with jobs? Absolutely not.  Did the Rules Committee allow us to add jobs with an amendment that would build perhaps as many as 100 new nuclear reactors in this country, tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of jobs? No. The Rules Committee said, You cannot offer that amendment.  Now, where are the jobs going? They're going to India and China. Did you happen to see on July 16 The New York Times where Secretary Chu said that if China's emissions of global warming gasses keep growing at the pace of the last 30 years, the country will emit more gasses in the next three decades than the United States.  Where are the jobs?                          ____________________
