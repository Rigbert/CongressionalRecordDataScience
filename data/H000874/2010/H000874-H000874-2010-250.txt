 The last time we voted on this issue, the floor was packed on both sides of the aisle. And I observed at that time that, and I repeat today, I really doubt that there are any of the 435 of us, Madam Speaker, who believe that this matter that is included in this rule ought to be defeated. I would hope that's the case.  The gentleman who represents the minority party on the Rules Committee has confronted this issue in the past. He confronted it in 2002. He confronted it in 2003. He confronted it in 2004 and again in 2005. On each of those occasions, he voted to increase the debt limit. His party was in charge. Unfortunately, my party voted against it at that point in time because we weren't in charge.  The point I make is that the American public too often believes that we do not do what we think is the responsible thing for our country but what we think is the right thing to do from the perspective of our party. They are not impressed by that kind of action. In fact, not only did Mr. Sessions vote to increase the debt limit on numerous occasions, many of us voted against it essentially for the same reasons, because we said the other party had incurred liabilities with which we did not agree. In fact, I'm sure all 435 of us could say we incurred certain liabilities in which we did not agree.  But the fact of the matter is that America, voting through its representatives in the House and in the Senate, incurred those liabilities. Creditors throughout the world relied on the fact that the United States of America, the world's wealthiest Nation, would, in fact, pay its bills.  I will say that in the future when this issue comes up, I will not repeat again the mistakes that I made in the past. I said that last time. And if it so happens at some time in the future the other party is in control and we come to the necessity of ensuring that America can pay its bills, it will be my intention to vote with the majority party to increase the debt limit--not because I want to see us deficit spend; I don't. I voted for constitutional amendments to balance the budget to constrain the spending of this body.  In a few minutes, I will speak strongly in favor of adopting statutory PAYGO, which is made in order by this rule. Statutory PAYGO will be a constraint on the spending that this Congress votes for, a restraint to bring in line spending on mandatory items with the revenues and abilities that we have.  And so I say to both sides of the aisle, this is not a vote about party. This is a vote about country. There is no one in this room, no one who has raised his or her hand to defend and protect the Constitution of the United States, not one of us who honestly can say that it is an alternative available to us to not ensure that America can pay its bills. That's what this is about.  That's why my friends on the Republican side, when you were in charge, you voted, in some cases almost to a person, almost unanimously, to increase the debt five times under President Bush.  Very frankly, I tell my friends on the Republican side, when President Bush was in office, we did the same thing you're going to do today. We pretended that somehow because we did not agree with the policies that had led us to the place where we had incurred those debts that somehow we would take no responsibility for paying those debts. Ladies and gentlemen, our creditors around the world on whom we are now relying in order to fund our government don't really care about our partisan politics. They do care, however, about the will that we have to meet our responsibilities to pay our bills and to meet our obligations to them.  Everybody understands that if we did not increase this debt limit, at some point in time, not too long thereafter, checks to Social Security recipients would have to stop, checks to veterans would have to stop, and checks to employees who work for the government would have to stop. No one thinks that's a rational alternative. We may think there ought to be less or more, but no one thinks that we ought to have none.  And so I say to my colleagues this is a vote for American responsibility, not Republican responsibility or Democratic responsibility, but for American responsibility.  Both of us--both of us have pursued politics in this matter. The American public is hopeful, as we all can see, that at some point in time we all realize that playing politics is not the policy that Americans want us to pursue. They want us to pursue the well-being of our country and of our citizens. We've incurred debts. We expect people to pay the debts they owe us, and they, in turn, expect the same. That's what this vote is about.  And so there are not a lot of Members on this floor. I hope a lot of Members, Madam Speaker, are watching, because I hope when they come to this floor to vote for this rule, which will deem the authorization of the ability of America to meet its responsibilities,that they will vote for their country, for our citizens, and for our responsibility. It's the right thing to do.  Every one of us on each side of the aisle, Republican or Democratic, knows it's the right thing to do. Let's do the right thing. I urge support of this rule. I urge support of the statutory PAYGO provision made in order by this rule, which will say that, notwithstanding the fact that we have authorized additional debt, we are also, at the same time, going to constrain the incurring of additional debt beyond that which we are prepared to pay for. That's what families have to do. That's what we need to do.  Vote for this rule. It's the right thing to do.  The material previously referred to by Mr. Sessions is as follows:                       Amendment to H. Res. 1065                        Offered by Mr. Sessions  At the end of the resolution, add the following new section:       Sec. 2. On the third legislative day after the adoption of      this resolution, immediately after the third daily order of      business under clause 1 of rule XIV and without intervention      of any point of order, the House shall proceed to the      consideration of the bill (H.R. 4566) to terminate authority      under the Troubled Asset Relief Program, and for other      purposes. The bill shall be considered as read. The previous      question shall be considered as ordered on the bill to final      passage without intervening motion or demand for division of      the question except: (1) two hours of debate equally divided      and controlled by the chairmen and ranking minority members      of the Committee on Financial Services and the Committee on      Ways and Means; and (2) one motion to recommit. Clause 1(c)      of rule XIX shall not apply to the consideration of H.R.      4566.                                  ____       (The information contained herein was provided by      Democratic Minority on multiple occasions throughout the      109th Congress.)        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous      question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.      A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote      against the Democratic majority agenda and a vote to allow      the opposition, at least for the moment, to offer an      alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be      debating.       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of      Representatives, (VI, 308-311) describes the vote on the      previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or      control the consideration of the subject before the House      being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous      question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the      subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling      of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the      House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes      the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to      offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the      majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated      the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to      a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to      recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:      ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman      from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to      yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first      recognition.''       Because the vote today may look bad for the Democratic      majority they will say ``the vote on the previous question is      simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on      adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no substantive      legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' But that is      not what they have always said. Listen to the definition of      the previous question used in the Floor Procedures Manual      published by the Rules Committee in the 109th Congress, (page      56). Here's how the Rules Committee described the rule using      information from Congressional Quarterly's ``American      Congressional Dictionary'': ``If the previous question is      defeated, control of debate shifts to the leading opposition      member (usually the minority Floor Manager) who then manages      an hour of debate and may offer a germane amendment to the      pending business.''       Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives,      the subchapter titled ``Amending Special Rules'' states: ``a      refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a      special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the      resolution to amendment and further debate.'' (Chapter 21,      section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: Upon rejection of the      motion for the previous question on a resolution reported      from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member      leading the opposition to the previous question, who may      offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time      for debate thereon.''       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does      have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only      available tools for those who oppose the Democratic      majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the      opportunity to offer an alternative plan.  Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution.
