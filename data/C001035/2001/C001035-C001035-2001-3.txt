This program, which will emphasize a common hullform and technology development, will form the foundation of our future destroyer and cruiser production. The Navy will use the advanced technology and networking capabilities from the DD(X) in the development of additional ships in the DD(X) family of ships program. As Chief of Naval Operations testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee, earlier this year, the DD(X) program ``is central to our [naval] transformation effort . . . and is another step toward the creation of a more integrated Navy/Marine Corps team.'' It is therefore critical that the Senate's FY2002 budget level for the DD(X) program be increased or at least retained in conference.
