President, before I yield the floor, as I see Senator Kennedy is here and wishes to speak, I wish to make a point for the Record.  We introduced this amendment 4 hours ago. I have come to the floor, and but for a brief period off the floor, to entertain any debate on this amendment. In 4 hours there have been four Republican Senators who have come to the floor, one each hour, to oppose this amendment. At this rate, with 49 Republican Senators, in 45 hours we should be able to close this amendment and vote on it. I say that facetiously.  I hope those who have an interest in the amendment will come forward and that we can schedule it for a vote. I have asked repeatedly for that. I don't know what more I can do other than be here and be available for any debate they want to take place.  This is a critically important bill. There are several important amendments, and I think mine might be one of them. But if Members won't come to the floor and debate it, apparently they either don't have an interest in the amendment or the bill. I hope they will seriously consider coming to the floor in the very near future.
