I asked that question because in the State of Oklahoma, I went back and read extensively about our balanced budget amendment which we passed in 1941. The interesting thing is the same arguments that are being used today in this forum were used back then, saying that it would not work, and it has worked since 1941. It would not have worked if it had not been in the constitution.  I thank the Senator for yielding.
