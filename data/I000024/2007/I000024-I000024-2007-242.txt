But I can tell you right now--and by the way, the reason I wasn't here earlier is that I have been, in the last 3 days, in Iraq. And by the way, good things are happening there in spite of what the press will tell you.  I came back somewhat shocked to see some of these amendments because, quite frankly, a lot of people don't understand the process. I don't want anyone out there watching what we are doing today saying that we are killing some useless project. It has nothing to do with that. This is an authorization bill. I will make this clear, but I can't do it in this time unless the Senator from Oklahoma would like to yield 5 minutes of his time.
