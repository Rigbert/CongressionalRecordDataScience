 1378. A bill to combat public corruption, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.                    the anti-corruption act of 1995  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Anti-Corruption Act of 1995, a bill which will strengthen the ability of Federal law enforcement officials to combat election fraud and public corruption by State and local officials. A few excerpts from recent news articles will demonstrate the need for this bill:  The San Diego Union-Tribune writes on October 1 of recent reports,       [T]hat cats and dogs are on the state's voter rolls, that      God is registered to vote in Hollywood, and that a San      Francisco man who died in 1982 has consistently voted for the      past decade.  The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports on the same day of the city comptroller who, a few days earlier, pleaded guilty to--       [I]ncome tax evasion in exchange for dismissal of charges      that he conspired with others to defraud voters in the      comptroller's election two years ago.  The Dallas Morning News reports on September 30, of citizens in rural Costilla County, CO, who,       [S]purred an investigation by the state attorney general      that led to a raft of indictments and guilty pleas for      election fraud [and p]rompted a second investigation by the      attorney general that found fraud and embezzlement by county      officials.  The Hartford Courant reports on August 28, of new efforts to combat voter fraud because of irregularities, including,       [T]wenty-seven felons who voted in 1994 in the race for the      2nd District Congressional seat.  It is no wonder the American people become more disgusted with our system every day. Allegations of vote buying and cries of ``voting irregularities'' pervade every close election.  We would like to think that the losing candidates are only motivated by sour grapes. But too often, investigations turn up cases where a dead, nonetheless patriotic, American manages to roll out of his eternal slumber to do his or her civic duty before the polls close.  Americans' faith is further eroded by daily scandals involving public officials reported in their local paper. This past summer, officials formally closed a nearly 5-year corruption investigation that rocked my own State of Kentucky. Operation BOPTROT resulted in more than a dozen convictions of State legislators, appointed State officials and lobbyists. The BOPTROT sting operation involved bribery and influence peddling at the highest level of Kentucky State government. Although the BOPTROT investigation was closed in early August, FBI officials made it clear that the State has not yet been cleansed of public corruption: ``Public corruption remains the FBI's No. 1 priority in Kentucky,'' according to the lead FBI investigator.  A central problem in preventing corruption in elections and government operations is a lack of Federal guidelines defining what is illegal. Another problem is the jurisdiction over this illegal activity. This bill I am introducing aims at correcting both of these problems.  The bill simply states that if anyone engages in any activity to deprive people of the honest services of their public officials, they will be fined and face a possible 10-year sentence in Federal prison. This includes rigging elections, intimidating voters, buying votes, and bribing officials.  And, this bill makes every act of elections fraud--at every level of government--a Federal offense. It gives Federal prosecutors the jurisdictional authority they need to investigate and prosecute entrenched local corruption.  We have made dramatic changes to the voter registration laws; while it is easier to register and vote, it is also easier to commit election fraud. This bill is needed to discourage those who would seek to defraud the government and abuse the public trust.  Moreover, as we ask the States to assume more responsibility for providing government services, we must ensure that we possess the tools for weeding out and punishing corrupt practices.  The bill also addresses public corruption as it relates to drug trafficking. The facilitation by public officials of drug trafficking would be classified as a class B felony under title 18 of the United States Code.  And, anyone attempting to bribe or actually bribing a public official for help in drug trafficking would be guilty of a class B felony.  Drug use and drug trafficking are back on the rise. It is a lucrative business. Aiding and abetting it can offer a huge stipend to public officials, worth many times their government salaries. This bill would make drug stings sting a lot more--for the pushers and for corrupt politicians.  Mr. President, I have spoken out repeatedly over the years on these issues and on this specific piece of legislation. In past years, this bill, included as an amendment to other pieces of anticrime legislation, has passed the Senate with overwhelming, bipartisan support. But it has never made it to the final conference report.  The bill has also had wide support among the U.S. attorneys, who would be on the front lines prosecuting these crimes. In fact, two former U.S. attorneys in Kentucky have endorsed this bill.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that their letters in support of this legislation be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                           Robinson & McElwee,                                  Lexington, KY, October 26, 1995.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Russell Senate Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: I am writing in support of the      Anti-Corruption Act you are introducing. As you know,      Kentucky has been victimized by public corruption at the      highest levels of state government. My first-hand experience      in Operation BOPTROT, resulting in the conviction of almost      two dozen officials, made me aware of the gaps in federal law      and jurisdiction over influence peddling and corruption.       Your bill would provide federal law enforcement officials      with the necessary tools to fight these plagues on the      taxpayers. And, it would send a message to public officials      everywhere that there will be grave consequences for failing      to uphold the public trust.       The American people grow more and more cynical about our      government and much of the blame can be laid at those who      breach the confidence placed in them by the voters. Your bill      will help restore the faith citizens should have in our great      system.       I am confident your bill will be widely supported among      your colleagues and I wish you every success in speedy      passage.           Sincerely,     Karen K. Caldwell.                                                                    ____                                            Joseph M. Whittle,                                   Prospect, KY, October 16, 1995.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Russell Senate Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: I am pleased to write in support of      your Anti-Corruption Act, a bill you have introduced in      previous Congresses and which has been adopted by a majority      of the Senate.       Since the bill addresses election fraud and corruption by      government officials, it is of particular importance to      Kentucky in view of the 5-year Operation BOPTROT effort. My      involvement in Operation BOPTROT made me aware that current      federal law is not fully adequate to deal with public      corruption. This bill will give federal law enforcement      agents the power and authority to vigorously fight election      fraud, influence peddling and public corruption.       Most of all, your bill will help restore confidence the      American people should have in their government and public      servants.       I wish you success in getting the bill passed. I know it      has enjoyed wide support in the past, and I am confident that      the bill will continue to have support among your colleagues.           Respectfully,                                                Joseph M. Whittle.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am confident this bill will gain the support of the Attorney General.  I am certain that in our renewed effort to gain the public trust, this legislation will be received with resounding approval. I urge my colleagues to support this much-needed legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1378       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
