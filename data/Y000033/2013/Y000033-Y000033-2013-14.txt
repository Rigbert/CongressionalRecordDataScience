Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  H.R. 623 transfers by warranty deed a 2.79-acre parcel of federal land located in Anchorage, Alaska, from the Indian Health Service to the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium. This consortium is a nonprofit authorized by Congress to render health services to Alaska Natives under a contract with the Indian Health Service.  The land has been used for parking to accommodate nearby facilities run by the consortium and the Indian Health Service. It will be used to construct a patient housing facility, thereby expanding its capacity to offer vital health services for Alaska Native patients, some of whom travel great distances from rural areas to receive care.  Following a subcommittee hearing on the bill in May, the Indian Health Service administratively conveyed the land to the consortium by quitclaim deed. H.R. 623 remains necessary because transferring the land by warranty deed provides cleaner title to the property than by quitclaim deed.  The bill was also referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce. The chairman of that committee, Mr. Upton, has kindly foregone action on the bill in the interest of expediting it for consideration on the House floor. I thank him for his cooperation and have an exchange of letters memorializing our agreement. CBO estimates that H.R. 623 would have no significant impact on the Federal budget and would not affect direct spending on revenues.  H.R. 623 is non-controversial, and I hope the House will pass it.  I reserve the balance of my time.                                         House of Representatives,                             Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                  Washington, DC, October 1, 2013.     Hon. Doc Hastings,     Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources, Longworth House          Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Hastings, I write concerning H.R. 623, Alaska      Native Tribal Health Consortium Land Transfer Act, which was      ordered to be reported out of your Committee on July 31,      2013. I wanted to notify you that the Committee on Energy and      Commerce will forgo action on H.R. 623 so that it may proceed      expeditiously to the House floor for consideration.       This is done with the understanding that the Committee on      Energy and Commerce is not waiving any of its jurisdiction,      and the Committee will not in any way be prejudiced with      respect to the appointment of conferees     or its jurisdictional prerogatives on this or similar      legislation.       I would appreciate your response to this letter, confirming      this understanding, and ask that a copy of our exchange of      letters on this matter be included in the Congressional      Record during consideration of H.R. 623 on the House floor.           Sincerely,                                                       Fred Upton,     Chairman.                                  ____                                         House of Representatives,                               Committee on Natural Resources,                                 Washington, DC, October 10, 2013.     Hon. Fred Upton,     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter regarding H.R.      623, the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium Land Transfer      Act. As you know, the Committee on Natural Resources ordered      reported the bill, as amended, on July 31, 2013. I appreciate      your support in bringing this legislation before the House of      Representatives, and accordingly, understand that the      Committee on Energy and Commerce will forego action on the      bill.       The Committee on Natural Resources concurs with the mutual      understanding that by foregoing consideration of H.R. 623 at      this time, the Committee on Energy and Commerce does not      waive any jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in      this or similar legislation. In addition, should a conference      on the bill be necessary, I would support your request to      have the Committee on Energy and Commerce represented on the      conference committee. Finally, I would be pleased to include      your letter and this response in the bill report filed by the      Committee on Natural Resources, as well as in the      Congressional Record during floor consideration, to      memorialize our understanding.       Thank you for your cooperation.           Sincerely,                                                     Doc Hastings,                                                         Chairman.
