Chairman, I have been working 23 years on civil service. I was very pleased to hear the observations of the gentleman, who has had 5 months experience here dealing with this issue.  I agree with the gentleman from Tennessee. The only reason to rush this to judgment is because they are unwilling to debate it fully and to have it open for amendment fully. If they had the courage of the gentleman from Ohio's assertions, they would not fear having this fully considered and debated. That is not the case though, I tell my friend.  Mr. Chairman, I hope we have an amendment. I hope we are able to discuss it fully, at which time we will be able to discuss his thoughts, as the gentleman indicated, which gives some rhetorical tip of the hat to those protections. But they ultimately will be in the discretion of the Secretary and the management at the Pentagon, not of the Congress or the President.  I would hope that the gentleman would review more closely his assertions and that perhaps we could discuss them at greater length at some time in the future.
