 The committee has heard from a number of our colleagues on the Corps' vegetation-on-levees policy. While we commend the Corps for its continued efforts to improve its policies and thereby improve public safety for everyone, we also understand and appreciate that occasionally new policies have unintended consequences. As we move forward with this bill, we intend to have further discussion on this subject.  I commend, again, the gentlewoman from California for her leadership on this issue.
