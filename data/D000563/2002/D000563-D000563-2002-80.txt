President, I rise in honor of Hispanic Heritage Month. For the past 34 years we have formally celebrated the numerous contributions the Hispanic community has made to our country. From September 15 to October 15, 2002, Hispanic Heritage Month will be commemorated by millions of people across the United States.  Hispanic Americans make up 12.5 percent of the population and have had a profound effect on our Nation's economic strength and stability. They not only are the fastest growing population group in the Nation, they are the fastest growing group among small business owners. Hispanic Business Magazine estimates that by the year 2007, Hispanic buying power will rise to $926.1 billion--due to a growth rate almost three times that of non-Hispanics.  There are more than 1.2 million Hispanic-owned businesses. These firms employed more than 1.4 million people and generated $183.3 billion in revenues. These statistics are a testamentto those Hispanic Americans who have overcome a myriad of obstacles to establish themselves as a prominent force in our Nation's economy.  Hispanic Americans also have succeeded in the political arena. The number of Hispanic elected officials has increased, and many States across the Nation have fielded Hispanic candidates at local and national levels. For example, earlier this month Georgia voters elected their first Hispanic State senator, Sam Zamarripa, and New Mexico's next Governor will undoubtedly be Hispanic.  In addition to recognizing the significant contributions Hispanics have made in politics and to our economy, we honor those Hispanic Americans who sacrificed their lives on September 11, 2001. Hispanic Americans were among the very first to respond to the terror attacks against our Nation. Twelve Hispanic firefighters lost their lives trying to save others.  As America continues to remember those Hispanic Americans who gave their lives on that tragic day, others in the Hispanic community have helped bring our Nation together. For example, Daniel Rodriguez, a Brooklyn-born Latino policeman, captured America's hearts with his rendition of ``God Bless America'' at numerous September 11 memorial services. Contributions like this from our fellow Americans have helped many of us heal and have instilled a deeper, greater pride in our Nation.  Other Hispanic Americans may not have received as much media attention but have equally contributed to every aspect of our American life.  In my home State of Illinois, where over 1 million Hispanic Americans reside, numerous individuals have had a significant impact on the Hispanic American community. Consider Theresa Gutierrez, a reporter for ABC News in Chicago. She was one of the first Hispanic women to break into television journalism, and since she began her media career in 1971 she has been the recipient of numerous awards. In 1999, she was recognized by Chicago Woman Magazine as one of 100 ``Women Making a Difference.'' She was also selected as one of the six outstanding broadcasters in the country by Hispanic USA Magazine.  Another similar example is Anna Zotigh, a 16-year-old girl working on a mural at the Instituto del Progresso Latino in Chicago. Anna, along with other teams of students across the country, works 8- to 9-hour days with local artists to help promote Latino culture, specifically the pivotal role played by women in Hispanic culture. These are just some of the extraordinary Hispanic American individuals who contribute to the vibrant life of our country.  The Hispanic American population has made significant strides in the last decade to help strengthen America's ideals of democracy, freedom, and opportunity. We have seen their contributions time and time again, from their impact on our economy to their service in law enforcement.  Hispanic Heritage Month is a time to celebrate, experience, and honor the Hispanic culture. I urge all Americans to actively participate in the many festivities across our Nation, as we deepen our appreciation for a community that has helped shape America today, and will continue to do so tomorrow.                          ____________________
