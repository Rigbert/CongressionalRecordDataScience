  This letter is from Alberto Mora:       I want to state my absolute and explicit endorsement for      the nomination of Alissa Starzak to be the next General      Counsel of the Army.       By my current affiliation with the Harvard Kennedy School's      Carr Center for Human Rights Policy, I served as the General      Counsel of the Navy from 2001-2006. I have served alongside      many of the most senior civilians in the Department of      Defense, and I know what qualities successful civilian      leaders should bring to their work, among them professional      competence and a commitment to honorable public      service. These two qualities describe Ms. Starzak.       The Senate has honored me four times by confirming me for      appointments in both Republican and Democratic      administrations. I am familiar with and supportive of the      Senate's role in confirming senior federal officials, but I      fear that in Ms. Starzak's case her confirmation has been      impeded for reasons unworthy of the Senate. As you are no      doubt aware, she served as counsel on the Senate Select      Committee on Intelligence for more than four years. Her work      on that committee was thorough and professional; she has      served the Congress and our republic ably. That she has been      disparaged for her work is wrong. It sends a clear and      troubling signal to every congressional staffer of both      parties that his or her dedicated public service may be      treated not as a credential, but as a disqualification for      senior administration appointments. If that signal is      confirmed by failing to confirm Ms. Starzak--not for what she      did wrong, but for what she did right--it would only serve to      damage the Senate, this and future administrations, and our      nation.  It is signed by Alberto Mora.  I would also like to submit a letter from RADM John D. Hutson, U.S. Navy, head of the JAG Corps, retired.       I write to express my complete and unequivocal support for      the nomination of Alissa Starzak to be the next General      Counsel of the Army. I have deep concerns that her nomination      has been the subject of unfortunate and nasty political      theater, but I am heartened to know that her nomination will      receive a full floor vote on Monday, 14 December 2015. As you      are no doubt aware, she served as a professional staff member      on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence for more than      four years. . . .       I served as The Judge Advocate General of the Navy. I      underwent the confirmation process. As the senior uniformed      lawyer in our service, I spent significant time assisting      nominees with confirmation. Throughout my career I worked      alongside, and under, some of the most capable, professional,      and brilliant people who make up the civilian ranks of      appointed leaders in our government. While I don't know her      personally, I am very familiar with her reputation, which is      stellar.       I write because I believe her case has been one that has      damaged our republic. She has been maligned for performing      her duties as a public servant, and her nomination was held      up because of events that occurred after she left the      committee staff.       I encourage you in the strongest terms to confirm her for      this position. Losing her services to the rankling of      partisan disputes would be to the detriment of both the      Department of Defense and the country.           Sincerely,                                                   John D. Hutson,                                                Rear Admiral, USN.  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that both of these letters be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                   McLean, VA,                                                December 11, 2015.       Dear Senator: I write to state my absolute and explicit      endorsement for the nomination of Alissa Starzak to be the      next General Counsel of the Army.

I encourage you to confirm Ms. Starzak without further      delay.           Sincerely,     Alberto Mora.                                  ____                                                December 11, 2015.

As you are no doubt aware, she served as a      professional staff member on the Senate Select Committee on      Intelligence for more than four years. Unfortunately, she has      been unfairly and inappropriately used as ``leverage'' in a      partisan quarrel.       I served as The Judge Advocate General of the Navy. I      underwent the confirmation process. As the senior uniformed      lawyer in our service, I spent significant time assisting      nominees with confirmation.
