 President, it is with great sadness that I rise today to pay tribute and bid a fond farewell to a remarkable philanthropist, a proud Louisvillian, a great-grandmother of 29, and a dear friend. Sadly, Sara Shallenberger Brown--known by her friends as ``Sally''--passed away this April 30 in Louisville, just after celebrating her 100th birthday on April 14.  Sally was more than just a leading citizen of Louisville and of Kentucky--she was a driving force of nature. Through her energy, spirit, and great generosity, she made our city and our Commonwealth better places to live.  Sally led a life that would not seem out of place in an epic movie or novel. Born in Valdez, AK, in 1911, her father was a brigadier general who fought in France during World War I and served with generals Pershing and Patton. In 1931, Sally visited a friend from college in Louisville, and here she met her future husband, W.L. Lyons Brown. When Lyons soon after wrote Sally's parents to tell them he was naming a race horse ``Sally Shall,'' they knew it had been love at first sight.  The couple made their home in Louisville, where he was the president and chairman of Brown-Forman Corp., a Louisville-based company for over 140 years and one of the largest American-owned spirits and wine companies. Sally became a generous benefactor to Louisville institutions such as the Speed Museum, Locust Grove, the Actors Theatre of Louisville and Waterfront Park.  She was instrumental in preserving Locust Grove, the final home of Louisville founder George Rogers Clark. Where the home had once been abandoned and in ill repair, today it is a museum and National Historic Landmark.  Sally cared deeply and throughout her long life for conservation and preservation. She founded a conservation program to preserve the natural beauty of the Kentucky River. She advocated for the preservation of federal national wildlife refuges, and was present at the bill signing by President Jimmy Carter that saw the culmination of her efforts. She was a delegate to U.N. conferences, and traveled internationally to promote wildlife conservation.  But most of all, Sally will be remembered for her enjoyment of life. She loved to be outdoors, working on her farm. Even in her later years you could often see her riding around on top of her tractor. She was an artist, designer, and breeder of cattle, thoroughbreds and Cavalier King Charles spaniels.  Sally inspired her family, friends and all who knew her as she forged ahead with her many philanthropic and intellectual interests, all while setting the example as the matriarch of the Brown family since her husband's passing in 1973. Together they had four children, 12 grandchildren, and 29 great-grandchildren, and I want to express my condolences to them and other family members at this great woman's passing.  Mr. President, the Louisville Courier-Journal recently published an editorial celebrating the life of Sally Brown. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was printed as follows:           [From the Louisville Courier-Journal, May 2, 2011]                     Sally Brown: A Force of Nature       Five years ago, when Kentucky Educational Television      produced a documentary about her life, Sara Shallenberger      Brown was called ``a force of nature.''       For most of the century through which she lived, she was      precisely that. And with her death on Saturday, the      environmental movement and the community have lost a      remarkable leader.       The daughter of an Army general who fought alongside George      Patton in World War II, Mrs. Brown witnessed important events      in history at close range. Born in Valdez, Alaska, in 1911,      decades later she would become a leader in the drive to save      the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska and stood      beside President Jimmy Carter when he signed the act      protecting it in 1980.       Widowed for almost 40 years from distillery executive W.L.      Lyons Brown, Sr., she rejected a comfortable, quiet life and      became an advocate for all sorts of causes related to the      environment. She traveled to Frankfort to testify about the      perils of strip mining and always came armed with a battery      of facts, which she eloquently expressed in precise terms.       She often said that to succeed as an advocate on political      issues a woman needs to ``act like a lady, look like a girl,      think like a man, and work like a dog.''       Besides her crusades, Sally Brown enjoyed life. She loved      to ride, shoot and take care of her farm. She was as much at      home on her tractor as she was in the corridors of power. She      took pleasure in the accomplishments of her children and      grandchildren and always challenged those she knew to push      harder.       She lived well on a grand stage, and with her departure,      our city has lost one of its visionary leaders.                          ____________________
