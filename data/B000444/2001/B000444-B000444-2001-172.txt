 President, after speaking with the Republican and Democratic sides, I understand there is room for 10 minutes for any Senator to proceed in morning business, and/or if I need to go over that 10 minutes, my Republican colleague indicated I may have some time. I will proceed and hopefully finish in 10 minutes.
