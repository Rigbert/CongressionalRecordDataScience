Tom Dreesen's name has appeared on major venue marquees in Las Vegas, Lake Tahoe, Reno and Atlantic City with artists like Frank Sinatra, Smokey Robinson, Natalie Cole and Sammy Davis, Jr. Dreesen, who opened for Frank Sinatra for well over a decade in club and concert appearances throughout the United States and Canada, has also appeared in many network television shows including the ``Tonight Show,'' as well as ``Columbo,'' ``Gabriels Fire,'' ``Murder, She Wrote'' and ``Touched by an Angel.''  Kelly Komara, one of Purdue Women's Basketball's strongest players, will also be in attendance at this memorable event. Kelly was raised in Schererville, Indiana and graduated from Lake Central High School, where she played basketball and was named Indiana's Miss Basketball. While attending college at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Kelly has been an integral part of Purdue's successful basketball team. With Kelly's quick shooting, ball-handling skills and accurate free throws, she helped lead the Boilermakers to the final round of the 2001 NCAA tournament. Additionally, Kelly was named the Mideast Regional's Most Outstanding Player.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my distinguished colleagues to join me in commending the Silver Bell Club, Lodge 2365 of the Polish National Alliance of the United States, for hosting this celebration of success in sports and academics. The effort of all those involved in planning this worthwhile event is indicative of their devotion to the very gifted young people in Indiana's First Congressional District.                          ____________________
