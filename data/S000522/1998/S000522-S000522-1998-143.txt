As the gentleman understands, there were those who I have dealt with in Oregon who believe that coyotes will never kill anything alive. I would submit to the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Skeen) who runs sheep, we have been trying to get rid of them for some time in cattle country, and coyotes are helping, but it is awful what can happen with a pack of coyotes at certain times of the year, and in the spring of the year when calves are small and when sheep are producing to see the relentless enjoyment of just killing when packs of coyotes run together. That is the answer.
