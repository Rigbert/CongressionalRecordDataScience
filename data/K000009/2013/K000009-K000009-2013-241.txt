Speaker, I rise today to recognize a milestone in the life of one of the oldest high schools in our district. Toledo's Scott High School celebrates its 100th birthday this month.  When young Toledoans in the first decade of the last century began to outgrow the former Central High School, construction on two new schools began: Morrison Waite High School on Toledo's East Side and Jessup W. Scott High School on Toledo's West Side. Scott High School was named for a mid-19th century Toledo Blade newspaper editor who was a well-known civic leader and philanthropist. Eight thousand people reportedly attended Scott High School's dedication ceremony and 1,193 students were enrolled on that first day of classes, September 8, 1913.  From the start and through the decades, Scott High School was a sports powerhouse. Many of its alumni have gone on to professional careers and even the Olympics. Scott and Waite High Schools have been friendly rivals from the start. Beginning in 1914 until 1963, the two schools came together in an annual Thanksgiving Day match up which generated interest far beyond the bounds of Toledo. Perhaps even more famous than its sports teams, Scott is also known for its internationally known marching band the ``Fantastic Dancing Machines.'' Truly one of the premier marching bands in the Midwest, the band has won many awards in band competitions throughout the United States and has performed all over the country. With a fine music tradition, Scott High School boasts famed jazz pianist Art Tatum among its illustrious alumni.  Scott High School's alumni are proud of their roots, proud of their traditions, and proud of their school. Many graduates live in Toledo and have made their mark in our hometown. As they look back with fondness on school days gone by and reminisce at the passage of 100 years, so too they look forward with hope to new accomplishments in the century to come.                          ____________________
