Mr. Speaker, H.R. 517, introduced by Mrs. Miller of Michigan, would direct the Commandant of the Coast Guard to convey the Coast Guard Cutter Bramble, upon its scheduled decommissioning, to the Port Huron Museum of Arts and History located in Port Huron, Michigan for use for education and historical display.  As amended, H.R. 517 would also direct the Commandant of the Coast Guard to convey the Coast Guard Cutter Planetree, decommissioned on March 19, 1999, to Jewish Life, a nonprofit corporation that promotes the understanding of Jewish history and culture. The vessel will serve as a symbolic ship honoring the original 66 Exodus ships, their crewmembers, and the 77,000 Holocaust survivors they brought to Israel.  Before the vessels are conveyed, the recipients of the vessels must agree to (1) use the designated vessel for education and historical display; (2) not use the vessel for commercial transportation; (3) make the vessel available in time of war or national emergency; and (4) hold the government harmless for any claims arising from exposure to hazardous materials. The recipients must also show their financial viability.  I urge the House to pass this legislation. Returning these decommissioned Coast Guard cutters to missions of public service benefits the public by providing important education and outreach activities.
