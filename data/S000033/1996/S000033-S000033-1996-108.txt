 Lazio] spoke of demolition of housing, the role of the private sector. He spoke about a lot of things, but he did not speak about the Watt amendment. The gentleman from North Carolina [Mr. Watt] did not tell us how we can achieve the goal. He did not explicitly tell us the role of the private sector or the public sector. All that he said is that ``It is a goal of our Nation that all citizens have decent and affordable housing.''  It seems to me, Mr. Chairman, that increasingly we are becoming a divided nation. On one hand, we have CEO's of major corporations who are making 200 times what their workers are making. We have people at the top who are seeing incomes that have never been seen in the history of this country. We are seeing a growing divide between the rich and the poor.  We can have a whole lot of differences regarding the role of government, but I would hope that every Member of this body agrees that all Americans should have decent and affordable housing. That is not a radical statement. It does not say how that housing should be built.  Mr. Chairman, there is something wrong in this country when we are building more jail units than we are building affordable housing units. There is something wrong when hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people are sleeping out in the streets. There is something wrong when millions of Americans are spending 50 or 60 or 70 percent of their limited incomes on housing and, therefore, not having enough money to provide food or clothing or educational opportunity for their children.                              {time}  1815  All that the Watt amendment says is, ``It is a goal of our Nation that all citizens have decent and affordable housing.''  Mr. Chairman, I would yield to the gentleman from New York [Mr. Lazio] to tell us not about demolition, not about how we should build housing, what is your objection to the sentence, ``It is a goal of our Nation that all citizens have decent and affordable housing''?
