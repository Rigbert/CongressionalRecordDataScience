 President, 2 days ago the President ordered a forceful response to Iraq's aggression against its own Kurdish minority.  The question before us is whether the Senate supports the action taken by our President.  Some have expressed concerns that go beyond the scope of that question. They have raised points that could be the matter of legitmate debate--but that debate should be reserved for another day.  We are not debating the history of American diplomacy with respect to Iraq. We are not debating the future of American security policy in the Persian Gulf. We are simply being asked to state whether or not we support the actions initiated by the Commander in Chief; Whether we support the troops fulfilling his orders; and, whether we condemn Saddam Hussein's aggressive actions.  These are weighty matters in and of themselves. We should not cloud the debate by injecting extraneous issues.  I intend to support the resolution before us because I believe that the forceful response ordered by the President was both necessary and appropriate. Saddam Hussein has demonstrated repeatedly that he only understands the language of force.  He was warned explicitly by the United States when evidence mounted of a threatening Iraqi military mobilization. He chose to ignore those warnings and enter an area that has been the site of past Iraqi transgressions. His actions violated universal human rights norms as well as U.N. Security Council Resolution 688, which demanded that he cease his oppression of the Kurds.  Had this aggression gone unanswered, it would have strengthened his position internally and emboldened him to strike elsewhere. Thankfully, it did not go unanswered.  President Clinton's decisive action sent a strong signal that the United States will not condone Iraqi military adventurism. It sent the message that there is a price to pay for aggression. It served to protect vital interests in the Persian Gulf by reassuring key allies of America's commitment to regional stability. And by extending the Southern no-fly-zone, the President has constrained Saddam Hussein's ability to make greater mischief.  Upholding these interests transcends the concerns that I and many of my colleagues have over becoming enmeshed in the internecine warfare between Kurdish factions. The saga of the Kurds is a long tale of struggle, betrayal, and oppression. It is one that is further complicated by a regional dynamic involving Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Turkey. The Kurdish question does not lend itself to an easy solution.  However, we should not allow the complexities of Kurdistan to cause us to lose sight of our broader objectives. The President's action is not about involving the United States in Kurdish intrigue. It is about containing a dangerous tyrant who is a continuing threat to international peace and security. It is about preserving stability in a region vital to American national security. In short, it is about protecting American interests.  I urge my colleagues to join me in standing with the President as he confronts a ruthless dictator.                          ____________________
