 They engage in circular reasoning. It goes like this: Without spending money on the Stockpile Stewardship Program, roughly $4.5 billion a year for 10 years, we will not be able to attain, when the shelf life of these weapons is reached 10 years out or more, a degree of certainty that they are reliable and safe.  You say: OK, we will fund it; we are for it, and the President sends up that number.  Then they say: But we have a problem. Our Republican friends in the House won't vote for that much money, and we had to fight too hard to get it and they probably won't do it next year. The reason why, they go on to say, I am against this, although I think if we funded it, it would work and it would make sense, is my Republican colleagues in the House probably won't fund it; therefore, I can't be for this treaty because you guys are not funding the stockpile.  I find that absolutely fascinating, but it is the circular reasoning which is being engaged. It strings together a group of non sequiturs that end up leading to a conclusion that makes no sense.  The Senator has been here longer than I. Can he imagine, if we vote this treaty down and other nations begin to test, and those who voted it down are saying, by doing that, we think the United States should be able to test, can you imagine this or future Congresses coming up with $45 billion to perfect a Stockpile Stewardship Program which purpose and design is to avoid nuclear testing, to spend $45 billion for the redundancy? Can the Senator imagine us doing that?
