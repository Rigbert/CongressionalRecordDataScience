 President, as you can see, the proposed spending is popular and has a nice political edge. Democrats could record themselves as voting for the amendment, and they could criticize Republicans for voting against those amendments. From a political calculation perspective, these were profitable efforts on the part of the Democratic leadership. The fiscal consequences, however, were another story.  If Democrats had been in the majority, as they are now, the fiscal effect of these amendments would have been a very big problem, and here is why. One-time spending increases, even if for 1 year, are built into the CBO baseline, and they are built in forever. This is explicitly the case for increases in discretionary spending. It is also implicitly the case with entitlement spending. If anyone disputes that point, I would ask them to show me the last time we reversed new entitlement spending. It just never happens around here is the best thing to say.  Let's take a look at the Kennedy amendment on vocational education and Pell grants to which I have referred. The amendment was purportedto be $6.3 billion, but that was for 1 fiscal year. That $6.3 billion, if adopted, would probably be extended in later years. It is in the baseline. So Senator Kennedy found his offset by closing $6.3 billion in what he referred to as corporate tax loopholes. I am not going to find fault with closing those tax loopholes. I have been involved in things like that for a long period of time, and successfully so. The fiscal and political effect, though, of Senator Kennedy's amendment was to identify specific popular spending and offset it with a nondefined tax increase. From a realistic standpoint, Senator Kennedy's amendment identified less than 10 percent of the gross spending burden it would have placed on future budgets to the extent the unspecified revenue offset was duplicative or not realistic. The real effect was that the $6.3 billion additional spending would have been added to the budget for that fiscal year.  All 12 of these listed amendments used the same undefined offset.  Several Members referred to revenue raisers in a Democratic substitute amendment to the 2005 Tax Relief Reconciliation bill, and they kept trying to spend the same money over and over again. Let's take a look at the list of revenue raisers in the substitute amendment.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a Joint Committee on Taxation estimate of the revenue offsets to the 2005 substitute be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:            Inventory of Specified Democrat Revenue Offsets                       [In billions over 5 years]Gross Revenue Available from Democratic Substitute                $53.6Less Enacted Offsets                                               -9.3Less Small Business Tax Relief Bill Offsets                        -8.7Net Available Democratic Offsets                                   35.6Source: Joint Committee on Taxation       Recap of Democratic Revenue Raisers and Spending Proposals                       [In billions over 5 years]Net Available Democratic Revenue Offsets                          $35.6Less Cost of Democratic Spending Amendments                      -105.2Net Cost of Democratic Spending Amendments                        -69.6Source: Joint Committee on Taxation
