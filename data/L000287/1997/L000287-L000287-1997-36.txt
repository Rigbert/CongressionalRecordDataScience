Madam Speaker, 40 years ago nine black students came to the doors of Central High School in Little Rock, AR, and demanded a seat in a classroom where they were denied welcome. They were entitled to be there by law, but they could not be there because an angry, hateful mob and Arkansas State troopers turned them away. The Little Rock Nine did nothing wrong. They were denied an education. They were turned away by hatred and bigotry. They were turned away because they were black.  Three weeks later, on September 25, President Eisenhower ordered Federal troops to escort the Little Rock Nine into Central High School. In doing so, the Little Rock Nine rocked not just a city, they rocked the Nation. As giants in our Nation's struggle for civil rights, the Little Rock Nine have earned their rightful place in history.  So today, Madam Speaker, we mark the 40th anniversary of the desegregation of Central High School. Because of their action, we have witnessed a nonviolent revolution in America. Our country is a better country, a better place, and we are better people because of them.                          ____________________
