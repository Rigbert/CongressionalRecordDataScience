President, I believe this policy has been adhered to--on his own time, if the Senator from Iowa knows of any time it has not been adhered to, I would be glad to listen--the criteria of having to be syndicated and, No. 2, at least 1 million listeners, which has been the policy all along. If he questions that this should be the policy or believes it should be in the future, I would be glad to change my amendment just to say that it should be based on those two criteria. That is not a problem at all. It is not necessary because it has used that criteria in the past.  To clearly demonstrate that 1 million listeners is one of the criteria, when the time came that Franken and Ed Schultz reached 1 million, all of a sudden they were programmed. It further demonstrates it is something that has worked in the past for liberal or conservative messages.  I yield the floor.
