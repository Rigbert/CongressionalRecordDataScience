I don't know the size of the market.  So when Americans express their concerns about speculation and its impact on oil and ask whether our Government is doing its job to make sure there is no manipulation of the future price of oil, that there is not excessive speculation, the honest answer from Mr. Lukkin and I believe it was honest--is he doesn't know.  This legislation which we are presenting is going to call for more disclosure and more oversight and more reporting of these markets so we will have information and be able to look closely at these trades. I ask the Senator from Nevada, as part of this legislation, is it not a fact that we are going to dramatically increase the number of people working at this commission--100 new full-time employees--and new computer capabilities so they can keep up with the dramatic increase in trading which is taking place, and will have people to deal with the new information that is collected?
