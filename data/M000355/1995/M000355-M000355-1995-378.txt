 President, several of our colleagues made some assertions earlier in the debate today on the underlying amendment that I would like to respond to.  First, the number and frequency of health care liability claims is, in fact, increasing. This is not in dispute. It [[Page S5780]] cannot be because we are turning out more doctors who commit more negligence. It is, in fact, the prospect of a willful verdict or a settlement that encourages people to sue.  According to estimates based on the AMA physician masterfile and other liability data from the AMA, the average rate of claims have increased every year since 1987.  Let us just look at the 3-year period from 1991 to 1993. In 1991, 33,424 medical professional liability claims were filed. In that year 1991, 33,424 medical professional liability claims were filed. In 1992, 38,430 claims; in 1993, 42,828. In just a 2-year period, the number of claims jumped by 28 percent.  As far as the assertion that malpractice insurance costs are not increasing, the data shows otherwise. While premiums stabilized in the late 1980's, rates are starting to climb again.  According to the Medical Liability Monitor, more than half of the doctors have experienced, for both 1993 and 1994, in the area of 9 to 15 percent increases, far in excess of the inflation rate.  As for the assertion that 80,000 people die each year from malpractice, it is just not true. That claim is made by the Consumer Union based on a 1991 study done by Harvard. Harvard researchers studied New York City in 1984, 1 year. Of the 51 hospitals studied in that year, 1984, they found 71 deaths out of 31,000 patient records where malpractice was the reason for death. There is simply no statistically sound way to get 80,000 deaths nationwide from 71 deaths in New York City in 1984. In other words, Mr. President, let me repeat. There is just no statistically sound way to get to 80,000 deaths nationwide from 71 deaths in New York city in 1984 alone.  The Harvard researchers themselves rejected the Consumer Union conclusion during last year's health care debate. In fact, that was in a letter to Representative Pete Stark.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
