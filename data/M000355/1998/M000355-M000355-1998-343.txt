 1896. A bill to transfer administrative jurisdiction over Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area to the Secretary of Agriculture; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.           the land between the lakes protection act of 1998  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President I have come to the floor today to introduce a bill known as the Land Between the Lakes Protection Act. Land Between the Lakes is a national treasure that must be protected. It is visited by more than 2 million tourists a year who enjoy its natural beauty, whether by camping, fishing, hunting, or just taking a long hike with the family.  That's why, after studying this issue for over a year, we have drafted a bill to ensure that the LBL, which so many Kentuckians enjoy today, will be there for them--unchanged--tomorrow.  As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, my top priority has been to provide LBL the money it needs to operate--including $6.9 million last year. I remain committed to providing that funding to ensure that LBL remains a national treasure just like Mammoth Cave or Daniel Boone National Forest.  But because of TVA Chairman Craven Crowell's harmful and ill-considered request last year to zero-out LBL's funding, it may be that Congress will deny funding to TVA's non-power budget this year. Because of this reality, LBL needs a safety net. That's what this bill is--a safety net.  If Congress decides to fund TVA then TVA will remain LBL's steward. If TVA is denied funding, my bill will safely and seamlessly transition LBL to a less controversial steward without interrupting the myriad of recreational activities that millions of visitors have come to enjoy every year.  There may be some who want to gamble everything on TVA receiving its appropriation. But I believe LBL is far too precious for such an all or nothing gambit. That's why our bill provides for both contingencies.  Mr. President, let me take a moment to explain some of the provisions I have included in this legislation based on the input I have received from area residents, and those who enjoy LBL. The goal of this bill is to ensure that the day to day operations of LBL remain the same for its visitors. Therefore, this bill codifies LBL's 1972 mission statement and ensures that the Forest Service continues to manage LBL for multiple use with a focus on recreation, conservation and environmental education.  This legislation also gives the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service the authorityto assist the Forest Service in managing the wildlife populations and educating visitors on the unique species at LBL, with an emphasis on endangered species, like the American bald eagle. LBL is home to over 100 eagles.  One of the most important aspects of this bill is the creation of a 17-member citizen advisory board that will assist the Forest Service in establishing a management plan at LBL. I believe this will ensure that LBL managers are more responsive to the local concerns about development at LBL. This will ensure that proposals like the ``Five Concepts'' proposed by TVA in 1995 will never be considered again.  We have given the authority to Federal, State and local officials to appoint the members to the board. While the board will represent a variety of interests, I am confident that each will have the best intentions for LBL foremost in mind.  The Secretary will appoint 4 individuals, two from each state. The Governors from Kentucky and Tennessee will each nominate two individuals from their state. The Kentucky and Tennessee Fish and Wildlife Commissioners will each nominate 1 person. The Land Between the Lakes Association, which is a non-profit organization that operates the gift shops, planetarium and welcome stations at LBL, will nominate one individual. The County Judge Executives from each of the three counties, which make up LBL will each nominate two individuals.  This bill also protects existing TVA payments to counties, and increases federal payments in lieu of taxes. This will ensure that county schools and county services are not negatively impacted.  This bill creates a $5 million trust fund to be used for internships, education grants, and regional economic and tourism promotion.  Finally, the bill also seeks to minimize any disruption to the employees working at LBL. We have sought to ensure that all eligible benefits provided to an employee will not be diminished or lost as a result of transferring this facility. This bill also provides a generous severance package based on a previous downsizing package offered by TVA.  Mr. President, we are rapidly nearing the end of the fiscal year and we need to ensure that this safety net is available if TVA doesn't receive sufficient funding. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the House and Senate, Republican and Democrat alike, putting aside politics and doing right by all those who treasure LBL.  Finally, I want to thank the hundreds of Kentuckians who have worked so closely with us in drafting this bill. I believe the plan we have arrived at together will help secure LBL's future for a long, long time.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1896       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
