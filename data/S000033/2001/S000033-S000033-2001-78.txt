 Chairman, can I have a point of personal something or other?  On this issue of enormous consequence our friends do not want to add a few more minutes to debate? I think that is really unfortunate.  I want to ask the chairman again, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Bonilla), who I know is a decent man and I respect his opinion, but we have many people here, so what is wrong with 5 more minutes on either side?
