 President, the Senator from Wyoming, just a few minutes ago, addressed the celebration of the 80th birthday of a friend of the U.S. Senate, a friend of most every U.S. Senator, David Brody. There was a celebration of that on the Hill this evening.  It is most appropriate that Senators help David Brody celebrate his 80th birthday because he is so well known, he has been so active on the Hill, and he has been, in the truest sense of the word, a public-spirited person, a person who has been civic-minded about his responsibilities to Government. He has represented a lot of good causes, as he has interacted with Members of the U.S. Senate throughout his career on the Hill.  A few years ago, you could have read a newspaper article that stated it better than any of us could have. It was about how David Brody is respected. In that newspaper article he was referred to as the 101st Senator.  So I wish David Brody a happy birthday. I wish him and his wife well in the future. Happy birthday.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
