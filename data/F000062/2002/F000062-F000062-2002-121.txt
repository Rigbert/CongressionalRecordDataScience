 President, I would like to thank the Senate for passing H.R. 4592, which designates the chapel located in the national cemetery in Los Angeles, CA the Bob Hope Veterans Chapel.  Beginning in May, 1941, when he performed his radio show for airmen at March Field, CA, and continuing through his Christmas show in Saudi Arabia in 1990 during Operation Desert Storm, Leslie Townes (Bob) Hope has taken to the roads to entertain U.S. troops, no matter where they were located.  Whether the country was at war or peace, Mr. Hope spent nearly 60 yearscommitted to boosting the morale of U.S. armed forces through goodwill tours, United Services Organization shows, and his world-famous Christmas specials.  Through laughter, Mr. Hope helped an estimated 10 million GIs forget, for a brief period, their distance from home.  In October, 1997, Mr. Hope was made an Honorary Veteran through Congressional action--the first individual so honored in the history of the United States.  Mr. Hope and his wife, Dolores, have been married for 68 years, and have four children, as well as four grandchildren.  This legislation would further honor Mr. Hope's selfless devotion to America's protectors on this, his 99th birthday, by naming after him the chapel in the national cemetery near his home--a lasting tribute to his lifetime of service.                          ____________________
