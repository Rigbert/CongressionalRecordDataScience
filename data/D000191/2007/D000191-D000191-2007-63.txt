Chairman, the simple answer to Mr. Flake is, this saves the taxpayers money. And I know that is a concern to the gentleman.  We have here certified breeding stock that was donated to the Government of the United States of America by the Australian Customs Service that has a great line of dogs that are easily trained and have a low failure rate once they reach maturity.  The gentleman obviously doesn't know much about dogs. And in fact, I would say there might even be a security risk. There are not a lot of breeders in the U.S. who are training for this specific purpose. In fact, many police agencies now have to buy their dogs from Germany.  Remember the Hamburg cell? Do you want them infiltrating our dog program, maybe with secret German commands that we don't know? I mean, come on. This is a national security issue, to have a little fun with the gentleman.  But the point is, these dogs are great stock. It is less expensive. They go to a foster home for a year. That isn't a year that you would have to pay for with a breeder, and then they get their final training. They have a very low failure rate. That again saves money for the program.  We are saving money here. We are providing a vital service. The gentleman doesn't strike the previous section of the bill, 201, which requires a dramatic increase in dogs for the program, which is fully warranted because they are extraordinarily effective deterrents, and they are very good at detecting problems, explosives, drugs and other contraband.  So I would say that the gentleman really should withdraw his amendment if he is interested in saving the taxpayers money. Privatization for private profits' sake is not the way to serve our taxpayers and our security well in this matter.
