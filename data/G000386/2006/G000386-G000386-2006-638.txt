 President, I speak today with deep sorrow, for we have lost a truly brave American and soldier. MAJ Stuart Anderson died on January 7, 2006, when the Blackhawk helicopter he was in crashed just outside Tal Afar in northern Iraq. His helicopter was part of a two helicopter team providing support for the 101st Airborne Division. Major Anderson was assigned to the 3rd Corps Support Command, Army National Guard. My condolences go out to his wife, Tori; his two daughters, Keely 15, and Kirsten 10; his parents, Claremont and Nancy Anderson; and many other family and friends.  Major Anderson grew up in Hoffman, MN, and then graduated from Benson High School in Benson, MN. He attended North Dakota State University. Maj. Anderson had been living in Dubuque, IA, for the past 5 years and was scheduled to return home this fall. He was a supply and service support representative for his Des Moines based unit; he made sure combat troops in some of Iraq's most dangerous areas had the proper supplies.  Major Anderson joined the Army Reserve in 1984, became an officer in 1989, and was serving in his second tour of duty in Iraq. Many of Major Anderson's colleagues define him as a trusted and humble leader. LTC Thomas Nielsen wrote that ``Major Anderson was one of the finest officers I have known in my 28-year career.'' Major Anderson's father said that ``he was very proud of being in the military . . . he just loved it.'' He was known to sprinkle in humor with his training and with his annual Christmas cards. His humor will be missed by all who knew him. I ask my colleagues in the Senate and every American to remember the sacrifice that Major Anderson gave for our freedom.                          ____________________
