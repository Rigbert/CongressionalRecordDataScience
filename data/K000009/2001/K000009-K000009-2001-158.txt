Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds to say, however, that the costs of remediating that should not only be borne by the public sector. That is, if we are going to have problems related to trade, those participating in trade ought to bear the costs of what goes wrong in the transaction. What has been happening within USDA is we have been transferring the cost of trade to the public sector, and the private entities that benefit have not been carrying their fair share of the load.  So let us hope we can find a solution to that that is fair to all.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Mrs. Clayton), a very, very esteemed member of the authorizing committee, and one of the hardest-working Members of this Congress.
