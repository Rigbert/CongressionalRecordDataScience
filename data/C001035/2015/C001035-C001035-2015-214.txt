President, to respond to the Senator from Texas, I hope that will not happen. I have put forth a way forward for this body. I want to ensure that the Department of Homeland Security is fully funded throughout the fiscal year. I want to ensure that we do not overturn the 2012 DACA Executive order, which is narrow enough that it does not raise the very troubling issues the Senator from Texas has so eloquently outlined. But I do believe it is important for each of us to take a stand against the President's overreach here. This is important. This matters.  It is our job to protect the Constitution and to uphold our role, and that is what I am trying to do here--accomplish those three goals--and that is what the Senator from Texas is discussing.
