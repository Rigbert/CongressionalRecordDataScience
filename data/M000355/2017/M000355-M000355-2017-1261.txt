 President, I ask unanimous consent that following the disposition of the Elwood nomination, the Senate proceed to the consideration of S. 1094, the Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability Act; that the committee-reported substitute be adopted, and that there then be 3 hours of debate, equally divided in the usual form; and that following the use or yielding back of time, the bill, as amended, be read a third time and the Senate proceed to vote on passage with no intervening action or debate.
