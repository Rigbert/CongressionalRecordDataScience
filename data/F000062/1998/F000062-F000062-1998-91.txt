 President, I join with those who have congratulated the committee for what I consider to be really a fine higher education bill. I want to extend my personal congratulations, representing Californians, both to the chairman and the ranking member of this committee.  This is a bill that really meets the needs of the day with respect to higher education. And I think we can all, hopefully, support it with great pride and enthusiasm.  I have been very involved in education in California because I have seen this great State, once in the lead, sink to below mediocrity in terms of its K-through-12 education system. And there are many reasons for it that the Federal Government cannot control, decisions that have to be made by the State itself, such as eliminating social promotion, setting specific standards of achievement for students in each of the grades, no-nonsense tests, remedial programs, and so on. But one thing the Federal Government can do is provide funds to help with the development of good teachers. And that is what this bill does and does so well.  I want to bring to the attention of the Senate one anomaly which the amendment I am about to send to the desk seeks to address. And that is that in the Pell grant program, there are two States that require a 5th year of teacher education. One of those States is New Hampshire; the other State is California. New Hampshire provides the 5th year before the baccalaureate degree and California requires the 5th year after the baccalaureate degree, ergo, California's higher education students are not currently eligible for Pell grants. And so, if I may, I send an amendment to the desk.
