Speaker, now is the time to get serious about balancing the budget. Today I am joined by my colleagues, Representatives Charlie Stenholm, Calvin Dooley, and Tom Barrett, in introducing legislation that would put in place tough new measures to balance the budget by the year 2002. This bill, the Balanced Budget Enforcement Act of 1995, would force us to make the tough decisions required to balance the budget. It would do so by setting spending caps and using across-the-board cuts if the caps are not met.  There are no exceptions. Everything is on the table and, unlike Gramm-Rudman, it has teeth.  I would say to my colleagues who really want to balance the budget, here is your chance to move beyond the rhetoric. For those of my colleagues who do not want to balance the budget, do not cosponsor this bill because under this legislation, that is exactly what would happen.  Mr. Speaker, it is time to put our money where our mouth is. Let us start balancing the budget now.                          ____________________
