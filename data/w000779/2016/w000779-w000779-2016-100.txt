President, today I am proud to join Oregonians all across our State in marking the 75th anniversary of the Oregon Air National Guard. For three-quarters of a century, thousands of Oregon's sons and daughters have joined the Air National Guard, dedicating themselves to defense of the Constitution of the United States and service to their fellow Americans and Oregonians. Today I want to take a moment, here on the Senate floor to thank them for their service and for their sacrifices on our behalf.  The Oregon Air National Guard traces its beginnings back to April 1941, when a small group of 110 airmen boldly stepped forward and volunteered for duty in the months before the U.S. entered the Second World War. Initially activated as the Oregon National Guard Air Corps 123rd Observation Squadron, their first mission was to conduct maritime surveillance of the continental United States following the attack on Pearl Harbor. In 1947, following the allied victory in World War II, Congress officially established the U.S. Air Force as a separate military service, apart from the U.S. Army, and designated the Air National Guard as a reserve component.  In the decades since, the Oregon Air National Guard has played a vital national defense role in the Korean war,the Vietnam war, the Cold War, and in many global operations in the wake of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Today's Oregon Air National Guard units include the 142nd Fighter Wing in Portland, the 173rd Fighter Wing in Klamath Falls, and the Joint Forces Headquarters in Salem. Oregon's F-15s serve on guard 24 hours a day, 365 days a year to defend the skies above America's western coast. In addition to protecting that airspace, Oregon airmen are the sole providers of F-15 flight training for the U.S. Air Force.  But Oregon's airmen and women aren't simply ready to respond in times of conflict; they also answer the Governor's call during natural disasters to protect Oregonians from floods, forest fires, volcanic eruptions, and medical emergencies. Through the State partnership program, Oregon Guardsmen also have played a powerful role to improve relations with our State's partners in Vietnam and Bangladesh. In doing so, they demonstrate the best of American generosity in communities throughout the world.  The strength of any organization is its people and here the men and women of the Oregon Air National Guard, like its counterpart the Oregon Army Guard, are at the top of their class. Oregon guardsmen come from diverse backgrounds and bring top notch private sector skills to bear on behalf of the State and the country. The nearly 2,300 men and women now serving in the Oregon Air National Guard contribute to the long legacy of volunteerism and community service for which the organization is already so well known.  As a Senator, it has always been one of my highest honors to represent the men and women of the Oregon Air and Army National Guards in Congress, and as an Oregonian, I am so proud of today's Oregon Air National Guard and its rich heritage. It is a privilege to serve these heroes--active, retired, and those who have given their lives in defense of our nation and helping others. I know I speak for people in Oregon, across the country, and around the world when I thank the Oregon Air National Guard for 75 years of fabulous service, congratulate them on this historic milestone, and wish them continued success in the years and decades to come.                          ____________________
