And the gentleman will observe, I have neither mentioned the names, nor did I impugn their integrity or their motivation.  What I said and what I will repeat is, initially they voted for an amendment that said there shall not be discrimination by contractors who get government money. That is what the amendment said. And they voted against discrimination, and for that amendment.  But in a short period of time, they changed that vote, resulting in, not becoming law yet, but this House saying to the administration: You cannot require contractors not to discriminate. That was the effect of it. And characterizing the effect of a vote is what our debate is about, what our country's values are about, what our country's future is about, and the respect we have for every citizen in this country, endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights. And we ought not preclude those through discrimination.  That I can characterize without impugning motives. But the effect of the vote, we had 217 people for nondiscrimination right up until the last moment. And by the way, the last moment was far beyond what Speaker Ryan has said ought to be the end of votes.
