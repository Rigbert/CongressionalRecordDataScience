President, I am pleased that the Senate is now considering legislation I introduced to stem the proliferation of websites that distribute counterfeit identification documents and credentials over the Internet. I appreciate the timely action on this legislation by the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, as well as the support and assistance of Senators Kyl, Leahy, and Feinstein. The substitute amendment proposed by Senator Feinstein and me improves the bill while retaining all of its key features.  After this measure becomes law, Internet commerce in computer discs, files, and templates designed for use in the production of false identification documents will be illegal. The bill will also outlaw the practice of producing false identification containing easily removable disclaimers, a method currently used to avoid prosecution. Finally, the legislation will establish a coordinating committee to concentrate resources of several federal agencies on investigating and prosecuting the creation of false identification. I authored this legislation after the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I chair, held hearings on a disturbing new trend--the use of the Internet to manufacture and market counterfeit identification documents and credentials. Our hearing and investigation revealed the widespread availability on the Internet of a variety of fake identification documents and computer templates that allow individuals to manufacture authentic-looking IDs in the seclusion of their own homes. The Internet False Identification Prevention Act of 2000 will strengthen current law to prevent the distribution of false identification documents over the Internet and make it easier to prosecute this criminal activity.  Mr. President, the high quality of the counterfeit identification documents that can be obtained through the Internet is astounding. With little difficulty, my staff was able to use Internet materials to manufacture convincing IDs that would allow me to pass as a member of our Armed Forces, a reporter, a student at Boston University, or a licensed driver in Florida, Michigan, or Wyoming, to name just a few of the identities I could assume. For instance, using the Internet my staff created a counterfeit Connecticut driver's license that is virtually identical to an authentic license issued by the Connecticut Department of Motor Vehicles. Just like the real Connecticut license, this fake with my picture includes a signature written over the picture and an adjacent ``shadow picture'' of the license holder. The State of Connecticut added both of these sophisticated security features to the license in order to reduce counterfeiting. Unfortunately, some websites offer to sell fake IDs complete with State seals, holograms, and bar codes to replicate a license virtually indistinguishable from the real thing. Thus, technology now allows website operators to copy authentic identification documents with an extraordinary levelof sophistication and then mass produce those fraudulent documents for their customers. The websites investigated by the subcommittee offer a vast and varied product line, ranging from driver's licenses to military identification cards to federal agency credentials, including those of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Other sites offer to produce Social Security cards, birth certificates, diplomas, and press credentials.  Testimony before the subcommittee demonstrated that the availability of false identification documents from the Internet is a growing problem. Special Agent David Myers, Identification Fraud Coordinator of the State of Florida's Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, testified that 2 years ago only 1 percent of false identification documents came from the Internet. Last year, he testified, a little less than 5 percent came from the Internet. Now he estimates that about 30 percent of the false identification documents he seizes comes from the Internet. He predicts that by next year his unit will find at least 60 to 70 percent of the false identification documents they seize will come from the Internet. The General Accounting Office (GAO) and the FBI have both confirmed the findings of the subcommittee's investigation. Earlier this year the GAO used counterfeit credentials and badges, readily available for purchase on the Internet, to breach the security at 19 federal buildings and two commercial airports. GAO's findings demonstrate that, in addition to the poor security measures at federal facilities, the Internet and computer technology allow nearly anyone to create convincing identification cards and credentials. The FBI has also focused on the potential for misuse of official identification, and recently executed search warrants at the homes of several individuals who had been selling federal law enforcement badges over the Internet.  In response to these findings, the House has passed legislation that will complement the provisions in the bill we currently have under consideration. H.R. 4827, the Enhanced Federal Security Act of 2000, was introduced by Congressman Steve Horn, and would make it a crime to enter federal property under false pretenses or for an unauthorized individual to traffic in genuine or counterfeit police badges. The House bill, supported by Congressman McCollum, chairman of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, provides an additional measure to curb the use of false identification, and I hope that the Senate will approve it along with S. 2924.  Mr. President, the Internet is a revolutionary tool of commerce and communication that benefits us all. But many of the Internet's greatest attributes also further its use for criminal purposes. While the manufacture of false identification documents by criminals is nothing new, the Internet allows those specializing in the sale of counterfeit identification to reach a broader market of potential buyers than they ever could by standing on a street corner in a shady part of town. They can sell their products with virtual anonymity through the use of e-mail services and free Web hosting services, and by providing false information when registering their domain names. Similarly, the Internet allows criminals to obtain fake IDs in the privacy of their own homes, substantially diminishing the risk of apprehension that attends purchasing counterfeit documents on the street. Because this is a relatively new phenomenon, there are no good data on the size of the false identification industry or the growth it has experienced as a result of the Internet. The subcommittee's investigation, however, found that some Web site operators apparently have made hundreds of thousands of dollars through the sale of phony identification documents. One website operator that we investigated told a state law enforcement official that he sold approximately 1,000 fake IDs every month and generated about $600,000 in annual sales.  Identity theft is a growing problem that these Internet sites encourage. Recent testimony by the Federal Trade Commission noted that the number of calls to their ID theft hotline had doubled between March and July of this year, that the agency was receiving between 800 and 850 calls a week, and that their phone counselors had handled more than 20,000 calls in an 8-month period earlier this year. Fake IDs, however, facilitate a broader array of criminal conduct. The subcommittee's investigation found that some Internet sites were used to obtain counterfeit identification documents for the purpose of committing other crimes, ranging from very serious offenses such as bank fraud to the more common problem of underage teenagers buying alcohol or gaining access to bars. The legislation under consideration today is designed to address the problem of counterfeit identification documents in several ways. The central features of the bill are provisions that modernize existing law to address the widespread availability of false identification documents on the Internet.  First, the legislation strengthens federal law against false identification to ensure that it is suited to the Internet age and the technology associated with it. The primary law prohibiting the use and distribution of false identification documents was enacted in 1982. Advances in computer technology and the use of the Internet may have rendered the law inadequate to encompass the technology of the present day. This bill will clarify that current law prohibits the sale or distribution of false identification documents through computer files and templates, which our investigation found are the vehicles of choice for manufacturing fake IDs in the Internet age.  Second, the legislation will make it easier to prosecute those criminals who manufacturer, distribute or sell counterfeit identification documents by ending the practice of using easily removable disclaimers as part of an attempt to shield the illegal conduct from prosecution through a bogus claim of ``novelty.'' No longer will it be acceptable to provide computer templates of government-issued identification containing an easily removable layer saying it is not a government document.  For instance, the subcommittee staff purchased a fake Oklahoma driver's license as part of an undercover operation conducted during our investigation. The fake license appears to bear the disclaimer, ``Not a Government Document,'' which is required by federal law. We found, however, that with one simple snip of the scissors, the fake ID could be removed from his laminated pouch, effectively discarding the disclaimer. It will no longer be acceptable under my bill to sell a false identification document in this fashion.  Finally, my legislation seeks to encourage more aggressive enforcement by dedicating investigative and prosecutorial resources to this emerging problem. The bill establishes a multi-agency coordinating committee that will concentrate the investigative and prosecutorial resources of several agencies with responsibility for enforcing laws that criminalize the manufacture, sale, and distribution of counterfeit identification documents. While the new provisions are intended to cover any individual or entity using a computer disc, file, template, or the Internet to produce, transfer or make available false identification documents or document-making implements, the substitute bill makes clear that the new offense does not cover companies providing interactive computer services, such as Internet service providers, communications facilities, or electronic mail services, who are innocent conduits of false identification documents. Just as the counterfeiting laws do not cover an unknowing provider of a device or service used to manufacture or transmit counterfeit money, the provisions in this legislation are not meant to apply to unknowing parties whose devices or services are used in the production or transfer of false identification documents. This exception is inapplicable, however, and ordinary common law doctrines of criminal lability will apply in cases of conspiracy between the interactive computer service and the user; knowledge of and specific intent of an officer, director, partner or controlling shareholder that the server or system be used for this criminal purposes; or when the material available through a service consists primarily of material that is covered by the new offense in this legislation.  This bill is one in a line of bills that have been considered by Congress in recent years that address the issue ofservice provider liability relevant to the unlawful conduct of third parties. These have ranged from bills dealing with the liability of service providers in cases of defamation suits, to copyright infringement actions, to criminal prosecutions for online drug trafficking, Internet gambling, and in this case, online distribution of false identification document-making implements. Through these bills, Congress has had to consider the complexities of the particular area of law at hand, the application of common law doctrines, such as respondant superior and theories of contributory and vicarious liability, and the nature of liability with respect to specific violations in both civil and criminal contexts. In short, I believe that my bill, while addressing a number of these issues, does not necessarily set a standard for Congress to follow when considering the issue of service provider liability in future bills, in future contexts.  Mr. President, our investigation established that federal law enforcement officials have failed to devote the necessary resources and attention to this serious problem. By striking at the purveyors of false identification materials, I believe we can reduce the end-use crime that often depends upon the availability of counterfeit identification. For instance, the convicted felon who testified at the subcommittee's hearing said that he would not have been able to commit bank fraud had he not been able to easily and quickly obtain high quality, fraudulent identification documents over the Internet. I am confident that, if federal law enforcement officials prosecute the most blatant violators of the law, the false ID industry on the Internet will wither in short order. By strengthening the law and by focusing our prosecution efforts, I believe that we can curb the widespread availability of false identification documents that the Internet encourages. The Director of the United States Secret Services testified at our hearing that the use of fraudulent identification documents and credentials almost always accompanies the serious financial crimes that they investigate. Thus, I believe that a stronger law against making false identification documents will deter criminal activity in other areas as well. I urge my colleagues to support S. 2924.  I ask unanimous consent to have print in the Record a brief section-by-section summary of the substitute for S. 2924.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:Internet False Identification Prevention Act of 2000 (Collins/Feinstein                 Substitute)--Section-By-Section Summary       Section 1 names the bill as the Internet False      Identification Prevention Act of 2000.       Section 2 establishes a coordinating committee to ensure      the vigorous investigation and prosecution of the creation      and distribution of false identification documents. The      coordinating committee, appointed by the Attorney General and      the Secretary of the Treasury, shall consist of the Secret      Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department      of Justice, the Social Security Administration, and the      Immigration and Naturalization Service, and shall exist for      two years. The coordinating committee will focus      investigative and prosecutorial resources of the federal      agencies concerned with false identification in order to curb      this growing problem, and will report the results of agency      actions each year.       Section 3 will amend 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1028 to modernize the      primary federal law pertaining to false identification      documents. The bill modifies the existing definition of      ``document-making implement'' to include computer templates      and files that are now frequently used to create counterfeit      identification documents from the Internet.       A new provision will make it illegal to ``knowingly produce      or transfer a document making implement that is designed for      use in the production of a false identification document.''      This provision will close a loophole which currently allows a      person to transfer, through a Web site or e-mail, false      identification templates that can easily be made into actual      finished documents. Current law will also be amended to      cover, in addition to documents used in interstate or foreign      commerce, any document made available by ``electronic      means.'' This will ensure that a false identification      document offered for download on a Web site is captured by      the statute. Innocent third parties, such as Internet service      providers or transmission companies, are excluded from      coverage under the legislation.       Finally, this section will provide for the first time a      definition of ``false identification document.'' A ``false      identification document'' will be defined as a document that      is intended or commonly accepted for the purpose of      identification which is not issued by or under the authority      of a government, but which appears to be issued by or under      the authority of any government entity. This provision, in      conjunction with the removal of the disclaimer provision      below, will make it clear that it is illegal for anyone but a      government entity to produce any document that is commonly      accepted for legal identification.       Section 4 will repeal 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1738, thus ending the      ability to use a disclaimer and legally produce      identification documents that include the age or birth date      of an individual. Repealing Section 1738 will prohibit the      practice, which was frequently encountered during the      Subcommittee's investigation, of attempting to avoid criminal      liability for manufacturing and selling counterfeit      identification products by displaying a ``NOT A GOVERNMENT      DOCUMENT'' disclaimer. This type of disclaimer can be      fashioned so as to be easily removable on both computer      templates and counterfeit identification documents. It will      now be illegal to produce or sell any document that resembles      a government identification document.       Section 5 will make the provisions effective 90 days after      enactment.
