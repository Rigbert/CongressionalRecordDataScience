President, while the Republican whip is still on the floor, I believe there is an agreement, at 10:45, Republicans will have control of the floor.  I have waited patiently while the Senator from Texas has given his speech. I ask unanimous consent to allow me 10 minutes to speak on the floor before the Republicans claim their time.
