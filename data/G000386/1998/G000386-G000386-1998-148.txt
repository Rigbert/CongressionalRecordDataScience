 President, I ask unanimous consent that we now move to the consideration of Senator D'Amato's amendment to the bankruptcy bill, and immediately upon disposing of that, which we hope to do fairly shortly, we move then to the Dodd amendment, and we would have 40 minutes on the Dodd amendment, evenly divided.
