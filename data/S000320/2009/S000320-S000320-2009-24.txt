  Could it be that through this program, which entices car buyers with up to $4,500 to trade in their old cars, the government has finally devised a smart way to stimulate the economy?  In a word, no.  Instead, the Federal Government has sent another $1 billion of taxpayer funds into the economic abyss with $2 billion of taxpayers' funds to follow.  It has robbed Peter to pay Paul, to give a kickback to the automotive industry.  Advocates of the Cash for Clunkers Program state the additional $2 billion in funding is necessary because the program is such a great success.  Of course it is. Who does not want free money?
