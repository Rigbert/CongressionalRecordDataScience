Mr. Chairman, it is time to take a second look at Planned Parenthood. I respectfully ask Members to support the Pence amendment which will be offered later on.  Mr. Chairman, no child is safe in a Planned Parenthood clinic. That goes equally for the preborn child who is yearning to be born as well as for the 15-year-old pregnant girl being told she is entitled to a secret abortion, an abortion procured with neither her parents' knowledge or consent.  Each year, with poison pills or by dismemberment, Planned Parenthood aborts more than 305,000 unborn children. That's a quarter of all abortions performed in America--a staggering loss of children's lives that, years to date, now exceeds over 5 million dead babies all by just one organization.  Planned Parenthood aggressively lobbies and litigates against every modest restriction that has been proven to significantly reduce abortions. Planned Parenthood lobbies and litigates against women's right-to-know laws, waiting periods and parental involvement statutes, even though the latter has been shown to reduce abortions among teenage girls by between 19 and 31 percent. Planned Parenthood lobbies and litigates against prohibitions of taxpayer funding for abortions even though Planned Parenthood's own research shows that funding bans reduce abortion by between 20 and 35 percent. Millions of children live today because public funds weren't available to effectuate their demise. Yet Planned Parenthood aggressively seeks to compel taxpayer funding for abortion.  It is time, Mr. Chairman, to take a second look at Planned Parenthood. It is time to understand the irreparable harm Planned Parenthood is doing to the children of America, both born and unborn.
