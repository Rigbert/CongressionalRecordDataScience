President, again, this amendment involves some very important rights with respect to consumer protection as it relates to health care practitioners, health care plans and the fact that it appears that some physicians are actually gagged in terms of what they can tell their patients about their illnesses and their treatment.  These gag provisions often are included in contracts for purely financial reasons. They limit the kinds of therapies that physicians or other licensed health care practitioners may recommend. It can restrict a practitioner from recommending a patient consult a physician outside a plan or go to a facility outside the plan's network.  In addition, these kinds of approaches may even prohibit a practitioner from discussing financial incentives or penalties physicians may be subject to based on treatments that are recommended or ignored, in the case of an individual physician.  Mr. President, the preamble of the Hippocratic oath tells physicians, ``First, do no harm.'' The message of these gag restrictions, unfortunately, is, ``First, support the bottom line.'' That is not good health care, and it is certainly not good managed care.  Several months ago, the Washington Post cited a startling example involving Mid-Atlantic Medical Services health plans, a large Washington metro area provider. This plan wrote a letter to network practitioners informing them that:       Effective immediately, all referrals from (the plan) to      specialists may be for only one visit.  And in bold type the letter stated:       We are terminating the contracts of physicians and      affiliates who fail to meet the performance patterns for      their specialty.  Obviously, this is a bad deal for patients on two counts. First, the patients may not be getting the kind of health care that is needed.  Second, the plan may restrict the physician from informing the patient about referral restrictions so the patient doesn't even know whether they are being medically shortchanged via the plan's policy.  In my home State of Oregon, where we do have a great number of managed health care services and plans, our State law specifically prohibits these kinds of provisions. Many managed care plans in our State are offering good quality services. They are able to do it in a way that allows them to be both patient-oriented and consumer-friendly and still be sensitive to their financial needs.  Unfortunately, even in our State, a State where there are good managed care plans, problems can develop. For example, an orthopedic surgeon in Portland recently was in a situation where their managed care plan demanded that this particular physician diagnose problems in patients apart from the ones for which they were referred. He was, in effect, in a situation where he was told to keep his mouth shut and instead re-refer those particular patients back to their primary care physician.  This physician wrote to us:       This is extremely disappointing to patients, as you might      imagine. This requires more visits on their part to their      primary care physician and then back to me, which is      extremely inefficient.  Another physician, a family practice physician in rural Enterprise, OR, wrote that this antigag legislation is needed because ``when a physician recommends medical treatment for a patient and a plan denies coverage for that treatment, patients and physicians need an effective mechanism to challenge the plan.''  I think it is understood that the free flow of information between doctors and patients is the very foundation of good health care. State legal protections on this matter vary. Some States have taken steps to limit these gag rules, but one of the reasons that I come to the floor today and why this legislation has received strong bipartisan support is that I think it is time for a national standard to deal with a national problem.  This amendment is rifle-shot legislation prohibiting only oral gag provisions in contracts or in a pattern of oral communications between plans and practitioners that limit discussion of a patient's physical or mental condition or treatment options. Health plans would still be able to protect and enforce provisions involving all other aspects of their relationship with their practitioners, including the confidentiality of proprietary business information.  In developing this amendment, Mr. President, I and others have talked with many who offer managed care health services, as well as practitioners and consumer advocates. Our enforcement provision specifies penalties for violations by plans of up to $25,000 per event. The amendment also specifies that State laws which meet or exceed the Federal standard set herein will not be preempted by Federal law.  I would like to point out to my colleagues that this amendment has been endorsed by the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, the American Association of Retired Persons, the Center for Patient Advocacy, Citizen Action, Consumers Union, the American College of Emergency Physicians and a number of other organizations. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record letters from these groups.  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                   August 1, 1996.     Hon. Ron Wyden,     259 Russell Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Wyden: We are writing to express our strong      support for ``The Patient Communications Protection Act.''       As you know, it has become common for insurers to      incorporate clauses or policies into providers' contracts      that restrict their ability to communicate with their      patients. Such ``gag clauses'' seriously threaten the quality      of care for American patients. Not only do gag clauses deny      patients the fundamental right to make a fully informed      decision about the care they receive, but also they prevent      health care providers from delivering the highest quality of      care.       Your legislation would prohibit the use of gag clauses. By      opening the lines of communication between patients and their      physicians, the bill helps to ensure that the practice of      medicine occurs in the doctors office not in the corporate      boardroom.       We, at the Center for Patient Advocacy, applaud your      efforts in behalf of American patients. We look forward to      working with you to secure passage of the Patient      Communications Protection Act.           Sincerely,     Neil Kahanovitz, M.D.,       President and Founder.     Terre McFillen Hall,       Executive Director.                                                                    ____                                   Oregon Medical Association,                                      Portland, OR, July 22, 1996.     Hon. Ron Wyden,     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, D.C.       Dear Senator Wyden: Thank you for asking for input from the      Oregon Medical Association prior to your introduction of the      Patient Communication Act of 1996. The ``gag rules'' decreed      by some of the managed care organizations would, indeed, make      a reasonable person gag. We appreciate your interest in      halting such activities and your intent to prohibit by      federal law such draconian practices. I know how much you      value and how well you understand the necessity of open      communication between patients and their physicians. Such      rules, and the knowledge that such rules exist, undermine the      trust that patients absolutely must have for their physicians      if the relationship is to be of value.       As you know, we here in the O.M.A. introduced and      orchestrated the 1995 state legislature's passage of the      Oregon Patient Protection Act which prohibited ``gag      clauses'' in managed care contracts here in Oregon, as you      are now intending to do at the federal level. As usual, your      state is out in front showing the way in health care.       We appreciate your sharing and exchanging ideas and      apprising us of pending legislation and we value such      dialogue. Please keep us informed of the progress of this      bill, on which we certainly are in agreement.           Sincerely yours,                                   Frank J. Baumeister, Jr., M.D.,     President.                                                                    ____           National Committee to Preserve Social Security and                                                      Medicare,                                  Washington, DC, August 30, 1996.     Hon. Ron Wyden,     Russell Senate Office Building, U.S. House of          Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Wyden: The National Committee to Preserve      Social Security and Medicare, on behalf of its 5.5 million      members and supporters, endorses S. 2005, the ``Patient      Communications Protection Act of 1996.'' By addressing a      concern health care providers and patients may have with      managed care, this bill may encourage Medicare beneficiaries      to enroll in managed care plans.       This bill will encourage full and open communication      between physicians and their patients, which are vital to the      prevention of and recovery from illness. Frank discussions      cannot occur if providers are prohibited by health plans from      disclosing all available treatment options. In addition, the      use by some managed care companies of financial incentives to      limit costly care also limits communication between the      provider and the patient.       Managed care enrollees have a right to expect that they      will receive appropriate care for their medical condition,      without regard to the cost to the managed care company. The      best way to ensure that appropriate care is given to foster      full communication between provider and patient.       We applaud your effort to advance the ``Patient      Communications Protection Act'' and look forward to working      with you toward final enactment of this important bill.           Sincerely,                                                Martha A. McSteen,     President.                                                                    ____                                           Association of American                                Physicians and Surgeons, Inc.,                                        Tucson, AZ, July 29, 1996.     Hon. Ron Wyden,     Russell Senate Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Wyden: The Association of American Physicians      and Surgeons supports your efforts to protect the sanctity of      the patient-physician relationship with the ``Patients Right      to Know Act of 1996.''       Our association strongly supports the liberty of contract      and freedom of association. However, such liberty has bounds.      Contracts of adhesion are immoral, unjust and should be      unlawful. Patients are being exploited by powerful      organizations.       Patients should be able to rely upon their physicians'      ethics. However, today certain organizations are gaining the      economic power to exclude and financially destroy      conscientious physicians who place their obligations to the      patient ahead of the interests of the ``plan.'' Restrictions      on communication with our patients not only undermine quality      of care, but are a blatant violation of the Hippocratic Oath.      Prohibition of ``gag rules'' is a crucial step toward      protecting patients.       Contracts which restrict physicians' freedom to communicate      their best judgment are only one of the most egregious      violations of patients' rights.       AAPS believes Congress should consider legislation which      would protect patients'     right to choice, confidentiality, the ability to privately      contract, and to receive full advance disclosure of the terms      of their insurance/health care plan in plain language. The      AAPS ``Patient's Bill of Rights'' which will be introduced as      a Congressional resolution by Rep. Linda Smith, addresses      those issues. We hope it will serve as a model and catalyst      for future legislation.       Information is the best prescription. Prohibition of ``gag      clauses'' is the first step in that direction, and we hope it      sets the stage for additional patient protections to come      from the 104th Congress.           Sincerely,                                             Jane M. Orient, M.D.,     Executive Director.                                                                    ____                              American Counseling Association,                                  Alexandria, VA, August 20, 1996.     Hon. Ron Wyden,     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Wyden: I am writing on behalf of the American      Counseling Association (ACA), the nation's largest nonprofit      organization representing licensed and certified professional      counselors, to express our support for your legislation S.      2005, the Patient Communications Protection Act of 1996. As      behavioral healthcare providers, professional counselors      would be greatly helped by your legislation. However, we      could appreciate your consideration of a minor change in the      bill's definition of a ``health care provider'' from ``anyone      licensed under State law to provide health care services . .      .'' to ``anyone licensed or certified under State law to      provide health care services . . .''       Currently, 33 states--including the State of Oregon--and      the District of Columbia license professional counselors to      provide behavioral healthcare services to their residents. In      eight other states--including Arizona, Kentucky, Maryland,      New Hampshire, New Mexico, Rhode Island, Washington, and      Wisconsin--professional counselors are certified, and thus      would not be considered ``health care providers'' under S.      2005. Attached for your information is a survey comparing      state policies regarding licensure and certification.       We have discussed this issue with Steve Jenning of your      staff, who states he saw no reason this change couldn't be      included in the legislation as it moves forward. Should you      be agreeable to this proposed change, we would be happy to      provide you with any assistance or further information you      may need. Please use Scott Barstow of our Office of      Government Relations as our contact on this issue, at (703)      823-9800 x234.       Thank you for your time and consideration. We look forward      to working with you on behavioral healthcare issues and other      areas of mutual concern.           Sincerely,                                                    Gail Robinson,     President.                                                                    ____                            American Chiropractic Association,                                     Arlington, VA, July 30, 1996.     Hon. Ron Wyden,     Russell Senate Office Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Wyden: Yesterday your office contacted the ACA      seeking endorsement for a bill you are drafting to prohibit      health insurance plans from restricting or limiting      communication between health providers and patients about      treatment options and procedures. This practice is most often      employed by managed care plans through what are called ``gag      rules.'' The ACA has endorsed legislation in the House, H.R.      2976, that would prohibit these gag rules, and we commend you      for your efforts to eliminate this unfair practice.       However, in the materials your staff provided us      (attached), it appeared that your proposal would limit the      effect of the bill to only those communications between      medical doctors and health plan participants. Thus, health      plans technically would be permitted to continue to employ      ``gag rules'' on communications between non-M.D. health      providers and their patients enrolled in managed care plans.       Such language concerns the ACA, since as you are aware,      doctors of chiropractic are not M.D.s, but rather are fully      licensed health care providers so recognized in every state.      It is our belief that any legislative proposal to prohibit      the establishment of ``gag rules'' in managed care plans      should apply to all providers licensed or otherwise      recognized by a state authority. Since hundreds of millions      of consumers utilize non-M.D. health professionals every      year, we believe your proposal needs to be broadened.       Therefore, before endorsing your bill, ACA would strongly      urge you to expand its definition of health provider to mean      any health professional licensed, certified or registered in      a state to provide health care services. This would extend      the sensible protections your legislation offers to those      patients who utilize the services of health professionals who      are not M.D.s.       ACA appreciates and acknowledges your past efforts on      behalf of the chiropractic profession and the tens of      millions of patients who visit doctors of chiropractic every      year. We hope that you will see fit to make the modifications      that we have respectfully submitted in this letter.           Sincerely,                                                 Garrett F. Cuneo,                                         Executive Vice President.
