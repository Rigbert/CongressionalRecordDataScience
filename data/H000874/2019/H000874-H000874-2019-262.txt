But I appreciate my friend's wish for a happy birthday.  God has been very good to me, and I am looking forward to celebrating that birthday. My daughters were a little premature. We celebrated it last Saturday, too, so we are going to have a number of celebrations on this birthday, and then hopefully everybody will forget it, including me.
