 President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending Grassley amendment No. 2687 be agreed to; provided further that I then be immediately recognized to offer a further second degree related to net operating loss. I further ask consent that the amendment then be agreed to, and the underlying amendment No. 2686 be agreed to, as amended, with the motions to reconsider laid upon the table. I further ask consent that Senator Harkin then be recognized in order to offer an amendment relating to overtime; further, that no second degrees be in order to that amendment prior to a vote in relation to that amendment.
