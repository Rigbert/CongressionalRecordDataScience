  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, there will be a unique opportunity today to do more than pass a birthday resolution for President Reagan. Students of history will remember that massive tax cuts passed in the first year of President Ronald Reagan's term. Just 1 year later, as deficits began to grow, President Reagan showed his mettle by joining with a Republican Senate and a Democratic House to pass into law the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982, raising taxes in the face of a deficit. And then he signed into law several other tax increases, including the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984.  But today the Republican President and the Republican House leaders do not have the vision and the gumption of the former President. The same day that they will pass his birthday resolution, they are going to also pass a resolution saying despite the huge and mounting deficits just like in the first term of President Reagan, they are going to hold steady to the huge tax increases tilted toward the wealthiest in this country.  It would be more appropriate and more fitting to recognize the spirit and the leadership of Ronald Reagan by admitting you were wrong and rescinding or freezing further tax cuts and dealing with the deficit honestly in this House.                          ____________________
