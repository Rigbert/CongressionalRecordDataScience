 President, I commend my friend and colleague from Alabama for an outstanding amendment. I listened carefully to his comments, Senator Faircloth's comments, and Senator Craig's comments.  As I understand the amendment by the distinguished Senator from Alabama, he is in effect here giving the Senate a choice, if I understand correctly, a choice between legal fees and children's health. The Senator from Alabama pointed out that as a State attorney general he had the option to retain private counsel to engage in this litigation which is going on in 30-some odd States around the country, and that he chose not to do it, but that many State attorneys general chose to hire private counsel to pursue this litigation against the tobacco companies.  Now we understand, as the distinguished Senator from Alabama pointed out, there are fee arrangements not known to the public under which there could be billions of dollars in fees paid to these lawyers who in effect were acting on behalf of State governments----  Is that right, I say to my friend from Alabama?
