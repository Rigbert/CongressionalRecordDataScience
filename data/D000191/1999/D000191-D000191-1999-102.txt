  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, on the other side they are talking about lower taxes. That means saving money. On the other side they are talking about dumping more money into the intelligence services, who already have a $30 billion a year budget. Sometimes this place reminds me of Alice in Wonderland.  Think of a parallel. When our kids fail the achievement tests, what do they say, more money for education? They say, no, we need to reorganize, we need to overhaul, we need to revitalize, we need vouchers, we need change. Now, when the CIA fails in its most basic mission on a multibillion dollar budget, they say they need more money.  Guess what? Here is the information they needed. Where did I get it? This came from the Congressional Research Service. It is publicly available. Maps of Belgrade on line. Here is the embassy. That is where it has been for 5 years. Here is where it used to be 5 years ago.  Well, maybe they did not know the current address. They could have gone to the web site, which is put up by the City of Belgrade and the government of Yugoslavia, which has the address. They could have got a phone book, but they probably do not have anybody who can read Serbian. I guess that is why they need more money. Maybe they need more money to go down to the bookstore and pay $19.95 for a Michelin map.  They do not need more money. They need to spend it better, they need to be reorganized, and some people need to be fired.                          ____________________
