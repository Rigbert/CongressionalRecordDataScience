In addition, I expect we will consider several bills from the Appropriations Committee. I've talked to the chairman about which bills would be most likely for floor action before August, and he's looking at the Veterans and Military Construction and the Transportation-HUD bills.  As the gentleman I'm sure knows, they have marked up now seven, I believe is the accurate number of appropriations bills--excuse me. I think it's nine because they marked up two today, or are in the process of marking them up today, and I expect by the end of the day there will have been nine appropriation bills marked up. They will proceed. But I think those two bills are probably the first ones that will come forward.
