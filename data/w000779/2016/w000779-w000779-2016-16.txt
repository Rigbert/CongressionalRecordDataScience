 Because of the lack of genuine answers from the Justice Department to this letter, signed by 23 Members of Congress, and the substantial nature of these unprecedented changes in surveillance policy, I ask now for unanimous consent for a vote on the SMDH Act to give Congress time to debate these sweeping changes to government's hacking authority.  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of S. 3485, introduced earlier today; that at a time to be determined by the majority leader, in consultation with the Democratic leader, but no later than 4 p.m. today, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to this bill.
