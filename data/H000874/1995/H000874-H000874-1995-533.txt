Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Deal bill.  On Tuesday, Representative Castle said the Republican bill is a big-bang approach to changing welfare.  He was right--and it is the kids who are getting banged up.  I rise today to support the Deal substitute, the only bill before us which makes fundamental changes to the current system while protecting our children.  The Deal bill is tough on work.  It is fair to kids.  It holds recipients accountable, and it makes both parents responsible for taking care of their children.  The Deal bill is tougher on work than any proposal before the House.  Each person on welfare will be required to sign a comprehensive individualized responsibility plan.  Each recipient is required to start looking for work immediately.  Nobody who refuses to work will get benefits.  Unlike the Republican bill, the Deal bill makes sure no kid will go to school hungry. It makes sure no kid will be left alone when Mom or Dad goes to work.  It cracks down on deadbeat parents to make sure they live up to their responsibility to support their children.  Both Democrats and Republicans agree the current welfare system is broken.  The Deal bill is the change we need to end welfare as we know it.  I urge support for the Deal substitute, which truly ends welfare as we know it.
