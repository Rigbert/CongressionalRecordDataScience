 President, for years I have worked to decrease our reliance on foreign sources of energy and accelerate and diversify domestic energy production. I believe public policy ought to promote renewable domestic production that burns clean energy. For this reason, I will be introducing the Providing Opportunities With Effluent Renewables, or POWER Act today which cultivates another homegrown resource: swine and bovine waste nutrients.  Section 45 of the Internal Revenue Code provides a production tax credit for electricity produced from renewable sources. Currently, the production tax credit is available for wind, closed-loop biomass, and poultry waste. ThePOWER Act will modify Section 45 to include swine and bovine waste nutrient as a renewable energy source.  The benefits of swine and bovine waste nutrient as a renewable resource are enormous. Right now, there are at least 20 dairy and hog farms in the United States that use an anaerobic digester or similar systems to convert manure into electricity. These facilities include swine and/or dairy operations in California, Wisconsin, New York, Connecticut, Vermont, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Colorado, Minnesota, and my home State of Iowa.  By using animal waste as an energy source, a livestock producer can reduce or eliminate monthly energy purchases from electric and gas suppliers. In fact, a dairy operation in Minnesota that uses this technology generates enough electricity to run the entire dairy operation, saving close to $700 a week in electricity costs. This dairy farm also sells the excess power to their electrical provider, furnishing enough electricity to power 78 homes each month, year round.  The benefits of using an anaerobic digester do not end at electricity production. Using this technology can reduce and sometimes nearly eliminate offensive odors from the animal waste. In addition, the process of anaerobic digestion results in a higher quality fertilizer. The dairy farm I referenced earlier estimates that the fertilizing value of the animal waste is increased by 50 percent. Additional environmental benefits include mitigating animal waste's contribution to air, surface, and groundwater pollution.  With all the problems that this type of opportunity remedies, I'm sure there will be a number of folks wondering why we haven't tried this before. The reason is, even if we had provided swine and bovine producers with tax incentives to produce renewable energy, they probably wouldn't have had access to the capital necessary for infrastructure development.  In fact, there was a segment on National Public Radio last week addressing the topic of anaerobic digester energy production. A professor from Cal State University who is an expert on anaerobic digesters was interviewed. The professor explained that the main reason farmers have not pursued this type of opportunity is cost.  For that reason, in addition to the tax credit opportunity I'm providing under section 45, I'm also going to guarantee within the POWER Act that funds be made available under the Environmental Quality Incentives Program for the development of anaerobic digesters.  Currently, the Environmental Quality Incentives Program provides funding for technical, educational, and financial assistance to farmers and ranchers for soil, water, and related natural resource concerns on their land. A component of the program allows for improvements to farm manure management systems. The POWER Act will guarantee that payments, up to two years worth of funding which currently amount to $100,000, would be made available to producers for ``cost sharing'' opportunities related to anaerobic digester implementation.  Using swine and bovine waste nutrient as an energy source can cultivate profitability while improving environmental quality. Maximizing farm resources in such a manner may prove essential to remain competitive and environmentally sustainable in today's livestock market.  In addition, more widespread use of this technology will create jobs related to the design, operation, and manufacture of energy recovery systems. The development of renewable energy opportunities will help us diminish our foreign energy dependence while promoting ``green energy'' production. This tax/farmbill proposal is real ``win-win'' situation for America and for our livestock producers.  Using swine and bovine waste nutrient is a perfect example of how the agriculture and energy industries can come together to develop an environmentally friendly renewable resource. My legislation will foster increased investment and development in waste to energy technology thereby improving farmer profitability, environmental quality, and energy productivity and reliability.  Why should we promote swine and bovine waste nutrient as an energy source? Consider the recent electricity shortage in California, the sky-high prices at the pump throughout last year and the soaring cost of home heating fuel and natural gas this winter. We have an obligation to consumers across the country to accelerate the nation's production of homegrown, clean-burning, renewable sources of energy.  The POWER Act is good for agriculture, good for the environment, good for energy consumers, and promotes a good, make that great, renewable resource that will reduce our energy dependence on foreign fuels. It is my hope that all of my colleagues join with me to advance this important piece of legislation.                                 ______                                       By
