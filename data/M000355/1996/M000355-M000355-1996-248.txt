 President, 50 years ago this June, President Harry Truman signed the National School Lunch Act into law declaring ``Nothing is more important in our national life than the welfare of our children, and proper nourishment comes first in attaining this welfare.'' This created the modern School Lunch Program operated through the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  By the end of its first year about 7.1 million children were participating in the National School Lunch Program. Today, over 25 million children receive a nutritious lunch under the program.  The National School Lunch Program is administered by Food and Consumer Service, an agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. At the State and local levels, the program is usually administered by the State education agency in cooperation with local school districts.  Throughout my career, I have been a strong supporter of child nutrition programs. We in public service have no greater responsibility than to ensure the health an well-being of our Nation's children. I pledge my commitment to continue to support the tremendously successful School Lunch Program.  Studies confirm and teachers readily agree, that there is a clear link between sound nutrition, learning ability, and the behavior of children. The best education programs we can devise will have little effect if children are simply too hungry to concentrate.  The School Lunch Program is a vital ingredient in the recipe to provide nutritious meals for America's children. For many of our Nation's children, the meals they receive through the various nutrition programs, especially the School Lunch Program, are the only nutritious foods they eat all day. Over 93,000 schools and residential child care institutions participate in the National School Lunch Program. The program is available in 95 percent of all public schools, representing 97 percent of all public school children.  Today, we not only celebrate the 50th anniversary of the School Lunch Program but also salute the women and men who contribute to the success of this program. I also want to thank the American School Food Service Association and their members for providing high-quality, low-cost meals to children across the country.  The School Lunch Program is an investment in our kids, an investment in our Nation's future. Happy anniversary and congratulations on a job well done.
