Speaker, reclaiming my time, in light of the fact, Mr. Leader, I will simply observe that if we get all of those things moving we are going to have a lot of work to do next week, and I presume our Members ought to be prepared for long days and, clearly, if we get all of that done, it will be Friday late before we get out of here.  In light of the fact we will not have a colloquy next week because we will be going on recess for the summer work period, can the gentleman tell us what he anticipates might be on the agenda when we come back on September 6, what might be on the agenda early in the September weeks? Clearly, appropriations bills conference reports, to the extent they are done, will be on the calendar, but other than that, can the gentleman enlighten us as to what your thoughts are? I yield to the leader.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding. We have not made any decisions yet, but obviously the gentleman knows and Members understand that the appropriations process did end with us passing our bills before the July 4 break. The Senate is working on appropriations bills, and we will be doing those conferences as they present themselves.  Also, we do know that at least the first week back, we could be looking at the Coast Guard authorization bill and possibly a research bill from the Committee on Science. That is the first week back. Other bills will be considered during the August district work period, and we will be able to make a more firm announcement to the Members as to what we anticipate having the first week back and, in addition to that, the second week also.
