 President, I am sure everybody is interested in the state of play. Chairman Hatch and Senator Wyden are meeting off the floor to try to identify a path forward. We would like to get more amendments pending and set some votes for later this evening.  I hope we will have an update from the bill managers here shortly, but I want to remind everybody, we are going to finish this bill before we leave. We are going to deal with FISA and we are going to deal with highways. There is a path forward, if people want to take it, that could complete all of this work at a reasonable time--probably sometime tomorrow--or we could make it difficult, but the end won't change. So I would just encourage at least some level of cooperation here becausewe are doing TPA and we are doing FISA and we are doing highways.  I yield the floor.                       Vote on Cahill Nomination
