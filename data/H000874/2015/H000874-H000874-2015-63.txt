McCARTHY. So what you heard from me--and let me say my own words once again, and I will be very clear about it. I said we will deal with this next week. I also said we are having bipartisan discussions. I also said, if you want to know the confidence of the world around us with how America deals with it, don't avoid the issue. Don't leave this debt for a future generation.  It is hard for me to believe that the entire other side of this aisle wouldn't want to do something about the debt. It is hard for me to believe that we want to continue just to build it up, that somehow that is a positive experience.  So don't play one against the other. Why don't we come together, find a way to raise it, but find a way that we don't continue to add to it. Because I will tell you, as I go across the country, it is not Republicans or Democrats who say that. It is all Americans who say that because they have to deal with that in their own house.  I am not going to say you said something different than the words you used, and the only thing I would ask is that you do the same for me.
