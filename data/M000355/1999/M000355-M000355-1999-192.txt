 President, others have said it probably better than I can, but what is really at stake is whether we are going to dramatically diminish, if not gut, the war on drugs.  The junior Senator from Kentucky has outlined the progress made on the teenage drinking front in the last 20 years, and it is, indeed, significant. No one argues with any of the observations that have been made by Senator Byrd and Senator Lautenberg, and others, about the devastating nature of the problem of teenage drinking, although it is encouraging that progress is being made.  The industry itself advertises against underage drinking extensively. The alcohol industry has spent $100 million over the last 8 years, and the beer industry has spent $250 million over the last 10 years, for a total of $350 million, in their own financed effort to get at the problem of teenage drinking, which is a horrendous problem. But as Senator Bunning has pointed out, it is a problem upon which we have made significant progress.  What is before us today with the Lautenberg amendment is whether we are going to gut the war on drugs. Regretfully, since President Clinton came to office, teenage drug use in this country has gone up 46 percent. We are going backwards in the war on drugs. While it may be an unintended consequence of what Senator Lautenberg is seeking to achieve today, the practical effect of this amendment is to gut the advertising campaign designed to go after teenage drug use, as Senator Dorgan has pointed out.  Let's have no misunderstandings; nobody is in favor of teenage drinking. Nobody thinks that we should not do more about this problem. However, the issue before us is: Are we going to gut the advertising effort in the war on drugs?  The National Youth Antidrug Media campaign is underway. This amendment, according to drug czar Barry McCaffrey, would undermine that. The Partnership for a Drug Free America, which is the nonprofit group that works with General McCaffrey to run this antidrug campaign, opposes this amendment.  General McCaffrey said just 3 weeks ago that proposals such as this amendment ``could dilute the focus of the successful media campaign advertising effort to change attitudes of youth and parents toward illegal drug use.'' He also said, ``An anti-underage drinking message to youth is largely a separate and distinct message from the anti-drug message, requiring a significantly different strategic approach based on scientific and behavioral knowledge.''  So what we are doing is mixing up apples and oranges. A campaign, designed, properly researched, and underway, to deal with youth drug abuse would be diverted in an entirely different direction by the Lautenberg amendment.  Others have referred to the letters from Mario Cuomo, Bill Bennett, and Jim Burke, the cochairs of the Partnership for a Drug-Free America. Theyoppose the Lautenberg amendment. Obviously, it is not because they are in favor of teenage drinking, but they don't want to gut the effort to have an effective antidrug campaign among America's young people.  Chairman Burke, of the Partnership for a Drug-free America, said: ``We don't believe . . . an effective campaign targeting underage drinking can be carved out of the current appropriation for the National Youth Antidrug Media Campaign.  He went on:       I can tell you that forcing the campaign to address      underage drinking (something it was not originally designed      to do) will seriously jeopardize the success of this effort.  He is referring to their effort to deal with teenage drug use, which, remember, is going up while teenage drinking is going down.  Cochairman Mario Cuomo, former Governor of New York, said this amendment ``threatens the success of one media campaign by creating another that simply cannot and will not work given the current limitations.''  Governor Cuomo also said that ``this type of program will require hundreds of millions more dollars--if not billions--to be effective.''  Governor Cuomo's cochairman, Bill Bennett, said:       Advocates are wrong to suggest that this enormous problem      of teenage drinking can be addressed effectively within the      current appropriation for the antidrug campaign. We read this      amendment as the beginning of the end of the antidrug      campaign.  Mr. President, we don't need to end the antidrug campaign. Drug use is going up; drug use among high school seniors has gone up 46 percent since 1992. It needs to be addressed. That is what this appropriation is for. Certainly, a program to address underage drinking, which all three of the men I have just quoted would tell us, would have to be of a tremendous size. That is an activity Congress would need to analyze carefully before embarking on.  I know that there are probably many Senators who are thinking that if they oppose the Lautenberg amendment, it is going to be very difficult to explain in a campaign contest. Let me say this. What would be even more difficult to explain, it seems to me, is a vote that would gut the effort to combat drug use in this country--teenage drug use in particular--which is on the increase. That is what this appropriation is designed to try to impact.  So if we are going to address teenage drinking, let's not do it at the expense of the war on drugs. The war on drugs has not been very effectively fought in the last few years. I am not here to cast any particular aspersions against anybody for that, but it is a cold, hard reality that teenage drug use has gone up 46 percent since 1992 in this country. It was previously tracking down. We need to get back on track and address this youth drug use. That is what the original appropriation was designed to do.  I hope we will resist the temptation to gut the war on drugs so that we can pursue it effectively. As evidence, we have the testimony of Jim Burke, Mario Cuomo, and Bill Bennett.  I ask that the record include copies of a letter from Bill Bennett of the Partnership for a Drug-Free America, opposing the Lautenberg amendment; a letter from Mario Cuomo of the Partnership for a Drug-Free America, opposing the Lautenberg amendment; and a statement of Richard D. Bonnette, President and CEO of the Partnership for a Drug-Free America, opposing the amendment, along with a press release from the Office of National Drug Control Policy.  I ask unanimous consent that those be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                 Partnership for a                                            Drug-Free America,                                    Washington, DC, June 24, 1999.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: An amendment has been introduced in      the House of Representatives that threatens the success of      the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign, currently being      coordinated by the Office of National Drug-Control Policy and      the Partnership for a Drug-Free America. This amendment, now      part of the Treasury & General Government Appropriations      Bill, mandates the inclusion of alcohol-related messages in      the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign. As former      Director of ONCDP in the Bush administration and as co-     chairman of the Partnership, I write to urge you to oppose      any similar provision that may be offered in your      Appropriations Committee markup of the Treasury and General      Government Appropriations Bill.       Representative Royal-Allard and Representative Wolf, who      introduced this amendment in the House are correct in their      convictions about underage drinking. But advocates are wrong      to suggest that this enormous problem can be addressed      effectively within the current appropriation for the anti-     drug campaign. Advocates of the amendment say it is simply      designed to give Gen. McCaffrey statutory jurisdiction to      address alcohol within the context of this campaign. We read      this amendment as the beginning of the end of the anti-drug      campaign.       If you wish to combat underage drinking, I urge you to      support the development of a mass media campaign specifically      targeting this issue through a separate appropriation. The      marketing experts who comprise the Partnership believe it      will take hundreds of millions of dollars to conduct a      campaign designed to dissuade teenagers from drinking. The      Partnership offers its assistance in this pursuit. But many      things need to fall into place first--research, market-     testing, and hundreds of millions in funding to do this      correctly.       Should a version of the Roybal-Allard/Wolf amendment      surface in the Senate, please help us keep the National Youth      Anti-Drug Media Campaign on track and focused. Please oppose      any effort to require this campaign to do more than it was      originally designed to do. As you may know, the Partnership      receives no part of the federal money dedicated to the anti-     drug campaign. The Partnership donates all its advertising to      this federally-backed effort for free.           Sincerely,     William J. Bennett.                                  ____                                                 Partnership for a                                            Drug-Free America,                                      New York, NY, June 23, 1999.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: An amendment has been introduced in      the House of Representatives that threatens the success of      the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign, currently being      coordinated by the Office of National Drug-Control Policy and      the Partnership for a Drug-Free America. This amendment, now      part of the Treasury & General Government Appropriations      Bill, mandates the inclusion of alcohol-related messages in      the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign.       If Congress wishes to support developing a national      advertising campaign targeting underage drinking, we stand      ready to support you be offering the assistance of our entire      organization. We do not believe, however, an effective      campaign targeting underage drinking can be carved out of the      current appropriation for the National Youth Anti-Drug Media      Campaign.       As the former chairman and CEO of Johnson & Johnson and      someone who has spent his entire career in marketing, I can      tell you that forcing the campaign to address underage      drinking (something that it was not originally designed to      do) will seriously jeopardize the success of this effort. To      undertake such an effort, extensive consumer-based research      would be needed to determine effective advertising      strategies. No such research exists. Additionally, to really      change attitudes about alcohol, this type of effort would      have to compete head-to-head with the billions spent to      market alcohol products and, therefore, require significantly      more funding.       Shaving money out of the National Youth Anti-Drug Media      Campaign will not accomplish this. We do not question the      rightness of addressing underage drinking. Our concerns focus      on what we can and cannot accomplish with the current      appropriation. We question the wisdom of seriously risking--     and perhaps killing--the effectiveness of one media campaign      to create another that simply cannot and will not work, given      current limitations. Should a similar amendment be proposed      in the Senate, I respectfully ask you to keep the anti-drug      campaign focused on what it was designed to target: illegal,      illicit drugs.           Sincerely,     James E. Burke.                                  ____                                                 Partnership for a                                            Drug-Free America,                                      New York, NY, June 23, 1999.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: As you may know, the Partnership      for a Drug-Free America--a non-profit coalition of      professionals from the communications industry--has for the      past 12 years demonstrated a remarkable expertise in the      production of anti-drug advertising and the execution of a      national anti-drug media campaign. The Partnership is      currently donating all of its advertising to the National      Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign, being coordinated by the      Office of National Drug Control Policy. The Partnership also      provides ongoing strategic advice to the campaign, and      receives no federal funds as part of this program.       The House Appropriations Committee will soon mark up its      Treasury & General Government Appropriations Bill. An      amendment has been added to this bill authorizing the      inclusion of alcohol-related messages in the anti-drug      campaign. As the Partnership has     demonstrated, advertising can be used to address teenage drug      use. Backed by the proper research, advertising could also be      used to address underage drinking. But please understand      this: We cannot target both effectively within the current      appropriation.       The alcohol industry spends billions each year on marketing      and promotion. As it stands, $185 million is authorized to      fund the anti-drug campaign. Of this less than $150 million      is actually being spent on the purchase of media exposure for      the campaign. If the Congress is interested in developing an      effective campaign to address underage drinking, the      Partnership stands ready to work with any and all concerned      organizations and government agencies to see it through. But      please understand that this type of program will require      hundreds of millions more dollars--if not billions--to be      effective.       Unless the House plans to increase funding significantly      for the anti-drug campaign, the Partnership has urged members      to vote to strip the Roybal-Allard/Wolf Amendment from the      anti-drug media campaign appropriation. The amendment      threatens the success of one media campaign by creating      another that simply cannot and will not work, given current      limitations. A fact sheet on the Partnership and our position      on this amendment are attached for your convenience. If any      similar provision is offered in your Appropriations Committee      markup of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations      Bill, I encourage you keep the anti-drug campaign focused by      opposing any such measure, unless significantly more funds      are appropriated.           Sincerely yours,     Mario M. Cuomo.                                  ____                  Partnership for a Drug-Free America                              co-chairman       Mr. James E.

Bonnette, President & CEO, Partnership for a          Drug-Free America on the Roybal-Allard/Wolf Amendment       New York, June 7th--We whole-heartedly support the concept      of developing a national advertising campaign targeting      underage drinking. Alcohol abuse is a huge problem in      America, and plays an undeniable role in substance abuse      among children and teenagers. As the Partnership has      demonstrated, advertising can be used to address teenage drug      use. Backed by the proper research, advertising could also be      used to address underage drinking. But it is simply not      possible to target both effectively within the current      appropriation for the National Youth Anti-Drug Media      Campaign.       I base this perspective on more than 30 years in the      advertising business, and 10 years of experience with the      Partnership for a Drug-Free America. The Partnership is a      coalition of communications professionals from advertising,      marketing, public relations and related disciplines. This      judgment does not question the relevance of targeting      underage drinking. It questions the wisdom of seriously      risking--and perhaps killing--the effectiveness of one media      campaign to create another that simply cannot and will not      work, given current limitations.       Our overriding concern about the Roybal-Allard/Wolf      amendment is that it will reduce the overall media exposure      for the anti-drug campaign. The alcohol industry spends at      least $1 billion each year on marketing and promotion; the      National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign is funded at $195      million. Of this, less than $150 million is backing the      advertising campaign. Clearly, an alcohol-abuse advertising      campaign would require significantly more money to compete      with the marketing muscle of the alcohol industry. From a      sheer marketing perspective, the chances of such a campaign      having an impact within the context of the current      appropriation are very, very slim.       The Partnership stands ready to support the development of      a national advertising campaign on underage drinking. We have      more than a decade's worth of experience in running a      consumer-focused media campaign designed to change attitudes      on drugs. We will help any and all groups interested in this      type of campaign in every way we can. This type of campaign,      however, must be done correctly.       The first step of any solid marketing effort is thorough      research. We have 11 years of experience in the marketplace      and 12 years of research on consumer attitudes about illegal      drugs. While one could assume this model could work for      alcohol abuse, extensive consumer-focused research would be      needed to guide the development and execution of such a      program. Currently, this type of research does not exist. The      development and literature review backing the National Youth      Anti-Drug Media Campaign took more than 18 months. To insert      an amendment requiring alcohol abuse be addressed, without      the same thorough approach taken in the development of the      anti-drug media campaign, ignores the fundamental need for      research.       Children and teenagers have different attitudes about      different drugs--marijuana, cocaine, inhalants,      methamphetamine, heroin and other illegal drugs. Kids of      different ages, races and genders view these drugs      differently. Attitudes about certain drugs also vary by      region in the country. We have no similar consumer insights      into what kids think about alcohol--beer, liquor, malt      liquor, etc.--and how these attitudes may differ by alcohol      brand, by age of kids, race, etc.       Marketing to reduce alcohol abuse would be more difficult      than marketing against illegal drugs. Alcohol, unlike illicit      drugs, is legal. While not impossible to accomplish, changing      attitudes about alcohol would be very challenging, given its      widespread cultural acceptance and use (responsible and      otherwise) of alcohol products. Alcohol use is widely      glamorized in movies, television and music. Alcohol use is      deeply ingrained in our culture--ritualized and commonplace.       We respect the opinions and passion of our colleagues      working to reduce alcohol abuse. We do not have any ties with      the beer and/or alcohol trade organizations opposing this      amendment; we do not accept funding from the alcohol and/or      tobacco industries. We are concerned about this amendment      solely because it could significantly diminish the impact of      the anti-drug campaign.       The National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign is being      coordinated by the Office of National Drug Control Policy in      cooperation with the Partnership for a Drug-Free America      (PDFA). PDFA provides advertising to the campaign pro bono      and receives no federal funding for its role in this effort.      The amendment seeks inclusion of anti-alcohol ads in this      campaign, which is using federal funds to purchase media      exposure for anti-drug advertising.                               fact sheet       The Partnership for a Drug-Free America is a non-profit      coalition of professionals from the communications industry,      whose mission is to reduce demand for illegal drugs in      America. Through its national anti-drug advertising campaign      and other forms of media communication, the Partnership works      to decrease demand for drugs by changing societal attitudes      which support, tolerate, or condone drug use.       The Partnership is comprised of a small staff and hundreds      of volunteers from the communications industry, who create      and disseminate the Partnership's work. Advertising agencies      create Partnership messages pro bono; research firms donate      information services; talent unions permit their members to      work for free; production professionals bring Partnership      messages to life; a network of advertising professionals      distribute the group's work to national and local media;      public relations firms lend services to various Partnership      projects; and media companies donate valuable broadcast time      and print space to deliver Partnership messages to millions      of Americans.       To date, more than 500 anti-drug ads have been created by      our volunteers. From March 1987 through the end of 1998, the      total value of broadcast time and print space donated to      Partnership messages topped $3 billion, making this the      largest public service media campaign in history. The      Partnership receives major funding from The Robert Wood      Johnson Foundation and support from more than 200      corporations and companies. PDFA accepts no funding from      manufacturers of alcohol and/or tobacco products. The      organization began in 1986 with seed money provided by the      American Association of Advertising Agencies.       Research demonstrates that the Partnership's national      advertising campaign has played a contributing role in      reducing overall drug use in America. Independent studies and      expert interpretation of drug trends support its      effectiveness. The New York Times has described the      Partnership as ``one of the most effective drug education      groups in the U.S.''       Drastic changes in the media industry over the past decade      have led to an overall decline in media exposure of public      service advertising. This is one factor contributing to the      Partnership's decision to participate in the National Youth      Anti-Drug Media Campaign, coordinated by the Office of      National Drug Control Policy in cooperation with PDFA.      Through the leadership of Gen. Barry McCaffrey, director of      the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, and      the commitment of numerous, outstanding members of Congress,      a total of $380 million has been appropriated by Congress for      this effort to date ($195 million in FY '98, $185 million in      FY '99). The bulk of this money is being used to pay for the      one thing that has eluded our campaign in recent years--     consistent, optimal, national media exposure. PDFA receives      no funding for its role in this campaign. The organization      donates all advertising to the effort pro bono and serves as      a primary strategic consultant (unpaid.)       In addition to its work on a national level, the      Partnership has helped create 54 state- and city-based      versions of its national advertising campaign through its      State/City Alliance Program. Working with state/city      governments and locally-based drug prevention organizations,      the Partnership provides at no cost--the guidance, on-site      technical assistance and creative materials necessary to      shape a multimedia campaign tailored to the     needs and activities within the state or city. Several      additional alliances are targeted for launch, which will      expand the program's reach to 98 percent of the U.S.                                  ____         Executive Office of the President, Office of National            Drug Control Policy,                                                   Washington, DC.    Assessment of the Potential Inclusion of Anti-Underage-Drinking                    Advertising in the ONDCP Campaign       An anti-underage drinking message to youth is largely a      separate and distinct message from the anti-drug message,      requiring a significantly different strategic approach based      on scientific and behavioral knowledge. If we were to be      asked to communicate an additional anti-underage-drinking      message platform with the current media budget, we would fall      below effective reach and frequency levels for all message      platforms, thus risking the success of the entire campaign.       An anti-underage drinking message to youth would also      require separate production, and this would incur a      considerable investment ($3-$4 million).       An anti-underage drinking message to adults might more      easily be incorporated in a strategic message focusing on      encouraging good parenting, and the important role of youth      influencers, in shapping positive behavior among youth.      Ideally, of course, a separate effort targeting adults would      be more effective.       While incremental advertising funds would absolutely be      required to successfully mount an anti-underage drinking      campaign, it would not be necessary to double the overall      ONDCP advertising budget if the adult efforts are combined.      Since the youth campaign represents about half of the      campaign, the ideal incremental budget would be approximately      $100 million. This would include some funds for such needed      expenditures as additional production, new behavior change      expertise, and limited copy testing, tracking and evaluation.      We would seek every possible efficiency between the anti-drug      and anti-underage-drinking campaigns from a creative and      media perspective (e.g., limiting the target to older teens).       If incremental funds are unavailable at this time, please      be aware that the current campaign already includes a      substantial percentage of anti-underage-drinking messages      (e.g., MADD, DOT, OSAP, etc.). This proportion could be      augmented, though this would obviously diminish other PSA      efforts. The ``match'' airtime devoted to this advertising is      every bit as good as that secured for the paid anti-drug      units.                              issue paper     Inclusion of alcohol in the National Youth Anti-Drug Media          Campaign       Using appropriated funds to include an alcohol or tobacco      component in the paid portion of the ONDCP National Youth      Anti-drug Media Campaign, within existing budgets, would      significantly dilute the campaign's emphasis on illicit      drugs, the primary intent of Congress and the Clinton      Administration in establishing this program.       The Media Campaign already addresses alcohol in several key      areas.       When ONDCP purchases time on network or local television      and/or radio stations, a condition of the media buy is a      dollar-for-dollar contribution to ONDCP from the media outlet      in the form of public service. Most comes in the form of      donated public service slots in similar time periods, which      ONDCP shares with other organizations that have drug-related      messages (PSAs). The Media campaign is already using      underage-drinking and drunk driving public service      announcements in its pro bono component. From July 1998      through January 1999 (the period for which data is      available), about 15% of the television public service time      given to the Media Campaign has been shared with four      organizations involved with underage drinking and drunk      driving (They are: National Council on Alcoholism and Drug      Dependence, Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD), Recording      Artists, Athletes and Actors Against Drunk Driving, and the      Dept. of Transportation). These 20 PSAs were electronically      coded and reports are generated to identify and track when      and where each massage is played. Computerized tracking      reports indicate these massages have played over 7,000 times      on local and network television, which is conservatively      valued at $8,000,000 in media time. ONDCP does not count any      time donated in the middle of the night (1 a.m. to 5 a.m.)      All of these PSAs were aired during appropriate time slots.       In addition, the Partnership for a Drug Free America has 53      State and local alliances 15 of which support programs that      include alcohol messages as public service announcements.      These messages include under-aged drinking, binge drinking,      prenatal alcohol use, parental modeling, and other subjects      that appear on television, radio, on billboards, on posters,      and in print PDFA estimates that the total value of media      time donated for these messages is approximately $7,000,000.       ONDCP's media match also comes in the form of television      programming. At least four national network television      programs have focused on youth-alcohol related issues. For      example, on May 16, the entire episode of WB's Smart Guy will      concentrate on underage drinking. ONDCP's behavioral change      experts have worked closely with the writers and producers of      this program to ensure key message strategies were      incorporated.       Much of the campaign's communications strategy to reach      parents regarding youth drug are appropriate to reaching      parents regarding underage drinking (knowing where your      children are, who their friends are, establishing rules and      values, etc.).       Substantial and costly changes in the communications      strategy would be required. The existing campaign strategy      was developed over an eight-month period in an expert driven      process. The strategy emphasizes specific message platforms,      techniques, and activities to address illicit drugs. Adding      alcohol to the strategy would mean a substantial departure      from current strategy, and would require additional time and      research for development. For example, ads would need to be      developed to address laws on underage drinking, issues of      access to alcohol (point of sale), etc. This would dilute and      delay the overall impact of the anti-drug ads by reducing      their reach and frequency. Professional advertising and      research staff have already alerted ONDCP that we may have      too many strategic messages for the level of funds available.      The addition of alcohol ads would further complicate efforts      and delay the campaign from reaching its planned potential      and strength.       Development of alcohol messages would place new,      unanticipated requirements on our existing partners, require      substantial time for production (behavioral briefs, focus      groups and testing) and create additional expense. The      Campaign was developed based on the Congressional expectation      that all the messages used would be produced on a pro bono      basis, primarily through the Partnership for a Drug Free      America, whose agencies provide their creative work free of      charge. PDFA does not produce national messages on alcohol      use/abuse; thus, we would required to pay for development      costs through an advertising agency (and no funding      allocation exists for this). The costs and contractual effort      required to undertake this would be substantial. Further it      would undermine a principle upon which the campaign was      based--the pro bono development of advertising messages.                                  ____         Executive Office of the President, Office of National            Drug Control Policy,                                     Washington, DC, June 7, 1999. McCaffrey Says Inclusion of Unresearched and Under Funded Alcohol Ads          in Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign Would Be Ill-Advised       Washington, DC.--White House National Policy Director Barry      McCaffrey today said that proposals to include alcohol      prevention in the paid portion of the ongoing National Youth      Anti-Drug Media Campaign ``could dilute the focus of the      successful media campaign advertising effort to change      attitudes of youth and parents toward illegal drug abuse.''       McCaffrey stated, ``We share a concern about the terribly      serious problem of underage alcohol use. We do not disagree      with the desirability of a media campaign targeted against      underage drinking. However, it would be a serious mistake to      simply add alcohol messages to the ONDCP paid media campaign      without significantly increasing the funding level.      Behavioral scientists and youth and advertising experts      advise us that our campaign will only be effective if we      purchase a sufficient level of media exposure for each of our      messages. The addition of paid alcohol ads--without new      funds, staff and research--would only hamper the      effectiveness of our campaign.       A commercial advertiser would not add a new product line to      an advertising plan without increasing the advertising      budget. We cannot simply add new alcohol messages without      seriously endangering the effectiveness of the anti-drug      youth campaign. There are several challenges that would make      an anti-alcohol campaign an expensive proposition. Although      at the initiation of the National Youth Anti-Drug Media      Campaign there was a stockpile of illicit drug ads, there are      very few ads currently available on underage drinking. We      would need to develop and produce expensive new ads.      Additionally, since alcohol is legal for adults, an effective      anti-alcohol campaign would need an entirely different      strategy than our existing media campaign, which has as its      focus illegal substances.       When ONDCP purchases time on national or local media, we      negotiate to achieve a dollar-for-dollar matching      contribution. Most of this contribution comes in the form of      donated public service announcement slots in similar time      periods. ONDCP then passes these PSA opportunities to      organizations that have anti-drug messages. From July 1998      through January 1999, roughly 15% of television public      service time given to the ONDCP Media Campaign was shared      with four organizations confronting underage drinking and      drunk driving (National Council on Alcoholism and Drug      Dependence, Mothers Against Drunk Driving, Recording Artists,      Athletes and Actors Against Drunk Driving, and the Department      of Transportation). These messages have played over 7000      times on local and network television, which is      conservatively valued at $8 million. In this concrete way, we      have already generated the largest youth anti-alcohol media      campaign in history. ONDCP has also used the match part of      the campaign to urge networks to include anti-alcohol      messages in entertainment programming. For example, the      entire episode of WB's Smart Guy that     aired on May 16 concentrated on underage drinking.''       We are now entering the second year of an increasingly      successful youth anti-drug media campaign. Alcohol and      tobacco use are clearly a major threat to the health and      safety of our children. However, now is not the time to lose      focus on the start of a massive, well designed and successful      effort to reverse the disastrous increase in illegal drug use      by Amedican adolescents.''  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let us get on about the business of fighting teenage drug abuse. I urge my colleagues to support the motion to table.  I yield the floor.
