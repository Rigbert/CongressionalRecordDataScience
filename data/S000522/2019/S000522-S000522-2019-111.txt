Madam Chair, the purpose of the 2002 AUMF could not have been more clear. I was here at the time. It was one of the more consequential debates we have ever had. And the purpose was clearly stated to go after Saddam Hussein because he had weapons of mass destruction and to wage war against the nation of Iraq.  If we cannot repeal that 17 years later, then Congress has truly and totally abrogated its constitutional responsibility to regulate any use of military force. There is no justification 17 years later to keep this on the books so that Presidents can use the authority as a blank check. Congress should stand up.
