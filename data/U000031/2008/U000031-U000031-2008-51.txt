 During the Vietnam War, Walter served as a paratrooper in the United States Army from 1965 to 1968. He received three Purple Hearts and two Bronze stars during his combat time and fought bravely in many battles, including the Battle of DakTo--a major victory over the North Vietnamese.  Perhaps even more impressive than Walter's war history, is his tireless work for the Civil Rights Movement. When he was a young man of 14 years, Walter become the vice president of the local NAACP Youth Council in Kalamazoo, and has been fighting for equal rights for all races ever since.  With the combination of Walter's bravery in the Vietnam War and his leadership in the Kalamazoo community, he has been chosen to receive the 2008 Veteran of the Year Award at the Metropolitan Kalamazoo branch of the NAACP Freedom Fund Banquet. I thank Walter Jones for his lifelong commitment to the betterment of our country, and in particular, forhis steadfast service to the Kalamazoo community.                          ____________________
