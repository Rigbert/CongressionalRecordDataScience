Speaker, ladies and gentlemen of the House, as you know, the continuing resolution expires at midnight tomorrow. As you also know, the other body is still in the process of considering the omnibus appropriation that we sent to them some days ago.  They are currently in the process of voting on five amendments. That will take probably another half hour. At the conclusion of that, they will be discussing whether or not they can get to two more votes to conclude their consideration of the omnibus appropriation.  There have been no amendments adopted in the Senate to the omnibus appropriation. As a result, if there are no amendments adopted and the Senate can come to a vote sometime this evening and that is assured, then it will not be necessary for us to return tomorrow. But I cannot tell you at this point in time. I'm hopeful that by 8:30 I will be able to give you a pretty definitive word on whether or not we will need to be here tomorrow.  So I wanted to bring you up to date. We will try to have it, as I say, by 8:30. If we get it earlier, we will give you that notice earlier. But I'm hopeful that by 8:30 we will be able to inform you.  We have one more vote now; but, again, if they proceed, as has been the case, and they can get an agreement on voting tonight, then it would not be necessary for us to be here tomorrow. If not, obviously we will have to be here tomorrow to assure that we do not shut down the government.                          ____________________
