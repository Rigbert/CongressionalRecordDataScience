President, I rise to clarify the legislative intent of S. 189, the 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act. In reviewing the section of the substitute text dealing with the purpose and definitions of fundamental research in nanotechnology that our bill references, I believe that they are not intended to limit research and development to the physical sciences and are intended to include a wide variety of research, including the biotechnology-nanotechnology interface. Senator Stevens, is that your reading of this legislation?
