We will be starting legislative business on the floor a little after noon. So there will be work on the floor proceeding.  It is my understanding, however, as the gentleman may know, that the hearing is in the Cannon Caucus Room. So we'll accommodate both media and the public, and as we all know, some of the most important hearings in history have been held in that room. So we certainly recognize the importance of this hearing, the gravity of the information that we will be receiving, and we have attempted to accommodate that.
