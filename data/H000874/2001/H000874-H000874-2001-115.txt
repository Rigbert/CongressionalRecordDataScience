Chairman, reclaiming my time, I thank the gentleman for his comments.  In closing, I also want to make the comment that although he takes this money out of an account that is a large account, it is a large account that has huge obligations in terms of the objects to which it is dedicated: that is, the maintenance and repair of Federal buildings all over this country. So although it seems to be a big pot out of which he is taking this money, it is, nevertheless, a pot which does not have enough money in it at this point in time to accomplish what GSA says is necessary in terms of repairs and alterations.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore (Mr. Gutknecht). The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Collins).  The amendment was agreed to.                Amendment No. 6 Offered by Mr. Traficant
