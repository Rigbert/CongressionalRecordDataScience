That is a very fancy word to say it has been made a whole lot worse by a host of the new regulatory requirements imposed by HCFA, including the implementation of another marvelous acronym called OASIS. The thought occurs to me, if there is an ``oasis'' that is proposed by HCFA--we all remember the ``Survivor'' show that was so popular--there would be no survivors in regards to this OASIS, I can tell you.  OASIS stands for the new outcome and assessment information data set--new outcome and assessment information data set--new requirements for surety bonds, new requirements for sequential billing, new requirements for overpayment recoupment, new requirements on a 15-minute reporting requirement. And all of this adds up.  I just concluded a 40-county tour in my State. I will go on another 65-county tour. At every stop was a hospital administrator. They said: I don't know who reads this stuff. I think they must weigh it somewhere in Kansas City--which is the regional center.  I am not trying to deprive from the purpose and the intent and responsibility that HHS and HCFA and OASIS have here, but it just seems to me that just about the time you have one requirement promulgated--there is another fancy word--then it is changed, and it is changed overnight. This is the kind of thing that a small rural hospital, or any hospital, just cannot put up with, with that very tight margin. We are down to the morrow of the bone.  Naturally, we are going to put in some money in regards to Medicare reimbursement, but this regulatory overkill is something that just has to stop.
