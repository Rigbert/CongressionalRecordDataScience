 President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session to consider the following treaties on today's Executive Calendar: No. 12 and 14.  I further ask unanimous consent that the treaties be considered as having passed through the various parliamentary stages up to and including the presentation of the resolutions of ratification, that any statements be printed in the Record as if read, and the Senate take one vote on a resolution of ratification to be considered as separate votes; further, that when the resolutions of ratification are voted upon, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, the President be notified of the Senate's action, and that following the disposition of the treaties, the Senate return to legislative session.
