President, last week there was an attempt made, I think, on the part of some--not all, but on the part of some--a serious attempt made in the Judiciary Committee to put together a bipartisan letter to the Attorney General regarding what should be done on the question of an independent counsel and some of the campaign fundraising issues. Unfortunately, it ended up being a partisan matter and the Republican majority, as is their right, sent a highly partisan letter asking immediately for an independent counsel.  Most of us on the other side sent a letter, which I signed as ranking member, along with other Democratic members, asking basically that we follow the law and we go through the various steps required on the issue of independent counsel: That we do not bring political pressure on the Attorney General to act one way or the other, recognizing that the reason for the independent counsel law was to shield the process and the Attorney General from political pressure or posturing.  In this regard, I would like to draw the attention of the Senate to the lead editorial in yesterday's Washington Post. The Post has been in the forefront of those investigative journalists who have been working on stories about many aspects of fundraising that has been taking place, and is taking place, to finance Federal elections--both fundraising by the Republican Party and by the Democratic Party. Certainly, the Post has not been shy about criticizing Republicans or Democrats, in the Congress or out, with regard to campaign fundraising.  It is interesting to read their editorial because, basically, they take the same position as we had taken on the Democratic side of the Senate Judiciary Committee. They speak of all the reasons to wait and follow the law itself, as she is now doing, and to have the Attorney General make her own determination. It ends by saying this:       There is one other major factor that argues for waiting      awhile before deciding whether to seek an independent counsel      in the campaign finance case. It has to do with what we      believe to be the integrity and, if you will, independence of      this attorney general herself. She is an uncommon figure in      this town, and this administration, as even many who are      banging on the table for an independent prosecutor will      agree. We do not think it would be an inducement to sleeping      well at night to know she was on your case if you had      violated the law and were trying to hide it--especially with      her honor being publicly challenged over and over again on      this matter.       You balance risks in a decision like this. The risk of      leaving the case in her hands at this stage, while Justice      Department, congressional and other investigators continue to      try to flesh it out, seems pretty slim. Events could change      that. But right now the matter seems to us to be proceeding      well enough without an independent counsel.  I ask unanimous consent the entire editorial be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 16, 1997]                     The Independent Counsel Issue       Attorney general Janet Reno says the conditions that would      require the naming of an independent counsel in the case of      the fund-raising for the president's reelection campaign have      yet to be met. She's taking a lot of heat for that. Critics      accuse her of trying to protect the president. Congressional      Republicans, some Democrats and all manner of other      commentators say if ever a case carried out for an      independent prosecutor, it is this one. We aren't so sure.      Anything could turn up tomorrow. But on the basis of what is      known today, an argument can be made that Ms. Reno is right.       We say that as strong supporters of the independent counsel      statute, though in some instances we have thought past      counsels carried on too long or went too far. We say it also      as a frequent critic of both the administration and the      rotten system of campaign finance, whose corrupting qualities      the president did so much to confirm last year. The fund-     raising practices, some of them, in which he, the vice      president and their adherents indulged were shabby, heavy-     handed, demeaning, unseemly, questionable, destructive of      public confidence and pretty close to the edge. But it isn't      clear they were illegal. That, in fact, is the problem. The      law is at least elliptical; not enough of what ought to be      illegal is.       The virtue of the independent counsel act is that it      reduces the conflict of interest that inevitably arises when      an administration is called upon to investigate its own      behavior. But it is not meant to avert mere awkwardness; it      comes into play in only certain instances. The attorney      general must seek appointment of an independent counsel (by      the special court created to do so) when confronted with      specific, credible evidence of criminal wrongdoing by the      president, vice president, Cabinet officials and certain      others in the executive branch, including a limited number of      senior White House aides. She also may seek appointment of a      counsel when confronted with evidence of such conduct by a      lesser official where she feels there is a conflict.       The evidence of such conduct in this case thus far is a lot      more limited than the churning surrounding the case would      suggest. A lot of pretty squalid stuff was done. But so far      as we know, no specific, credible evidence exists that, say,      an official covered by the act sold a particular piece of      policy for a campaign contribution, or knowingly accepted      money from a forbidden source. You could make the generic      charge against both presidential campaigns that they violated      and pretty well trashed the campaign finance laws, including      their criminal provisions, by raising so much so-called soft      money in excess of federal limits. They pretended it wasn't      campaign money when it     clearly was. But no one is talking about that in this case,      least of all the congressional Republicans who want an      independent counsel but oppose most regulation of campaign      finance. There are charges that funds were illegally      raised (by the vice president, for one) and received      inside a federal building--the very White House itself--     instead of in some other building down the street, but you      can find any number of lawyers who will say on one basis      or another that what was done was not illegal, and does      anyone really want to name an independent counsel to      conduct a criminal prosecution of the vice president for      making a phone call from the wrong room? That isn't what      this is about, either.       More serious charges have been leveled against some lesser      figures in the drama--that they laundered money from foreign      sources, sought favors in return for contributions, etc. Ms.      Reno has set up a task force to investigate these. As a      practical matter, what the task force appears to have been      conducting is precisely the kind of preliminary inquiry,      though by another name, that would be required if the      independent counsel statute were invoked, the question being,      what evidence is there that criminal conduct occurred? If      such conduct is found, and found to be of a kind that      requires the naming of an independent counsel, Ms. Reno may      yet ask for one. In a sense, what's going on is what the      critics claim to want, but without the label.       Meanwhile, the independent counsel already investigating      the president in the Whitewater case, Kenneth Starr, is also      looking into what you might call one of the most advanced      aspects of the campaign finance case, which is whether      political donors were somehow called upon to hire Clinton      family friend and former associate attorney general Webster      Hubbell before he went to prison several years ago, the      question being whether the large amounts of money paid him as      Mr. Starr was seeking information from him were meant to hush      him up.       There is one other major factor that argues for waiting      awhile before deciding whether to seek an independent counsel      in the campaign finance case. It has to do with what we      believe to be the integrity and, if you will, independence of      this attorney general herself. She is an uncommon figure in      this town, and this administration, as even many who are      banging on the table for an independent prosecutor will      agree. We do not think it would be an inducement to sleeping      well at night to know she was on your case if you had      violated the law and were trying to hide it--especially with      her honor being publicly challenged over and over again on      this matter.
