1123, then all other amendments and motions be withdrawn; the substitute amendment be agreed to; the bill be read a third time and the Senate then immediately vote on final passage; that the Senate insist on its amendment, request a conference with the House and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees; with the preceding all occurring without intervening action or debate.  I further ask unanimous consent that upon the disposition of H.R. 2206, the Senate begin debating the conference report on the budget resolution, notwithstanding the receipt of papers; that the time until 3 p.m. be equally divided between Senators Conrad and Gregg or their designees; that at 3 p.m., the Senate vote on passage of the conference report, notwithstanding the receipt of papers; provided the House has adopted the conference report by that time. If the House has not acted by that time, the Senate vote be delayed until the House has adopted the conference report. I further ask unanimous consent that if the House does not act on Thursday, May 17, then there remain 1 hour each for the chairman and ranking member to use prior to the vote on the conference report whenever the Senate does consider the conference report and that it be in order to consider it notwithstanding the provisions of rule XXII.
