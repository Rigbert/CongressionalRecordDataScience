Speaker, I urge support for the motion.  This bill renames the wonderful National Museum of American Art as the ``Smithsonian American Art Museum''. This museum is dedicated to the arts and artists of the United States, and its collections and enable the public to enjoy America's visual arts both at the museum and on-line.  The museum, part of the Smithsonian Institution, shares the historic Patent Building with the National Portrait Gallery.  Known first as the National Gallery of Art, and later as the National Collection of Fine Arts, Congress in 1980 gave the museum its present name, at the Smithsonian's request, to reflect its mission and to conform to the style of the other Smithsonian ``national'' museums.  However, since 1980, dozens of other museums have assumed the designation ``national'' in their names, thus weakening the Smithsonian's distinction as America's primary museum of works by American artists. Visitors to Washington are doubly confused by the presence on the Mall of the current National Gallery of Art, which is not part of the Smithsonian Institution.  This change will clarify the museum's mission and status, and it is hoped, increase visitation numbers as museumgoers better understand and discover the contents and location of this important part of the Smithsonian. This non-controversial legislation has the support of the Smithsonian's Secretary and Board of Regents, and passed the Senate without dissent. I urge its passage by this House.
