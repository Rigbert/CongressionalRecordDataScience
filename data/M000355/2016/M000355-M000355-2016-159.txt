 President, I wish to pay tribute to a man who has been a great advocate for the people of Kentucky and a man I am proud to call a friend. Mr. William ``Bill'' Bissett, who served for more than 6 years as the president of the Kentucky Coal Association, KCA, helped lead the effort in Kentucky to spread awareness regarding the devastation the coal industry has seen over the past several years--devastation wrought in many cases by wrongheaded government regulations and daunting challenges within the energy market.  Unfortunately for Kentucky, Bill recently left his position with the KCA, and starting November 1, he moved on to take his talents to the Huntington Regional Chamber of Commerce as its new president and CEO. Bill's departure is a great loss for the Commonwealth, and although he will certainly be missed, I wish him all the best in his new position.  As the people of Kentucky well know, the coal industry has not only supported and sustained life in the Bluegrass State for generations, it has also powered this Nation's rise through the industrial revolution and through times of war to become the greatest country in the world.  Coal is forever intertwined with the history of Kentucky and the Nation, but recently, coal has been under attack. For the last 8 years, the current administration has waged a war on coal and a war on coal jobs. They would have us believe it is immoral to use coal, and they have pursued regulations that aim to close coal mines and shut down coal-fired power plants that exist in Kentucky and prevent new ones from being built.  Even in the face of this hostile environment, in 2010, Bill Bissett took on a difficult job that many would have shrank from and became the president of the KCA. Since then, he has been on the front lines fighting against government overregulation and overreach. And I have been proud to stand alongside Bill to defend Kentucky's coal workers and their families against an administration dead set on waging a war on coal, a war which has contributed to the closure of mines and an increase in unemployment.  Bill and I worked together in taking Kentucky's case for coal and for coal jobs to the EPA. When the EPA first held hearings on the set of regulations that would become the so-called Clean Power Plan--regulations that threaten to close down power plants in Kentucky and reduce jobs--Bill and I worked together in calling for them to hold listening sessions in Kentucky so EPA could hear from the people who would be most affected by its new rules.  When the EPA refused to come to Kentucky and only held hearings in States with little reliance on coal like California and Massachusetts, Bill and the KCA joined me in making sure our voices were heard. We convened our own hearings in Pikeville, where coal miners and Kentuckians with jobs reliant on the coal industry spoke about how EPA's proposed regulations would impact them. We also took our case directly to the EPA in Washington, DC, when it conducted one of its listening sessions on the so-called Clean Power Plan, which threatens to cut more coal jobs in Kentucky and increase electricity prices in the State by double digits.  These are just a few highlights of Bill's tenure with KCA. Before coming to KCA, Bill worked as chief of staff/senior vice president for communications at Marshall University, his alma mater. Prior to that he served as vice president of public relations for Charles Ryan Associate, CRA, an integrated marketing firm. During his time at CRA, he was instrumental in the establishment of the Friends of Coal campaign. Bill and his wife, Lara, are devoted parents to two daughters, Molly and Maggie.  From the beginning of his tenure at KCA to the very end, Bill Bissett worked with great energy and enthusiasm on behalf of Kentuckians who work in the coal industry. He was a great advocate for coal miners. Kentucky's loss is truly Huntington's gain, and I wish Bill well in his future endeavors with the regional chamber of commerce and beyond. On behalf of the thousands of Kentuckians touched by Bill's work, I want to thank him for his service to the Bluegrass State and his advocacy to preserve our history and heritage. He is always welcome back in Kentucky, where he has many friends.                          ____________________
