 President, in September the community of London, KY, lost one of its treasured residents with the passing of Don Wattenbarger at the age of 81. Don's remarkable life will be remembered for his kindness, his service to others, and his dedication to helping Kentucky's children celebrate Christmas. Overcoming a childhood bout with polio, Don never let his physical difficulties stop him from helping others, and as a fellow survivor of the disease, I admire him for it.  I would especially like to remember Don's work with the Laurel County Sheriff's Department, which he joined as a part-time deputy in 1986. His official responsibilities included working as a bailiff in court, but this community will remember him for his boundless care and generosity outside of his job description. Even after his retirement in 2007, Don hardly slowed down, continuing to be a force for good in his community.  Working with the Cumberland Valley Fraternal Order of Police, Don was instrumental in leading and maintaining the Shop with a Cop program in Laurel County. Every year, Don and his wife Virginia would collect donations to help children in need have a joy-filled Christmas. It is a heart-warming program that helps so many children in this community. One of Don's friends, Karlyle Young, remembered a particular family with several children who participated in the Shop with a Cop program. Their father had recently lost his job, and money was tight around the house. The children asked if they could use some of the money to buy food, instead of Christmas toys. Don and the other volunteers collected extra donations to help buy this family food and make sure the children also received Christmas presents. Working with the sheriff's department for more than 20 years, Don helped spread Christmas cheer to more than 5,000 local children.  Don also served as a longtime board member of the Laurel County Drug Abuse Resistance Education, D.A.R.E., program, teaching children about the dangers of drug and alcohol abuse. For his dedication to this cause, North and South Laurel high schools present an annual scholarship to a graduating senior in Don's honor. He was also an active member of the local Shriner's Club, the masonic lodge, and several other service organizations that helped those in need in Laurel County.  In 2018, the city of London recognized Don's incredible lifetime of service by honoring him as a ``Living Treasure.'' His respect, compassion, and charitable nature will continue to be remembered and appreciated by the thousands of lives he made better. I would ask my Senate colleagues to join me in expressing our gratitude and deep condolences to Don's family, especially his beloved wife of 51 years Virginia, his friends, and the Laurel County community that cherished him.                          ____________________
