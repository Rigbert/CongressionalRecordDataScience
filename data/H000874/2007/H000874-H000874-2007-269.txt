 We will have another vote, and then it will be our intention to go to debate on the Transportation-HUD bill. We will go to debate after the votes until 10 o'clock. We will then end the debate on the bill at that time, have no further proceedings on the bill after 10 p.m. tonight, and go back to it tomorrow morning after 1-minutes.
