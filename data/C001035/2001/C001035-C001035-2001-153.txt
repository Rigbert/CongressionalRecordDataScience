President, today I introduce a bill to provide fair reimbursement to state and local law enforcement organizations for additional costs incurred by them in providing frequent assistance to the Secret Service to protect the President of the United States.  Of course, the Secret Service has the principal responsibility for protecting our Presidents. Without the assistance of state and local law enforcement organizations, however, providing that protection would be more costly and more difficult, if not impossible. For the most part, state and local law enforcers provide this assistance with no need for or expectation of reimbursement from the Federal government. In some cases, however, reimbursement is appropriate. It is appropriate, for example, when state and local law enforcement organizations are required to incur substantial expenses on a frequent basis in localities that are small and thus does not have adequate financial bases to provide the necessary services without reimbursement.  This is not a new idea. Dating back to at least the Administration of President Jimmy Carter, the Federal government has provided reimbursement to local and sometimes state organizations where sitting Presidents maintain a principal residence. In the early 1990s, reimbursement was provided forservices provided for then-President Bush's visits to Kennebunkport, Maine. Reimbursement is similarly available now to Crawford, Texas. The bill I am introducing will extend this authority to localities and states other than the place of principal residence when the sitting President so designates.  I envision that it will help, for example, the Kennebunkport Police Department and associated law enforcement organizations in my home state. I expect that the allure of summer in Maine will draw President George W. Bush to the Bush family residence in Kennebunkport for several visits in the coming months. My bill will help ensure that the town, with a population of only 3,720, will not have to shoulder alone the substantial financial burden associated with these visits. In addition, however, I anticipate that in the future other localities will benefit, for this bill has been carefully drafted to provide reimbursement to localities and states designated by future Presidents.  This bill will not result in an unlimited ``windfall'' to local and state law enforcement organizations. It requires that the organizations requesting reimbursement first incur the expenses and therefore will likely discourage excessive expenditures. It also limits the number of days for which reimbursements may be sought to not more than 60 days per fiscal year. In addition, it provides reimbursement only for services provided in conjunction with visits to small localities with a population of no more than 7,000 residences. Finally, the total amount of reimbursement is limited to not more than $100,000 per fiscal year.  I encourage my colleagues to support this modest, yet important and equitable provision of support to local and state law enforcement organizations.                                 ______                                       By
