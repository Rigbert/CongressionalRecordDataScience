 President, we spent nearly 6 weeks debating a bill that would help small business.  My friends on the other side of the aisle exclaimed that the bill was a jobs bill, one that would help small business--the engine of our economy.  The senior Senator from Louisiana--for whom I have great admiration as an advocate for small business--said, ``If the Democrats aren't for small business, I don't know what we're for.''  Well, the small business jobs bill was not passed by this body.  My friends on the other side will claim that Republicans blocked the bill.  But I think my friends need to look in the mirror when placing blame on their inability to govern.  Even if the small business jobs bill would have passed, the tax measures in that bill are only a drop in the bucket when it comes to the taxes and increased regulation small business is going to have to endure.  That's right, although Democratic leadership and the White House continue to say that they are for small business, any legislative measure that has been advertised as helping small business has not lived up the hype.  Let's start with the new health care reform law.  During the debate over health care reform, my friends on the other side of the aisle--including top officials in the White House--explained that the new law would provide tax credits to small business to help them pay for health insurance.  My friends said it so many times, you would almost think that the so-called tax credit was the best thing since sliced bread.  Many Democratic Senators based their vote in favor of the health care reform bill solely on the belief that the small business tax credit for health insurance would help struggling small businesses.  Well, even after the White House spent taxpayer dollars to send postcards to 4 million small businesses informing them of the so-called tax credit for health insurance, the tax credit has been a dud.  That is not according to this Senator; that is according to small business owners and brokers who are in the business of selling insurance to small business.  For example, just the other day--Thursday, July 29--the Bloomberg news organization wrote an article noting that the response to the so-called tax credit for small business ``has been cool'' according to ``health-plan brokers across the country.''  Here are some quotes from the article about the small business tax credit:  James Stenger, director of business development for Benefit-Mall, said, ``The reality is it doesn't meet the hype . . . It's had very little traction so far . . .''  Russ Childers, a broker in Americus, GA, said, ``It fell short of what was needed to help businesses.''  Todd Page, of Warrenville, IL, said, ``We've really wanted it to work, because we'd sell more . . . It just hasn't worked out, and most firms have been disappointed.''  Thomas Harte, president of Landmark Benefits, Inc., said, ``We're not seeing more people becoming insured as a result of a subsidy coming their way.''  They are not the only ones decrying the so-called tax credit for health insurance.  The chief executive officer of the largest organization representing small business--the National Federation of Independent Business--questioned the effectiveness of this tax credit.  Small business owners who also had high hopes that the credit would help them were surprised and extremely disappointed when they found out they did not qualify for the credit.  A May 20 Associated Press article chronicles these frustrations.  I would like to read one passage from the article before I move on. The article said:       Zach Hoffman was confident his small business would qualify      for a new tax cut in President Barack Obama's health care      overhaul law. But when he ran the numbers, Hoffman discovered      that his office furniture company wouldn't get any assistance      with the $79,200 it pays annually in premiums for its 24      employees. `It leaves you with this feeling of a bait-and-     switch,' he said.  Every day, I hear from Iowa small business owners who are frustrated with the so-called small business tax credit for health insurance.  I have been told that--after gathering all of the required information and paying an accounting professional to calculate all of the phaseouts and limitations--the time and cost almost outweighs any benefit for those businesses lucky enough to qualify.  Steven Yeater of Wilton, IA, the co-owner of a products finishing business, wrote me a letter telling me that the tax credit is ``(1) not well thought out or discussed, (2) ridiculously complicated for a small business owner to understand and implement, and (3) once again, Congress is over-selling/over-promising the benefits of the tax credit.''  This is just one example where the Democratic majority has failed small business.  This is one example where the Democratic majority has touted a so-called benefit for small business that did not live up to its hype.  And now, small business is faced with mounting tax increases and regulatory burdens.  What do I mean?  The new health care reform law included 20 tax increases. Thirteen of them fall on individuals and families, and 7 of them hit businesses.  These tax increases will be devastating for small business. Moreover, these tax increases far outweigh the benefit of the so-called small business tax credit for health insurance that some businesses are lucky enough to receive.  And this is not the only tax increase small business will face. When Congress returns after the August recess, we are going to debate the bipartisan tax relief that was enacted back in 2001 and 2003. That tax relief is set to expire at the end of this year unless Congress acts. Allowing the bipartisan tax relief to expire will result in the largest tax increase in our Nation's history.  My friends on the other side of the aisle have indicated that they would like to extend the bipartisan tax relief for the ``middle class.''  I want to emphasize that this means that my Democratic colleagues want to extend 80 percent of the bipartisan tax relief that they like to call the Bush tax cuts.  Actually, the only reason why they call it the Bush tax cuts is to vilify the tax relief. But my friends seem to support 80 percent of the tax cuts they enjoy vilifying so often.  Which brings me to my final point. My friends on the other side of the aisle would extend some of the tax relief but not all of it. My friends want to allow the top marginal tax rates--and a number of hidden taxes that affect these taxpayers--to expire. Why? Because my friends say the country--our Federal Government--cannot afford to give tax cuts to the ``rich.''  But, it is not the rich who are going to be burdened if the rates were allowed to expire; it is small business that will suffer.  So in closing, I refer back to the statement of the distinguished Senator from Louisiana, which was, if Democrats are not for small business, I don't know what we are for.  The Democratic leadership is not for extending all of the bipartisan tax relief. So I will leave it to others to decide whether or not my Democratic colleagues are for small business.  I ask unanimous consent to have the items to which I referred printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:     [From the Bloomberg Government in Development, July 29, 2010]     Small Business Slow To Embrace Health Tax Credits, Brokers Say                    (By David Lerman and Liz Smith)       One of the ways President Barack Obama envisioned expanding      coverage under the health overhaul was by giving small      businesses a tax credit worth tens of thousands of dollars to      help cover their employees.       Though 4 million postcards were mailed to eligible firms,      response has been cool, say health-plan brokers across the      country. The reason is that the credit starts to phase out      for companies that pay average annual wages of more than      $25,000, leaving out many businesses in higher-wage states      and discouraging others who don't think the credit will help.       ``The reality is it doesn't meet the hype,'' said James      Stenger, director of business development for BenefitMall,      which sells small-group plans in New Jersey. ``It's had very      little traction so far.''       Todd Page, vice president of sales at JLBG Health in      Warrenville, Illinois, said about 40 percent of the 460 small      businesses his firm contacted were eligible for the credit.      Only about seven would get the full benefit and be able to      claim a credit equal to 35 percent of the premiums they pay.       Independent brokers sell small-group policies from insurers      such as UnitedHealth Group Inc. and Aetna Inc. to firms with      up to 50 employees and can assess how tax incentives affect      coverage decisions.       Karen Mills, administrator of the U.S. Small Business      Administration, said complaints about the credit's limited      reach are premature.       ``I think this is all still in anecdote land,'' Mills said      in an interview. ``The math says it's likely to be      positive.''       Mills said the income cap was necessary because Congress      was intent on keeping program costs under control. ``It's      just trying to get to the people who need the help the      most.''                           Estimated Savings       The Congressional Budget Office estimates the tax credit      will save small businesses $40 billion by 2019, and Obama      said it will help millions of companies solve one of their      biggest worries: offering health insurance to their workers.       The plan is intended for enterprises such as independent      printers, mechanics shops and restaurants, which lack the      negotiating power that big companies have with insurers. The      biggest breaks go to the smallest, least-wealthy workforces      under the plan.                           Targeted Employers       The Internal Revenue Service said the plan is for employers      who pay at least half the cost of individual coverage for      their employees in 2010. From 2010 to 2013, the maximum      credit goes to companies with 10 or fewer full-time employees      that pay annual average wages of $25,000 or less.       The credit is completely phased out for employers that have      25 or more workers or that pay average wages of $50,000 a      year or more. Because eligibility rules are partly     based on the number of employees, brokers complain that the      tax break diminishes relatively quickly. For example, a firm      with 14 workers that pays an average of $30,000 gets to claim      a credit worth 19 percent of premiums paid.       The Obama administration said the program can help as many      as two thirds of the nation's 6 million small businesses,      based on Small Business Administration figures.       ``It's worth perhaps tens of thousands of dollars to your      companies,'' Obama said in a May 25 speech at the White      House. ``And it will provide welcome relief to small business      owners, who all too often have to choose between hiring or      keeping your health care for yourselves and your workers.''       Mills said ``a huge proportion'' of these small businesses      haven't been able to afford insurance or get access to it.       ``This could very well tip the scales for some of them,''      she said.                             Cost of Living       Many businesses who buy small-group health insurance have      10 or fewer employees. Most won't enjoy anything close to      that 35 percent maximum credit because they pay more than      $25,000 in average wages, the brokers said.       Stenger said the average family plan in New Jersey costs      $1,500 to $1,800 a month. So a tax break that ends up cutting      premium costs by 10 percent, for example, wouldn't induce      firms to start offering coverage.       ``The impact is a lot less than the crafters of this      provision thought it would be, at least in New Jersey,'' he      said.                            `Bleeding Wound'       Brokers in other regions said the income issue isn't      isolated to high-cost states like New Jersey.       ``The income hurts the worst,'' said Russ Childers, a      broker in Americus, Georgia. ``It fell short of what was      needed to help businesses.''       The National Federation of Independent Business, a small-     business lobbying group, disputed the administration's      estimates for how many businesses will benefit.       ``It's the equivalent of putting a band aid on a profusely      bleeding wound,'' said Michelle Dimarob, head of legislative      affairs for the federation. ``It won't solve the number-one      problem for small businesses.''       The group in May joined Florida's legal challenge to the      health-care reform law, becoming the first private      organization seeking to overturn the measure.       Some 46 percent of companies have fewer than 10 workers,      and many of those businesses insure only owners' families,      Dimarob said. The credit, which expires in its current form      in 2014 and fully in 2016, isn't likely to change this, she      said. The credit can increase to 50 percent for the last two      years if owners purchase insurance through a state exchange.                           Michigan Insurers       Insurers in Michigan are scaling back attempts to sell to      small businesses, said Steven Selinsky, the incoming      president of his industry's trade group, the National      Association of Health Underwriters. Selinsky closed his      agency that sold small-group health insurance.       ``After the economy collapsed, people just weren't      purchasing,'' said Selinsky, who now works for BeneSys Inc.,      a third-party insurance administrator for unions. ``It's just      not doing what we had hoped.''       Page, the Illinois broker, said his staff has provided 61      new quotes for potential clients and has sold two new      policies to that group.       ``We've really wanted it to work, because we'd sell more,''      said Page, whose clients include doctors' offices and auto-     body repair shops. ``It just hasn't worked out, and most      firms have been disappointed.''       Thomas Harte, president of Landmark Benefits Inc., who      serves about 400 employers in New Hampshire and      Massachusetts, said he hadn't come across any clients      eligible for the tax credit. He has a long list of customers      that exceed allowable income thresholds, or who have too many      full-time workers.       ``We're not seeing more people becoming insured as a result      of a subsidy coming their way.''                            Blue Cross Gains       One exception to the experience of many insurance brokers      has been Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City, which      started an intensive advertising campaign to promote the tax      credit when the law was enacted.       The group sold 227 plans to small businesses in the past      three months--an 80 percent increase in sales compared with a      normal three-month period, said Tom Bowser, chief executive      officer.       Even with the added business, Bowser said most small      businesses in the Kansas City market don't qualify for the      tax credit. Of the firms with fewer than 25 employees, no      more than a quarter of them qualify, he said.                             Help for Idaho       The credit has potential to help in Idaho because its      economy is dominated by small businesses averaging eight      workers, said Scott Leavitt, owner of an insurance brokerage      in Boise and the immediate past president of the health      underwriters association. On the other hand, Idaho's average      per capita income is $33,000, and more than $35,000 for his      block of customers, he said.       About a quarter of his clients could see some relief,      though it would only be significant for 12 percent, he said.       Administration officials say they expect more businesses to      warm to the incentives.       ``These tax credits will make it easier for small      businesses to give their workers the insurance they need,''      said Nicholas Papas, a spokesman for the White House. ``We're      working diligently to ensure small businesses know about this      credit.''       ``Small businesses are looking into it because they're not      dumb,'' Mills of the Small Business Administration said.      ``People want to provide health insurance. The reason is      they're losing good employees when they don't.''                                  ____            Fact Check: Tax Cut Math Doesn't Add Up for Some Fact Check: `Broad' Health Care Tax Cut for Small Business Leaves Out                              Some Companies         (By Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar, Associated Press Writer)       Washington (AP).--Zach Hoffman was confident his small      business would qualify for a new tax cut in President Barack      Obama's health care overhaul law.       But when he ran the numbers, Hoffman discovered that his      office furniture company wouldn't get any assistance with the      $79,200 it pays annually in premiums for its 24 employees.      ``It leaves you with this feeling of a bait-and-switch,'' he      said.       When the administration unveiled the small business tax      credit earlier this week, officials touted its ``broad      eligibility'' for companies with fewer than 25 workers and      average annual wages under $50,000 that provide health      coverage. Hoffman's workers earn an average of $35,000 a      year, which makes it all the more difficult to understand why      his company didn't qualify.       Lost in the fine print: The credit drops off sharply once a      company gets above 10 workers and $25,000 average annual      wages.       It's an example of how the early provisions of the health      care law can create winners and losers among groups lawmakers      intended to help--people with health problems, families with      young adult children and small businesses. Because of the      law's complexity, not everyone in a broadly similar situation      will benefit.       Consider small businesses: ``The idea here is to target the      credits to a relatively low number of firms, those who are      low-wage and really quite small,'' said economist Linda      Blumberg of the Urban Institute public policy center.       On paper, the credit seems to be available to companies      with fewer than 25 workers and average wages of $50,000. But      in practice, a complicated formula that combines the two      numbers works against companies that have more than 10      workers and $25,000 in average wages, Blumberg said.       ``You can get zero even if you are not hitting the max on      both pieces,'' Blumberg said.       Hoffman used an online calculator to figure his company's      eligibility. At least three are available: from the House      Energy and Commerce Committee, which helped write the      legislation; from the progressive Center for American      Progress; and from the National Federation of Independent      Business, which is seeking to overturn the law in federal      court. All produced the same result.       ``I think (the administration's) intentions are good, but      the numbers and applications don't come out to what they      intend,'' said Hoffman, part owner of Wiley Office Furniture,      a third-generation family business in Springfield, Ill.       The Treasury Department, which administers the new credit,      did not dispute the calculations.       ``The small-business tax credit was designed to provide the      greatest benefit to employers that currently have the hardest      time providing health insurance for their workers--small,      low-wage firms,'' said Michael Mundaca, assistant secretary      for tax policy. ``Small employers face higher premiums and      higher administrative costs than large firms and in many      cases cannot afford to provide coverage.''       Small business owners are a pivotal constituency in the      fall congressional elections, and Democrats are battling to      win them over. Major benefits of the health care law--     competitive insurance markets, more stable premiums and a ban      on denying coverage to those in poor health--don't take      effect until 2014. But the health care credit is available      starting this year.       It can be a boon for smaller companies paying lower wages.      Betsy Burton, owner of The King's English Bookshop in Salt      Lake City, estimates that she will get a credit of roughly      $21,000 against premiums of about $67,800. She has 11 full-     time equivalent employees averaging $26,100.       ``What it means is that I can afford to carry this      insurance and insure people's families,'' said Burton. ``I      was afraid that we were fast approaching a time when I would      have to choose between insuring my employees and closing my      doors.''       Burton believes offering health insurance is the right      thing for an employer to do--and also makes good business      sense because it helps her retain valued employees. Except at      the beginning, she has provided coverage for most of the 33      years the bookstore has been in business.       Slightly more than a third of companies with fewer than 10      employees offered coverage in 2008, down about 10 percent      since the start of the decade, according to an Urban      Institute analysis.       Hoffman, the furniture store owner whose business missed      out on the credit, says he understands that lawmakers writing      the     health care legislation had a limited amount of money to work      with. But his company's premiums rose 15 percent this year,      and it's a struggle to keep paying.       To get the most out of the new federal credit, Hoffman said      he'd have to cut his work force to 10 employees and slash      their wages.       ``That seems like a strange outcome, given we've got 10      percent unemployment,'' he said.                                  ____       Dear Mr. Wyatt: I am contacting you as I believe you are      the individual who assists Sen. Grassley on tax matters      connected to his Senate Finance Committee position.       I am writing you to comment on the Small Business Health      Care Tax Credit.       Some brief background about our company:       We are a small manufacturer of abrasives in Wilton, IA,      currently employing 17 full-time people.       Our major competitors are the Chinese, Korean, and Japanese      sandpaper manufacturers and the recession has hit us hard.       We provide some of the following historical benefits to our      employees:       We pay 100% of all employees' health insurance premiums;       We provide $40,000 of life insurance to each employee;       We contribute approximately 14% of each employee's      compensation into a profit-plan for their retirement;       Paid vacation;       Approximately 2 weeks paid time off during Christmas which      does not count against an employee's vacation time;       What the recession has done to us:       Like many small businesses, we are losing money;       This has caused us to hire some workers through a local      temporary business to replace full-time employees as we have      turnover and as we try to expand into other areas to keep our      business going;       For the last 2 years we have only been able to contribute      the 3% safe harbor to the profit-sharing plan (for at least      the prior decade we contributed the full roughly 14% of      compensation to the profit-sharing plan);       We were forced to change the safe harbor profit-sharing      contribution from a 3% mandatory to a matching type plan      since a few of the temporary workers will have met the 1,000      hours/12 month rule--essentially punishing the full-time work      force as we don't have the discretionary cash to make the      contributions for the temps (a whole other tax issue for      small businesses); and       We have continually had to reduce some health benefits (via      increasing deductible to $1,000; however, we continue to pay      100% of the premium cost).       Now back to the Small Business Health Care Tax Credit.       Early on I had high hopes that the credit would be quite      helpful in defraying the health care premium costs. We      currently pay $11,410.39 per month in Wellmark BCBS premiums      (nine on the single plan at $413.67/month and eight on the      family plan at $960.92/month) for a total annual premium cost      of $136,924.68; and this is before anyone gets sick as we      self-insure for the co-insurance. Our annual premium increase      will be communicated to us by Wellmark about August and I      anticipate another 20+% jump.       However, now some of the details of the credit are leaking      out. Today I received the attached letter from our CPA firm,      RSM McGladrey. I point you to the limitations and phase-out      of the credit. Are you kidding me? By the time I gather all      the required information, pay RSM McGladrey to calculate all      the phase-outs, the resulting credit will not even cover the      expected annual premium increase from BCBS!       What small business is this helping? This is about like all      the back to work credits, or whatever they are called, which      we concluded with RSM McGladrey are not worth the manpower      costs to fully investigate and gather the information.       This credit is worthless. If Congress thinks this is going      to encourage small businesses to keep providing health care      for their employees, they are grossly mistaken. It just isn't      meaningful enough to even enter into the equation in making a      decision of what to do for my employees.       Effective today, we can no longer hire someone and provide      them with subsidized health insurance beyond what is required      by law. We hope to continue with existing employees, but      clearly, with what little bit I know about the Health Care      Act, come 2014 we are dropping our health plan; if not      sooner.       I would hope as Senator Grassley's Finance Committee tax      assistant, someone who would understand ``the devil in the      details'', you will pass on to him my frustrations. Such      frustrations with respect to the Small Business Health Care      Tax Credit being, but not limited to: (1) not well thought      out or discussed; (2) ridiculously complex for a small      business to understand and implement; and (3) once again,      Congress' over selling/promising the benefit of.       I would greatly appreciate if you would convey my thoughts      on this matter to Senator Grassley to help him understand      what is happening with small business on this issue.           Sincerely,                                                 Steven D. Yeater,     Co-Owner.                          ____________________
