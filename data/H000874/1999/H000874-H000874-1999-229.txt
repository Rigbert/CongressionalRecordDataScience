 Yesterday, last night, shamefully the House of Representatives voted to do nothing. It sent an uncertain trumpet, not only to our NATO allies, but to one of the evils of this world: Slobodan Milosevic.  Let me read from a speech given by John McCain, not a member of my party, but one of this body, the Congress of the United States, that knows about war and knows about the American interest, not the partisan political interest. He said this:  Let me close by saying that both the Congress and the administration must show resolve and the confidence of a superpower. Our cause is just, and our early success is imperative. Let us keep our nerve and see the things through to the end. No matter how awful the images of war appear on television, the cost of failure, John McCain said correctly, are infinitely greater than the price of victory.  Madam Speaker, we failed last night. Let us not fail in the days ahead.                          ____________________
