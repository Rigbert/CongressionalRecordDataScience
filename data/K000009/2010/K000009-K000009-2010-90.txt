It was reported this month that Goldman Sachs, the favored Wall Street firm that has way too much special access in this city and that got bailed out by the American people to the tune of billions and is now handing those over in bonuses to their executives, has paid a net effective tax rate of 1 percent. You heard me right--1 percent, Goldman Sachs.  When most small businesses and corporations in this country are paying at a 35 percent tax rate, Wall Street's elites still don't carry their fair share. Imagine that secretaries, nurses, firefighters, cleaning crews--the middle class of this country--pay at a higher rate than Goldman Sachs.  Meanwhile, the chief executive officer of Goldman Sachs, Mr. Lloyd Blankfein, harvested over $140 million in salary as head of that firm. When he was asked, Well, isn't this a bit too much? His answer was that he's doing God's work. I call that blasphemy.  This is fundamental economic injustice in America, and the American people know it. They're voting their frustration. They expect Congress to listen to them, not to continue to reward Wall Street's overprivileged scions at their expense.                          Bill Moyers Journal                            (By Bill Moyers)       The ancient Romans had a proverb: ``Monday is like sea      water. The more you drink, the thirstier you become.'' That      adage finds particular meaning today on Wall Street, which      began this New Year riding a tidal wave of bonuses in a      surging ocean of greed.       Thanks to taxpayers like you who generously bailed banking      from the financial shipwreck it created for itself and for      us, by the end of 2009 the industry's compensation pool      reached nearly $200 billion. And despite windfall profits,      the banks will claim almost $80 billion in tax deductions.      And nearly $20 billion of those deductions will go to just      three institutions--Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan Chase, and      Goldman Sachs.       Ah, yes--Goldman Sachs, that paragon of profit and      probity--which bet big on the housing bubble and when it      popped--presto!--converted itself from an investment firm      into a bank so it could get your bailout money. Now consider      this: In 2008, Goldman Sachs paid an effective tax rate of      just one percent. I'm not making that up--one percent!--while      their CEO Lloyd Blankfein     pulled down over $40 million. That's God's work, if you can      get it. And, believe me, Wall Street bankers know how to get      it.                          ____________________
