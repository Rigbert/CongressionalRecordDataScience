 President, what our amendment simply does is provide an additional $100 million for counseling so families do not go into foreclosure. There is $15 billion in spending in this underlying bill, all of which is being declared an emergency. It seems to me that $100 million of it, which is a small additional amount compared to that $15 billion, that we know has a 96-percent success rate of keeping families in their home so they do not go into foreclosure, is a very smart investment.  I think it would be very foolish to block this on a budget point of order because it is one of the few issues in this bill that will actually keep people in their homes and prevent this crisis from getting larger.  I urge my colleagues to vote against the budget point of order.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island be listed as a cosponsor of this amendment.
