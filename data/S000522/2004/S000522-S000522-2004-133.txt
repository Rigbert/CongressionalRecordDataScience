Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 462) reaffirming unwavering commitment to the Taiwan Relations Act, and for other purposes.  The Clerk read as follows:                            H. Con. Res. 462       Whereas April 10, 2004, marked the 25th anniversary of the      enactment of the Taiwan Relations Act (22 U.S.C. 3301 et      seq.), codifying in law the basis for continued commercial,      cultural, and other relations between the United States and      Taiwan;       Whereas it is and will continue to be United States policy      to further encourage and expand these extensive commercial,      cultural, and other relations between the people of the      United States and the people of Taiwan during the next      quarter century;       Whereas since its enactment in 1979 the Taiwan Relations      Act has been instrumental in maintaining peace, security, and      stability in the Taiwan Strait;       Whereas when the Taiwan Relations Act was enacted, it      affirmed that the decision of the United States to establish      diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China was      based on the expectation that the future of Taiwan would be      determined by peaceful means;       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China      refuses to renounce the use of force against Taiwan;       Whereas the Department of Defense report entitled ``Annual      Report on the Military Power of the People's Republic of      China,'' dated July 30, 2003, documents that the Government      of the People's Republic of China is seeking coercive      military options to resolve the Taiwan issue and, as of the      date of the report, has deployed approximately 450 short-     range ballistic missiles against Taiwan and is adding 75      missiles per year to this arsenal;       Whereas the escalating arms buildup of missiles and other      offensive weapons by the People's Republic of China in areas      adjacent to the Taiwan Strait is a threat to the peace and      security of the Western Pacific area;       Whereas section 3 of the Taiwan Relations Act (22 U.S.C.      3302) requires that the United States Government will make      available defense articles and defense services in such      quantity as may be necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a      sufficient self-defense capability;       Whereas the Taiwan Relations Act requires the United States      to maintain the capacity to resist any resort to force or      other forms of coercion that would jeopardize the security,      or the social or economic system, of the people of Taiwan;       Whereas the Taiwan Relations Act affirms the preservation      and enhancement of the human rights of the people of Taiwan      as an objective of the United States;       Whereas Taiwan serves as a model of democratic reform for      the People's Republic of China;       Whereas Taiwan's 1996 election was the first time in five      millennia of recorded Chinese history that a democratically      elected president took office;       Whereas Taiwan's democracy has deepened with a peaceful      transfer of power from one political party to another after      the presidential election of 2000;       Whereas the relationship between the United States and      Taiwan has deepened with Taiwan's evolution into a full-     fledged, multi-party democracy that respects human rights and      civil liberties;       Whereas high-level visits between government officials of      the United States and Taiwan are not inconsistent with the      ``one China policy''; and       Whereas any attempt to determine Taiwan's future by other      than peaceful means and other than with the express consent      of the people of Taiwan would be considered of grave concern      to the United States: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate      concurring), That--       (1) Congress reaffirms its unwavering commitment to the      Taiwan Relations Act (22 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.) as the      cornerstone of United States relations with Taiwan;       (2) the military modernization and weapons procurement      program of the People's Republic of China is a matter of      grave concern, and particularly the current deployment of      approximately 500 missiles directed toward Taiwan;       (3) the President should direct all appropriate United      States Government officials to raise these grave concerns      regarding military threats to Taiwan with officials of the      Government of the People's Republic of China;       (4) the President and Congress should determine whether the      escalating arms buildup, including deployment of offensive      weaponry and missiles in areas adjacent to the Taiwan Strait,      requires that additional defense articles and services be      made available to Taiwan, and the United States Government      should encourage the leadership of Taiwan to devote      sufficient financial resources to the defense of their      island;       (5) as recommended by the U.S.-China Economic and Security      Review Commission, the Department of Defense should provide a      comprehensive report on the nature and scope of military      sales by the Russian Federation to the People's Republic of      China to the Committees on International Relations and Armed      Services of the House of Representatives and Committees on      Foreign Relations and Armed Services of the Senate;       (6) the President should encourage further dialogue between      democratic Taiwan and the People's Republic of China; and       (7) the United States Government should not discourage      current officials of the Taiwan Government from visiting the      United States on the basis that doing so would violate the      ``one China policy''.
