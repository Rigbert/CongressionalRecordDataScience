I remember a meeting we had about a year ago on this issue, and he continues to press ahead, which I appreciate.  I certainly will continue to work with him on the development of lithium ion battery technology and promote battery safety as an important part of this research, and I appreciate the gentleman's concern, as well as his good work.  Mr. Chairman, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.
