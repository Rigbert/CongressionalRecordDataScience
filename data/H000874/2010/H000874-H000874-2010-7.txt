That will happen tomorrow at midnight.  We have been in constant communication with the United States Senate, and we are not exactly sure what they are going to pass and, more importantly, when they are going to pass it. As a result, we are confronted with the challenge of ensuring that we have passed a document which will ensure that government does not shut down tomorrow night.  Therefore, it is our intent at this point in time to recess to go to the Rules Committee to obtain a short-term CR, for 3 days, until Tuesday night.  Now, there is a lot of grumbling on my side, and I appreciate your courtesy on your side. But having said that, I know there are at least 434 of my colleagues who are not happy about anything right now, and I want you to know I will make that a unanimous judgment. I am not happy, either. But we are in the place where we have a responsibility and we have not yet completed it, for whatever reason. There is a lot of blame to go around, but the fact is we are not where we need to be.  So when we come back from recess--it will take probably 1\1/2\, 2 hours, let's say we come back at 3:30 or 4 o'clock to consider this short-term CR which will get us through whatever the Senate isor is not going to do, I will then hope to be able to announce at that point in time the further schedule for tonight and/or tomorrow; and we would like to preclude the necessity to come back next week. I think that would be consistent--even my side would not grumble at that proposition.  So that's what we are trying to do. I hope you will bear with me. You understand the problem that we are having. It is not a new problem; it exists all the time.  So we are going to recess now. We will come back within a short period of time to do this short-term CR, which will be a simple CR simply extending us through Tuesday. Then at 4 o'clock, we will try to have some more information from the Senate. I will be in communication with Mr. Cantor and Mr. Boehner's office. I talked to Mr. Cantor's floor person about this and Mr. McCarthy about this, and we will have better information at 4 o'clock. I would urge all of you to stay here.  I know that everybody wants to get home. I want to get home myself. I don't live far from here, about an hour; but I have not been by my house and haven't decorated a single--as all of you know, I live alone and, therefore, it's up to me and I haven't been there so it's not done. So I want to get home just like you do.  So bear with us. This is our responsibility. We have two Houses; we've got to agree. So we will let you know at 4 o'clock as we begin the CR where we're going from there and try to have some final word.  Thank you very much.                          ____________________
