 After 38 years at the forefront of Kentucky's racing community, Mr. Williams has left a legacy worthy of the champion thoroughbred horses who have won there, and the entire State wishes him well as he retires from the job he loves.  Keeneland racetrack is located in the beautiful Bluegrass region of Kentucky. Since 1936 Keeneland has operated two meets per year, every April and October. For nearly 40 of those years, Mr. Williams has helped transform what was once a small racetrackthat began on a local farm into a premier equestrian facility.  Mr. Williams's passion and dedication for Keeneland and horse racing began when he was just a boy, when he moved to Lexington and attended his first race at Keeneland. Since that first race, Mr. Williams has been in attendance at a majority of Keeneland's races.  Mr. Williams has had the opportunity to serve under three Keeneland presidents: Mr. Ted Bassett, Mr. Bill Greely and the current CEO, Mr. Nick Nicholson. Mr. Nicholson spoke dearly of Jim when asked to reflect on his service. In a recent article in the Lexington Herald-Leader, he said:       To put Jim's tenure in perspective, when he joined      Keeneland in 1971, Richard Nixon was president, ``All in the      Family'' premiered on television, and gas was 30 cents a      gallon. Since that time, Jim has been the public face of      Keeneland, and he has conducted himself in a manner that has      enhanced Keeneland's stature in the eyes of everyone who has      had the pleasure of meeting him. Jim is a man of character,      integrity and humility. We at Keeneland thank him for his      many years of service and wish him the best in his      retirement.  Jim Williams is a legend in Kentucky horse racing and his contributions to the Commonwealth's most hallowed sport are immeasurable. His retirement is going to leave a large hole that will be very hard to fill. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Jim Williams for his 38 years of service to Keeneland and to Kentucky horse racing.                          ____________________
