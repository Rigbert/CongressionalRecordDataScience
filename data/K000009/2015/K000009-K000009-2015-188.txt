Speaker, I rise today to join the men and women of Local 50 of the United Association of Journeymen Plumbers, Steamfitters and Service Mechanics' 125th anniversary. I join in the union's celebration and add my congratulations to the chorus in recognizing this remarkable milestone event.  The union's original 37 members were granted a charter on December 1, 1890 after previous association with the International Association. Aggressive organizing efforts brought the city's pipe craftsmen together and the union grew to nearly 90 members by 1897. During this time the local worked not only to increase its membership, but also the wages of its members who had been earning on average 30 cents an hour in a sixty hour work week.  The Local's history reports that one of its first major construction projects was the Nasby Building, Toledo's first skyscraper at six stories tall. By the end of its first decade, Local 50 craftsmen also helped to build Toledo landmarks the Gardner Building, the Spitzer Building and the Lucas County Courthouse. During this time of its initial establishment and growth, the Local's history explains that its leadership was able to work with are contractors and business owners while adhering to its primary objective: ``Solidarity among workers for the benefit of all.''  As the new century dawned, there were rivalries between the UA and other unions which ultimately weakened the relationship between Local 50 and contractors and resulted in wage and overtime differentials among the crafts. However, these early power struggles eventually served to strengthen Local 50, which emerged from the battles a strong and powerful leader in Toledo's labor movement.  Through World War I, fears of Communist infiltration, tensions between management and labor, violent strikes, Prohibition and the Great Depression, Local 50 suffered, but survived. Then came the 1934 Electric Auto-Lite Strike. The Local 50 history notes, `` `The outcome of the Auto-Lite Strike strengthened the Toledo Central Labor Union, its affiliate locals and the Lucas County Unemployed League, leading to further organizing activity in the city.' The strike also led to the creation of the Toledo Industrial Peace Board, which would go on to become a national model for strike resolution.''  President Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal saved Local 50. Its members were employed by many of the public works building efforts the New Deal initiated, including the city's Collins Park Water Treatment Plant, completed in 1941 and still operating in testament to the members' skills. World War II brought increased work and technological and training improvements.  As the union grew, progressive changes were initiated for its membership. The Health and Welfare Fund was created in 1952 followed by pension, holiday and retirement plans. Beginning in the 1950s, the union's membership was kept busy with many new buildings going up along Toledo's downtown skyline and new buildings at the University of Toledo. In 1970, the members of Local 50 began the biggest project in its history: the building of the Davis-Besse nuclear power plant. The history reports that during the eight-year building project, ``Local 50 members dismantled and rebuilt components of nearly every piping system installed in the plant.''  Local 50 then joined with other unions in the Northwest Ohio Building Trades to strengthen further its efforts on behalf of its membership. This coalition was crucial to the unions during the economic downturn of the 1980s and the subsequent fallout of the challenges to working families brought by that economy. The Local's history explains the union was able to remain strong ``by `drawing on the highest traditions of craft unionism and moral guidance provided by the hearts and minds of its membership.' The 1990s saw the centennial celebration of Local 50 as well as employment in large construction projects and a renewed emphasis on continual training. As the new century began, the jobs were still going strong. A new union hall and training center opened on August 12, 2003 with a state-of-the-art training center completed in 2009. Through the first years of the 21st Century, Local 50 members were again an integral part of major building efforts at universities, industries and public construction in our region.  The January 4, 2000 edition of ``The Pipe Line'' Voice of the Building Trades printed this truth which summarizes the U.S. labor movement and the journey of Local 50: ``When Local 50 was born, there were no pensions, no hospitalization, no scholarships, no picnics, no dinner dances, no apprenticeships, no Journeyman training and no credit union. Each of these benefits grew through struggle and dedication. `We stand on the shoulders of those who came before.' I don't know who said this, but it is certainly true of Local 50 . . . Over the last 100 years, labor has changed the face of this nation. We have weekends, Social Security, living wages, Health and Welfare, pensions, 8 hour days, safety provisions, and other benefits which are a direct result of labor's struggles.''  I am reminded of labor leader Richard Trumka's statement that ``There is nothing stronger than the American labor movement. United, we cannot and we will not be turned aside. We'll work for it, sisters and brothers. We'll stand for it. Together. Each of us. To bring out the best in America. To bring out the best in ourselves, and each other.'' The brothers and sisters of Local 50 in Northwest Ohio have done just this for 125 years, helping to create the middle class and bringing out the best that is in us. United, its members have stood strong over three centuries. United, its members will stand strong and in solidarity in the centuries to come.                          ____________________
