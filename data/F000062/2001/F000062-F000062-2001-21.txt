  On October 7, 2001 at Pacific Bell Park in San Francisco, Barry Bonds hit his 73rd home run, setting a new record for most home runs in a season, eclipsing the previous mark of 70 set by Mark McGwire of the St. Louis Cardinals in 1998. In addition, during the 2001 campaign Barry Bonds set records for slugging percentage, 16 points above the previous mark, and most walks in a season, surpassing the feats of the immortal Babe Ruth.  Barry Bonds' outstanding play on the field added to what was already a Hall of Fame career: 3 Most Valuable Player awards, 567 career home runs, 7th on the all-time list, the only player with more than 400 home runs and 400 stolen bases, 10 All-Star Game appearances, 8 Gold Glove awards, and the Sporting News' Player of the Decade for the 1990s.  As a native San Franciscan and life-long San Francisco Giants fan, I could not be prouder of Barry Bonds. His roots in California and the Bay Area run deep. Born in Riverside, he grew up in San Mateo and attended Sierra High School. After attending Arizona State University and beginning his career with the Pittsburgh Pirates, Barry Bonds returned to his hometown team, the Giants, in 1993.  No one should be surprised that Barry Bonds has reached the elite level of baseball players. After all, he is the son of former major league star and San Francisco Giant, Bobby Bonds, and the godson of perhaps the greatest living ball player, the great Willie Mays.  His exploits in baseball are matched by his dedication to the community off the field. Seven years ago he founded the Barry Bonds Family Foundation, headed by his mother, Pat Bonds. The Foundation supports activities and programs opportunities of African American youth in the Bay Area. Barry Bonds and his Foundation are particularly involved in the United Way's ``Link and Learn'', a program dedicated to raising student achievement through greater parental involvement, access to tutoring and interactive technology.  All baseball fans, even those of the Los Angeles Dodgers, can appreciate Barry Bonds' breathtaking skill, record setting performance, and commitment to his community. During a difficult time for our country, he gave us a reason to return to the ballpark and cheer him on the way to a new home run record. All over the country, fans rose from their seats for every at-bat, celebrated each home run, and even booed their own teams when they intentially walked him.  At 37 years old, he is in the prime of his baseball career and I am sure he will amaze and dazzle us many more times in the future.  Again, I congratulate Barry Bonds for his season and thank him for all that he has done for baseball and his community. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.                          ____________________
