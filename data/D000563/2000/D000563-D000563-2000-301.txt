This was going to be done without any discussion, any debate, $750 billion in tax breaks.  I ask my colleague, the Senator from North Dakota, whether or not he believes it also says something about the priorities of the Congress, that of all the different people who could be helped by this Congress, the highest, the single most important priority for the Republicans turns out to be the wealthiest. When it comes to helping people pay for their prescription drugs, when it comes to helping people, dealing with areas such as difficulties with HMOs, folks don't even have a voice in this debate. They are not even being considered.  Would the Senator address the whole question of prioritization, as to whether or not we are making the right decision in terms of helping the people who really need it the most in this country?
