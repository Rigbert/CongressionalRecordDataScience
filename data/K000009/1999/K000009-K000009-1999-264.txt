Speaker, I rise to recognize Richard C. Blake of Toledo, OH, a man of great stature and kindest heart, who passed from this life on June 4, 1999. I came to know Dick and his family through his passionate commitment to the credit union movement to which, as his family noted, he ``dedicated 52 years . . . as both his vocation and avocation.''  Employed by the former Champion Spark Plug in Toledo, Dick was a member of the Champion Credit Union. He served in many of the credit union's leadership positions over 37 years, including membership on the board of directors, on the Credit and Supervisory Committees, board president, and treasurer/CEO. Not limiting his involvement in promoting credit unions to just the Champion Credit Union, Dick rose to the highest levels of the movement. He served as president of the Toledo Chapter of Credit Unions, chairman of the board and director emeritus of the Ohio Credit Union League, and director of the Credit Union National Association.  Dick also focused his time on community involvement, and was a past master of Toledo-Fort Industry Lodge #144; past patron of Fort Industry Chapter #391; a member of the Scottish Rite; and a member of the Adams Township American Legion Post. He also was a member of the Loyal Order of Moose Lodge #1610 and served on the finance committee of his church, Zion United Methodist. A water enthusiast, Dick belonged to the Toledo Yacht Club, Oak Harbor Long Beach Association, and the Coral Cay Association in Florida.  Dick's passing leaves a void in our community, but much more importantly within his loving family. Our heartfelt condolences to his wife of 57 years, Helen, and his children Becky, Kathy, and Bill, his eight grandchildren and five great-grandchildren. Dick has touched the lives of thousands of people and made our community and country a more humane nation. We all are grateful for the privilege of knowing him.                          ____________________
