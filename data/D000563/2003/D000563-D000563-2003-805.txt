We talked about the complications she faced. It was interesting to me that as I told her tragic story--I wonder if the Senator from California is aware of the fact--the Senator from Pennsylvania took the floor and said that, in his opinion, she did not face a medical crisis in her pregnancy. I wonder if the Senator from Pennsylvania or the Senator from California are aware of the fact that at 32 weeks in her pregnancy an ultrasound disclosed that her son had nine major anomalies, including a fluid-filled cranium with no brain tissue at all; compacted, flattened congenital hip dysplasia; and skeletal dysplasia; and hypertoloric eyes, and he would never have survived outside the womb.  I wonder if the Senator believes it is within our purview, within our authority and knowledge, to judge that that terrible outcome in a pregnancy was not a medical crisis.
