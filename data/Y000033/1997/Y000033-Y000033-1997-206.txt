Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my good friend, the gentleman from North Carolina [Mr. Coble], for yielding me this time and for working so hard. I do believe I had something to do with this working on a compromise between the gentleman from Montana [Mr. Hill], and of course the chairman of the committee itself.  I strongly support H.R. 908, but I want to talk about the ninth circuit itself. It is an empire. A lot of people do not understand this. It covers a land mass the size of Western Europe, including nine States and two territories. It serves over 15 million people, more than our largest city, larger than New York or Los Angeles. It is a monstrous responsibility, and it is a court that is overburdened at this time.  If I can say another thing about Alaska. Sometimes I think one of the reasons it is overburdened is they take cases that mean very little. We have a highway that we would like to extend 2\1/2\ miles, that everybody agrees with in the State of Alaska, including the State itself and all those people in the small community, with a railroad that goes through a tunnel at this time. And because the trustees of Alaska filed a suit, the ninth circuit decided to hold up construction for 6 months.  Now, this is an example of a court being out of touch with the people of America and the people they represent. Not judicially. They had to review.  So I suggest one thing. I would like to split the court. This bill does not do that. I am the extreme. I think the court should be split at this time so it serves the people as a whole, not to guard massive cities. But I cannot do this.  So this bill right now is a compromise to set up the commission to establish what I think they will find out, that I am correct, that the court should be split. It is the right thing, and I urge the passage of this legislation.
