Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend Turkey's Parliament and Prime Minister Ciller for taking an important step towards strengthening democracy. On Sunday, July 23, Turkey's Parliament approved 16 constitutional amendments which are part of a democratization plan introduced last year. The Parliament also agreed to resume work in September on amending article 8 of the Anti-Terror Law, which is widely used to criminalize anti-government and pro-Kurdish expressions. These reforms are considered prerequisites to Turkey's acceptance into a European Union customs agreement this fall. Mr. Speaker, I am very encouraged by the fact that the amendments were adopted by a vote of 360-32 after weeks of tumultuous debate.  These amendments are significant for the cause of democracy in Turkey. Their passage marks the first time the civilian government in Turkey has altered the 1982 constitution promulgated by the military. Prime Minister Ciller and the junior coalition partner, Republican Peoples Party deserve much praise for standing by the legislation despite strong opposition from Islamic and nationalist parties.  More specifically, Mr. Speaker, the amendments will broaden political participation by lowering the voting age from 20 to 18; adding 100 seats to the 450 seat Parliament; enabling MPs to switch parties; and allowing trade unions, student associations and other groups to engage in political activities. Language in the constitution praising the 1980 military takeover was also removed.  As I have said in the past, Mr. Speaker, it is in our Nation's best interest to maintain close relations with a stable, democratic Turkey. These amendments, and other efforts in the future, will place our bilateral relations on a much more firm footing. While there is more that needs to be done to address free speech issues and the situation of Turkey's Kurdish population, adoption of these amendments by such a wide margin indicates a commitment and willingness in the Parliament to move forward along this path.  Mr. Speaker, as someone who has spoken out in the past against actions taken by the Government of Turkey, I believe it is important to give the Turkish Government credit where credit is due. Reaction in the Turkish press to the amendments was resoundingly positive and public opinion is also likely to view the reforms in a positive light. Given this set of circumstances, I strongly encourage the Turkish MPs to immediately seize upon the momentum of this impressive showing and press on for further reforms.  Last week, Mr. Speaker, it looked as though partisan politics in Turkey would block the passage of any democratic reforms. Successful adoption of the amendments, though, has breathed new life into the reform debate underway in Turkey. Mr. Speaker, I believe that all who are concerned about human rights and regional stability should express support for the continued efforts of Turkey's Parliament and Government to continue this important process.                          ____________________
