President, I thank the distinguished Senator from California. I have had a chance to work with the Senator on this amendment. It is an extremely important amendment. I have spent decades on the question of landmines. We use the Leahy War Victims Fund in parts of the world to aid landmine victims. I have visited these field hospitals. I have seen the damage, usually to children, overwhelmingly to civilians. My wife is a registered nurse. She has gone into the surgeries and watched the amputations.  The problem of cluster bombs which maim and kill the innocent has been known for many years. Probably one of the most egregious examples was in Laos, where millions of the explosives were dropped by U.S. planes during the Vietnam war. Unfortunately, what happens with landmines, the war ends, the landmines stay. The peace treaties are signed and civilians continue to die; 30 years after those were dropped there are horrific casualties of civilians.  I have urged the Pentagon both in Democratic and Republican administrations to address this problem for nearly a decade. While they have acknowledged the problem, and they do acknowledge it, they have not taken effective steps to solve it.  We have used massive numbers of cluster munitions in the invasion of Iraq, including in densely inhabited areas. Civilians paid the price and continue to pay the price.  Israel used these weapons in Lebanon. Again, it has been innocent civilians who have suffered disproportionately.  Now, cluster munitions, like any weapon, of course, have military utility. They can be effective against armor or military infrastructure, but they are in effect indiscriminate because they scatter thousands of lethal bomblets over wide areas. There are many weapons that can be effective. Used right, I suppose, poison gas is effective, but we have banned it since World War I. We have urged other countries to ban it.  On these cluster munitions, between 1 and 40 percent, depending on the type or the condition of the terrain, fail to explode on contact. Remember, there are thousands of these coming down. So if anywhere from even 1 percent fail, and as high as 40 percent fail, they remain as hazardous duds indefinitely, no different than scattering landmines, something we do not do.  And those who come in contact with them activate them. That could very well be a child out walking to school. It can be someone playing. It can be someone going to tend their animals, their crops, and they end up with lifelong disfigurement or disability, often death.  No one argues it is possible to completely avoid civilian casualties in a war.  Such casualties are inevitable. They have been tragic consequences in all wars. But this amendment should not be necessary. Weapons that are so disproportionately hazardous to civilians should be subject to strict rules of engagement.  The Feinstein-Leahy amendment is fully consistent with the laws of war and international humanitarian law. It uses the same standard as for incendiary weapons, which are also notoriously hazardous to civilians. Rather than prohibit cluster munitions, the amendment says only that they should not be used where there are concentrations of civilians.  This is a moral issue and it is an issue of our own self interest. Using or selling weapons that are so indiscriminate, without strict rules of engagement, is immoral. It is immoral. Anyone who has seen the horrific consequences of children with an arm or a leg blown off, or a part of their face, or their lifeless body cut to pieces by the shrapnel, knows that.  But it is also contrary to our own interest to be using or selling weapons which, without strict controls on their use, cause such appalling casualties ofinnocent people who are not the enemy. It fuels anger and resentment we can ill afford among the very people whose support we need.  So again I commend the Senator from California and strongly support the amendment.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article from USA Today, dated December 11, 2003, about cluster bombs be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                    [From USA Today, Dec. 11, 2003]          Cluster Bombs Kill in Iraq, Even After Shooting Ends                           (By Paul Wiseman)       Baghdad.--The little canisters dropped onto the city, white      ribbons trailing behind. They clattered into streets, landed      in lemon trees, rattled around on roofs, settled on lawns.       When Jassim al-Qaisi saw the canisters the size of D      batteries falling on his neighborhood just before 7 a.m.      April 7, he laughed and asked himself: ``Now what are the      Americans throwing on our heads?''       The strange objects were fired by U.S. artillery outside      Baghdad as U.S. forces approached the Iraqi capital. In the      span of a few minutes, they would kill four civilians in the      ai-Dora neighborhood of southern Baghdad and send al-Qaisi's      teenage son to the hospital with metal fragments in his foot.       The deadly objects were cluster bomblets, small explosives      packed by the dozens or hundreds into bombs, rockets or      artillery shells known as cluster weapons. When these weapons      were fired on Baghdad on April 7, many of the bomblets failed      to explode on impact. They were picked up or stumbled on by      their victims.       The four who died in the al-Dora neighborhood that day      lived a few blocks from al-Qaisi's house. Rashid Majid, 58,      who was nearsighted, stepped on an unexploded bomblet around      the corner from his home. The explosion ripped his legs off.      As he lay bleeding in the street, another bomblet exploded a      few yards away, instantly killing three young men, including      two of Majid's sons--Arkan, 33, and Ghasan, 28. ``My sons! My      sons!'' Majid called out. He died a few hours later.       The deaths occurred because the world's most modern      military, one determined to minimize civilian casualties,      went to war with stockpiles of weapons known to endanger      civilians and its own soldiers. The weapons claimed victims      in the initial explosions and continued to kill afterward, as      Iraqis and U.S. forces accidentally detonated bomblets lying      around like small land mines.       A four-month examination by USA Today of how cluster bombs      were used in the Iraq war found dozens of deaths that were      unintended but predictable. Although U.S. forces sought to      limit what they call ``collateral damage'' in the Iraq      campaign, they defied international criticism and used nearly      10,800 cluster weapons; their British allies used almost      2,200.       The bomblets packed inside these weapons wiped out Iraq      troop formations and silenced Iraqi artillery. They also      killed civilians. These unintentional deaths added to the      hostility that has complicated the U.S. occupation. One anti-     war group calculates that cluster weapons killed as many as      372 Iraqi civilians. The numbers are impossible to verify:      Iraqi records are incomplete, and many Iraqi families buried      their dead without reporting their deaths.       In the most comprehensive report on the use of cluster      weapons in Iraq, USA Today visited Iraqi neighborhoods and      interviewed dozens of Iraqi families, U.S. troops, teams      clearing unexploded ordnance in Iraq, military analysts and      humanitarian groups. The findings:       The Pentagon presented a misleading picture during the war      of the extent to which cluster weapons were being used and of      the civilian casualties they were causing. Gen. Richard      Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters      on April 25, six days before President Bush declared major      combat operations over, that the United States had used 1,500      cluster weapons and caused one civilian casualty. It turns      out he was referring only to cluster weapons dropped from the      air, not those fired by U.S. ground forces.       In fact, the United States used 10,782 cluster weapons,      according to the declassified executive summary of a report      compiled by U.S. Central Command, which oversaw military      operations in Iraq. Centcom sent the figures to the Joint      Chiefs in response to queries from USA Today and others,      but details of the report remain secret.       U.S. forces fired hundreds of cluster weapons into urban      areas. These strikes, from late March to early April, killed      dozens and possibly hundreds of Iraqi civilians. Forty      civilians were killed in one neighborhood in Hillah, 60 miles      south of Baghdad, say residents and Saad Khazal al-Faluji, a      surgeon at Hillah General Hospital who tracked casualties.       The attacks also left behind thousands of unexploded      bomblets, known as duds, that continued to kill and injure      Iraqi civilians weeks after the fighting stopped. U.S.      officials say they sought to limit civilian casualties by      trying to avoid using cluster munitions. But often      alternative weapons were not available or would not have been      as effective during the invasion.       Unexploded U.S. cluster bomblets remain a threat to U.S.      forces in Iraq. They have killed or injured at least eight      U.S. troops.       The U.S. Air Force, criticized for using cluster bombs that      killed civilians during the wars in Vietnam, Kosovo and      Afghanistan, has improved its cluster bombs. But U.S. ground      forces relied on cluster munitions known to cause a high      number of civilian casualties.       The Air Force, responding to the criticism, began working      on safer cluster bombs in the mid-1990s and started using      them in Afghanistan. But the Army started a program to      install self-destruct fuses in existing cluster bomblets only      after former Defense Secretary William Cohen called in      January 2001 for dud rates of no more than 1% after 2005. The      safer bomblets won't be available for at least two years.      During the war in Iraq, U.S. ground forces dipped into      stockpiles of more than 740 million cluster bomblets, all      with a history of high dud rates.       Senior Army officials in Washington would not answer      questions about the Army's use of cluster weapons in Iraq.      Maj. Gary Tallman, an Army spokesman at the Pentagon, said      such weapons are effective ``against enemy troop formations      and light-skinned vehicles'' and are used only after ``a      deliberate decision-making process.''                      Why cluster bombs are deadly       Cluster bombs have been controversial since they killed      thousands of Vietnamese, Cambodian and Laotian civilians      during and after the Vietnam War. They have since been used      by armies around the world, including Russian forces in      Chechnya and Sudanese government troops fighting rebels in a      long-running civil war. But their use in urban areas of      Iraq has given new momentum to a movement to restrict the      use of cluster bombs.       Last month, dozens of activist groups hoping to duplicate      the success of the campaign to ban land mines formed a      coalition aimed at getting a worldwide moratorium on cluster      weapons. After seeing the toll the weapons took on Iraqi      civilians and their own forces, even some U.S. soldiers have      misgivings about using cluster weapons, at least in urban      areas.       As the war in Iraq approached, humanitarian groups warned      the Pentagon against using cluster weapons, especially in      urban areas. New York-based Human Rights Watch predicted on      March 18, a day before the war began with an airstrike in      Baghdad: ``The use of cluster munitions in Iraq will result      in grave dangers to civilians and friendly combatants.''      Cluster weapons are especially dangerous to civilians because      they spray wide areas with hundreds of bomblets. Most are      unguided ``dumb'' weapons, so they can miss their target, and      many of the bomblets don't explode immediately.       The U.S. military was aware of the threat cluster munitions      posed and was determined to minimize them. Col. Lyle Cayce,      an Army judge advocate general (JAG), led a team of 14      lawyers providing advice on the battlefield to the 3rd      Infantry Division on the use of cluster munitions, as well as      other weapons, during its 21-day, 450-mile drive north from      Kuwait to Baghdad. The goal was to ensure that U.S. forces      complied with international humanitarian law, enshrined in      the Geneva Conventions. ``No other army in the world does      that,'' Cayce says. ``We value the rule of law.''       The Geneva Conventions hold that when choosing which      targets to hit and which weapons to use, armies must make      sure they do not ``cause superfluous injury or unnecessary      suffering'' and ensure that the harm to civilians does not      outweigh the military advantages.       U.S. forces relied on sophisticated radar to pinpoint the      sources of Iraqi fire, then cross-checked them against a      computerized list of about 10,000 sensitive sites, such as      mosques and schools. Cayce and the other lawyers looked at      potential targets and advised U.S. commanders whether the      military benefits of using specific weapons against those      targets justified the risks to civilians.       Cayce gave advice 512 times during the war, usually in      cases involving cluster munitions. Most involved sites      outside populated areas. Cayce estimates he dealt with only      25 to 30 ``controversial missions.'' For example: He approved      a strike against an Iraqi artillery battery in a soccer field      next to a mosque because it was firing on the 3rd Infantry      Division's artillery headquarters.       The choices could be agonizing. He says he asked himself,      ``How many Americans do I have to let get killed before I      take out that (Iraqi) weapons system?'' Ten to 15 times,      Cayce advised commanders against firing on a target; they      never overruled him. Five times, in fact, they decided      against using cluster munitions even after he gave them the      go-ahead because they believed the risk to civilians was too      great. ``We didn't just shoot there willy-nilly,'' he says.       ``It was the enemy who was putting his civilians at risk. .      . . They put their artillery right in town. Now who's at      fault there?''       Rather than call upon their artillery to hit a target with      cluster munitions, U.S. ground forces preferred either to use      other weapons, such as M-16 rifles or tank rounds, or to      summon the Air Force to hit Iraqi targets from the sky with      precision bombs. ``Cluster munitions were the last choice,      not the first,'' Cayce says.       But aircraft frequently were unavailable. Sometimes the      weather was bad or sandstorms were swirling. Sometimes Air      Force pilots insisted on seeing targets instead of relying on      radar readouts. The cluster munitions, especially M26 rockets      fired by a multiple-launch rocket system (MLRS), had     greater range than other weapons and were more reliable in      bad weather.       Commanders also thought an MLRS was better at returning      fire and killing the enemy. ``MLRS is ideal for      counterfire,'' says Col. Ted Janosko, artillery commander for      the Army's V Corps. In fighting on March 31 around Karbala,      50 miles south of Baghdad, U.S. forces came under heavy      artillery fire from the Iraqis. ``We used (MLRS) rockets to      fire back,'' Janosko says. ``As soon as we started using      rockets, guess what? We never heard from that unit again. I'm      not going to say we killed them all . . . but believe me,      they did not fire again from that position.''       The 3rd Infantry Division also used MLRS frequently. The      rockets can go more than 20 miles, and they spray a wider      area than other weapons. The 3rd Infantry fired 794 MLRS      rockets during the Iraq war, according to an assessment by      two high-ranking division artillery officers in the U.S. Army      journal Field Artillery, published at Fort Sill, Okla.       As they raced north from Kuwait toward Baghdad in late      March and early April, U.S. forces fired rockets and      artillery shells loaded with bomblets into Iraqi troop and      artillery positions in Hillah, in Baghdad and in other      cities. U.S. aircraft sometimes dropped cluster bombs as      well.       Just before U.S. forces' ``thunder run'' into Baghdad on      April 7, the 3rd Infantry Division fired 24 MLRS cluster      rockets into Iraqi positions at an important intersection in      the capital. The damage assessment, recounted in the Field      Artillery article: ``There's nothing left but burning trucks      and body parts.''
