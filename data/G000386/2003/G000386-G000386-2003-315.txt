 President, I wish to propound a unanimous consent request.  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Dodd have up to 20 minutes and Senator Grassley up to 10 minutes for debate on amendment Nos. 970 and 998 concurrently. I further ask unanimous consent that following that debate, the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the amendment No. 970, to be followed by a vote in relation to amendment No. 998, with no second-degree amendments in order to the amendments prior to the vote. Finally, I ask unanimous consent that at 10 a.m. tomorrow the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the Grassley, or his designee, amendment, regarding the benchmark, with no amendments in order to the amendment prior to the vote; provided further, that this vote be subject to the approval of both leaders.
