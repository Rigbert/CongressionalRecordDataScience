President, I consider myself a responsible gun owner. I think common sense tells us that if we have assault weapons that are designed for the battlefield, they really have no place on our streets, in our schools, in our churches, or in our communities. I move to support an assault weapons ban. We do not even allow them for hunting in Vermont.  Does the Senator agree with me?
