In fact, we need lots of missions by church groups and interested organizations around our country connecting the workers who have lost their jobs in this country and then going and finding those jobs. Remember the games we used to play as children, you would follow the string? We need to follow the string, whether it is Vermont, Ohio, California, Florida.  I wanted to place another company in the Record tonight that started layoffs this May, just this past month, in the State of Massachusetts, Osram Corp. And when the gentleman from Michigan talked about global production and global sourcing, this company is owned by Sieman's Corp. out of Germany. They are laying off an initial 160 workers at this company in Danvers, MA, starting this past May, just last month, and they do not know how many more they are going to lay off, but they are moving the workers to Juarez, which is in one of the maquiladora areas, and to Mexico City.  If I could just take 1 extra minute to read from one of the articles in the local weekly newspaper up in Massachusetts, it says that the layoffs are significant because they mark the first time NAFTA has impacted the labor force north of Boston. The President of the company said that it had a relationship to NAFTA, which was approved by Congress 4 years ago, but here is what he says in the article.  He says that aggressive pushes by competitors General Electric and Philips BV of the Netherlands into Mexico, where labor is cheap and environmental laws lax, forced Sylvania to reexamine labor costs. He says, ``My competitors are selling products at prices lower than my costs.'' And at that particular plant workers earn $13 an hour, while workers in Mexico earn less than $2 an hour. So they can rake off a lot more profits, whether the multinational is based in Germany and has a subsidiary in Massachusetts, or whether it is located in Ohio and it moves down to Mexico, or to any low-wage haven. That is really what we are fighting for.
