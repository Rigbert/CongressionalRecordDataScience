3 billion in the first year alone. This is pure, grade A Pentagon baloney. The IG says it is baloney.  No one knows what the new policy would cost--if anything.  Maybe it would save money.  DOD is paying accounting firms like Coopers & Lybrand hundreds of millions of dollars to resolve accounting errors.  These accounting errors are caused, in part, by the current policy.  If payments were made according to law, all the money paid to Coopers & Lybrand could be saved. Surely these saving would offset any new costs. Let's face it, the thought of more cost makes industry lick its chops. More cost is not the issue.  More money is the issue. What I am talking about here is the flow of funds.  The new policy threatens to interrupt the money flow.  That is what scares CODSIA.  And I am not talking about not paying legitimate bills on time. Under law, DOD must pay its bills promptly.  I am talking only about bills that cannot or should not be paid. I amtalking about overobligations and overpayments.  DOD cannot write checks and pay bills with no money in the bank.  Mr. President, this simple rule applies to most citizens in this country but not to entrenched bureaucrats in the Pentagon.  They can dip into a bottomless well that is the $250 billion defense budget.  This bottomless well allows DOD bureaucrats to merge and comingle appropriations.  They do this to cover shortages--beyond the purview of Congress. Say a bill is submitted for payment, but the bureaucrats discover that there is insufficient money in the account to pay it.  Under the current policy--that is Mr. Hamre's policy--the bureaucrat is authorized to arbitrarily and deliberately post it to another account--the wrong account--but one fat with cash.  Mr. President, that is illegal. Yet that is exactly what CODSIA is asking DOD to keep doing. CODSIA refers to ACRN for accounting classification reference number. ACRN's identify appropriation accounts.  I quote from CODSIA's letter to DOD:       Continue the current DFAS [Defense Finance and Accounting      Service] procedure of reallocating payment by ACRN when there      are not enough funds in an ACRN to make the payment.  In other words, CODSIA says: Keep charging the wrong account if there isn't enough money in the right account.  Mr. President, that is a blatant violation of law.  When an ACRN contains insufficient funds to pay a bill, the account is overdrawn. It is in the red. It is time for heads to roll.  That is a violation of the Antideficiency Act--section 1341 of title 31, and that carries criminal penalties. It's a felony.  And when you arbitrarily reach into another account to get the money, as CODSIA suggests, you also violate sections 1301 and 1502 of title 31.  These laws are the sacred constitutional cornerstones of Congress' control over the purse strings.  CODSIA shows no respect for these sacred constitutional principles.  At least CODSIA is up-front about what it wants. It wants industry to get paid--even if it means breaking the law.  There is another problem--overpayments. These are bills that should not be paid.  DOD has a nasty habit of overpaying contractors and does it with great regularity.  The bad part about it is DOD doesn't know when it happens. DOD doesn't have the controls in place to detect them.  The only way DOD knows about an overpayment is when the contractor voluntarily returns the money.  Well, Mr. President, guess what is causing overpayments?  Answer: Mr. Hamre's current progress payment policy--the one he promised to terminate on October 1.  A recent GAO report--No. 97-37, page 12--says this policy is ``the most frequent cause of DOD's overpayments.''  The GAO report is entitled ``Fixing DOD's Payment Problem Is Imperative.''  The new policy promised--but not delivered--by Mr. Hamre should put a lid on overpayments.  Now if overpayments were stopped, who would suffer: CODSIA or the taxpayers?  Mr. President, I think CODSIA has plenty of self-serving reasons for wanting to keep the current policy.  CODSIA lost its credibility when it insisted that DOD break the law to keep the money spigot wide open.  Mr. Fuqua's letter to Acting Comptroller Alice Maroni was followed by a similar letter to Mr. Hamre.  This one was from the defense heavyweights: Boeing, Hughes, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and Raytheon.  The message was the same.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         The Boeing Co., Hughes Aircraft Co., Lockheed Martin            Corp., Raytheon Co., Northrop Grumman Corp.,                                               September 22, 1997.     Hon. John Hamre,     Deputy Secretary of Defense,     Pentagon, Washington, DC.       Dear Dr. Hamre: We are writing to convey our concern      regarding the Department's plan to implement new requirements      for progress payment distributions effective October 1. We      are particularly concerned that there has not been time to      ascertain fully the cost of compliance or the impact on      timeliness of payments. A quick cost impact estimate      conducted by industry indicates a minimum impact for Fiscal      Year 1998 of $1.3 billion (see enclosed CODSIA letter dated      August 27). These costs, plus those to be incurred by DOD for      implementing this requirement, will have to be borne by the      U.S. Government.       We understand that the DOD Inspector General and the      General Accounting Office indicate the need for improvements      in the DFAS accounting system. However, until DOD and its      contractors can fully assess the cost and related impacts of      the policy change made in your two memoranda of July 23,      1997, we are not confident that this is the least expensive      means of ensuring the improvements. We should also explore      legislative action for the Fiscal Year 1999 authorization      cycle.       In the meantime, we request that you delay the October 1,      1997, implementation date for the proposed progress payment      distribution policy change and that the change, when it does      become effective, be applied only prospectively and not to      any existing contracts. We respectfully request the      opportunity to meet with you to discuss the grave nature of      this issue and obtain your guidance on appropriate actions      industry can take to mitigate the associated cost impact and      delay.       We appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and look      forward to your response. We remain confident that the      taxpayers' interest can be protected in a cost effective      manner.           Sincerely,         Scott E. Carson, Vice President, The Boeing Co.; Marcus            C. Bennett, Executive Vice President and Chief            Financial Officer, Lockheed Martin Corp.; Peter R.            D'Angelo, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial            Officer, Raytheon Co.; Charles S. Ream, Vice President            and Chief Financial Officer, Hughes Aircraft Co.;            Richard B. Waugh, Corporate Vice President and Chief            Financial Officer, Northrop Grumman Corp.
