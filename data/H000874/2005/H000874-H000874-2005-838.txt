Speaker, as we commemorate the fifteenth anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which occurred this week, I would like to share the attached Statement of Solidarity, signed by 170 national organizations and numerous state and local organizations. This Statement of Solidarity demonstrates the strong commitment in our nation for building upon the progress achieved in the first fifteen years after passage of the ADA, and continuing to strive to improve the lives of all Americans with disabilities.     Statement of Solidarity on 15th Anniversary of Americans With                     Disabilities Act--July 26, 2005       Fifteen years ago today, with bipartisan support in      Congress and broad endorsements from the civil rights      coalition, President George H. W. Bush signed into law the      Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), calling for the      ``shameful wall of exclusion'' to come tumbling down. As we      mark this significant anniversary, we celebrate improvements      in access to polling places and the secret ballot, government      services and programs, transportation, public places,      communication and information technology. Parents pushing      strollers, workers delivering packages, and travelers pulling      roller bags have grown accustomed to curb cuts, ramps, and      other accessibility features less common in 1990. Our country      is more accessible today thanks to the ADA, and all Americans      are better off.       Although substantial progress has been made, we are      reminded every day of the significant remnants of the      ``shameful wall of exclusion'' that continue to prevent this      great country from realizing the full promise of the ADA. The      majority of Americans with disabilities continue to live in      poverty and unnecessary isolation. Most adults with      disabilities are either not working or not working to their      full potential, robbing the economy of the contributions of      tens of millions of would-be workers. Children and youth in      special education continue to drop out of school in alarming      numbers before obtaining a regular high school diploma. The      promises of higher education, accessible and affordable      housing and transportation, quality affordable healthcare,      and a living wage continue to elude many adults with      disabilities and their families. The ADA is slowly driving      policy changes that have enabled more people with significant      mental and physical disabilities to live independently in the      community, but the ongoing institutional bias in the Medicaid      program keeps too many people trapped in nursing homes and      other institutions, unable to enjoy the freedoms and personal      choices about where and how to live that other Americans take      for granted.       New technologies are increasing the independence and      productivity of many Americans. Yet, advances in technology      alone are not guaranteed to improve the lives of people with      disabilities. As we develop applications like Voice-over-     Internet-Protocol (VOIP) telephony, wireless      telecommunications, widespread broadband internet      connectivity, new medical devices, new computer applications,      and a plethora of new genetic tests, it is critical that      these technologies be designed and used in a way that      increases the inclusion, independence, and empowerment of      Americans with disabilities as well as America's growing      senior population.       The ADA has begun to change the landscape of our cities and      towns, but a civil rights law alone does not create the kind      of transformation of attitudes that Americans with      disabilities, their families, and allies are fighting to      achieve. This kind of change requires widespread discussion,      education, and consciousness-raising.       In 2005, how do fears, myths, and stereotypes continue to      artificially limit understanding and acceptance of disability      as a form of human diversity? What role do the mass media and      entertainment industries play in forming public perceptions      of disability, and how can decision makers in these important      fields be influenced to produce more content that depicts the      actual life experience and first person perspectives of      people with disabilities? What can be done to further improve      accessibility at the design stage of new products and      programs? How can disability awareness and disability-     friendly practices create more productive places of business      and learning? What concrete actions can worship communities      and sports and recreation programs take to foster full      participation of children, youth, and adults with      disabilities in these activities?       Why do so many Americans continue to view disability as a      fate worse than death, and how do these views affect      surrogate medical decision making and the application of new      genetic testing technologies?       These questions form the basis of an American conversation      that still needs to take place.  Widespread social change cannot simply be legislated, and it will not occur without bold leadership from all sectors of American society.       Public and private employers, in particular, must make a      serious, concerted effort to recruit and advance qualified      workers with disabilities within their labor force.       Election officials must take the necessary actions to      ensure that every adult is able to enter his or her polling      place and cast a secret and independent vote.       School administrators and university presidents must      embrace their responsibility to deliver a worldclass      education to all their students.       It is time for leaders across America--business owners,      little league coaches, moms and dads, sheriffs and clergy--to      reject exclusion, paternalism, and segregation and to take      personal responsibility for removing barriers to full      participation that still exist in every community in this      country.       With the aim of making America work better for everyone,      the undersigned organizations pledge to build on the progress      of the last 15 years and join together to promote the full      participation and self-determination of the more than 50      million U.S. children and adults with disabilities. We      believe that disability is a natural part of the human      experience that in no way should limit the right of all      people to make choices, pursue meaningful careers, live      independently, and participate fully in all aspects of      society. We encourage every American to join us in this      cause, so that our country may continue on the path that      leads to liberty and justice for all.
