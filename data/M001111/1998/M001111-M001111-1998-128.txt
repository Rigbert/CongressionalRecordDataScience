 I thank my colleagues from Massachusetts and North Dakota because they are stating the case quite correctly on class size. It absolutely makes a difference when you reduce class size particularly in lower grades.  The Senator from Massachusetts has cited what several empirical studies have shown. The Educational Testing Service says that empirical evidence is clear; smaller classes can make higher levels of student achievement, at least in the elementary school grades and particularly for disadvantaged students.  We have submitted these studies for the Record, and our colleagues are welcome to look at the Record. But I can tell you as an educator, clearly class size makes a difference. There is not a parent in this country who does not want to send their child off to school and know that they are learning how to read, that they are learning how to write, that they are learning math skills. When you have reduced class size, it makes a difference. Ask any parent. Ask any student. Ask any teacher. It will make a difference.  Every parent asks their child on the first day of school when they come home, ``Who is your teacher? How many kids in your classroom?'' They ask that because they know it makes a difference. Parents know it. Students know it. Teachers know it. And the studies show it. If you want to help IDEA kids, to which many of my colleagues have been alluding on the floor, I will tell you that class size matters. It matters more than anything else. I think it is absolutely imperative that this Senate go on record stating that we understand that. We are not going to ignore it. We are not going to come up with all kinds of arguments about paperwork and bureaucracy and federalism. We are going to say that as leaders in this country we understand that class size makes a difference. We want to make a difference for our children in our schools across this country, and we can by passing this amendment.
