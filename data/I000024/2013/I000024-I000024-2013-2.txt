President, first, I wish to say the same thing. It sounds as though it is all rehearsed, but it is not. It is actually a reality that I have always felt I could call and talk to the chairman about things we might not have in common--although I can only remember one issue where we were on opposite sides, but we have our reasons for being on opposite sides. Unless we work those out, then between John Bonsell and Peter, it is always a joy to be able to call and know I am reaching the top and we are going to be able to come up with a decision.  I talked to a lot of the Republicans who voted against this, and I want the chairman to be aware of this. I think almost all of them who voted against it voted that way for one reason; that is, the process. They wanted to have amendments. They are entitled to amendments. I think we said that over the last 10 years we have averaged 9 days of debate on this most significant bill each year. That is an average. We have had about 100 amendments on average. So that is something both the chairman and I agree should have happened, but it just didn't happen. We can't really blame one side more than the other.  Then, of course, when the nuclear option came, that got things pretty hostile here, and unfortunately what suffered was our bill.  I feel strongly that we have a good bill. In fact, a lot of people don't know how this process works when we cannot get a bill through the House and/or the Senate to make it a reality, and I had to go through this one year when I was on the House Armed Services Committee. Then they had the big four; that is, the chairman and the ranking member of the Senate and the chairman and the ranking member of the House, get together and put this together. That may not be the process--in fact, it is not the process we wanted--but the choice became, do we have a bill or do we not have a bill, and we have gotten down to that choice.  What I tried to do, and I failed--I am embarrassed to say I failed with many of our Republicans in explaining to them what would happen if we don't have a bill. I started writing what the chairman talked about that is in this bill, and I couldn't keep up. He was too fast. But I would like to mention a couple of things that I think perhaps were not mentioned.  Of course, we did cover Gitmo, and I look at it just a little bit differently than the chairman does. I like the restoration of the 1-year prohibition on the transferring of the detainees to the United States. That was a 12-month provision we had last time that we tried to get in, and we actually addressed this in our bill. But in this bill--the substitute bill we just voted on--I think it is very important and something I feel very strongly about.  On the sexual assault, we had both Senators McCaskill and Gillibrand, and I recall both of them saying: Well, this isn't everything I wanted. But they both thought it sure was a lot better than not having a bill. So I think we have done a good job there.  I always pick out one area that shows how much this would cost. If we look at the CVN-78--75 percent finished right now, $12 billion spent on it now--and if we didn't have this bill, I am sure we would try to do something, but work would stop, and people would be laid off. It would have then cost a lot more to wind things up and get back into it. When I say ``a lot more,'' we are talking about millions of dollars more. So that is one of the great victories we have.  The one aspect so many of my constituents are concerned about that I think needs to be called to everyone's attention that is in this bill is the U.N. Arms Trade Treaty. I remember back when we had the bill that didn't ultimately pass, but we had an all-night session, and at 5 o'clock in the morning I passed my amendment that would preclude us from getting involved in that treaty. This was after our Secretary of State had already signed this treaty. We had 53 votes. We had all the Republicans and six of the Democrats vote in favor of that. That didn't pass, but it is very important that we address that, not just to protect Second Amendment rights but also to protect our ability to help our allies without having to go through the United Nations. And we have that provision in here, which is very significant.  On the BRAC, BRAC is controversial. I was opposed to the last BRAC round. My feeling at that time was that we were getting the force structure down artificially low, and I didn't feel comfortable bringing down the infrastructure to meet that because I was hoping we would be able to--that is the same reason I would not want to have a BRAC round right now. We have never been in such a critical fiscal condition in supporting our military as we are today.  One thing that is certain about BRAC rounds is that we can debate about how much ultimately they will save, but everybody knows what it costs in the first 5 years, and these are the first 5 years that we really can't afford it, particularly the first year.  The last thing I would mention is something I felt more strongly about than I think most of the rest of them did, and that is how much we have spent on these drop-in fuels, the biofuels, and we have language here that would say we would not do it unless they are cost-competitive. That is a huge issue to me personally.  The last two I would like to mention--people say in my conference, a lot of them are saying: Well, what is going to happen on December 31 if we don't pass the bill? I have a long list of expirations here that I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record. I will only mention three of them. One is on the aviation officer retention bonus.  I think we all know and most of us believe that we made a mistake in April when we shut down some of our squadrons and about a third of our fighter squadrons for a period of about 3 months. General Walsh presented a very persuasive case that it costs a lot more to get them back to current, as we started to do in July, than the money that was saved during the time they were down. I think we lost a lot of aviators at that time because they were grounded, they weren't flying, and they just decided they would go into the private sector.  If we take away the aviation officer retention bonus, that is going to accelerate the lost number of people who would otherwise stay in the military. That would have gone away on the 31st of December. I don't know how many of the aviators we would lose, but I do know this: It is a $25,000 bonus, and the difference between retraining and retaining is huge. We can retain them, if the bonus would influence them, for $25,000, but retraining, to get to the optimum--the first level being the F-22--is about $7.5 million, but there is another $9 million to get to the top proficiency. That means $17 million as opposed to $25,000. So I think we need to in the future always keep track of retraining and retaining.  The health care professional bonus would end on December 31. Why is that important? Because a lot of these people who are taking care of our wounded warriors--not just at the hospitals but also after they leave--have special pay to take care of our wounded warriors, those who have made the sacrifices, and that would have ended on December 31.  The reenlistment bonus for Active members would also end. I remember from my military days that when people were getting ready to leave, they looked at the bonus, and that is there to encourage them to stay. So it is not just aviators; it is the ground guys and gals too.  So we have done a lot. I really appreciate that opportunity.  The last thing I will say--and I will ask my staff to put up the picture--this is my appeal to the minority leader and the majority leader. We could play the game and extend this and be here until midnight, I guess, on Thursday night. It happens that tomorrow is my 54th wedding anniversary, and I would really like to ask both the majority and the minority if we couldn't yield back a little bit of time. We know we are going to have the votes for this. I would sure like help. Those 20 kids and grandkids are waiting for me for a big dinner on our 54th wedding anniversary tomorrow night. So have mercy, give us a break, and let's try to get this voted on and go home. And Merry Christmas to everybody.
