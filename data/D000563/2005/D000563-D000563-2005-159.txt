President, I greatly respect my colleague from Iowa. The Grassley amendment is a clear explanation of why we have never done anything to expand health care. Do you know why? Because the Grassley amendment says we can have it all. We can give $20 billion in tax cuts to the wealthiest people in America and we can provide health care for children. It doesn't add up, just like this budget doesn't add up. What we have to understand is this. I give you a choice: Take away the tax breaks, half of which go to people who make over $1 million a year, take the money and insure all the children in America. That is my amendment.  Senator Grassley's amendment doesn't provide any resources or any funds to insure the children. What it says is if we give enough money to the wealthiest people in America, surely out of the charity of their hearts they will take care of the kids. We know better. There are more and more uninsured every single year.  I urge you to defeat the Grassley amendment and consider voting for the Durbin amendment.  I raise a point of order that the amendment violates the Byrd rule, section 313(b)(1)(a) of the Budget Act.
