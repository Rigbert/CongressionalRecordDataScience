Mr. Chairman, we have worked very constructively with the gentleman from California on this amendment, as well as on the bill itself. It has been through a very long and arduous process, two full hearings in the full committee last September, a whole series of hearings in my subcommittee on religious persecution, and then the drafting and redrafting. The gentleman from California (Mr. Campbell) has been very vital for that. We thank him for that. We appreciate his support for the full bill in final passage.
