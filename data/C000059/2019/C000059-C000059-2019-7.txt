 Madam Chair, I rise in support of the en bloc amendment, and I thank the Defense Subcommittee chairman for working with our side to include many amendments important to our Members. The chairman has been a great partner and has been very fair throughout this process.  Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.
