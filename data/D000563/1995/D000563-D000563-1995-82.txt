Speaker, I spent the August recess crisscrossing the State of Illinois from Chicago to Carbondale meeting with a variety of different people, asking them what was on their mind and what they were concerned about. The one thing that came through loud and clear at every meeting with every group was the fact that they are beginning to feel that working families in this country, the middle class of America, the backbone of this country, are falling behind. Husbands and wives are both working hard, playing by the rules, beating their heads against the wall, pushing their credit cards to the limit, worrying about paying for the kids' education, worrying about their own health care, worrying about whether that pension is going to be around.  Mr. Speaker, I thought to myself as I worked across the State that, when I come back to Washington, each day as we sit up here and debate the important issues I am going to try to hold those issues against that basic concern that I heard across Illinois. What is it we are doing on this floor of the House of Representatives that will respond to that?  Frankly, I do not think cutting Medicare benefits responds to those concerns, putting an additional burden on senior citizens and their families. I do not think the idea of tax breaks for people making over $150,000 a year makes any sense at all with our budget deficit, and that does not help the working families. Cutting back on education? Heck, most of those families are praying that their kids will qualify for a Federal college student loan. It is their only ticket to get that higher education and have an opportunity, and yet on this floor we are talking about cutting those opportunities.  So I hope in the weeks ahead we really can address this in a bipartisan fashion. I hope we can all be sensitive to the concerns of what has really been the strength of America now for 50 years, the strongest, most vibrant and growing middle class in the world. I hope we all are not taking pride in the politics of Washington. I hear people almost boasting about a train wreck that may occur. ``We may close down Government,'' they are saying with some level of pride. We should not be proud of that fact. Democrats and Republicans ought to sit down together and work out the problems. That is what we were sent here to do, and that is what we are paid to do.                          ____________________
