President, I rise today to introduce legislation with my colleague Senator Torricelli that would give the federal government clear authority to recover from the manufacturers of lead-based paint, funds spent on the prevention and treatment of childhood lead poisoning.  Our knowledge of lead poisoning dates back to 200 BC, when the Greek physician Galen wrote ``lead makes the mind give way.'' Benjamin Franklin knew about ``the mischievous effects of lead'' back when he wrote those words in 1786. In the late 19th century, scientific studies and medical reports began detailing the effects of lead on children. And by 1904, the source of those poisonings was identified as white lead paint used in housing. Queensland, Australia, was the first to ban certain applications of lead-based paint in 1922. Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Chile, Czechoslovakia, Estonia, France, Latvia, Poland, Romania, Spain, and Sweden followed suit in the mid-1920's. In 1978, more than a half of a century later, lead-based paint was banned in the United States.  Today, nearly one million preschoolers nationwide have excessive levels of lead in their blood; making lead poisoning the leading environmental health disease among children. Even low levels of lead exposure can cause serious injury to the developing brain and nervous system of children, lost IQ points, learning and reading disabilities, hyperactivity, and aggressive or delinquent behavior. At high levels of exposure, lead causes mental retardation, coma, convulsions and even death.  Lead-based paint in housing is the major remaining source of exposure and is responsible for most cases of childhood lead poisoning. Children contract lead poisoning when they come into contact with lead-based paint chips, contaminated soil, or dust generated from deteriorated paint. An estimated three million tons of lead still coats the walls and woodwork of American homes. Approximately half of America's housing stock, roughly 64 million units contain some lead-based paint. Twenty million of which are considered hazardous because they contain paint which is peeling, cracked, or chipped. My home state of Rhode Island has the fifth oldest housing stock in the country, and, as a result, has a lead poisoning rate that is three times the national average.  Sadly, this disease is particularly prevalent in those communities with the fewest resources to address the problem. Poor children are eight times more likely than kids from moderate and upper income families to contract lead poisoning. Yet, while lead poisoning is most prevalent in low-income communities, 20-25 percent of children who are poisoned live in middle- or upper-income homes. They were poisoned by exposure to lead released through renovation or repainting activities.  Taxpayers have already paid billions of dollars to deal with the tragic consequences of childhood lead exposure, including large expenditures for medical care, special education, and lead abatement in housing. However, what has been spent so far is barely a drop in the bucket. In Rhode Island alone, we are looking at a bill of $300 million to clean up just the most dangerous housing units. There are simply not enough grant or loan programs available. Last year, one federal lead abatement program had to turn down nine applicants for every grant it made.  Each year, we fight to make childhood lead poisoning a priority in Congress, in State legislatures, in cities, and in communities, knowing that the real solution is getting rid of the source of a child's exposure. At the same time we are frightfully aware that it could be decades longer, and millions of poisoned children later, until we finally ``get the lead out.''  The Rhode Island Attorney General recently filed a 10-count lawsuit against the manufacturers of lead paint and the industry's trade association. The lawsuit documents nearly a century-long record of industry culpability. The lead industry aggressively marketed its product as safe, despite knowledge of its harmful effects that were made apparent by continuous warnings from the medical community. To date, an industry that has over $30 billion in assets has yet to make a significant contribution to addressing the problems associated with its product.  Clearly, victims of lead poisoning were never given a chance, not even a warning. Parents were never told that the product they used to beautify their home could prevent their children from achieving their fullest potential. Instead, the industry fought regulations in California, New York, and Maryland that would have banned the use of lead-based paint or required the product to be labeled as poisonous. In 1954, the Board of Health of New York City proposed a sanitary code provision banning the sale of paints containing more than 1 percent lead, and requiring lead paint to be labeled as ``poisonous'' and not for interior use. The lead industry opposed the proposal as ``unnecessary and unjustified'' and unduly burdensome. Ultimately, the New York City Board of Health dropped the proposed ban of lead paint in 1955, and adopted a more narrow warning label requirement. This is only one example from an extensive record of industry wrongdoing which I believe the federal government should have the authority to address.  That is why Senator Torricelli and I are introducing legislation that will ensure that justice is served. Our legislation provides clear authority for the Federal government to recover the significant resources it has expended to mitigate childhood lead poisoning. This includes dollars spent on medical care and treatment, special education, and funds spent to make homes lead-safe for children. As cities and states stand up and say enough is enough, it is only appropriate for the federal government to join them in the effort to hold the industry responsible. The severity of childhood lead poisoning and the considerable expense borne by taxpayers to clean up the industry's mess demands action now. I urge my Senate colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation so that we can move aggressively towards our goal to end childhood lead poisoning. I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the Record.                                S. 1821       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Lead Poisoning Expense      Recovery Act of 1999''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds the following:       (1) Lead poisoning is the number 1 environmental health      threat to young children, affecting an estimated 890,000      children.       (2) Most children are poisoned in their homes through      exposure to lead particles when lead-based paint deteriorates      or is disturbed during home renovation or repainting.       (3) Lead paint remains in almost \2/3\ of the housing stock      of the United States.       (4) Lead poisoning may cause serious, long-term harm to      children, including reduced intelligence and attention span,      behavior problems, learning disabilities, and impaired      growth.       (5) Research shows that children with elevated levels of      lead in their blood are 7 times more likely to drop out of      high school than children without elevated blood-lead levels.       (6) Children from low-income families are 8 times more      likely to be poisoned by lead than children from high-income      families.       (7) African-American children are 5 times more likely to be      poisoned by lead than white children.     SEC. 3. SUITS BY THE UNITED STATES AUTHORIZED.       (a) In General.--In any case in which the United States is      authorized or required to furnish housing, education, or      medical care or treatment to an individual who suffers from      or is at risk of lead poisoning (or to pay for the housing,      education, or medical care or treatment of such an      individual) under circumstances creating liability upon any      third party, the United States shall have the right to      recover (independent of the rights of the injured or diseased      individual) the value of the housing (including the cost of      lead hazard evaluation and control), education, or medical      care or treatment furnished or paid for by the United States      before, on, or after the date of enactment of this Act.       (b) Amounts Recovered.--Any amount recovered by the United      States under subsection (a) shall be available, subject to      authorization and appropriations Acts, to enhance childhood      lead poisoning prevention and treatment activities, including      lead hazard evaluation and control.       (c) Third Party Defined.--In this section, the term ``third      party'' means any manufacturer of lead or lead compound for      use in paint or any trade association that represents such a      manufacturer.       (d) Statute of Limitations.--No action may be brought under      this section more than 6 years after the later of--       (1) the date of enactment of this Act; or       (2) the date on which the United States incurs the expense.                                 ______                                       By Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Ms. Snowe):  S. 1822. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to require that group and individual health insurance coverage and group health plans provide coverage for treatment of a minor child's congenital or developmental deformity or disorder due to trauma, infection, tumor, or disease; to the Committee on Finance.            treatment of children's deformities act of 1999 Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation with my colleague, Senator Snowe, to address the growing problem of HMOs denying insurance coverage for reconstructive surgery for children suffering from physical defects and deformities. This legislation would require medical plans to cover the medical procedures to reconstruct a child's appearance if they are born with abnormal structures of the body, including a cleft lip or palate.  Today, approximately seven percent of American children are born with pediatric deformities and congenital defects such as cleft lip, cleft palate, missing limbs including ears, and other facial deformities. Unfortunately, it has become commonplace for insurance companies to label reconstructive procedures to correct these deformities as cosmetic surgery and deny coverage to help these children eradicate or reduce deformities and acquire a normal appearance.  A recent survey of the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons indicated that over half the plastic surgeons questioned have had a pediatric patient in the last two years who has been denied, or experienced tremendous difficulty in obtaining, insurance coverage for reconstructive surgery.  It is disgraceful that many insurance companies claim that medical services to restore to a child some semblance of a normal appearance are superfluous and merely for vanity or cosmetic purposes. My colleagues may be wondering how such a ludicrous and cruel argument can be made when these procedures are clearly reconstructive in nature. Helping a child born without ears or with a cleft so severe it extends to her hairline is not cosmetic surgery.  The medical and developmental complications arise from these conditions are tremendous. Speech impediments, hearing difficulties and dental problems are a few of the physical side effects resulting from a child's physical deformity. In addition, the effect of a child's deformities on their personal development, confidence, and self-esteem and their future aspirations and achievements, is often very far reaching.  A healthy self image is vitally important to develop self esteem and confidence. How people see themselves, and how others see them, helps determine how a person feels about himself and whether he has the strength to cope with difficult challenges, including the taunting of peers and disengagement from school activities. As parents, we want our children to be armed with a healthy self esteem and confidence. The best way to guarantee that happens is to help them develop a strong and healthy self image.  At the same time, I recognize that we live in a society which places a high value on physical beauty and often unfairly uses it to measure a person's worth, ability or potential in society. It is unrealistic not to recognize the unfair obstacles facing children born with deformities if they are not provided access to medical services to help them attain a more normal physical appearance.  Some of my colleagues may know that my daughter, Bridget, whom Cindy and I adopted from Mother Theresa's orphanage in Bangladesh, was born with a severe cleft. We are fortunate to have had the means and opportunities to provide the expert medical care necessary to help Bridget physically and emotionally. However, we, too, encountered numerous obstacles and denials by our insurance providers who did not believe that Bridget's medical treatment was necessary. Fortunately, Cindy and I were able to afford the reconstructive services Bridget needed, despite denials by our health plan. Most hard-working American families are not so fortunate. That is why I am introducing this important bill to assist all American children.  This is not a new mandate that could cause health care premiums to escalate. What I am proposing simply prohibits plans from frivolously ruling that substantial, medically needed reconstructive surgeon for children to obtain a relatively normal appearance is cosmetic and refusing to pay for the procedures. This bill ensures that all children are afforded an opportunity to lead a more normal life and realize their full potential.  Mr. President, I ask that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  The bill follows:                                S. 1822       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

A bill to revise and extend the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act of 1994; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.           THE SAFE AND DRUG FREE SCHOOL AND COMMUNITIES ACT  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, it is no secret that drugs and violence destroy lives and families. They also can destroy entire neighborhoods and communities. More and more, our young people--our children--are being exposed to the evils of drugs and the dangers of violence. That is why I am introducing legislation today, along with my colleagues Senators Dodd and Murray, that would reauthorize the Safe and Drug Free Schools program.  This program funds a wide range of drug education and prevention activities. Our bill, which was drafted with the assistance of community anti-drug organization representatives, would give states greater flexibility on targeting assistance to schools in need; increase accountability measures to ensure that assistance is targeted to programs that work; and improve coordination of Safe and Drug Free programs with other community-based anti-drug programs.  Mr. President, I have dedicated a great deal of time, both in the House and the Senate, to fighting illegal drug use in this country. Way back in 1990, as a Member of the House of Representatives, I was on the National Commission on Drug Free Schools. From my experience on this Commission, and through my work on drug prevention when I was Lieutenant Governor of Ohio, I learned that school-based prevention efforts must be coordinatedand consistent during a child's school years. Programs must not have gaps that leave our children vulnerable to the lure of drugs.  Throughout my efforts, I always have emphasized the importance of a balanced attack against drug use. We must win the fight against people who manufacture and grow drugs, we must put a stop to those who transport illegal drugs into, and through, this country, and we must fight against the dealers who their trade drugs on our streets and yes, even in our schools.  There are many fronts in the important battle against drugs. The Safe and Drug Free Schools program is one area where I think we can improve our efforts. I believe we should continue the Safe and Drug Free Schools Program, but increase the accountability of federally funded programs and focus limited resources on programs that demonstrate an actual reduction in drug use. We must provide parents, schools, and local communities with the resources and flexibility they need to reduce drug use among kids.  Every child deserves to live and go to school in a drug and violence-free community. Our bill helps ensure that our children have this opportunity. Congress first passed the Anti-Drug Abuse Act--the precursor to the Safe and Drug Free Schools and Communities Act--in 1986. This legislation was the product of an aggressive, ambitious, and comprehensive anti-drug effort, which contributed to a 25% overall reduction in adolescent drug use from 1988 to 1992. Unfortunately, over the course of this decade, much of that success was lost. Youth drug use increased dramatically, including an 80% increase in marijuana use by high school seniors, an 80% increase in cocaine use, and a 100% increase in heroin use. We must reverse this trend. We have an obligation to our kids to reverse this trend.  I believe that our children's disturbing acceptance and experimentation of life-destroying drugs is due in large part to the Administration's national anti-drug strategy, which has been neither balanced nor comprehensive. Reinvesting in an improved Safe and Drug Free Schools and Communities program is a critical part of restoring effectiveness in and purpose to our national drug policy. Our legislation would be a major assault against drugs and violence in our schools and communities, by coordinating school-based programs with the broader community anti-drug effort.  Children spend more time at school than at any single place. A quality education starts with a quality educational environment. Congress can show its commitment to this goal by continuing--and improving--our investment in the Safe and Drug Free Schools and Communities Program. Specifically, our bill would increase the accountability within the program and ensure that only effective, researched-based programs receive federal funding. Also, it would provide States and Governors with greater flexibility in targeting their grants to prevent youth violence and drug use. Each state has unique drug prevention challenges and this bill provides the states with the flexibility to target funds to all of their schools, focus on those schools with the greatest drug/violence problems, or a combination of these two groups.  Our bill would increase community participation in the development and implementation of drug and violence prevention programs. Drug abuse and violence among young people is a community problem and requires a community-based solution. That's why when we drafted this bill, we worked closely with the Community Anti-Drug Coalition of America. Thanks to their input, this bill ensures that the entire community is involved in the creation and execution of programs to fight youth drug abuse and violence. It would maintain a viable program for all schools willing to conduct research-based violence and drug abuse prevention programs.  Mr. President, the threat of violence--and the reality of drug abuse--in our schools are all too real. If we get to our kids before the drug dealers do--if we have a policy of zero tolerance on drugs--America's children have a chance. I believe that the Safe and Drug Free Schools program empowers America's families and teachers with the information, training, and resources they need to help our children resist the temptation of drugs.  Over the coming months, we will be reauthorizing the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. The Safe and Drug Free is an important part of that legislation. I look forward to working on this bill and making this country's schools safer and drug free for our kids.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be entered into the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1823       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Safe and Drug-Free Schools      and Communities Reauthorization Act''.     SEC. 2. AMENDMENT TO THE ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION                    ACT OF 1965.       Title IV of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of      1965 (20 U.S.C. 7101 et seq.) is amended to read as follows:         ``TITLE IV--SAFE AND DRUG-FREE SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITIES     ``SEC. 4001. SHORT TITLE.       ``This title may be cited as the `Safe and Drug-Free      Schools and Communities Act of 1994'.     ``SEC. 4002. FINDINGS.       ``Congress makes the following findings:       ``(1) Every student should attend a school in a drug- and      violence-free learning environment.       ``(2) The widespread illegal use of alcohol and drugs among      the Nation's secondary school students, and increasingly by      students in elementary schools as well, constitutes a grave      threat to such students' physical and mental well-being, and      significantly impedes the learning process. For example, data      show that students who drink tend to receive lower grades and      are more likely to miss school because of illness than      students who do not drink.       ``(3) Drug and violence prevention programs are essential      components of a comprehensive strategy to promote school      safety, youth development, positive school outcomes, and to      reduce the demand for and illegal use of alcohol, tobacco and      drugs throughout the Nation. Schools, local organizations,      parents, students, and communities throughout the Nation have      a special responsibility to work together to combat the      continuing epidemic of violence and illegal drug use and      should measure the success of their programs against clearly      defined goals and objectives.       ``(4) Drug and violence prevention programs are most      effective when implemented within a research-based, drug and      violence prevention framework of proven effectiveness.       ``(5) Research clearly shows that community contexts      contribute to substance abuse and violence.       ``(6) Substance abuse and violence are intricately related      and must be dealt with in a holistic manner.       ``(7) Research has documented that parental behavior and      environment directly influence a child's inclination to use      alcohol, tobacco or drugs.     ``SEC. 4003.
