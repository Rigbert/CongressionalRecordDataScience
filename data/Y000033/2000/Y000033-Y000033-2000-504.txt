Mr. Chairman, the amendment is redundant, number one. It relates to the export of Alaskan oil. The President now has the authority to do so. The cases in law, 104-58--Section 201, states that if the Secretary of Commerce finds that exporting oil has caused sustained material oil supply shortages or sustained oil prices significantly above world market levels, and further finds these supply shortages or price increases have caused or are likely to cause sustained material adverse employment effects in the United States, the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, shall recommend, and the President may take, appropriate action concerning exports of this oil, which may include modifying or revoking the authority to revoke and export.  Mr. Chairman, we also had a GAO report that says there is no impact on the West Coast, and I again remind the gentleman from Oregon that there is no capacity for refining the oil from Alaska. Frankly, I would like to sell it all to the lower 48 if they had refinery capabilities.  So I ask the Chair to sustain the point of order.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, if I might just further respond.
