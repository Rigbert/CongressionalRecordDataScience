President, I thank the Senator from Alabama for offering to work with me. It would be my wish and hope that we could find a bipartisan agreement on this issue. Either he or someone who is distributing information on the floor has raised I think a very valid issue about our reference to the term ``veteran'' in my amendment. What we were thinking of was a situation where some of our active-duty soldiers who are seriously wounded and transferred to hospitals, such as Walter Reed, find themselves needing to be discharged quickly so they can go into the veterans health system. So we included the term ``veteran'' so it would apply to them as well.  But someone has observed, correctly, by using the term ``veterans'' we have opened this up very broadly. So I send a modification to my amendment to the desk.
