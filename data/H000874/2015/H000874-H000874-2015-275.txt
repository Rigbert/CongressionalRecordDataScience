Speaker, I rise today to honor one of our own, Joe Strickland, the Chief Reporter of Debates, on his retirement from the House after more than 21 years of service.  Joe Strickland is a native Texan. He came to the House in 1993, 2 years after graduating from court reporting school. He quickly distinguished himself not only as an excellent court reporter but as a very capable manager. In 2000, the Clerk of the House promoted Joe to Deputy Chief Reporter and made him Chief in 2005.  Joe has participated in seven State of the Union addresses by three Presidents, and he has developed a global reputation as a leader in reporting parliamentary debates.  Joe has represented the House abroad on several occasions, Mr. Speaker, including participating in the World e-Parliament Conference in Johannesburg.  Here at home, Joe has addressed the national convention of the National Court Reporters Association three times, and he has served on the board of the Greater Washington Shorthand Reporters Association.  Mr. Speaker, the House has lost a great resource and role model for the 43 dedicated professionals Joe manages. One of the reporters, of course, is on the floor reporting this now, and we thank her, and we thank all of those who have to listen to us and report what we say. That is a tough job. But I know that Joe will continue to inspire those who serve in the reporting office.  I join, and I know all of my colleagues join, in honoring Joe Strickland, thanking him for his service to this House. We wish him a very happy retirement, full of time spent with his husband, Tom, and their son, Kevin. I thank him for his service to the Congress and to our country.                          ____________________
