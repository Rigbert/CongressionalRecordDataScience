 President, I wish to say a word about ObamaCare as well.  I wish to remind my colleagues that the President is absolutely correct. He is correct when he says ObamaCare is about so much more than some flawed Web site. It is about people. People such as the California woman with stage 4 gallbladder cancer whose story we read about in the Wall Street Journal just this past weekend. I will read some of what she wrote:       I am a determined fighter and extremely lucky. But this      luck may have just run out: My affordable, lifesaving medical      insurance policy has been canceled effective December 31.  Here are the impossible choices she says she is left with. She can either get coverage through the exchange and lose access to her cancer doctors or she can pay up to 50 percent more for, as she put it, ``the privilege of starting over with an unfamiliar insurance company and impaired benefits.''  That is just not right. It is not what the President promised, and it is not the kind of health care reform Americans asked for.  So we should keep our focus where it belongs--on the real people getting hurt by this law.  But that doesn't mean we should stop asking questions about healthcare.gov too. Because if the government can't even run a Web site that it had 3 years--3 years--and hundreds of millions of dollars to create, can Americans entrust the same bureaucracy with even more power over their health care?  The calamitous rollout reminds us that we do not even know if data being submitted over this Web site is 100 percent secure. In today's age of digital scammers, that is a real concern for our constituents. Identity theft is about the last problem Americans need to be dealing with right now, especially with everything else this economy and this law have been throwing right at them. They are already mad enoughabout the President's repeated, unequivocal claims of, ``If you like it, you can keep it.''  The White House keeps trying to message its way out of this whopper, but no matter what they say, the reality remains: People are getting hurt. People are getting hit with premiums they can't afford and millions are losing the coverage they like. In my home State of Kentucky alone, 130,000 individual policies and 150,000 small group policies will be canceled. Remember, the President assured Americans up and down this wasn't going to happen.  I read about one DC woman who just lost her plan. She found something comparable on the exchange, but it cost a lot more than what she had before. Here is what she said: ``[It's] just not fair. [It's] ridiculous.''  She is not alone.  So I will say again it is time for Washington Democrats to work with Republicans to start working for their constituents instead of thinking that their first priority is to protect the President and his namesake legislation.                          ____________________
