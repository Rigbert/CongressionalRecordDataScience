 That means he has taken the largest number of votes among all of us currently serving here in the Senate. It means he has taken the sixth largest number of votes in Senate history. It certainly means he has taken more votes than any other Senator from his State, and Vermont has been sending Senators here since the late 1700s.  That is not the only thing that sets him apart from every other Vermonter to serve here in the Senate. He was the first Democrat elected to serve from Vermont. Unfortunately, that is a habit that has not continued. I think we can safely assume he is Vermont's first Batman fanboy to serve as well; the first Bat fan and probably the first Dead Head as well.  There is no doubt that our colleague is the longest serving current Member of the Senate from any State. We are happy to recognize today his 15,000th vote.  (Applause, Senators rising.)
