Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, this has been a long time coming. Ronald Reagan worked with the Democratic Congress and passed a tax, a tax paid by every American, Americans in Arkansas and every other State. Every time you buy an imported good that came through a container into our country, you pay a minuscule sales tax. Most Americans don't know that, but Congress is well aware of it. And for decades, Congress has been stealing that money.  The money was intended to maintain our harbors and our ports, critical to a maritime nation, critical to our competitiveness in the world economy. And our ports are in pathetic condition around the Nation.  As we hear so much about our crumbling infrastructure, the surface bill that I am working on--our wastewater, our drinking water--we don't have any money. Well, here we have the money. We actually have the money. We have taken it from the American people. They have paid that tax, but Congress is stealing it and not applying it to harbors.  This has been a bipartisan problem over the years. It was Republicans and Democrats who created this program, and it has been Democratic administrations and Republican administrations that have been diverting these needed funds.  On a daily basis, our largest ports have only about 38 percent of their authorized capacity. That means longer lines of ships out to sea and more costs in the movement of goods and particularly for our exports.  I will note that this bill is strongly supported by the Senator from Alabama, Senator Shelby, and Senator Shelby supports it because of the need to export from his State. And guess what? A bunch of those exports come from the State of Arkansas.  Why would someone from that State where half of their soybean crop is exported, where they have $3.1 billion in agricultural exports, be opposed to more efficiently moving their goods out of the country and adding costs to their farmers? I don't understand.  But there are some people inland who think ports don't affect them. Ports affect every single American every day. Goods that are imported cost more when our harbors aren't dredged properly. And our trade deficit grows when we are not competitive in the world economy.  I started working on this 23 years ago with a guy named Bud Shuster. His son, Bill Shuster, succeeded him as chairman of that committee over the last 6 years before we took back over the House. Twice we moved that bill out of the committee unanimously, including provisions to spend the harbor maintenance tax on harbor maintenance.  Now, that is a radical idea to some people inside the beltway in Washington, D.C., people who just have their focus right here in Washington. They are not focused on the Nation, the needs of the Nation, the needs of their farmers, the needs of others who are exporting and importing goods, about a great maritime Nation that is falling behind, that isn't going to be ready to accept the largest new ships because we don't have the money to dredge the harbors.  Well, we have the money. $10 billion of it is sitting over in the Treasury, but there are those here who do not want to spend that money on its lawful purpose. They will say, oh, my God, it breaks the budget caps. Really? The budget caps?  The deficit this year was $397 billion higher than when President Obama left office. Now, who has been in charge the last 2 years? Who wrote those budgets to put us up to nearly $1 trillion? And now we are going to say we can't afford to dredge our harbors, that we should just shut them down.  Shut them down. Let them silt in. Let the jetties decay. No, we can't afford it.  We can afford it. This is one place with bipartisan support where we can meet our infrastructure needs without raising a new tax on the American people.  This administration actually had some concern about the underspending of the tax and the diversion of the money to the Treasury, so the President's budget proposed to cut the tax instead of dealing with our harbors and saying let's spend the money. But that was written by Mick Mulvaney, the President's Chief of Staff, and OMB.                              {time}  1515  The President himself, when I was in a meeting with him discussing infrastructure and I said, ``We have $10 billion, Mr. President, sitting in the bank ready to be spent on infrastructure needs at our ports,'' he turned to Larry Kudlow and he says, ``Spend that money.''  That is where the President stands. That is where Senator Shelby stands. He has been trying to get it into any and every bill moving into the Senate. Every one of these budget deals, he is trying to get it in.  So here today we are going to hear arguments that we can't afford to spend the taxes that have been taken from the American people on the purpose for which it was intended. I do not agree with that argument.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                         House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Budget,                                    Washington, DC, June 26, 2019.     Hon. Peter A. DeFazio,     Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,          House of Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman DeFazio: I write to confirm our mutual      understanding regarding H.R. 2440, the Full Utilization of      the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund Act. H.R. 2440 contains      provisions that fall within the rule X jurisdiction of the      Committee on the Budget. However, the committee agrees to      waive formal consideration of the bill.       The Committee on the Budget takes this action with the      mutual understanding that we do not waive any jurisdiction      over the subject matter contained in this or similar      legislation, and the committee will be appropriately      consulted and involved as the bill or similar legislation      moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues      within our jurisdiction. The committee also reserves the      right to seek appointment to any House-Senate conference      convened on this legislation or similar legislation and      requests your support if such a request is made.       In particular, the committee should be involved in any      discussions regarding creation of adjustments to      discretionary spending limits and how they relate to the      appropriate level for overall discretionary spending limits.       Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter      confirming this understanding,     and I ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this      matter be included in the committee report on H.R. 2440 and      in the Congressional Record during floor consideration of      H.R. 2440.       Thank you for your attention to these matters.           Sincerely,                                                     John Yarmuth,     Chairman.                                  ____         House of Representatives, Committee on Transportation and            Infrastructure,                                    Washington, DC, July 12, 2019.     Hon. John Yarmuth,     Chairman, Committee on the Budget,     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Yarmuth: Thank you for your letter regarding H.R.      2440, the Full Utilization of the Harbor Maintenance Trust      Fund Act. I appreciate your decision to waive formal      consideration of the bill.       I agree that the Committee on the Budget has valid      jurisdictional claims to certain provisions in this important      legislation, and I further agree that by forgoing formal      consideration of the bill, the Committee on the Budget is not      waiving any jurisdiction over any relevant subject matter.      Additionally, I will support the appointment of conferees      from the Committee on the Budget should a House-Senate      conference be convened on this legislation. Finally, this      exchange of letters will be included in the Congressional      Record should the bill be considered on the floor.       Thank you again and I look forward to continuing to work      collaboratively with the Committee on the Budget on this      important issue.           Sincerely,                                                 Peter A. DeFazio,                                                            Chair.
