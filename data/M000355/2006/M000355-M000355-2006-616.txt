 President, I say to my friend from Texas, the only alternative I heard suggested, I have read about it in the press--I have not heard it offered on the floor yet--is that we essentially give the terrorists advance notice that we are going to be out of the country by the end of the year.  Look, we all hate, as the Senator from Texas indicated, to read reports of the death of any of our troops. We value human life in this country greatly. We do not, however, honor those who have given their lives in this great cause by giving up when we are making dramatic progress. And it is also important to remember that while we value every single life, we have lost fewer of our soldiers liberating Afghanistan and Iraq--50 million people liberated--than we lost on 9/11 in one morning or in Normandy during the invasion in World War II.  So while we value every life and we regret the loss of each soldier, it is extremely difficult to fight a war and lose absolutely no one.
