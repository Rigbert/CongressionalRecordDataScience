I don't know about time at the moment. I am trying to think of some way--we have been on this bill since Friday. A lot of us have other matters to attend to, including meetings with the President's nominee to the Supreme Court. Senator McConnell and I have sat here through hours of quorum calls. I think it is time to fish or cut bait. I say this to our cloakrooms, this may soon turn into a unanimous consent agreement and will require each of these amendments to come up and either be voted on or withdrawn.  I don't know how else we get it done. We have been several hours in quorum calls so far, and some of us have other things to do. I have no problem with somebody getting a vote. Vote for it or against it, but let's get it done.
