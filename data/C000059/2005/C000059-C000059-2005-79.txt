Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor Colonel Richard C. Crotty, United States Army, for his service and leadership while commanding the United States Army's 653rd Area Support Group. On June 25, 2005, Colonel Crotty will relinquish his command of the 653rd and report for assignment to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, J-3 Operations Directorate at the Pentagon.  After graduating from North Georgia College with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1980, Colonel Crotty began his military career at the Infantry Officer Basic Course at Fort Benning, Georgia. As a trained parachutist, he served with a number of airborne units, including the much heralded 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.  While with the 82nd Airborne Division he fought in Grenada during the 1983 U.S. invasion. Colonel Crotty spent 12 years in the Rangers and Special Forces and was a student at the Army War College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania when receiving orders to take over the 653rd.  On August 9, 2003, Colonel Crotty assumed Command of the 653rd, headquartered at March Air Reserve Base in Riverside, California. This unit is based in my congressional district and a number of the reservists under Colonel Crotty's command are my constituents. I have come to know Colonel Crotty as a dedicated and selfless leader with a ``can do'' attitude. He has demonstrated his leadership and innovation in developing and coordinating the joint training center at March Air Reserve Base. When complete, this jointly funded and shared training center will be used by 1,800 service-members.  Colonel Crotty has seen the 653rd deploy 1,367 troops in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. These troops include military police officers, chemical and biological warfare specialists, Humvee mechanics, communications experts and oil-pipeline builders. Knowing the sacrifice and challenges all reservists experience, Colonel Crotty has demonstrated a sincere dedication to preparing these service-members for the serious mission that lies before them. I know his troops share my admiration of his compassion, strength, and service to our country.  He has earned my many thanks. I wish him well in his new assignment at the Pentagon and in all of his future endeavors.                          ____________________
