   Did Fired Oc Air Marshal Endanger Flying Public, or Protect It?                            (By Teri Sforza)       On July 26, 2003, the Department of Homeland Security      issued an alert to all U.S. airlines, airport security      managers and federal air marshals:       A possible hijacking plot was in the works, involving five-     man teams that might try to seize planes and fly them into      government, military or economic targets.       Robert MacLean of Ladera Ranch had been working as a      federal air marshal since shortly after 9/11. So it struck      him as particularly bizarre when--just three days later--a      text message popped up on his government-issued mobile phone:       Overnight missions involving federal air marshals will be      cancelled from late July through early August.       What? No overnights? That meant no air marshals on long-     distance flights. To save money on hotel rooms, MacLean would      come to understand.       This, thought MacLean, was crazy. The 9/11 hijackers      targeted long-distance flights because they hauled the most      fuel and could do the most damage. Pulling air marshals from      such flights, precisely when there was warning of a possible      attack, was gross mismanagement--and a ``specific threat to      public safety that could lead to catastrophic loss of life,''      he'd say later in court papers.       So MacLean took his concerns to his supervisor and other      officials.       He didn't get far.                              TOP SECRET?       That text message, MacLean would later argue, wasn't marked      as sensitive information. It arrived on his mobile phone, not      on his secure PDA.       And so, on July 29, 2003, MacLean disclosed the message      to--gasp!--a member of the press. NBC.       Fallout was fast and furious. Lawmakers decried the idea as      foolish; Sen. Barbara Boxer offered to send the      Transportation Security Administration a list of hotels near      San Francisco International Airport where rooms cost less      than $100 a night. Officials said they had made no final      decisions yet; and overnight missions continued, as per      usual, on the full schedule of cross-country and      international flights.                       ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL?       Not quite.       Nearly three years later--in April 2006--MacLean was fired      from his job as a federal air marshal. Grounds for dismissal:      disclosing sensitive information to the media.       The message didn't need to be marked ``sensitive,'' the      government argued; all details regarding the deployment,      number and operations of federal air marshals were protected      information.       ``Your unauthorized media appearance and unauthorized      release of SSI (sensitive security) information to the media      raise serious doubts about your judgment and      trustworthiness,'' says MacLean's dismissal notice, signed by      Frank Donzanti, special agent in charge with the      Transportation Security Administration.       ``Moreover, the disclosure of this SSI had the potential to      reveal vulnerabilities in the aviation security system, and      as such, was extremely dangerous to the public we serve. As      such, I find little chance for your rehabilitation as a FAM      (federal air marshal). Based on the egregiousness of your      actions I have lost confidence in your ability to perform and      find that removal from Federal employment for your      unauthorized disclosure of SSI is necessary to promote the      effectiveness of the FAM Service,'' the letter says.                            LEGAL LABYRINTH       So was MacLean endangering the public safety by revealing      the message? Or was he protecting it?       Is he a villain, or a hero?       MacLean argues that he should be protected as a federal      whistleblower, and filed a whistleblower suit against the      government.     Many machinations have followed, in that tortured, slow,      legal sort of way. ``I want to get back to federal law      enforcement,'' said MacLean, 39, who says he has applied at a      dozen local police departments, but remains jobless. ``I want      to go back to serving as if I had never blown the whistle      before.''       MacLean was a Border Patrol agent in San Clemente for six      years, and a federal air marshal for four years. He has a      wife and two daughters, 5 and 7. They've moved in with his      parents. These days he spends time tracking the fits and      starts of whistleblower-protection legislation that seems to      come up every year, and die every year.                          THIS TIME, MORE HOPE       Last week, a letter signed by seven congressmen and women      went to President Obama, urging him to swift action on the      issue of whistleblower protection for federal employees,       ``Whistleblowers are our nation's best resource against      fraud and abuse of the public trust,'' the letter says.      ``Legal victories for employees who have been retaliated      against for blowing the whistle are almost nonexistent. We      encourage you to support congressional efforts to reform the      inadequate system of whistleblower protections, such as H.R.      1507. . . . In addition to these forward-looking reforms, we      encourage you to take action to restore the careers of      employees who were wrongly terminated or marginalized by      previous administrations after blowing the whistle.''       And other lawmakers are getting on board as well. There      have been meetings at the White House. MacLean's documents      live on the Project on Government Oversight's web site. He      has his own page on Wikipedia. Officials did not rush to get      back to us to discuss his case; but he has made appearances      on many news programs and is not shy about pressing the      righteousness of his position.       He hopes for a resolution soon.                          ____________________
