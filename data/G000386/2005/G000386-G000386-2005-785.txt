 President, the amendment by the Senator from Maine and the Senator from Oregon about the noninterference clause will not result in savings, and it is going to undermine a drug benefit that is not even up and running yet. I don't know how you can propose changes in legislation that effectively doesn't get started until January 1, 2006. How do you know things are not going to work until you have had some experience with it?  I have urged everybody to hold off on changing anything in the prescription drug bill until you actually see it functioning. It seems to me to be very difficult to work on a piece of legislation like this and try to change it before it has been operational.  First and foremost, let me be clear about something again.
