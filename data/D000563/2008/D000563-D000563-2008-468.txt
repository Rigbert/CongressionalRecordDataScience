President, for the record, it is my understanding the time between now and 5:30, when we vote on the motion to proceed to the tax extenders, has been evenly divided between the Republican and Democratic sides.  I ask unanimous consent that all time--even time on the quorum calls--be credited to both sides equally during that period.
