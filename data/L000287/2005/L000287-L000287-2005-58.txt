Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in support of H.R. 787, to designate the United States Courthouse located in Sacramento, California, as the Robert T. Matsui United States Courthouse.  It is so fitting and appropriate that we honor Bob Matsui. In spite of what the American Government did to him and his family, this good and decent man never lost faith in America. He loved America. He loved the people of his district. He was a wonderful human being. Every day he tried to do his best to bring America together, to create one America, one family, one House, the American House.  Mr. Speaker, with this legislation I think we are doing the right thing by honoring Bob Matsui.
