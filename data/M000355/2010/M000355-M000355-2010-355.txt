 President, most Americans breathed a sigh of relief in January when it looked like the Democrats' partisan plan for health care was done for. Most people saw the outcome of the Massachusetts Senate race as an opportunity to start over on what they wanted, which is a step-by-step plan that would target costs without raising taxes or insurance premiums, without cutting Medicare, and without using taxpayer dollars to cover the cost of abortions.  Unfortunately, the proponents of this plan are still determined to force this distorted vision of health care reform on a public who is already overwhelmingly opposed to it. So this afternoon the President will outline yet another version of the Democratic health care plan we have been hearing about all year long.
