 President, I rise today to remember and pay tribute to Mike Jendrzejczyk, a tireless and dedicated champion of human rights who passed away earlier this month. A gaping hole has been left with his passing, but his life and commitment to fundamental values we all cherish will continue to inspire and motivate us all.  As the Washington director for the Asia Division of Human Rights Watch for 13 years, Mike became an institution in this city and a leader in his field. Few human rights issues in Asia escaped his attention and few of his colleagues could surpass his knowledge and level of expertise.  As Human Rights Watch noted, ``There's no one in D.C. who didn't know him, and no one in military fatigues in Asia who didn't have a reason to fear him.''  From Burma and Indonesia, to Vietnam and North Korea, Mike spoke up for those who could not speak for themselves. He shined a light on human rights abuses and made it his mission to see that justice was done. Time and time again he called on the United States to live up to the values that made this country great and be the leader for human rights that the world so desperately needed.  Recently, my office had worked with Mike on the need to bring safety and stability to the people of Afghanistan, particularly women and girls. We have lost a partner in that endeavor, but we have not lost the example he set, and I know his memory will push us to work even harder in the days and weeks ahead.  My thoughts and prayers go out to his wife Janet and his colleagues and friends at Human Rights Watch. Mike Jendrzejczyk will be sorely missed.
