Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Dr. Lawrence Newman, a beloved educator, writer, and deaf advocate who passed away on July 4, 2011.  In 1953, Lawrence joined the faculty of the California School for the Deaf in Riverside. He distinguished himself as a talented and devoted teacher, becoming the first deaf person to be awarded the California Teacher of the Year Award in 1968.  Lawrence's contributions extend far beyond the classroom. As two-term president of the National Association of the Deaf, Lawrence was a tireless public advocate for deaf students, raising awareness of their unique needs and fighting for reforms in the law to support residential schools. He also fought for change from within the deaf community, encouraging sign language and total communication.  Perhaps Lawrence's most important role, however, was that of father of five and husband to Betty, his wife of 61 years. He is missed and will always be remembered for his contributions to the deaf community.                          ____________________
