Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  This bill by the gentleman from Illinois, he has already eloquently described the history and the purpose. It is an extraordinary history in New Philadelphia, and it certainly deserves more national recognition. In this case, the gentleman's legislation, H.R. 930, would direct the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a special resource study of the New Philadelphia archaeological site and the surrounding land. It would require the Secretary to evaluate the national significance of the study area and determine the feasibility of designating the study area as a unit of the national park system. Therefore, we support this legislation.  I thank the majority and the gentleman from Illinois for bringing this up, and urge all of my colleagues to support this important legislation.  I yield back the balance of my time.
