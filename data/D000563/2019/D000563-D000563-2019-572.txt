President, in 1958, recently married Genie Zavaleta went on assignment with the Migrant Ministry with her husband Hector. They traveled the country to support Mexican migrant workers. Genie was a child of the Great Depression, and she knew when people needed help. What was supposed to be a 1-year stint became a lifetime of helping people in need.  Last month, Genie passed away at the age of 92. She was known as the grandmother of the Dreamers. She was a longtime champion and mentor to undocumented youth in Arizona and a fierce advocate for the Dream Act. Genie also was my ally in defending the Dreamers.  In 1965, Genie and Hector moved to Arizona permanently with their two sons, Dan and David. Arizona was a transforming State, and the influx of migrant workers attracted Genie. She became the first director of education at Planned Parenthood of Phoenix, teaching classes on poverty and across the county. She taught classes at Phoenix College and Arizona State University too. She worked with theMaricopa County Health Department for 15 years until her retirement in 1989.  Genie's retirement was not close to the end of her story. She moved into full-time advocacy for immigrants. For more than a decade, my staff and I worked with her on behalf of Dreamers. She saved countless Dreamers from being deported. Genie had my office on speed dial. She frequently alerted us to Dreamers at the risk of deportation. She shared stories of Dreamers that I told on the Senate floor.  In 2011, I organized the Dream Sabbath, a gathering of faith communities around the country to put a human face on the plight of undocumented students. An event about the Dream Act would never be complete without Genie's participation, so of course, she helped organize Arizona's Dream Sabbath.  Genie did not seek fanfare. She quietly became one of Arizona's most influential immigration activists. She did not want fame. It was about the Dreamers.  On the lawn of her home in Arizona, there once were signs covering the whole area for the causes she supported. Today, the house is quiet, and the lawn is empty except one sign, a stars-and-stripes one with ``In our America, all people are equal'' at the top. We will keep fighting on Genie's behalf until the Dream Act is the law of the land.  Genie Zavaleta is survived by her husband Hector, her sons Dan and David, and their wives Nori and Linda. On behalf of the hundreds of people she helped, Loretta and I send our sincere condolences.
