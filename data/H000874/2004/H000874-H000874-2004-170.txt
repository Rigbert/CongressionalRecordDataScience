Speaker, I thank the majority leader.  Mr. Speaker, the majority leader mentioned two appropriations bills scheduled for next week: Defense and Energy and Water. Can the gentleman tell us on what days he anticipates those bills to be on the floor, and does he anticipate that they will come to the floor under the customary open rules?  I yield to my friend.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding. We have not made a final decision as to when we might suggest that we place them on the schedule. Just as a possibility, we would put Department of Defense on the floor on Tuesday; Energy and Water might be later on, because we are working, trying to work with the Committee on Appropriations to make sure we are not on the floor when the committee is in markup.
