Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer an amendment in the nature of a substitute. The substitute has the support of the administration and many other interest groups.  The amendment brings the bill in conformity with title 2 of S. 395. In a nutshell, it would, among other things:  Allow exports to be carried in U.S.-flag, U.S.-crewed vessels.  Require the President to make a national interest determination.  Require the President to conduct an environmental review, as well examining the effect of exports on jobs, consumers and supplies of oil.  The President could impose terms and conditions other than a volume limitation.  The Secretary of Commerce would be required to issue any rules necessary to implement the President's finding within 30 days.  If the Secretary found drastic oil shortages or price increases, he could recommend actions, including modification and removal of the authority to export.  Actions under this bill would not be subject to traditional burdensome notice and comment rulemaking requirements.  The President would retain his authority to block exports in times of emergency.  Finally, the substitute would also require the GAO to prepare a report assessing the impact of ANS exports on consumers, independent refiners, shipbuilders and repair yards.  I urge support for the amendment in the nature of a substitute.amendment offered by mr. traficant to the amendment in the nature of a                substitute offered by mr. young of alaska
