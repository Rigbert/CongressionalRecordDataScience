We have had over 18,000 Americans since January 1, 1994, lose their jobs to Mexico already because the wages down there are so cheap. Our plants, several thousand of them, have been relocating down there over the years, and after NAFTA that exodus accelerated. So our people will not be getting the money. In fact the [[Page H1608]] money is being taken from our taxpayers to bail out the big financial institutions.                              {time}  1650  We know the money will not go to feed the people of Mexico. The people of Mexico understand that their government will not help them, because it is in fact a one-party government and an authoritarian state that has been in power since before my grandmother was born. So they know that they will not get assistance from there. So it is interesting to think about who the money is really going to and at the same time as those dollars flow between the central bank of Mexico and its public treasury and Wall Street here in the United States and the central bank of Germany and Japan, when you think about that movement of money, and then you think about the fact that some of those very same institutions, especially the private creditors, have said very quietly to our government it is all right, let Mexico clean up its problems in Chiapas, clean up its problems in Tabasco state, in other words, kill the people of Mexico who are fighting because they basically do not have enough money to survive for life, enough to eat.  I remember one woman said to me when I visited down there, ``Well, Ms. Kaptur, you do not understand. We work for hunger wages.'' I said, ``I beg your pardon? I never heard that term.'' She said, ``People get about 80 percent of the calories that it takes to keep a person's weight in balance,'' so in the part of the countryside that we were in, the people were very thin, and they were very hungry, and it was very hard to even get tortillas. The children were eating tortillas. They did not have fresh water. It is hard for Americans to imagine if they have not visited the inland area how people are actually living in that nation of nearly 100 million people, yet the dollars will not go to help those people. In fact, the people that are suffering most, the ones who are crying out for their own government, for their own government to help them, are being felled by the federal police.  And so we ask ourselves, what are we doing as a country; what are the major institutions of this country doing, political and economic? Are we standing up for the best ideals that are in the Constitution?  I think not.  And so it is my pleasure to join with the gentleman from Mississippi [Mr. Taylor] this evening and to be a voice for people on both sides of the border who feel that this money is being incorrectly used to support a government that does not represent the majority of people in that nation.
