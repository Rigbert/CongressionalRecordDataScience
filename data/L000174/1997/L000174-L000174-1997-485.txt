President, as I listened to the question of the Senator from West Virginia and the response, I do not believe that the question was fully answered. I say to my good friend from Utah that he and I have debated this matter in committee now for several years. We have debated it on the floor of the Senate for the past couple of weeks, which also feels like several years. We have gone back and forth.
