But deciding whether to prescribe a drug, and which one, requires a careful balancing of potential benefits, risks, and costs.  Prescribing should not be determined by how heavily a drug is promoted by a pharmaceutical company. Sadly, this is largely what happens today.  Our health care system does not generate objective, easy-to-access information for doctors to guide them when it comes to prescribing options.  New drugs are constantly entering the marketplace, but there's very little objective information about what drug might be marginally safer or more effective than existing drugs.  Even the most vigilant doctors would be challenged to monitor the dozens of medical journals that could contain a helpful study comparing the safety and effectiveness of drugs.
