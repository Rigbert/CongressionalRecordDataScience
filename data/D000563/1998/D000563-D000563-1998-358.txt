President, I want to take a few minutes to pay tribute to one of our Nation's most important industries--agriculture. Today, we celebrate National Agriculture Day. It is a time to reflect on the value of production agriculture and to say thank you to all those who are involved, both directly and indirectly, in producing the most abundant and safest food and fiber supply in the world.  Illinois is one of our country's most important agricultural contributors. Illinois farm land, which accounts for about 27 million acres, is considered some of the most productive in the world. More than 76,000 farm families in the State produce corn, soybeans, wheat, beef, pork, dairy products, and specialty crops. Illinois exports more than $3.4 billion worth of agricultural products. The State's agribusiness activity is vibrant. From the Chicagoland area to Decatur and throughout Illinois, agricultural processing employs thousands of people. And, our researchers continue to help provide answers to some of the most common as well as the most complex agricultural questions we face.  Since last year's National Agriculture Day, we've made some real progress for rural America. The Taxpayer Relief Act raised the inheritance tax exemption for small businesses to $1.3 million, lowered the capital gains tax rate, and began a gradual increase in the deductibility of health insurance premiums.  This year, we face a number of equally important issues, specifically, reauthorization of agricultural research, expedited health insurance premium deductibility for the self-employed, extension of the ethanol tax incentive, and food safety.  The safety and availability of our Nation's food supply depends directly on agricultural research. This year, Congress must reauthorize the research title of the farm bill. Reauthorization will establish a national policy for important agricultural research into the 21st century. In these times of constrained federal budgets, it is vitally important to maintain an effective system for agricultural research.  Agriculture-related research in this country is currently conducted at over 100 ARS labs, including Peoria, and at over 70 land grant institutions, including the University of Illinois. The University of Illinois is involved in biotechnology, aflatoxin, genome, and food safety research on their campuses. Southern Illinois University is working on groundwater contamination and an important National Corn to Ethanol Research Pilot Plant near its Edwardsville campus. These projects are simply too important to delay. However, the future of agricultural research depends on Congress reauthorizing these vital programs sooner rather than later.  With regard to health care costs, I believe that a 100-percent tax deduction for health insurance premiums is one of the most basic issues of fairness to farm families across this country. Because of the high cost of health insurance, especially insurance purchased in the individual market, lack of affordability is a growing problem to farmers. Health insurance is particularly important to those involved in production agriculture because farming is one of the more dangerous occupations. It is essential that farmers have access to quality health care and affordable health insurance.  In last year's Taxpayer Relief Act, Congress made the commitment to increase deductibility very gradually from 40 percent in 1997 to 100 percent in 2007. Although I believe this legislation was a good first step, we need to provide this relief faster. I have introduced legislation that will expedite the full deductibility of health insurance premiums. I also intend to offer an amendment to increase deductibility to 60 percent in 1999 and 100 percent thereafter. Relief for farm families in this area is needed now. Farmers should not have to wait until 2007 for equity with their corporate competitors.  Mr. President, finding new and expanded uses for agricultural products is an important endeavor. Soybean growers and the oilseeds industry are proposing a strategy for biodiesel, a diesel fuel derived from soybeans. Including biodiesel in existing and future Department of Energy programs will help the nation reduce dependence on imported oil, while improving the environment, reducing global warming, and creating new domestic agricultural product markets. And, of course, ethanol, a corn-based renewable fuel, is one of the best alternative use opportunities that exists today.  On a day like today, it is important to point out the benefits of ethanol. The industry is responsible for more than 40,000 American jobs. Ethanol contributes more than $5.6 billion annually to our economy. Five percent of our nation's corn crop goes to ethanol production. Corn growers have seen their incomes increased by more than $1.2 billion because of ethanol. This year alone, over 1.4 billion gallons of ethanol will be produced . Thanks to the reformulated gasoline program, toxic air pollutants like benzene and carbon monoxide have fallen substantially. And, ethanol contributes over $2 billion annually to the U.S. trade balance.  Last week, the Senate overwhelmingly defeated a proposal that would have removed the ethanol excise tax exemption from the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA). That vote was the strongest in Senate history in support of ethanol. It is my hope that an extension of the ethanol tax incentive will be included in the final conference report on ISTEA. Time is running out. Farmers, the ethanol industry, and rural America deserve to have this important program extended.  An issue that also needs immediate attention is food safety. Make no mistake, our country has been blessed with the safest food supply in the world. However, we can do better. The General Accounting Office estimates that as many as 33 million people will suffer food poisoning this year and more than 9,000 will die. The Department of Health and Human Services predicts that foodborne illnesses and deaths are likely to increase 10 to 15 percent over the next decade.  I have introduced the Safe Food Act, S. 1465, which would empower a single, independent agency to enforce food safety regulations from farm to table. It would provide an easier framework for implementing U.S. standards in an international context. Research could be better coordinated within a single agency rather than among multiple programs. And, new technologies to improve food safety could be approvedmore rapidly with one food safety agency.  At a time of government downsizing and reorganization, the U.S. simply can't afford to continue operating multiple systems. In order to achieve a successful, effective food safety and inspection system, a single agency with uniform standards is needed.  Mr. President, National Agriculture Day affords us all the opportunity to say thank you to those who farm, process agricultural products, conduct the research and plan for the future, and keep American agriculture the best in the world.                          ____________________
