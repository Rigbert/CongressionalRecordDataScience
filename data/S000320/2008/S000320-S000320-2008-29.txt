 President, I wish today to honor Kathryn Tucker Windham, who is celebrating her 90th birthday on June 5, 2008. In Alabama, one of our greatest treasures is our history, which is often best learned through the stories told by others. Alabama is lucky to have one of the world's best storytellers, Kathryn Tucker Windham, who shares her memories and observances of our State's social history in a way unlike any other. Kathryn can tell stories about graveyards and ghosts, cooking or recipes and the Gee's Bend quilters that provide her listener with a unique view into life in the rural South.  Born in Selma, AL, Mrs. Windham grew up in Thomasville, where she began her writing career at the age of 12 working for the Thomasville Times, a local weekly newspaper. After receiving her bachelor's degree from Huntingdon College in Montgomery, AL, Kathryn became one of the first women to cover the police beat for a major daily newspaper in the South at the Alabama Journal. She also worked as a reporter, photographer, and State editor for the Birmingham News and as a reporter, city editor, State editor, and associate editor for the Selma Times-Journal, where she won Associated Press awards for her writing and photography.  Kathryn is also the author of 24 books and is a playwright. She is widely recognized for storytelling abilities in classrooms, historical meetings, and storytelling events across Alabama. In addition to her writing career, Mrs. Windham worked as the community relations coordinator for the area agency on aging, which serves 12 rural counties in southwest Alabama and promoted statewide war bond drives during World War II.  Mrs. Windham's work in radio brought her a new level of notoriety, as she is now a favorite contributor to National Public Radio's program, ``All Things Considered.'' Her tales about life in the rural South tell listeners more about our region than is widely known and have included stories about rumors of people who could kill a rattlesnake by spitting, a hailstorm in Thomasville that was supposed to have knocked the eyes out of goldfish in a pond, or the frog houses Alabama children make with cold mud.  Quoted in a 1999 article for Current magazine, Windham said of her storytelling, ``It preserves a part of our Southern history maybe, our heritage. We need to know where we came from.'' I could not agree with her more. Kathryn Tucker Windham will leave an important legacy as a trailblazing female journalist and a chronicler of life in Alabama that I greatly admire.  I join Kathryn's three children, Kathryn Tabb Windham, Amasa Benjamin Windham, Jr., and Helen Ann Windham Hilley, and her two grandsons, David Wilson Windham and Benjamin Douglas Hilley in wishing Mrs. Windham a happy 90th birthday. Mrs. Windham is a special and unique lady, and I wish her the very best.                          ____________________
