 President, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC, is currently considering the renewal of the California Department of Water Resources, DWR, license for the Oroville Facilities hydroelectric project in Butte County, CA.  DWR is exempt from paying State, local, or a Federal tax associated with the Oroville Project and has not compensated Butte County for the services it provides for the project and its visitors. Butte County believes the relicensing is an opportunity to mitigate the county's revenue losses, which are estimated at nearly $6.9 million per year.  FERC's Final Environmental Impact Statement also acknowledges that the Oroville Project has a negative fiscal impact on Butte County.  I have sent a letter to FERC asking that they consider efforts to mitigate Butte County's revenue loss and treat all parties equitably during the Oroville Project relicensing proceedings, and I ask unanimous consent to have text of this letter printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                                Washington, DC, December 13, 2007.     Chairman Joseph T. Kelliher,     Commissioner Suedeen G. Kelly,     Commissioner Philip Moeller,     Commissioner Marc Spitzer,     Commissioner John Wellinghoff,     Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Kelliher and Commissioners: I am writing in      regards to the relicensing proceedings for the Oroville      Facilities hydroelectric project (Project P-2100) currently      before the Commission. As you know, Butte County is required      to provide services associated with the Oroville Facilities      Project and its visitors, including law enforcement, fire and      rescue, and road maintenance services.       The Commission's Final Environmental Impact Statement      acknowledges the negative net fiscal impact the Oroville      Facilities Project may impose on Butte County. As you prepare      your final decision regarding the relicensing, I encourage      you to consider efforts to mitigate the County's revenue      loss. I am hopeful that all parties involved with the      relicensing of the Oroville Facilities will be regarded      equitably. Thank you for your attention to this matter.           Sincerely,                                                 Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senator.                          ____________________
