 President, I today offer my support for the conference report on the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. Simply put, this legislation represents the first, and most critical, step towards bringing our national security structure into the 21st Century.  I begin by offering my thanks, and praise, to Senators Susan Collins and Joe Lieberman. This bill would never have been done without their extraordinary work.
