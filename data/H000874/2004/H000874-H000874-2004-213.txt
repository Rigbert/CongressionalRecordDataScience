I want to, on behalf of the gentleman from New York (Mr. Rangel), state our appreciation for that consideration. It is my understanding the gentleman is going to Normandy with the Speaker and they will not return until approximately 5 or so Tuesday afternoon, so that meeting at 6 o'clock would have been difficult. We appreciate the consideration that has been given.  Mr. DeLAY. If the gentleman will yield further, I might also add that the jobs bill contemplated by the chairman will probably be introduced by tomorrow. So Members will have at least over the weekend a chance to look at the bill before the markup of the committee.
