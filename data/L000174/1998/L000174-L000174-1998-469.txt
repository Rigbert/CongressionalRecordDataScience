 However, for our family this has been a time of remembering more than mourning, and that is the way she would have wanted it.  Cecile was a beloved mother to my wife, Marcelle, and her brothers, Rene and Claude, a loving and loved grandmother to Kevin, Mark, and Alicia Leahy, and Mark and Paul Pomerleau, to the spouses of her grandchildren, to nephews and nieces, and adopted daughter Sister Consolata--and without a doubt, the best mother-in-law I could have.  For Cecile, family, above all else, was her world. Even in her final illness, her ailments seemed to melt away when Marcelle was there to care for her or when she knew her sons were arriving to be with her, when Kevin and Christianna visited and brought her home, when Mark and Kristine sat with her as they planned their new life together. A very special visitor was her ``favorite'' and only granddaughter, Alicia. Trips from Chicago by Mark and Paul Pomerleau meant so much to her.  I so greatly benefited from her love and our daily talks and visits--and had in her the most loyal and accepting of any constituent! Even when I thought I did poorly in a Senate debate, she was there to tell me I really won.  At her funeral, our son, Mark, talked of living with his grandmother while going to school. Here was a strong willed, young teenager living with a grandmother who was comfortable in a different language and different customs from his own.  As he told us his story, with humor and love, we saw a grandmother wanting to move across generations to help her grandson--and a grandson meetingher at the generational chasm to accept her love. When he walked past the casket bidding farewell in French to his grandmother, all of us, through our tears, knew the bond.  Cecile nearly left us a decade earlier. The love, sacrifice and nursing skill of her daughter, brought her back to life and gave her those extra years of fulfillment.  I have often said that Marcelle's vocation as a registered nurse is aided by a God-given gift of healing. And no place was it more evident than when caring for her mother--indeed as she became her mother's mother.  Marcelle brought us the essence of her mother when she said the following in a memorial service for Cecile at the Goodwin House.  I was struck by one part of the history of her mother who had a professorship in music at the age of 17 but was told, of course, because of that generation, and especially being a woman, she would have to wait a year before she was old enough to go out into the world. Even though she had demonstrated the talent, genius, and everything necessary to get the professorship, she would have to wait 1 more year.  Knowing my mother-in-law, knowing her genius for music, I suspect that was a somewhat frustrating year and she probably watched the pages coming off the calendar.  I ask unanimous consent Marcelle Leahy's comments be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                        A Tribute to Our Mother       When I think of Mom, these words come to mind first:      Family, Faith, Music, Friends and French (Canadian). All of      these required loyalty and honesty, and then the strength she      had to follow her convictions and the promises she had made.       As children my brothers Rene, Claude and I grew up in a      home where all of these things became almost as one. Mom set      high standards for herself as well as others.       As a very young woman in Coaticook, Canada she earned her      professors degree in music when she was only 17. Even though      she was qualified to teach they wouldn't let her begin to      teach for a year when she would be that much older and more      mature.       Music was also to be the thing that brought Mom and Dad      together. Dad sang a concert in Sherbrooke, Canada and didn't      have an accompanist, so Mom was asked to accompany him on the      piano which she agreed to do. When she walked up to him that      evening wearing a long red taffeta dress he burst into song      and serenaded her (and everyone within hearing distance) with      ``Lady Lady in Red I adore you.'' I believe they were married      within the year.       Music was always a very large part of our lives. Mom taught      us all to play the piano as she did a countless number of      students over the next 70 years.       Do you have any idea what it is like to have the piano      teacher monitoring your practice sessions? Her voice would      come out of the kitchen as she prepared dinner. ``Claude you      aren't counting! Rene why can't you remember the key? and      Marcelle I told you not to practice that until you did 10      minutes of the exercises!'' I would seek my revenge by      playing Chopsticks! which was absolutely forbidden as that      was never considered classical music. The memories are      endless with all the novenas, Masses, weddings and, yes,      funerals she played for. She used to like to count the black      dresses at weddings and the red hats at funerals back in the      days when these weren't considered proper. Then all the      concerts we went to and, at the recitals where we had to      participate, always a nightmare for this participant, and      Saturday afternoon with the metropolitan opera blaring from      the radio throughout the house.       Some of my fondest memories are of the times we had all of      these things combined. Christmas was something else with      midnight Mass, Mom playing the organ, her two feet on the      pedals, one hand on the keys and the other in the air      directing the choir with a few head movements thrown in as      she sang as well. Dad would sing at least one solo and we      three kids would be singing in the choir too. For me this      was all great and exciting as it meant when it was all      over there would be our Reveillion at home.       Of course it was the family, the choir who were all our      friends but then more friends came and the priests too. There      would be singing, laughing, gifts, and food. Mom was known      for her tourtiere, tartelette, fruit cake and nut goodies, to      mention only a few things. She would have been preparing for      weeks and what a feast it would be, our beds wouldn't see us      until daylight!       There it was, Church, family, friends, music and French      Canadian heritage all wrapped into one glorious celebration.       I really need to talk more about the French, as it was a      large part of our lives from both of our parents. Our names      are French as though no one noticed!       Rene, Claude, Marcelle, they chose those for many reasons      but also because they don't change in the translation and we      were always going to go back and forth from French to      English. Mom never stopped thinking, speaking and counting in      French. She even preserved her accent all of these years.       She also never stopped trying to change things ``to the way      we did it in the Province of Quebec.'' You can just imagine      how that caused some fireworks between a mother and a      daughter when Patrick and I were planning our wedding.       Then it was the pronunciation of English words--why did      they (as in English speakers) have to do it that way? It just      didn't make sense. So, we had a phrase we liked to repeat      with her pronunciation. We're going to the Potomac eating a      banana from Panama.       Then there was the issue of Thanksgiving ``Why can't the      Americans celebrate it the same day as Canada? '' Oh well I      guess that was never a matter of discussion when our two      countries were deep into negotiations.       Mom taught my brothers and me many many things for which we      will always be grateful. I want to share with you one of the      things that she often said to me as I was growing up and she      taught me so well because she also lived her life this way.      ``Always treat people the way you would like to be treated      and you will never go wrong.'' Sounds easy and it isn't.       She was generosity, gentleness, loyalty, honesty and      strength in all that she did, teaching us well with her words      and her actions. All of this was intertwined with her love      for her family, faith and music her adopted country, not to      mention her great pride for son-in-law Patrick, Le Senateur,      and her grandchildren.       We have a lot to celebrate when our sadness diminishes and      we can dwell on her beautiful life and her strength in dying.      Mom's health problems started in 1989. It's been a long long      road to arrive to this day. She never lost her patience,      always kept smiling, never neglected to express her      appreciation, saying goodbye to her last piano student only      about a year ago and always with rosary in her hand.       Mom, your whole life was quite a concert. It was harmony      with your music, your family and friends and your God. We      will continue to sing your praises. Au revoir.
