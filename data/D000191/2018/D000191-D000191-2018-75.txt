Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment, although I am in favor of it.  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 minutes.  There was no objection.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment.  I actually, recently, had a conversation with the Acting FAA Administrator on this very subject. I think it is something that could help mitigate. Since we have moved to performance-based navigation and changed for more efficient approaches to safe fuel, the airlines are benefiting tremendously, but it has concentrated the noise over a narrow area.  I have also asked the FAA if it would be possible to vary the approaches on performance-based so that you are not always, every day, every hour, every minute, going over exactly the same position. I think that is also something they should look at.  Mr. Chairman, I certainly support this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.
