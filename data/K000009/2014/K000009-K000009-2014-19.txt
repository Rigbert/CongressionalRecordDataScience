What magnificent Americans these individuals were.  Mr. Speaker, it is my great honor to lay their life stories in the Congressional Record.  Mr. Speaker, as we come to this Season of Thanksgiving, a time to celebrate the precious gifts of family, friends, community, and country, please allow me to pay special tribute of gratitude to some outstanding Northwest Ohio citizens whose lives made a significant contribution to building a better community and America. We honor them for who they were and what they contributed to the betterment of our lives together in what some have called our beloved community.  In particular, Mr. Speaker, please let me recognize for outstanding character and achievement:  Business leader Barry Greenblatt, founder of Barry Bagels. Without a doubt, Barry's ebullient personality, creativity, and work ethic produced a business, founded in 1972, that anchored Toledo and Southeast Michigan in their very hearts. Without question, Barry Bagels are the best in America. His deli counter became part of the Toledo and Ann Arbor scenes, appreciated and always dependable. Barry's generosity extended far beyond the walls of his business. His charity was as boundless as his broad smile. He was always collecting for some needy cause--sick children, peace in the Middle East, local ball clubs and youth groups. He worked in his business, hands on, year after year. He was indefatigable. He made an effort to employ local youth and touched the lives of thousands of our fellow citizens with his good humor and community-minded. What a likable human being was he. Customers could often find Barry behind the counter, his happy banter infectious.  Quick to lend a hand, participate in an event, lead an effort or help a friend, Barry Greenblatt was held in high esteem by all who were lucky to know him. He was the perfect example of a compassionate businessman whose focus was on his family, his employees and his community. We shall always remember Barry's smiling face and golden heart. May his wife, children and grandchildren draw strength from his legacy achievements. We join our spirits with theirs and shall deeply miss him.  Mrs. T. Jean Overton was a pioneering woman who gladly assumed the role of Mother for our Community. Jean never stopped giving--to her family, her church, her neighborhood, her community, and to every person whose path she crossed. A talent and broadcast pioneer and graduate of the University of Toledo, in 1952 Jean was the first African American woman to broadcast on Toledo area airwaves. She went on to work for many more years in broadcasting and public relations, but also moved into public service.  Following the Civil Rights movement of the 1960's, Jean assumed leadership roles in Model Cities and other programs to revitalize Toledo's neighborhoods, with a particular dedication to North Toledo. Jean was a leader. Always with grace, she attended community meetings, founded organizations, counseled youth, testified at public forums, fought the abuses of poverty and discrimination, and ministered to forgotten people and places. Her spirituality, perseverance, and genuine concern were evident and made a difference. Appointed to the Ohio Public Health Council in 1971, Jean led an effort to organize an association for people with sickle cell anemia. Jean was also a neighborhood activist throughout her life. As her son succinctly described Jean, ``She would want to be remembered as a mother, first and foremost. And someone who would rather give than receive, to be honest. She was a mother to Toledo.'' Toledo is a better place because Jean Overton made her life here with us. May God grant her a peaceful rest and bring comfort to her dear family and all those who loved her.  Chuck Peyton truly was a man for others. As a Navy veteran, councilman, municipal administrator and then three term mayor of Waterville, Ohio, Chuck logged four decades of public service. With an easy smile and ability to listen, he happily devoted his years to building a stronger community and country. He was a storyteller, enjoyable company to young and old. His travels as a deep sea diver equipped him with harrowing and adventuresome tales.  Committed to public transit, and understanding the needs of the disabled as he bore lifetime mobility challenges from an accident, he served 18 years as a trustee for the Toledo Area Regional Transit Authority for eighteen years. His public service also included various county positions and administration in the Ohio Department of Transportation's Northwest Ohio district office.  Chuck Peyton knew how to achieve progress. He was always thinking forward, whether it was modernizing regional public transit or visioning the new U.S. 24 route between Ohio and Indiana to relieve dangerous conditions on the old Route 24. Our community is better because Chuck Peyton lived among us, and cared about us. May his lovely wife Diane, family, and friends draw comfort from their memories of his living legacy of love and devotion to duty.  Robert O'Connell was ``an icon of local tennis.'' He was a history teacher and renowned tennis coach at Ottawa Hills High School, retiring in 1988. A master of the game, he coached many young people to outstanding high school and college careers, imbuing them with a love of the game. A testament to his character and his coaching is the high regard with which his athletes still hold him. In 2006, the Ottawa Hills tennis courts were named in Robert O'Connell's honor. Even with all of the local and statewide accolades, Robert O'Connell's greatest legacy is his family. We shall not forget this champion.  Sheryl Shipman dedicated her career to ensuring recreational opportunities for children, older adults and people with special needs. She served as a supervisor and manager in Toledo's Recreation Department until illness overcame her. Through several city administrations and many budget challenges, Sherrie fought for the initiatives she developed for people to play in Toledo's pools, parks, ice rinks, baseball diamonds and community centers. One of her colleagues explained, ``She felt all the children of Toledo were her children. That's what allowed her to be a force to be reckoned with.'' Sherrie Shipman's tireless efforts on behalf of others earned her respect and admiration and will not soon be forgotten. Her son summed it up by saying, ``She was a leader, and people trusted her.''  Finally, Samuel Szor, ``Mr. Music.'' Born in Toledo's Birmingham neighborhood, Sam's musical talents were soon recognized. A high school standout, Sam performed as part of the University of Michigan Marching Band while earning two degrees. He came home to teach, inspiring students and community alike. Sam began Toledo's famed outdoor summer concert series, ``Music Under the Stars'' in the Toledo Zoo's amphitheater. For more than sixty years under his baton, Sam delighted and dazzled summer concertgoers with this brilliance. An accomplished musician in this own right, Sam performed with the Toledo Symphony Orchestra, eventually leading it himself in the Casual Concerts program of popular and classical music. He also conducted the Perrysburg Symphony Orchestra for twenty years. He directed the First Congregational Church motet choir for 37 years. For 53 years Sam led the Toledo Choral Society in its annual December presentation of Handel's ``Messiah.'' A true visionary, Sam Szor enjoyed iconic status in his lifetime. His imprimatur in our community is everywhere as his career was writ large. The gifts he gave us are truly priceless and we will long remember our very own ``Mr. Music.''                          ____________________
