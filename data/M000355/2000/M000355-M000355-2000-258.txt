 2280. A bill to provide for the effective punishment of online child molesters; to the Committee on the Judiciary.                 cybermolesters enforcement act of 2000  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, as we are all aware, the Internet has revolutionized communication and business. However, it also provides a new tool for some very traditional villains: child molesters. Unfortunately, loopholes in the current law allow some of these predators to escape without any real consequences. For this reason I have introduced the Cybermolesters Enforcement Act to ensure that these new on-line molesters are brought to justice.  It is already a federal crime to cross state lines to sexually molest a minor. In recent years the number of people using the Internet to violate this law has skyrocketed. In the last two years alone the FBI's cybermolester caseload his increased by 550 percent.  Most cybermolesters are well-educated, middle-class, and have no previous criminal record. As a result, many judges are giving them laughably light sentences. Ironically, the purveyors of child-pornography receive a ten-year mandatory sentence, but those who use the Internet to meet children and act out pornographic fantasies often receive no jail time at all. We need to end the double standard that gives lighter sentences to a special set of privileged criminals.
