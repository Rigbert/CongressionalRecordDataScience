Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time, and I congratulate him and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Stupak) and others on both sides of the aisle for sponsoring this amendment.  Mr. Chairman, this should not be, in my opinion, a hard decision for us to make. The risk is too great, when you consider the damage a spill would cause to one of the world's environmental treasures. Twenty percent of the world's fresh water is contained in the Great Lakes. It is much too precious to risk for additional drilling. And what would that drilling get us? The existing 13 wells have produced enough over their lifetime to provide only approximately a quarter of 1 day's use of natural gas in this country, and only approximately 2 percent of 1 day's use of petroleum. At what cost? I cannot imagine what type of drilling would have to occur to make a serious dent in Michigan's energy needs.  Since receiving criticism for taking the hard road of production versus conservation, the Bush administration has tried to say nice things about conservation. But the facts are clear: the Bush budget proposed to cut the Department of Energy's renewable energy and efficiency programs by almost 30 percent. It cut innovative technologies like wind, solar, and hydroelectric research by 50 percent. The American people clearly do not want to see a policy of drilling at all costs, and the people of Michigan do not want it either.  I urge my colleagues to support this very excellent amendment.
