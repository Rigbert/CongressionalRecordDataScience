But      it is also true that judges who would wipe out our hard-     fought legal victories--no matter where they were born or      what color their skin--are not role models for our children.      And they are not the kind of judges we want on the federal      courts.       Miguel Estrada is a successful lawyer, and he has powerful      friends who are trying to get him a lifetime job as a federal      judge. Many of them talk about him being a future Supreme      Court justice. Shouldn't we be proud of him?       I for one am not too proud of a man who is unconcerned      about the discrimination that many Latinos live with every      day. I am not especially proud of a man whose political     friends--the ones fighting hardest to put him on the court--     are also fighting to abolish affirmative action and to make      it harder if not impossible for federal courts to protect the      rights and safety of workers and women and anyone with little      power and only the hope of the courts to protect their legal      rights.       Just as we resist the injustice of racial profiling and the      assumption that we are lesser individuals because of where we      were born or the color of our skin, so too must we resist the      urge to endorse a man on the basis of his ethnic background.       Are these groups fighting Miguel Estrada because they are      somehow anti-Hispanic? Are they saying that only people with      certain political views are ``true'' Latinos? Of course not.      They are saying that as a judge this man would do damage to      the rights we have fought so hard to obtain, and that we      cannot ignore that fact just because he is Latino. I think      Cesar Chavez would be turning over in his grave if he knew      that a candidate like this would be celebrated for supposedly      representing the Hispanic community. He would also be      dismayed that any civil rights organization would stay silent      or back such a candidate.  I deeply resent the charges leveled by Republicans that those opposing this nomination are anti-Latino or anti-Hispanic. As we began this debate about 2 weeks ago, I urged Republicans who said such things to apologize for these baseless and divisive charges. They have yet to do so. Because they have not apologized for these baseless charges, it prompted the League of Latin American Citizens, an organization that has supported this nomination, to write to the Senate to protest the charges leveled without basis by Republicans. I emphasize the League of United Latin American Citizens, which supports Mr. Estrada's nomination, has written to the Senate to protest the charges of bias leveled without basis by some Republicans.  Hector Flares, the LULAC National President wrote on February 12:       [W]e are alarmed by suggestions from some of the backers of      Mr. Estrada that the Senate Democrats and the members of the      Congressional Hispanic Caucus are opposing his nomination      because of his race, ethnicity or an anti-Hispanic bias. We      do not subscribe to this view at all and we do not wish to be      associated with such accusations.       LULAC has had a long and productive working relationship      with many Senate Democrats and all of the members of the      Congressional Hispanic Caucus and our experience is that they      would never oppose any nominee because of his or her race or      ethnicity. On the contrary, it is most often the Democratic      members of the Senate who support LULAC's priority issues. .      . .  I thank LULAC for disassociating itself with the base political efforts of Republicans to accuse those who oppose this nomination as doing so based on race or ethnicity. On the contrary, it is most often the Democratic Members of the Senate who support Hispanic priority issues.  I thank LULAC for disassociating itself with the base political efforts of some Republicans who accuse those who oppose this nomination of doing so based on race or ethnicity. I renew my request for an apology for all the statements made in connection with the Senate debate that suggest those opposed to this nomination are anti-Hispanic.  I think perhaps we should go back to a different time, a time when I first came to the Senate, when Republicans and Democrats assumed the best motives of patriotism and honesty on the part of each other; when you did not hear attacks made on people saying they are anti this race or that race or anti this religion or that religion. I am concerned.  I will speak only for myself, not for other Senators, but I look back at 29 years in the Senate, a record of one who I think has always stood for antidiscrimination, one who has a record where I have never questioned the race, ethnicity, or religion of anybody else. When I hear charges that opposition to a candidate, in this case opposition to a candidate that has divided the American people, is done on the basis of that person's race, I find that more than distasteful, I find it wrong. In the same way, I found wrong the attacks on my religion by some in the Republican Party because of opposition to 1 of this President's more than 100 nominees, especially since I made it very clear in my statements on this floor that I never once considered religion or the background of any nominee for anything--nominees from either Republican or Democratic administrations. Not in any of the thousands upon thousands of nominees of both Republican and Democratic Presidents that I voted for have I ever once considered their religious background. So I find it distasteful when my religion is attacked by members of the Republican caucus, and I find it distasteful when members of that caucus attack Democrats on the claim that their principled opposition to this nomination is anti-Hispanic. I think the largest Hispanic organization supporting Mr. Estrada made it very clear they resent it, too. I join with them on that.  We know Mr. Estrada's short legal career has been successful. By all accounts he is a good appellate lawyer and legal advocate. He has had a series of prestigious positions and is professionally and financially successful. In my case, as the grandson of immigrants, as a son, a father and grandfather, I know no matter the country of origin or economic background that a family takes pride in the success of its children. Mr. Estrada's family has much to be proud of in his accomplishments, no matter what happens to this nomination.  He is now 41 years old. He has a successful legal career in a prominent corporate law firm, which was the firm of President Reagan's first Attorney General, William French Smith, and that of President Bush's current Solicitor General, Ted Olson. I am told that Mr. Olson, along with Kenneth Starr, have been among Mr. Estrada's conservative mentors. At his relatively young age, Mr. Estrada has become a partner in the law firm of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, having previously worked with the Wall Street law firm of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz.  While in private practice, his clients included major investment banks and health care providers. Mr. Estrada's financial statement, which Senator Hatch had printed in the Congressional Record, says he earned more than $\1/2\ million a year 2 years ago.  At his hearing, Mr. Estrada testified:       I have never known what it is to be poor, and I am very      thankful to my parents for that. And I have never known what      it is to be incredibly rich either, or even very rich, or      rich.  I will let his financial statement speak for itself on that point. Half a million dollars a year in my State does put you in the upper brackets.  So he is a well-compensated lawyer in a first-rate law firm. His family and friends take pride in his success, and rightfully so.  In his almost 6 years with Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, with its thriving appellate court practice, developed by its senior partner, Ted Olson, who was confirmed to be Solicitor General in June 2001, Mr. Estrada has had one argument before the Supreme Court--just one. That was in connection with a habeas petition on which he worked pro bono when he first came to the firm. It is one of the only pro bono cases he has taken in his entire legal career, according to his testimony.  I am about to yield the floor. I note one thing, some of the speeches on the other side of the aisle make you think everyone opposes the efforts of Democrats to get answers to fair questions and review documents provided in past nominations. Especially in the case where a supervisor has called into question a nominee's ability to be fair, that is all the more reason we should see what he did. There is also ample precedent for the Senate Judiciary Committee examining memos written by Department of Justice attorneys, including Assistant Solicitor Generals--like Mr. Estrada was--in connection with nominations to either lifetime or short-term appointments, such as in the nominations of Robert Bork, William Rehnquist, Brad Reynolds, Stephen Trott, and Benjamin Civiletti.  There have been a number of papers and published editorials and op-eds supporting our efforts to know more about Mr. Estrada before we give him a lifetime seat, before we could never question him again, before we put him, for a lifetime, on one of the most powerful courts of the country.  On February 4, Senator Hatch said, and I will paraphrase: Mr. Estrada is not nominated to the Supreme Court--of course he is right--but his nomination may be even more important because the Supreme Court hears only about 90 cases per year while the DC Circuit issues nearly 1,500 decisions per year. These decisions affect the rights of working people and the environmental rights of all people. The Senate must not be a rubberstamp.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record some of the editorials in favor of the position the Democrats have taken here. Just to name a few, we have editorials from the New York Times, the Boston Globe, and the Rutland Daily Herald, among others, as well as op-ed from the Washington Post and Wall Street Journal, and letters to the editor of the Washington Post, disagreeing with their earlier editorial--touted by Republicans this morning--urging an immediate vote in spite of the precedent for requesting documents and getting answers to questions before giving someone such an important job.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, Feb. 13, 2003]                   Keep Talking About Miguel Estrada       The Bush administration is missing the point in the Senate      battle over Miguel Estrada, its controversial nominee to the      powerful D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. Democrats who have      vowed to filibuster the nomination are not engaging in      ``shameful politics,'' as the president has put it, nor are      they anti-Latino, as Republicans have cynically charged. They      are insisting that the White House respect the Senate's role      in confirming judicial nominees.       The Bush administration has shown no interest in working      with Senate Democrats to select nominees who could be      approved by consensus, and has dug in its heels on its most      controversial choices. At their confirmation hearings,      judicial nominees have refused to answer questions about      their views on legal issues. And Senate Republicans have      rushed through the procedures on controversial nominees.       Mr. Estrada embodies the White House's scorn for the      Senate's role. Dubbed the ``stealth candidate,'' he arrived      with an extremely conservative reputation but almost no paper      trail. He refused to answer questions, and although he had      written many memorandums as a lawyer in the Justice      Department, the White House refused to release them.       The Senate Democratic leader, Tom Daschle, insists that the      Senate be given the information it needs to evaluate Mr.      Estrada. He says there cannot be a vote until senators are      given access to Mr. Estrada's memorandums and until they get      answers to their questions. The White House can call this      politics or obstruction. But in fact it is senators doing      their jobs.                                  ____                 [From the Boston Globe, Feb. 15, 2003]                             Rush to Judges       The Senate Judiciary Committee ought to come with a warning      sign: Watch out for fast-moving judicial nominees. Controlled      by Republicans, the committee is approving President Bush's      federal court nominees at speeds that defy common sense.       One example is Miguel Estrada, nominated to the US Court of      Appeals for the District of Columbia. Nominated in May 2001,      Estrada had been on a slow track, his conservative views      attracting concern and criticism.       Some Republicans called Democrats anti-Hispanic for      challenging Estrada. He came to the United States from      Honduras at the age of 17, improved his English, earned a      college degree from Columbia, a law degree from Harvard, and      served as a Supreme Court clerk for Justice Anthony Kennedy.       What has raised red flags is Estrada's refusal to answer      committee members' questions about his legal views or to      provide documents showing his legal work. This prompted the      Senate minority leader, Thomas Daschle, to conclude that      Estrada either ``knows nothing or he feels he needs to hide      something.''       Nonetheless, Estrada's nomination won partisan committee      approval last month. All 10 Republicans voted for him; all      nine Democrats voted against. On Tuesday Senate Democrats      began to filibuster Estrada's nomination, a dramatic move to      block a full Senate vote that could trigger waves of      political vendettas.       It's crucial to evaluate candidates based on their merits      and the needs of the country.       Given that the electorate was divided in 2000, it's clear      that the country is a politically centrist place that should      have mainstream judges, especially since many of these      nominees could affect the next several decades of legal life      in the United States.       Further, this is a nation that believes in protecting      workers' rights, especially in the aftermath of Enron. It's      an America that struggles with the moral arguments over      abortion but largely accepts a woman's right to make a      private choice. It's an America that believes in civil rights      and its power to put a Colin Powell on the international      stage.       Does Estrada meet these criteria? He isn't providing enough      information to be sure. And the records of some other      nominees fail to meet these standards.       Debating the merits of these nominees is also crucial      because some, like Estrada, could become nominees for the      Supreme Court.       The choir--Democrats, civil rights groups, labor groups,      and women's groups--is already singing about how modern-day      America should have modern-day judges. It's time for moderate      Republicans and voters to join in so that the president can't      ignore democracy's 21st-century judicial needs.                                  ____             [From the Wall Street Journal, Feb. 20, 2003]                    Symmetry in Judicial Nominations       The White House has a message for Democratic senators tying      up its judicial nominations: we won the election, you're      thwarting the people's will.       Not quite. Never mind it was an evenly divided electorate.      The selection of judges was a non-issue. George W. Bush      didn't even mention the topic in his speech at the GOP's      Philadelphia convention or in his acceptance remarks when he      finally emerged victorious--thanks to judges--after Florida.       In two of the three debates, judicial selections weren't      mentioned. In the other, candidate Bush, while ducking the      question of whether all his judicial appointments would be      anti-abortion, insisted he wouldn't have any litmus tests.      But he declared that, unlike Vice President Gore, he would      not appoint judicial activists; judges, he declared, ``ought      not take the place'' of Congress. As the president accuses      Democrats of playing politics, however, he nominates almost      nothing but pro-life judges and passionate activists of a      conservative stripe.       For all the emotions judicial appointments arouse on both      sides, the political implications for senators are wildly      exaggerated. Over the past several decades the only one who      lost an election because of a judicial vote was Illinois      Democrat Alan Dixon, defeated in a primary after he voted to      confirm Clarence Thomas for the Supreme Court. What these      battles are about is energizing the base; that's why during      presidential campaigns they are retail, not wholesale,      issues.       Currently, Senate Democrats are staging a mini-filibuster      over the nomination of movement conservative Miguel Estrada      for the U.S. Court of Appeals to the dismay of not only      Republicans but many editorial writers. How dare they employ      politics! In these matters there should be a simple test:      symmetry. Or, as former Clinton Solicitor General Walter      Dellinger declares, ``Whatever factor a President may      properly consider, senators should also consider.'' Since      ideology clearly is the guiding force behind the slate of      Bush circuit court nominees, it's perfectly appropriate for      Senate Democrats to sue the same standard.       That's certainly the criterion Republicans used in the      Clinton years. Orrin Hatch is outraged at Democrats'      insistence that nominee Miguel Estrada, who refuses to      express an opinion on any Supreme Court decision, be more      forthcoming. Yet it was only a few years ago that the same      Utah Republican was insisting on the need ``to review . . .       nominees with great specificity.''       In 1996 Sen. Hatch decried two Clinton, judicial nominees      as ``activists who would legislate from the bench.'' Later,      the then Senate Republican leader, Trent Lott, left no doubt      that it was ideology that prompted his objections to the      ``judicial philosophies and likely activism'' of prospective      judges.       Judicial activism used to be a term reserved for liberals.      Now much activism on the bench comes from the right, often,      in the words candidate Bush used to attack liberals, in the      form of judges who ``subvert'' the legislature. In recent      years, congressional measures such as the Americans with      Disabilities Act, legislation to oppose violence against      women and to increase gun control have been gutted by      conservative judges.       As Indiana law professor and former Clinton Justice      Department official Dawn Johnson chronicled in a Washington      Monthly piece last year, the right-wing Federalist Society-     agenda envisions an activist judiciary that would roll back      many of the guarantees enacted by Congress under the Commerce      Clause and the 14th Amendment.       A contemporary example is Jeffrey Sutton, a brainy legal      scholar nominated for the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.      Mr. Sutton clearly is qualified but just as clearly would      turn back the clock on protecting people with disabilities.      Should senators who care about disability rights simply      ignore his ideology?       The right claims that central to the Democrats' opposition      to these nominees is abortion. And it's true that, more than      any other issue, abortion remains a litmus test for both      sides. Almost all the Bush circuit-court nominees have been      pro-life and a high percentage of the Clinton appointments      were pro-choice. But, as Mr. Sutton's selection shows, the      issues are much broader than the disproportionate influence      placed on abortion.       In the Estrada fight, some Republicans also allege an anti-     Hispanic motive. Opposition to his nominees sends ``the wrong      message to Hispanic communities,'' charges Georgia Sen. Saxby      Chambliss. For the record, Mr. Bush has nominated one      Hispanic judge to the circuit courts; President Clinton      nominated 11. Three of the Clinton nominations were killed by      Senate Republicans. Were they racially motivated? That makes      as much sense as the Estrada charges.       To be sure, the Democrats play the same games, though the      Clinton nominees, as a whole, were nowhere near as      ideological as the Bush picks. But there is some overreach;      the Democrats' efforts to get Mr. Estrada's private notes      when he worked in the solicitor general's office would set a      bad precedent.       Thoughtful people on both sides of the aisle worry about      these perpetual battles. Mr. Dellinger, for one, notes that      if the focus     is only on ``noncontroversial,'' selections, the result      chiefly would be courts full of ``relatively undistinguished      lawyers lacking any substantial record of creative      scholarship or advocacy.'' Instead, he proposes a more      constructive solution. Opposition leaders in the Senate would      develop a short list of distinguished scholars and      practitioners for the president to submit for the courts of      appeal. There is a precedent: President Bush last year      renominated Clinton nominee, Roger Gregory, the first African      American on the Fourth Circuit, in to win acceptance for his      other nominees.       Currently, Mr. Dellinger says if Senate Democrats proposed      a ``distinguished'' nominee like former Solicitor General      Seth Waxman for the U.S. Circuit Court, a deal could be      crafted whereby he and Bush nominees Mr. Estrada and John      Roberts are promptly confirmed. Republicans still would hold      the upper hand, but the rightward rush would be modified.       It makes a lot of sense and would result in a better      judiciary. But the activists on both sides have little      interest; it wouldn't energize their bases.                                  ____             [From the Rutland Daily Herald, Feb. 24, 2003]                            Partisan Warfare       Senate Democrats are expected to continue their filibuster      this week against the appointment of Miguel Estrada, a 41-     year-old lawyer whom President Bush has named to the federal      appeals court in Washington, D.C.       Sen. Patrick Leahy, ranking Democrat on the Judiciary      Committee, is in the middle of the fight over the Estrada      appointment. He and his fellow Democrats should hold firm      against the Estrada nomination.       Much is at stake in the Estrada case, most importantly the      question of whether the Democrats have the resolve to resist      the efforts of the Bush administration to pack the judiciary      with extreme conservative judges.       The problem with the Estrada nomination is that Estrada has      no record as a judge, and senators on the Judiciary Committee      do not believe he has been sufficiently forthcoming about his      views. It is their duty to advise and consent on judicial      nominees, and Estrada has given them no basis for deciding      whether to consent.       President Bush has called the Democrats' opposition to      Estrada disgraceful, and his fellow Republicans have made the      ludicrous charge that, in opposing Estrada, the Democrats are      anti-Hispanic. For a party on record against affirmative      action, the Republicans are guilty of cynical racial politics      for nominating Estrada in the first place. He has little to      qualify him for the position except that he is Hispanic.       Unless the Democrats are willing to stand firm against      Bush's most extreme nominations, Bush will have the      opportunity to push the judiciary far to the right of the      American people. Leahy, for one, has often urged Bush to send      to the Senate moderate nominees around whom Democrats and      Republicans could form a consensus. In a nation and a      Congress that is evenly divided politically, moderation makes      sense.       But Bush's Justice Department is driven by conservative      idealogues who see no reason for compromise. That being the      case, the Senate Democrats have no choice but to hold the      line against the most extreme nominees.       Leahy has drawn much heat for opposing Bush's nominees. But      he has opposed only three. In his tenure as chairman of the      committee, he sped through to confirmation far more nominees      than his Republican predecessor had done. But for the Senate      merely to rubber stamp the nominees sent their way by the      White House would be for the Senate to surrender its      constitutional role as a check on the excesses of the      executive.       The Republicans are accusing the Democrats of partisan      politics. Of course, the Republicans are expert at the game,      refusing even to consider numerous nominees sent to the      Senate by President Clinton.       The impasse over Estrada is partisan politics of an      important kind. The Republicans must not be allowed to shame      the Democrats into acquiescence. For the Democrats to give in      would be for them to surrender to the fierce partisanship of      the Republicans.       The wars over judicial nominees are likely to continue as      long as Bush, with the help of Attorney General John      Ashcroft, believes it is important to fill the judiciary with      extreme right-wing judges.       The Democrats, of course, would like nothing better than to      approve the nomination of a Hispanic judge. But unless the      nominee is qualified, doing so would be a form of racial      pandering. That is the game in which the Republicans are      engaged, and the Democrats must not allow it to succeed.
