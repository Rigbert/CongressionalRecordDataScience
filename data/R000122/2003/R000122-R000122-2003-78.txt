President, I rise today to pay tribute to James D. Bennett, Jr., an outstanding public servant who is retiring after a distinguished career spanning more than 34 years as a firefighter in the capital city of Providence, RI.  James Bennett began his career as a Providence firefighter in August of 1968, quickly rising through the ranks becoming lieutenant in December of 1977, captain in February of 1984, and ultimately he was promoted to the coveted rank of battalion chief in April of 1986.  Chief Bennett's illustrious career has been marked with a special dedication to his brethren firefighters, and to seeking out leadership opportunities and specialized training for himself and the department. He completed numerous Federal, State, municipal and professional association training programs, courses and workshops on fire and safety issues. A member of the Fire Department Safety Officers Association and International Association of Fire Chiefs, he served from 1977 to 1982 as president Providence Local 99 of the International Brotherhood of Firefighters.  As a community and as a Nation, it is most fitting that we pause to reflect upon the contribution of those in our society from whom we ask so much. With selflessness, dedication and great personal sacrifice firefighters answer the call each and every day, putting themselves in harm's way to protectand defend lives and property of our citizens. With courage, compassion and devotion to duty they epitomize the phrase ``public servant.'' Indeed, I am honored to humbly recognize this noble profession and this outstanding individual, Chief James Bennett, on the occasion of his retirement.  I ask that you join me in paying tribute to Chief Bennett on this milestone and ask that you also recognize his devoted wife Kaiji who this June retired from her own career as an elementary school secretary after many years of loyal service. As a grateful community we recognize the immense contributions made by people like James and Kaija Bennett to the cherished quality of life in this great Nation. Please join me and the Bennett's wonderful daughters, Kerrie and Stacie, their many friends and colleagues in this much deserved retirement celebration.                          ____________________
