  Well, technically that is correct, if you consider allowing existing tax law to sunset on December 31, 2010. If you do that, we are going to have the biggest tax increase in the history of the country without a vote of Congress, without a vote of any of us, the biggest tax increase in the history of the country, January 1, 2011. This budget covers that period of time. I don't know how you can say there is no tax increase in this budget, if we are going to have the biggest tax increase in the history of the Congress without a vote of the people, if you have an opportunity to do something about it and keep taxes where they presently are. That is what is in this budget. There is not going to be an attempt to keep taxes where they are so the existing tax laws sunset and we have the biggest tax increase in the history of the country, January 1, 2011.  We have a budget by the majority party, the Democratic Party, before us because the people spoke in November. For the first time in 12 years, the Democrats are in the majority and, consequently, control the congressional budget process. As ranking Republican on the tax-writing Finance Committee, I was not consulted, nor did I expect to be, by the chairman of this year's budget resolution. Unfortunately, after reviewing this resolution, which was presented 5 days ago, it is abundantly clear it does not realistically address the possibilities of the Finance Committee carrying out what are its supposed responsibilities under this budget resolution.  Despite claims to the contrary, this budget does not provide for even 1 year of alternative minimum tax relief, let alone 2 years, or even a 1-year extension of provisions of various tax laws that expire from time to time and that we normally reinstitute. It does not provide for that as well. So this budget puts the burden on the Finance Committee to come up with the offsets to pay for the alternative minimum tax relief and for what we refer to as extenders, things that are normally extended by the Congress because they are things the economy demands be extended.  Press reports have largely echoed the defenders of this resolution on the needs of the Finance Committee. I strongly suggest the media folks take a very careful look at the claims of the Democratic leadership and see how they stack up against the cold, hard fiscal numbers and the operating history of the Finance Committee in these policy areas. They would find it does not square with the reality of what is possible for the Finance Committee.  I back up that statement with these numbers. Over the 5-year budget window going out to the year 2012, keeping existing policies in place will have a revenue effect of about $916 billion. This includes alternative minimum tax relief, extension of bipartisan 2001 and 2003 tax relief, and extending other broadly supported expiring provisions. In the aggregate, this budget provides no resources for extending these policies over the 5-year window. In so doing, we end up with the biggest tax increase in the history of the country without Congress voting for it. Yet somehow the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee can say there are no tax increases in this budget.  I go back to the grassroots. As a family farmer, which I am, I like to think we country folk can teach city folk a lesson or two by referring to the country's sayings and metaphors. Although I am going to be using numbers, you will recognize some rural touchstones in the chart I am using, which is this chart of a well where you get water. The first chart involves the method a lot of us farmers use to get our water, through the well on our family farm. You will see the well in this chart.  Here is the top of the well. My colleagues can see it is a long well and a very deep well. There is some water way down at the very bottom, but most of this well in between is very dry. At the top of the well we see the number that represents the rough--and it is probably a bit on the low side--amount of the revenue raisers in this budget, and it assumes we on the Finance Committee will be able to find $916 billion. That is revenue we would have to find offsets for over a 5-year period to pay for extending existing tax policies that expire during this period. If we don't do it, that is where I continue to make the point we are going to have the biggest tax increase in the history of the country.  Of course, this is talking about existing tax policy. It doesn't even include any new starters such as tax relief to encourage renewable energy which most Members of this body are talking about, or tax relief to help education which a lot of Members of this body, including this Senator, have talked about, and a lot of new starters such as providing tax benefits to help the health care problem. A lot of us in this body talk about that. It doesn't include renewable energy, education, and health care. So this budget assumes the well of revenue raisers is full to the brim. We can see it is not.  As a farmer, I know something about the predictability of wells. You hopeyou will get a lot of rain and it will give you a decent level of water. As former chairman and now, because we Republicans are in the minority, ranking member of the Finance Committee, I think I know something about revenue raisers and how difficult or how easy it might be to raise a certain amount of revenue. I have been there. I have done that. When I was chairman of the Finance Committee, I aggressively led efforts to identify and enact sensible revenue raisers and at closing the tax gap and shutting down tax shelters. As ranking member, I continue to look for ways to shut off unintended tax benefits. I consider myself to be a credible authority on what is realistic when it comes to revenue raisers.  This budget is not realistic. From 2001 through 2006, Congress enacted over 100 offsets with combined revenue scores of $1.7 billion over 1 year, $51.5 billion over 5 years, and $157.9 billion over 10 years. That figure is reflected on this chart. That would be the figure of $51 billion enacted over a 5-year timeframe.  To show I am not making this up, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a table that shows the track record on enacted offsets. These numbers are conservatively high because they include repeal of the FSC/ETI to comply with the ruling of the World Trade Organization which could not have been done without also providing tax relief with the manufacturing deduction.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                       REVENUE RAISERS ENACTED SINCE 2001                                        (Amounts in millions of dollars)----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                  # of                                                               provisions      1-yr         5-yr        10-yr----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Military Family Tax Relief Act of 2003    Extensions of Customs User Fees.........................            2          619        1,305        1,305American Jobs Creation Act of 2004    Repeal of FSC/ETI (to comply with WTO ruling)...........            1          354       16,411       49,199    Provisions to Reduce Tax Avoidance Through Individual               6          139          526        1,343     and Corporate Expatriation.............................
