President, I thank my colleague for her leadership. I wish to make a couple of points. First, there is a staggering amount of economic hurt in virtually every nook and cranny of my State. Our unemployment rate is over 7 percent.  The Economic Development Administration recently announced that for key projects to create jobs in rural areas, small communities are going to have to come up with $22 to get $1 of help for infrastructure, something that can create good-paying jobs.  We are trying to get the transportation bill passed, but with those kinds of measures, we desperately need to extend this lifeline legislation to the thousands and thousands of Oregonians and other Americans who are out of work.  These are folks who simply have nowhere to turn to pay the bills. They are walking an economic tightrope, balancing fuel costs against food costs and fuel costs against medical costs.  Without this extension and without the look-back rule that this legislation would provide, these are folks who are going to fall into the economic abyss. They deserve better.  The fact is, the stock market is doing well. We are glad to see it. We are glad to see profits up at so many of our companies. All of these are pluses for our country. But the fact is, middle-class folks, and particularly the middle class that is unemployed, are feeling pinched like never before. I am very hopeful my colleagues will support this legislation. It is essential to provide a measure of relief to these folks who are enduring so much economic hurt.  I have just gone through a series of community meetings at home, and it came up again and again. So I hope, in the name of compassion, but also in the name of helping these middle-class folks get back on their feet as they look for alternatives, as they look for other positions that pay them enough to support their families, that my colleagues would support this important Cantwell amendment.  I yield the floor.
