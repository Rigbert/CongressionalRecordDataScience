 President, the Republican budget throws 27 million people off of health care. It denies nutrition programs for hungry kids and pregnant women. It cuts $90 billion from the Pell program, making it harder for young people to get a college education, and it raises the price of prescription drugs for the elderly. For Senator Paul, that is apparently not enough. He wants, over a 2-year period, $189 billion in cuts to discretionary programs, which will be devastating to the working families of this country.  Stop the war against working families. Vote no on the Paul amendment.  I make a point of order that the pending amendment violates section 312(b) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.
