Speaker, it is with great sincerity and admiration that I wish to congratulate Father Evagoras Constantinides on the 50th Anniversary of his ordination into the Holy Priesthood. Father Constantinides will be recognized at a banquet in his honor at the Saints Constantine and Helen Greek Orthodox Cathedral on Sunday, February 26, 2006, which will also be a celebration of the 60th Wedding Anniversary of Father Evagoras and his wife, Presvytera Mary.  Father Constantinides was born in Lapithos, Cyprus in 1918 and was educated in his village through his second year of high school, where he graduated with the Gold Medal Award for academic excellence. He entered Athens College in 1932, where he was accepted on a yearly scholarship with the school's science section. Father Constantinides had no trouble maintaining his scholarship for six years, and he graduated with honors while receiving the Delta Public Speaking Prize and the English Language Prize. This dedication and commitment to his studies exemplifies the hard work on which Father Constantinides prides himself.  After finishing college in Greece, Father Constantinides traveled to the United States to continue his studies and broaden his experiences. In 1938, he enrolled at Fenn College, which is now Cleveland State University, where he studied civil engineering. During his four years at the University, he served as a Greek teacher and as the Hellenic Board of Education Secretary for the Greek Orthodox Community of the Annunciation of Cleveland, Ohio. Although he enjoyed his time in Cleveland, his final year was interrupted by World War II. As a British subject, Father Constantinides entered the Canadian Army as a private in the fall of 1942. After completing his basic training, he was enrolled in the officer training program, from which he graduated as a 2nd Lieutenant in the Engineer Corps with proficiency in explosives, mines, and demolitions. His outstanding ability as a military officer, coupled with his excellent intellect, allowed Father Constantinides the opportunity to work for the United States Central Intelligence Group translating Japanese documents and the Greek Constitution into English.  After being discharged in 1947, Father Constantinides returned to the United States and began extensively studying theology. On March 11, 1956, Father Constantinides was ordained into the priesthood, and on September 1, 1969, he was appointed pastor of the Saints Constantine and Helen parish in Gary, Indiana. Since arriving in Northwest Indiana, the graciousness and generosity of Father Constantinides has touched many lives. In 1971, Father Constantinides was instrumental in the construction of the Hellenic Cultural Center in Merrillville, Indiana, as well as in the design and construction of the Saints Constantine and Helen Cathedral, one of the ten largest Orthodox churches in the Americas, in 1975. During his years of service, Father Constantinides has also become deeply involved in the work of Hospice of the Calumet Area.  In addition to the many contributions within his own parish, Father Constantinides has committed himself to improving the community, the nation, and the world. To name just a few of the appointments and accolades bestowed upon Father Constantinides throughout his years of service, he was honored with the office of Protopresbyter in 1972, and he served as the Treasurer and member of the National Presbyters Council from 1970-1974, and again from 1980-1982. He received the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of North and South America Service Award and Gold Cross in 1976 for his struggles and lobbying activities for the liberation of invaded Cyprus. Father Constantinides has shared his immense wisdom and faith in various countries, including Russia, Kenya, Uganda, and India. Remarkably, Father Constantinides has even found time to author four Sunday school books for children and has translated six Orthodox Service books from Greek to English.  Since his retirement in June 1995, Father Constantinides has devoted his time to the Orthodox Christian Mission Center through writing, lecturing, and substituting at churches in the Chicago Diocese, but he has also been able to devote much of his time to his loving wife, Mary, and their four children. Presvytera Mary has stood by her husband's side for the past 60 years. I am sure Father Constantinides would agree that the unwavering support of his loving wife has been a major factor in the many achievements he has reached in his lifetime. Father Evagoras and Presvytera Mary are a shining example of true dedication to their vows and each other.  Mr. Speaker, at this time I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in thanking Father Evagoras Constantinides for his contributions to the members of his parish, the citizens of Northwest Indiana, and his fifty years of service to people throughout the world. I also ask that you join me in congratulating Father Evagoras and Presvytera Mary Constantinides on their 60th wedding anniversary. Their love for each other and for all mankind is truly an inspiration to us all, and I am proud to be their representative in Congress.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Page E142]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]           CONGRATULATIONS TO FATHER EVAGORAS CONSTANTINIDES                                 ______                                                         HON.
