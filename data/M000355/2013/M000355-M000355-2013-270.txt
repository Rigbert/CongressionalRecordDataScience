 It strikes me that the question again is pretty easily understood and has to be something the administration has given some thought to, given the development of this new weapon.  I heard Senator Barrasso earlier today talking about how this technology has changed--we would never have thought of this a few years ago--this technology has actually changed warfare in a very dramatic way. So as I understand it, what the Senator from Kentucky is looking for is how this dramatic new weapon applies to the U.S. Constitution--how the use of it applies to the U.S. Constitution on American soil.  So I think it is entirely appropriate that the Senator from Kentucky engage in an extended debate with the support of his colleagues to get the answer to this question. I wanted to congratulate him for his tenacity, for his conviction, and for being able to rally the support of a great many people, as well as people who have come over from the House of Representatives who feel also, I gather, that this is a legitimate question the administration ought to be answering.  I might say, at whatever point we get to a cloture vote to extend debate on the nomination of Brennan, it is my view cloture should not be invoked. This is a controversial nominee. Should cloture be invoked, I intend to oppose the nomination.  I congratulate my colleague from Kentucky for this extraordinary effort.
