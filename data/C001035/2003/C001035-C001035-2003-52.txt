President, I join my colleague from Rhode Island in urging support for this amendment which would provide additional emergency funding for the Low Income Home Heating Assistance Program. When we experience huge spikes in the increase of home heating oil and natural gas, it imposes an incredible hardship on our low-income families and on our elderly who are living on limited incomes. We are taking a prudent action by setting aside $300 million in emergency funding in case this winter we experience the kinds of price disruptions that create such hardships for our constituents. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.
