President, today I am introducing bipartisan legislation to provide new support for environmental education in our Nation's classrooms. I thank Senators Kirk, Bingaman, Cardin, Durbin, Gillibrand, Kerry, Lautenberg, Mikulski, Murray, Sanders, and Whitehouse for agreeing to be original cosponsors of the No Child Left Inside Act of 2011. Given the major environmental challenges we face today, our bill seeks to prioritize teaching our young people about their natural world. For more than three decades, environmental education has been a growing part of effective instruction in America's schools. Responding to the need to improve student achievement and prepare students for the 21st century economy, many schools throughout the Nation now offer some form of environmental education.  Yet, environmental education is facing a significant challenge. Many schools are being forced to scale back or eliminate environmental programs. As a result, fewer and fewer students are able to take part in related classroom instruction and field investigations, however effective or popular. State and local administrators, teachers, and environmental educators point to two factors behind this recent and disturbing shift: the unintended consequences of the No Child Left Behind Act and dwindling sources of funding for these critical programs.  The legislation that we are introducing today would address these twoconcerns. First, it would provide a new professional development initiative to ensure that teachers possess the content knowledge and pedagogical skills to effectively teach environmental education in the classroom, including the use of innovative interdisciplinary and field-based learning strategies. Second, the bill would create incentives for states to develop a peer-reviewed comprehensive statewide environmental literacy plan to make sure prekindergarten, elementary, and secondary school students have a solid understanding of our planet and its natural resources. Lastly, the No Child Left Inside Act provides support for school districts to initiate, expand, or improve their environmental education curriculum, and for replication and dissemination of effective practices. This legislation has broad support among national and state environmental groups and educational groups.  The American public recognizes that the environment is already one of the dominant issues of the 21st century. In 2003, a National Science Foundation panel noted that ``in the coming decades, the public will more frequently be called upon to understand complex environmental issues, assess risk, evaluate proposed environmental plans and understand how individual decisions affect the environment at local and global scales. Creating a scientifically informed citizenry requires a concerted, systemic approach to environmental education . . .''. In the private sector, business leaders also increasingly believe that an environmentally literate workforce is critical to their long-term success. They recognize that better, more efficient environmental practices improve the bottom line and help position their companies for the future.  Environmental education is an important part of the solution to many of the problems facing our country today. It helps prepare the next generation with the skills and knowledge necessary to be competitive in the global economy. Studies have shown that it enhances student achievement in science and other core subjects and increases student engagement and critical thinking skills. It promotes healthy lifestyles by encouraging kids to get outside.  In Rhode Island, organizations such as the Rhode Island Environmental Education Association, Roger Williams Park Zoo, Save the Bay, the Nature Conservancy, and the Audubon Society as well as countless schools and teachers, reach out to children to offer educational and outdoor experiences that these children may never otherwise have, helping to inspire them to learn. Partnering with the Rhode Island Department of Education, these organizations have developed a statewide environmental literacy plan.  Similar efforts are taking place across the Nation. According to the National Association for Environmental Education, 40 states have taken steps towards developing similar plans to integrate environmental literacy into their statewide educational initiatives. Despite these extraordinary efforts, environmental education remains out of reach for too many kids.  That is why I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact the No Child Left Inside Act of 2011.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1372       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
