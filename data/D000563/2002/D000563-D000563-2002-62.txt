 The Senator and I have stood on the floor and argued this point. Sometimes we did not fare so well. Keep in mind there was a question at the beginning of this debate about Iraq as to whether or not Congress would be engaged. Some argued that the President had the authority of his father's resolutions.  The second point made by Senator Byrd in this resolution is one I hope you will read carefully because I address part of this in an amendment I will offer later. He establishes a standard by which we would declare war. A standard is stated clearly: A clear threat of imminent, sudden, direct attack upon the United States, its possessions or territories, or the Armed Forces.  I hope Members of the Senate will read that. If that is not a standard by which we will measure whether this Nation will dedicate its Armed Forces and risk the lives of Americans in combat and the lives of innocent victims, I cannot imagine what we are going to debate. To take any other standard is to take the power away from Congress to declare war. This is a constitutional resolution. I applaud the Senator from West Virginia for offering it.
