 Harkin, and Mr. Hatch):  S. 1133. A bill to amend the Food Stamp Act of 1977 to permit participating households to use food stamp benefits to purchase nutritional supplements of vitamins, minerals, or vitamins and minerals, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.                         food stamp legislation Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that would give food stamp recipients greater flexibility to balance their diets by permitting food stamp purchases of vitamins and mineral supplements.  The Food Stamp Program is the U.S. Department of Agriculture's largest income security program. Its goal of providing all Americans access to healthy, nutritious diets is pursued by increasing the food purchasing power of more than 27 million low-income Americans in 11 million households each day.  While it is possible to receive optimum levels of nutrients through a careful selection of foods, the fact is that most people do not. A government survey of 21,000 Americans showed that not a single person surveyed obtained 100 percent of the recommended daily allowance [RDA] for all of the essential vitamins and minerals. Scientific research shows that many nutrients play an important role in reducing the risk of various common and chronic diseases. So, it is no surprise that millions of Americans regularly take vitamin and mineral supplements to assure that they receive appropriate levels of these essential nutrients.  Unfortunately, food stamp recipients have not been permitted to use their food stamps to purchase vitamin and mineral supplements. Therefore, the legislation I am proposing would permit Food Stamp Program recipients the option of spending the few pennies a day it costs to purchase vitamin and mineral supplements.  Mr. President, this legislation would help the people who need nutritional help the most--the poor--especially women of childbearing age, young children, and the elderly. Their access to vitamin and mineral supplements can help them assure they are receiving a nutritious diet. I urge my colleagues to consider the positive contribution to public health that can be achieved through permitting low-income Americans access to vitamin and mineral supplements.  My legislation is simple, it permits vitamin and mineral supplements to be purchased with food stamp coupons. It helps the people who need nutritional food the most, the poor and elderly. If food stamp recipients are permitted to use their food stamps to buy nutritional supplements, everybody will be helped. Vitamin and mineral supplements are considered an accessory food and therefore would have no effect on the number of stores participating in the Food Stamp Program. I urge all of my colleagues to take a look at this legislation and consider the positive health benefits that vitamin and mineral supplements can add to a healthy diet.
