President, earlier I had mentioned Robin Cleveland and Tim Rieser. I also want to thank Jennifer Chartrand and Billy Piper on the Republican side, who are always very helpful and did a superb job. On the Democratic side, Mark Lippert, who recently joined my staff from the Democratic Policy Committee, is mastering the Appropriations Committee process. I saw Jay Kimmitt on the floor earlier of the committee staff. Not only is he a good friend but a repository of all knowledge and the one to whom we can all turn when we need to know just how to get out of whatever mess we have stumbled into.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank Tim Rieser and Mark Lippert, a representative of Senator Leahy's staff, Jennifer Chartrand, and, of course, my longtime associate, Robin Cleveland, and Billy Piper as well, for their great work on this bill. I thank Senator Leahy. It was good to work with him again this year.  Having said that, I understand there are 5 minutes that Senator Stevens has reserved. I am told he is happy for me to yield that time back.
