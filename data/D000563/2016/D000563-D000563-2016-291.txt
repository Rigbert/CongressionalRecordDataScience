 Cynthia's dream to become a doctor was on hold because of her immigration status. Only nine schools told her she might be able to apply and be considered as an undocumented student. Two years after graduating, Cynthia was working as a nanny and questioning whether all the hard work and time in school was wasted.  Cynthia cried as President Obama made the announcement about creating DACA. She realized she was going to be given a chance. She applied for DACA immediately. She was approved in the summer of 2013. By September, Cynthia was working at Northwestern University in Chicago doing clinical research in the Department of Medicine's Division of Cardiology. Her research focuses on improving treatment options for patients facing heart failure.  She sent me a letter, and this is what she said:       DACA has meant a new realm of opportunities for me, it has      opened new doors for me, and it has allowed me to once again      see my dream as a reality. I truly believe that if those      opposed to DACA or the DREAM Act had the chance to sit down      and meet undocumented students, their opinions might change.      They would see capable, smart, hard-working individuals who      are Americans in every sense of the word, love this country      and want to contribute to its prosperity. After all, this is      our home.  Cynthia and the other DREAMers have a lot to give to America. Like many Americans who have come to this country, they are willing to sacrifice. They are willing to go to the back of the line. All they are asking for is a chance.  I urge my colleagues--particularly my Republican colleagues--to join us in doing the right thing for these DREAMers, doing the right thing for Cynthia, and thousands of others who are just asking for a chance to make America a better nation.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
