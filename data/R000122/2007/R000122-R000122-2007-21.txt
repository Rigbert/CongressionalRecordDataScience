President, I am pleased this afternoon to recommend the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and related agencies division of this conference report to the Senate. This is an extremely important and time-sensitive funding measure, and I urge my colleagues to adopt it without delay as part of the Labor and Health and Human Services conference report and send it to the President to be signed into law.  I am particularly honored to be presenting this measure to the Senate on behalf of the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Tim Johnson. We have worked closely throughout the entire appropriations process, and the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs provisions before the Senate today are the product of a thoroughly collaborative and a cooperative effort, but the leadership was provided by Senator Johnson. I appreciate Senator Johnson's graciousness in allowing me to offer this conference report on his behalf.  I would also like to thank the ranking member of our subcommittee, Senator Hutchison, for her excellent work and cooperation in developing this conference report and the chairman and ranking member of the full committee, Chairman Byrd and Senator Cochran, for their strong support and guidance in shepherding this legislation to the floor.
