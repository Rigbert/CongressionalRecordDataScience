Chairman, I thank Congressman Connolly for yielding me his last minute and rise in support of this very important amendment to move $97 million to the Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation account.  Without question, we are going to undergo modernization of our entire nuclear stockpile in this country. We are going to spend well over a trillion dollars.  In addition to that, we have had discussions this afternoon and debate about this new low-yield nuclear weapon, which many people have misgivings about in view of the way it has been handled in committee here.  There is no more important time in terms of the world, when we look at many unstable regimes that hold nuclear weapons within their stock, for us to have the most capable people with the most technical expertise to advise, not just people here in the United States, but our friends and allies abroad and international organizations concerned about nuclear proliferation.  So the gentleman's amendment increases our ability, doesn't harm our ability, to monitor and verify arms control agreements and prevent other countries from acquiring nuclear weapons.  I support the amendment. I think it makes sense with what we are doing with our own arsenal and what is happening globally. It makes ultimate sense that we should never cut these accounts.
