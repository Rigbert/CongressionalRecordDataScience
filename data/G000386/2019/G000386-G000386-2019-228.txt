 President, May has been recognized as National Foster Care Month for over 20 years to bring awareness to the challenges that foster youth face.  Through my work on the Senate Caucus on Foster Youth, I have had the opportunity to hear firsthand what children in foster care need. They need love, support, safety, and permanency. They need a family. I salute all those who dedicate their time and resources to help these kids.  In moving forward, I will continue to work to find better solutions and to secure better outcomes for youth in foster care.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for an additional 1 minute as in morning business.
