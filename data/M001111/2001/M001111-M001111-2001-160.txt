 We say to all Senators, one more time, Members have just a short timeframe to come to us with any of their amendments.  I understand the Senator from Georgia is on his way. We have heard from several other Senators who may have amendments. I remind all Members that they just have a short time this morning to get their amendments here if they want to speak on them or they will probably not be able to speak to their issue.  We want to move this bill forward. We are here. We are ready. We are working. And we would appreciate it if Members would let us know what amendments they have so we can move this bill.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
