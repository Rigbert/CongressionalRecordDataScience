President, I yield back all time on the pending nomination, other than the 5 minutes that will be reserved for Senator Stevens; provided further that the vote on the confirmation of the nomination occur at 3:45 today. I further ask that at 3:30 today the Senate resume consideration of the emergency supplemental bill for the final 15 minutes of debate and that the votes scheduled on the two amendments and final passage occur immediately following the vote on the Negroponte nomination. I ask that all votes in the sequence after the first be limited to 10 minutes in length and that there be 2 minutes for debate equally divided between the votes. Finally, I ask unanimous consent that following this consent, the Senate proceed to a period for morning business with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each.
