Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy) for the purpose of inquiring of the majority leader about the schedule for the week to come.  (Mr. McCARTHY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, on Monday, no votes are expected in the House.

On Wednesday and Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning hour and noon for legislative business.  On Friday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business.  Mr. Speaker, the House will consider a number of suspensions next week, a complete list of which will be announced by close of business tomorrow.  The House will also consider the fiscal year 2017 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations bill sponsored by Representative Ander Crenshaw.  The House will also consider the veto message of H.J. Res. 88, disapproving the rule submitted by the Department of Labor relating to the definition of the term ``Fiduciary.''  Additionally, the House will consider a package of bills, authored by Representatives Lynn Jenkins and Erik Paulsen, that would make it easier for individuals to contribute to their health savings accounts and allow people to use their accounts to purchase over-the-counter drugs.  Mr. Speaker, the House will also consider H.R. 4768, the Separation of Powers Restoration Act, sponsored by Representative John Ratcliffe, which will ensure that the laws Congress passes are adhered to rather than the interpretations of unelected agency bureaucrats.  Finally, Mr. Speaker, the House may consider the conference report that includes additional resources to combat the Zika virus, if that measure is ready.
