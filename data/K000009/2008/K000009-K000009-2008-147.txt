 A newspaper once headlined, ``Name any art media, and chances are good that Mrs. Cousino has had experience in it.'' Joe Ann Cousino blessed Toledo with her artistic talents, beautifying the world she touched. Mrs. Cousino passed from this life Wednesday, December 19, 2007 due to ailing health. She was one of the most eminent artists in the Toledo area for more than 50 years and a renowned sculptor. Mrs. Cousino's sculptures can be seen in public spaces, buildings, and private collections throughout northwest Ohio, in surrounding states, and as far away as Cairo and San Miguel de Allende, Mexico. Her figurative bronze pieces have won national acclaim and her work has appeared in more than 100 shows nationwide.  Born Joe Ann Bux, she was the only child of Mr. and Mrs. George Carl Bux. She graduated from Scott High School in Toledo, Ohio and later the University of Toledo, where she majored in art and minored in English literature. To finance her education, she taught classes in mural painting and glass etching at Toledo's YMCA and YWCA. She was accepted to study at the prestigious Pratt Institute in New York, but chose to stay in Toledo with her fiance, Wayne Kenneth Cousino.  Among her most visible sculpture projects are the 6-foot-tall ``Woman with the Birds'' at Toledo Botanical Garden, the 7-foot bronze Outreach of a ``Woman and a Dove'' at the University of Toledo Medical Center, the former Medical College of Ohio, and the 6-foot, 3-inch ``St. Clare'' at the Franciscan convent's gardens in Tiffin. ``She has been such a prominent figure in the Toledo art world, and a lot of that has to do with so many of her pieces being public art,'' said Greg Jones, former director of the School of Art and Design at the Toledo Museum of Art.  Mrs. Cousino was a founding member and later a president of the Toledo Potters' Guild. She focused on sculpture but her work included interior decoration, fashion design, jewelry, ceramics, painting, and architecture. In the early 1950s she designed her family's Ottawa Hills home. Mrs. Cousino traveled the world to research art and cultures, going as far as a village in Egypt in search of tapestries made by Bedouin children.  In March 2007 Mrs. Cousino presented her last major sculptural work in Bowling Green, Ohio: a stoneware bust of local silent film star Lillian Gish. It was a capstone achievement to a distinguished professional career that began to take shape in the late 1940s. Through the years she became known for her industrious work ethic, indomitable spirit, and outspoken nature--traits which availed her rise to prominence during the 1950s in what was then a largely male-dominated sculpture field. ``She was like a dynamo,'' said Tracey Ladd, one of Mrs. Cousino's art instructor colleagues. ``There just weren't a lot of female sculptors [in the 1950s], and she had to struggle a bit to make her artwork.''  The Toledo Blade interviewed Mrs. Cousino in 2000, providing a glimpse of her persona in which she explained her approach to instructing students. ``I'm fussy. I'm a taskmaster, and for myself too,'' she said. ``People run all over artists. You learn. I learned the hard way. I sometimes get on the case of these young artists because they just get abused.''  She taught sculpture for most of her life, and until a few months ago gave private lessons from home while teaching adult continuing education classes at the Toledo Museum of Art. ``She had the ability to teach them exactly what they need to sculpt a human figure, and to do that out of a lump of clay is very, very difficult,'' Mr. Jones said.  The Toledo community deeply will miss the loss of this artistic treasure. Her talent and the generous nature of her public work remain irreplaceable. The Toledo community will remember her courage, skill, and spirit every time they pass by and view her momentous and beautiful creations.                          ____________________
