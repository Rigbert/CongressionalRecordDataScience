 President, not to belabor the point, but earlier I made the point about the duplicative costs of the ninth circuit split proposal, the inordinate costs of the proposal, the unnecessary costs of the proposal, the unfair division that the Burns bill presents.  I would like to just clarify what I said. What I said was that California, Hawaii, Guam, and Northern Marianas have currently 62 percent of the caseload; Alaska, Arizona, Nevada, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Montana have 38 percent. In the Burns proposal, the group of States with 62 percent of the cases get 15 judges, and the States with only 38 percent of the caseload get 13 judges. The States with 62 percent of the cases end up getting proportionately fewer judges relative to caseload. According to ninth circuit statistics for 1995, the proposed new twelfth circuit would have only 765 filings per three-judge panel, whereas the ninth circuit would have 1,065 filings per three-judge panel. How this huge caseload is going to be handled with a disproportionately low number of judges should cause some concern because this will still remain a very large circuit. It will be unable to function due to a heavy backlog of cases.  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.
