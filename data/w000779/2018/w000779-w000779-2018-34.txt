President, the Senate has just cleared the most sweeping package of bills to address the opioid epidemic to date. These fresh policies will make a difference on the ground. In my view, there are promising ideas dealing with some key important priorities: helping people steer clear of addiction from the get-go and knocking down barriers that prevent people from getting help when they need it.  These policies were crafted on a bipartisan basis in practically half of the committees in Congress. The Finance Committee passed its own bill in June with more than two dozen policies that at least one member from each side of the aisle sponsored.  For example, Senator Bennet led the way on a provision that will help root out fraud by requiring prescriptions to be sent electronically from doctors to pharmacies. It is too easy to fake a script on old-fashioned paper and get a bottle of pills, so this policy would make electronic prescriptions the norm in Medicare's drug program.  Senators Brown and Stabenow have important provisions that will help make sure new mothers and infants have access to the care and treatment they need. Senator Menendez and Senator Scott worked on provisions that will help parents get treatment and find smart, safe ways to reunify families.  Since homelessness and addiction often go hand-in-hand, Senator Cardin and I have worked on a bipartisan provision that is about uncovering innovative opportunities in Medicaid to provide housing-related supports and services to individuals struggling with substance use disorders including for those transitioning out of residential treatment and for those who are experiencing homelessness.  Senators Warner, Cardin, and Thune have also brought forward an important provision that would expand access to telehealth services in Medicare for older Americans struggling with substance use disorders. That will expand this promising technology so seniors who don't live in rural areas can also remotely connect with their doctors to get substance use disorder treatment. When it comes to ensuring a substance use disorder is being correctly managed, frequent and convenient check-ups can make all the difference in the world.  These are only a few of the ideas the Finance Committee has been able to bring forward in this bipartisan package.  This legislation represents a measured but important step towards ensuring Federal and State policies are working towards a resolution of this crisis, not making it worse. I view this legislation as an early step in dealing with the epidemic. Nearly 70,000 Americans are dying every year due to drug overdoses. This is one of the most serious issues of our time, and the work will need to continue, especially when it comes to identifying how the crisis began in the first place and holding those responsible accountable.  Congress is going to keep at it until pain policy in this country is back on track. I think of how this has progressed as a ``prescription pendulum.'' Years ago, when I was the director of the Oregon Grey Panthers, I would get calls from the families of older people coping with pain. They would say, ``My dad is 93 years old, he's in agony, but he can't get a prescription because they say he'll get addicted.''  More recently, the pendulum has swung too far in the other direction. If you broke a bone, came down with a bout of back pain, or had a root canal, getting a script for a bottle of opioids became routine. Millions of Americans got hooked. No community has been spared from the consequences--mothers, fathers, babies, sons, daughters, grandmothers, relatives, friends, coworkers--I would challenge any American to claim someone in their social network has not felt the effects that opioid addiction have had.  Congress has a responsibility to stay on this issue until no family is torn apart just because of a misused or inappropriate prescription after an accident, until no parent has to spend day after day wondering if they will receive a call that their child has overdosed again, until no baby has to spend days or even weeks after they are born recovering from opioid withdrawal. The bill before the Senate today will start to turn the tide, and I am proud so many of my colleagues supported it.                          ____________________
