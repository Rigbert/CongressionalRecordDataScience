Speaker, everybody is talking about Chrysler's Super Bowl commercial ``Halftime in America.'' It featured Clint Eastwood, relating the recovery of the American automobile industry. That inspirational adhas now gone viral as people share its positive message about our country and our workers.  Trust me, Mr. Speaker, in America's heartland, we know about hard times. Our people have been through a lot these last few years. But that commercial has it right: We took a punch, but we're still standing. President Obama made a bet on America's workers and companies, and it saved thousands of jobs. It saved our industry. ``This country can't be knocked out with one punch,'' Clint Eastwood says. ``We get right back up again. And when we do, the world is going to hear the roar of our engines.''  You can already hear that roar in Toledo. We're building Jeeps day and night. You can hear it in Lorain too, and in Sandusky, Avon Lake, Brook Park, and Parma. We're going to win this competition. We're going to win it with teamwork. And we're going to win it because we want it more. Gentlemen and gentleladies, start your engines.                          ____________________
