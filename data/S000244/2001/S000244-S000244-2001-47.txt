Speaker, I urge all Members to support this conference report because it contains important provisions protecting aircraft manufacturers, airport owners and operators, and persons with property interest in the World Trade Center from unlimited damages resulting from lawsuits inspired by the terrorist attacks of September 11.  Today's agreement adds significant protections to those entities not protected in the airline bailout bill. However, the protections do nothing to address the unlimited liability exposure faced by the State of New York and other entities or industries that are self-insured or not specifically listed in the bill. In contrast, my proposal as contained in the House-passed bill would have protected all potential defendants from lawsuits based on the September 11 terrorist attacks.  After we pass this legislation, other potential defendants such as jet fuel providers, architects, steel manufacturers or self-insured entities such as the State of New York and, thus, its taxpayers will still be exposed to billions of dollars in damages under New York's rules on joint and several liability. The only constraint on their being named in a lawsuit would be a sense of restraint or reasonableness on the part of trial lawyers, and I do not think we can count on that.  I have fought, and will continue fighting, for those who remain left out of the provisions limiting potentially infinite liability. I remain committed to helping everyone, deep pockets to small pockets, who becomes embroiled in litigation inspired by foreign enemies. We must not stop in our effort to do the right thing by treating everybody equally. We must not stop in our efforts to prevent trial lawyers from taking advantage of this great tragedy and, thus, becoming war profiteers.
