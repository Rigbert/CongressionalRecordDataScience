  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, our democracy is dying under a flood of special interest campaign dollars, and it is a problem on both sides of the aisle, I admit that, and it needs to change. But the Republican leaders today, instead of tossing the American people and our democracy a life preserver with real campaign finance reform, tossed out a big lead sinker.  The debate on Monday will require a two-thirds vote to pass any tiny part of what they have deemed to be campaign finance reform, which does not even go to the heart of the issue, the soft money to the so-called ``issue ads,'' and why is that? Because apparently, for now, according to the New York Times, there is a majority in the House to pass an overhaul bill that would ban political parties from taking unregulated money known as ``soft money'' and would also curb issue ads by outside groups. It is fiercely opposed by the Republican leaders whose party generally has a fund-raising advantage.  Fiercely opposed, they did more than fiercely oppose it; they gutted democracy here today on the floor with this travesty. That will be nothing but a travesty of a debate on Monday.  It is disgusting, the worst thing I have seen in 11\1/2\ years in this House of Representatives.                          ____________________
