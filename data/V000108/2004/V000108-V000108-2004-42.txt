Speaker, it is my distinct pleasure to recognize and commend the members of the Gary, Indiana branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). On Friday, October 15, 2004, the Gary NAACP will hold its 44th Annual Mary White Ovington Awards Banquet at St. Timothy Community Church's Fellowship Hall in Gary, Indiana.  This annual event is a major fundraiser for the Gary branch of the NAACP. The funds generated through this activity, and others like it, go directly to the organization's needed programs and advocacy efforts. In addition, the dinner serves to update and keep the community aware of the activities, accomplishments, and accolades of the local and national chapters of the NAACP on an annual basis.  The featured speaker at this gala event will be Dr. Mary Steele. Dr. Steele is the Superintendent of the Gary Community School Corporation. This is a celebration of the 50th Anniversary of the Brown vs. Board of Education, the 75th Birthday of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and the 39th Anniversary of the Voting Rights Act. This year's theme is ``The Race Is On. The Time Is Now.'' The NAACP Gary Branch will honor members of the community that have contributed to the cause of civil rights, labor and industry, the community, and its organization.  On February 12, 1909, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People was founded by a multiracial group of activists, and their goal among many was to secure the political, economic, and social rights of all African Americans. For more than 95 years, the NAACP built and grew on the collective courage of thousands of people. As the Nation's oldest and largest civil rights organization, the NAACP has worked successfully with allies of all races who believe in and stand for the principles on which the organization was founded. Throughout its history, some of America's greatest minds have worked to effect change.  The Gary NAACP was organized by a group of residents that felt there was a need for an organization that would monitor and defend the rights of African Americans in Northwest Indiana. The national organization, of which the Gary branch is a member, focuses on providing better and more positive ways of addressing the important issues facing minorities in social and job-related settings. Like the national organization, the Gary branch of the NAACP serves its community by combating injustice, discrimination, and unfair treatment in our society.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in paying tribute to the members of the Gary NAACP for the efforts, activities, and leadership that these outstanding men and women have championed to improve the quality of life for all residents of Indiana's First Congressional District.                          ____________________
