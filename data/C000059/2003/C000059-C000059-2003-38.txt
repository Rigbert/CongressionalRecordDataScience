Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1588. As we have done in our recent successes with our fine troops, sailors, Marines, airmen, they have done a fantastic job. The reason they have done such a great job, Mr. Chairman, is because their success is dependent upon training.The motto is ``train as you fight.'' I want to congratulate all of our people at all our military bases of the fine job that they do at managing those bases in spite of difficulties of increasing bureaucracies and restrictions to provide such training. In spite of that, they have done as good a job as they can. Not only have they succeeded in providing that training, but they have done a wonderful job in conserving our natural heritage.  In my own home State of California, Camp Pendleton, I cannot think of an area that has done a better job in preserving the heritage of Southern California. You can go down Highway 5 and look upon Camp Pendleton, a part of California that you do not see today. As a matter of fact, they have done such a fine job, the old motto goes, the other motto, ``no good deed goes unpunished,'' that many people try to restrict our Marines in training the way they fight. Right now of the many miles of beach front along Camp Pendleton, I believe it is close to 40 miles, only 500 yards can be used for training along that beach front. We have to make believe that there are foxholes there. We have to put these young Marines in buses and ship them to another location. They cannot train as they fight. We want to do just some modest modifications in this legislation which would allow our military, as I said, to train as they fight.  This is the right thing to do, Mr. Chairman. This is a good bill. This is going to provide the kind of training that those young men and women deserve. I would urge everyone to support this legislation.
