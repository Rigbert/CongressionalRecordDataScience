Madam Speaker, pursuant to the Republican leadership standards on earmarks, I am submitting the following information regarding earmarks I received as part of H.R. 3288, the Departments of Transportation, HUD, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2010.  Project Name: Arctic Utilidors (Phase 11) at Eielson Air Force Base, Alaska  Bill Number: H.R. 3288  Legal Name and address of entity receiving earmark: Eielson Air Force Base, Alaska 99702  Description of how the money will be spent and why the use of federal taxpayer funding is justified: This project (which would be another increment in a highly successful, multi-year funding effort) will repair large sections of the utilidor that are in extreme need. The utilidors and related piping were constructed and installed in the 1950s and were they to fail during the winter season, when temperatures are commonly -40F and lower, the base could suffer catastrophic results in as quickly as four hours.
