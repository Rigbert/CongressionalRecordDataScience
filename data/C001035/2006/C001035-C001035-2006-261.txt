President, I want to comment on the tremendous efforts of the ranking member of the Homeland Security Committee, Senator Lieberman, and the chairmen and ranking members of the Commerce and Finance Committees, Senators Stevens, Inouye, Grassley and Baucus. They along with their committee staffs have worked together for months to develop the bill that is before us today.  Each of the committees has its own jurisdictional interests in this bill. The Homeland Security Committee has jurisdiction over the Department of Homeland Security with its primary mission of preventing terrorist attacks against the United States and reducing vulnerabilities to such attacks. Many of the programs in this bill, including the Automated Targeting System, the Container Security Initiative, and the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism, serve the purpose of reducing vulnerabilities to terrorist attacks and are operated by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection within the Department of Homeland Security--squarely within the Homeland Security Committee's jurisdiction. Moreover, it was the committee's jurisdictional authority to study the effectiveness of government agency programs that began the evaluation of the DHS' cargo security initiatives that are improved by this bill.  The Commerce and Finance Committees also have significant jurisdictional interests. The Commerce Committee has jurisdiction over shipping and the Coast Guard. And the Finance Committee has jurisdiction over the assessment of customs duties and compliance with customs laws.
