 Speaker, I very much thank my friend, the gentleman from Ohio, for yielding time to me.  I want to congratulate my colleague, the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Gutknecht), for introducing what I think is important legislation which raises some very, very fundamental issues.  I think that tonight's discussion in terms of prescription drugs is good, and I am delighted to hear it taking place in a nonpartisan way, progressives, conservatives, who are standing up for the American consumer.  I believe that I was the first Member of Congress to go across the border with constituents to purchase prescription drugs. I have made that trip twice. I made a trip a year ago to Canada. Like everyone else that we have heard tonight, my experience was that we went across the border and we were able to save Vermont constituents thousands and thousands of dollars.  The one particular drug that comes to my mind now is Tamoxifen, which is widely prescribed for breast cancer. Here we have women fighting for their lives, they go across the Canadian border and they purchase that product for one-tenth the price that they were paying in the United States.  It seems to me, and we have heard it all already, I must tell the Members, I have concerns about NAFTA and I voted against it; concerns about that aspect of the global economy.  The bottom line is, as the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Miller) said a few moments ago, in every single product one can think of, whether it is a food product, whether it is shoes, whether it is apparel, there are massive amounts of trade taking place throughout the world. The question that the American people have to ask is why is it that there is an exception with prescription drugs.  Legislation that has been offered by the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Berry) and the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Emerson) and myself which now has 85 cosponsors is a very simple piece of legislation. It is a free trade piece of legislation.  What it says is exactly what the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Miller) was talking about a moment ago. That is, if one is a prescription drug distributor, if they are a pharmacist, they should be able to go out and purchase anyplace in the world that they can FDA-safety-approved products at the best price that one can purchase it.                              {time}  0000  And if the case is that one can go to Canada, the reason that Tamoxifen and all the other products are sold less expensively in Canada is that the pharmacists purchase the product for significantly lower amounts of money. Why is it that an American pharmacist has to pay 10 times more for a product than a Canadian or Mexican pharmacist?  Mr. Speaker, it seems that people who believe in the competitive, free enterprise system should support legislation which says that a prescription drug distributor, so long as the product that comes into the country is safe and that is easily done, that that businessperson has a right to purchase that product at the lowest price he or she can so that it can be sold to the American people at a lower price, so that we end the disgrace that that chart was showing us that Americans are paying by far more than the people of any other country for the same exact prescription drug.  Mr. Speaker, I think this particular piece of legislation is a small step forward, but it may open the door for further discussion. I hope tonight, and I mean this very sincerely, that in a nonpartisan way we can go forward. I think we are in basic agreement. The only rational objection that anyone can throw us is the fear of adulteration from abroad and so forth. That is easily addressed. If we can bring into this country pork and beef and lettuce and tomatoes from farms and ranches all over this continent, my God, we can regulate the importation of prescription drugs which are made in a relatively few factories.  I think that we are onto something big tonight, and I think if we continue to work together in developing the concept of reimportation, we can substantially lower the cost of prescription drugs in this country 30, 40, or 50 percent and not see the American consumer the laughing stock of the world by paying two, three, five times more for products than other people throughout this world.  So I see this discussion as a very, very important step forward. I congratulate the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Gutknecht) for bringing this piece of legislation to the floor; and I hope that after tomorrow, we will continue to meet and go forward and represent the American consumers and finally stand up to the pharmaceutical industry which is ripping our people off.
