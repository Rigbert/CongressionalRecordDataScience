 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a friend and legendary Kentuckian, Wild Turkey Distillery's Master Distiller Jimmy Russell. This year marks the 60th year Jimmy has been making Bourbon for Wild Turkey, a fact that the distillery is rightfully proud to celebrate. As a 60-year Bourbon veteran, Jimmy is the longest tenured active spirits master distiller in the world.  Kentucky is, of course, the birthplace of Bourbon. The drink itself is named for Bourbon County, KY, in the heart of the Bluegrass State, where the product first emerged. Kentucky produces 95 percent of the world's Bourbon supply, and Kentucky's iconic Bourbon brands ship more than 30 million gallons of the spirit to 126 countries, making Bourbon the largest export category among all U.S. distilled spirits. Not only is Kentucky the overwhelming producer of the world's Bourbon, Bourbon gives much back to Kentucky. It is a vital part of the state's tourism and economy.  Jimmy grew up only 5 miles away from the Wild Turkey Distillery, located in Lawrenceburg, KY. His passion for Bourbon led him to study under whiskey luminaries, including Bill Hughes, Wild Turkey's second master distiller; and Ernest W. Ripy, Jr., great-nephew of distillery founder James Ripy and Wild Turkey's third master distiller. Jimmy recalls being taken under Bill's wing and learning everything about the business from the ground up. Since becoming master distiller in the mid-1960s, he has traveled the world as an unofficial ambassador of Bourbon, introducing people from as far and wide as Japan and Australia to American's native spirit.  Over the past 60 years, Jimmy has been responsible for the launches of several new Wild Turkey brands and expressions, such as Tradition, Tribute, 17-year-old Wild Turkey for Japan, Rare Breed, American Spirit, Kentucky Spirit and Russell's Reserve, which he cocreated with his son and distilling partner Eddie Russell. Jimmy broke new ground in 1976 with the first honeyed Bourbon, at the time called Wild Turkey Liqueur. The evolution of that product today is known as American Honey. Jimmy is also responsible for overseeing the production of Wild Turkey 101, the distillery's flagship brand. This fall, Wild Turkey released a commemorative Diamond Anniversary limited-edition Bourbon created by Jimmy's son, distilling partner and Bourbon Hall of Famer Eddie Russell. As for Jimmy himself, he is known to enjoy his Bourbon neat or with a touch of branch water.  As a legend in the distilled spirits industry, Jimmy is a member of the Kentucky Bourbon Hall of Fame. He is a member of the Whiskey Hall of Fame and a whiskey judge for the International Wine and Spirits Competition. He has been honored by the Commonwealth of Kentucky General Assembly, been anointed a Kentucky Colonel, and received the key to the city from the mayor of Lawrenceburg.  When not hard at work at Wild Turkey, Jimmy spends time with his wife Joretta. They have three children, Eddie, Mike, and Kathy, six grandchildren and one great-grandchild. An avid sports fan, Jimmy is a lifelong supporter of local Anderson County High School athletic programs for girls and boys.  I want to congratulate Jimmy Russell for reaching his 60th anniversary of work at Wild Turkey Distillery. His lifetime of achievement in the distilled spirits industry is certainly something to be proud of. I know my Senate colleagues join me in commending Jimmy for decades of success.                          ____________________
