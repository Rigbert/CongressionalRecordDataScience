 President, I rise today to pay tribute to Stan Cave, who represents the 45th district (Lexington) in the Kentucky House of Representatives. Representative Cave has been recognized by the National Republican Legislators Association as one of their ten Legislators of the Year.  I am proud to have joined several of his General Assembly colleagues in nominating Stan for this award. I have worked closely with Stan since his election to the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1993, on a variety of issues of importance to our constituents.  Since his election, Stan has risen quickly in the Republican leadership in the Kentucky House. He currently serves as Chairman of the House Republican Caucus. For the past two years, Stan has played a major role in overhauling Kentucky's Workers' Compensation laws, as well as other important issues ranging from Higher Education Reform to the state budget.  Outside of the General Assembly, Stan has been very generous with his time to both Republican causes and candidates for office. As Recruitment Chairman for the Fayette County Republican Party, Stan has worked tirelessly to find quality candidates for Congress, the state legislature, Mayor and Council in his home community of Lexington, Kentucky.  Mr. President, in just a few short years, Stan Cave has become a respected contributor to Kentucky government and politics. His meteoric rise has now been recognized and rewarded by the National Republican Legislators Association as a 1997 Legislator of the Year, a great and well deserved honor.                          ____________________
