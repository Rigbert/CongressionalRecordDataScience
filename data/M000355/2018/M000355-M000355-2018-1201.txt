 This was a needless delay, but I look forward to confirming this well-qualified nominee later this morning.  Next, the Senate will turn to Fernando Rodriguez, Jr., the President's selection to be a U.S. district judge for the Southern District of Texas. Mr. Rodriguez is a graduate of Yale and the University of Texas. He earned recognition for his tireless efforts to combat human trafficking. His peers praise his work ethic and his knack for tackling complicated issues.  President Trump continues to send us impressive judicial nominees with sterling qualifications. I would urge all of my colleagues to join me in voting to promptly confirm this slate.                          ____________________
