 Any worthwhile investment will involve an ongoing expense.  Those who claim all the spending in the stimulus bill will be temporary are essentially admitting it will have no lasting value. Alternatively, those who claim it will have a long-term benefit are essentially admitting the spendingwill not be temporary. Clearly, both these claims cannot be true. Contrary to what some people might have us believe, a massive increase in Government spending for the purposes of creating temporary make-work jobs is not a sound economic recovery plan.
