President, now that the vote to impeach William Jefferson Clinton has been taken, and before I discuss my vote, let me say that this whole thing could have been avoided had President Clinton resigned months ago. I say this because I called for his resignation last September. Rather than explain my reasoning for calling for President Clinton's resignation, I believe it is better explained by an 8th grade school teacher from Tulsa, Oklahoma, Mr. Terrence Hogan. I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Hogan's letter to the President dated September 26, 1998, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                               September 26, 1998.     The President,     The White House,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. President: It is in the early morning hours. The      infamous Starr report has been made public for less than      twentyfour hours and I am unable to sleep. I don't imagine      you've had much of a restful night either. As you no doubt      are troubled, so am I.       As the forty eight year old father of five and a teacher of      eighth grade Civics these past twenty two years I am greatly      concerned about the moral direction of our nation. It is as      if we have lost our compass and know not what we as a nation      wish to be. I am fearful, for I do not wish us to become a      nation that is only concerned about the economy and has lost      the will to be a nation of admirable principles. I do not      want us to dissolve into a people who are more influenced by      the spin of the facts than the facts themselves. I am      concerned about the effects the next six months of a legal      nit picking debate over whether or not you commited an      impeachable offense will have on our nation. I am also      concerned that the debate will not ask what I believe to be      the two paramount questions. First, are you capable of      leading this nation for the next 30 months in the directions      that we want and need to go? And secondly, do you deserve to      be allowed to lead this country?       There is no question in my mind that you have the will to      lead. The sad conclusion I have drawn is that you no longer      have the moral authority to lead for you have violated the      main foundation upon which all relationships are built, that      being the existence of mutual trust. In the elections of 1992      and 1996 the American voters forgave you for your one      admitted transgression with Ms. Flowers. Then, however, you      chose to repeat that transgression in the confines of the      Oval office. After which, when confronted with your choices      you chose to repeatedly lie to your wife, daughter,      supporters and the American people. You chose to continually      lie about your choices rather than to frame the debate around      the issue that this was a private matter between you and your      wife and therefore no business of the American public. It is      my heartfelt belief that your choice to lie was designed not      so much to save your wife and daughter certain pain but to      save yourself and your presidency, an understandable choice      but not an acceptable one. Your willful and repeated lying      has given the people of this country an insight into the      character and integrity of their leader.       With this in mind I am asking you to resign your position      as President of these United States for if we are even to      pretend to be a nation of principles we cannot tolerate from      our president actions and choices that we would not tolerate      from the principal of our neighborhood school.       In the last few days you have begun to ask the forgiveness      of the American people. If your contrition is heartfelt you      deserve the forgiveness of all those individuals whose trust      you have violated. I for one forgive you. But as a member of      the body politic I must also hold you accountable for your      public choices and demand that certain natural consequences      be allowed to occur. You no longer posess the trust of the      majority of the American people and can therefore no longer      lead that people and must therefore give up your position of      leadership.       No doubt you share my belief that God our creator calls      each of us to be all we can be and that we are also called to      sacrifice ourselves for what is in the ultimate best interest      of our neighbors, I am asking you now, Mr. President, to do      both of those things. Please set aside your personal pride      and ambitions, take full responsibility for the choices you      have made, accept the natural consequences of those choices      and step down as our president and save this nation from the      turmoil that the debate over your choices will undoubtedly      cause. Let this nation heal and get on with those issues you      believe need to be dealt with. Please remember that in making      this personal sacrifice that your true legacy will not be      determined by what kind of president you were but by what      kind of man you became.       Please know that my prayers are with you and your family in      this time of trial for you, your family and this country.           With sincerity,                                                   Terrence Hogan.
