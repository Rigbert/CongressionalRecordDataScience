Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 98) expressing the grave concern of Congress regarding the recent passage of the anti-secession law by the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China.  The Clerk read as follows:                            H. Con. Res. 98       Whereas on December 9, 2003, President George W. Bush      stated it is the policy of the United States to ``oppose any      unilateral decision, by either China or Taiwan, to change the      status quo'';       Whereas in the past few years, the Government of the United      States has urged both Taiwan and the People's Republic of      China to maintain restraint;       Whereas the National People's Congress of the People's      Republic of China passed its anti-secession law on March 14,      2005, which constitutes a unilateral change to the status quo      in the Taiwan Strait;       Whereas the passage of China's anti-secession law escalates      tensions between Taiwan and the People's Republic of China      and is an impediment to cross-strait dialogue;       Whereas the purpose of China's anti-secession law is to      create a legal framework for possible use of force against      Taiwan and mandates Chinese military action under certain      circumstances, including when ``possibilities for a peaceful      reunification should be completely exhausted'';       Whereas the Department of Defense's Report on the Military      Power of the People's Republic of China for Fiscal Year 2004      documents that, as of 2003, the Government of the People's      Republic of China had deployed approximately 500 short-range      ballistic missiles against Taiwan;       Whereas the escalating arms buildup of missiles and other      offensive weapons by the People's Republic of China in areas      adjacent to the Taiwan Strait is a threat to the peace and      security of the Western Pacific area;       Whereas given the recent positive developments in cross-     strait relations, including the     Lunar New Year charter flights and new proposals for cross-     strait exchanges, it is particularly unfortunate that the      National People's Congress adopted this legislation;       Whereas since its enactment in 1979, the Taiwan Relations      Act (22 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.), which codified in law the basis      for continued commercial, cultural, and other relations      between the people of the United States and the people of      Taiwan, has been instrumental in maintaining peace, security,      and stability in the Taiwan Strait;       Whereas section 2(b)(2) of the Taiwan Relations Act      declares that ``peace and stability in the area are in the      political, security, and economic interests of the United      States, and are matters of international concern'';       Whereas, at the time the Taiwan Relations Act was enacted      into law, section 2(b)(3) of such Act made clear that the      United States decision to establish diplomatic relations with      the People's Republic of China rested upon the expectation      that the future of Taiwan would be determined by peaceful      means;       Whereas section 2(b)(4) of the Taiwan Relations Act      declares it the policy of the United States ``to consider any      effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other than      peaceful means, including by boycotts or embargoes, a threat      to the peace and security of the Western Pacific area and of      grave concern to the United States'';       Whereas section 2(b)(6) of the Taiwan Relations Act      declares it the policy of the United States ``to maintain the      capacity of the United States to resist any resort to force      or other forms of coercion that would jeopardize the      security, or the social or economic system, of the people on      Taiwan''; and       Whereas any attempt to determine Taiwan's future by other      than peaceful means and other than with the express consent      of the people of Taiwan would be considered of grave concern      to the United States: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate      concurring),  That it is the sense of the Congress that--       (1) the anti-secession law of the People's Republic of      China provides a legal justification for the use of force      against Taiwan, altering the status quo in the region, and      thus is of grave concern to the United States;       (2) the President of the United States should direct all      appropriate officials of the United States Government to      reflect the grave concern with which the United States views      the passage of China's anti-secession law in particular, and      the growing Chinese military threats to Taiwan in general, to      their counterpart officials in the Government of the People's      Republic of China;       (3) the Government of the United States should reaffirm its      policy that the future of Taiwan should be resolved by      peaceful means and with the consent of the people of Taiwan;      and       (4) the Government of the United States should continue to      encourage dialogue between Taiwan and the People's Republic      of China.
