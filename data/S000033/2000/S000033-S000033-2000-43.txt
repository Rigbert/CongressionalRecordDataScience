 Chairman, there is no argument that family farmers all over the country are losing their farms. This is a national tragedy.  I do not claim that this $2 million is going to save the world, but I think what it will do is add energy to a growing concept by which farmers can gain the greater share of the tourist dollar that they deserve. Tourists come to their areas because they keep the land open.  I would urge strong opposition to the Hefley amendment.
