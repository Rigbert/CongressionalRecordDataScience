 President, I say to my colleagues on the Democratic side who want to speak on this treaty, if I am not mistaken, there is less than 1 hour--approximately 1 hour--left under the control of the Senator from Delaware, and 13 Members wish to speak to it; and, further, if my Republican colleagues conclude that they wish to yield back their time, the time is going rapidly as we approach this vote. I urge Senators, if they wish to speak, to be prepared, as my friend from the State of Connecticut is, to speak for 5 minutes.  I yield 5 minutes to my friend from Connecticut.
