Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.  I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Congressman Jim Saxton, who has worked tirelessly on this legislation and to have it scheduled for floor debate today. He cannot be here because he is en route.  He has had a long and distinguished career championing ocean and coastal causes in the House of Representatives. He will be missed as he retires at the end of this Congress. I thank him for his service and for his leadership on the Natural Resources Committee as well as for his being a former Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee member. I wish him good winds and fair seas in his next voyage in life.  I reserve the balance of my time.
