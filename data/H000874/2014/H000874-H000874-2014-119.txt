Speaker, for his remarks, and I will look forward to debating what he says is an important responsibility of this House, and that is to set priorities. When the Labor-Health bill comes before us--and the $155 billion is the gross number that goes to that committee; the $30 billion-plus is what NIH has, and the $1.5 billion that I am talking about is a cut to NIH, not to the gross figure of $155 billion, so I understand the figures. But we will have an opportunity to debate that when we come to the floor on the Labor-Health bill, if, in fact, we ever come to the floor on the Labor-Health bill. We didn't come to it last year or the year before. Hopefully, we will come to it this year.  Two additional things I would like to ask the leader, Mr. Speaker.                              {time}  1230  Earlier this week, I had an opportunity to meet with a number of DREAMers who want to join the Armed Forces of the United States. There is a bill called the ENLIST Act, introduced by one of our Republican Members, that essentially says that we are going to allow DREAMers to enlist, and through their service, they could establish their paths to citizenship.  Mr. Speaker, that is an important bill for me because my father came from Denmark. He came here in 1934, at the age of 32. He served in the Armed Forces of the United States, and he became a citizen through his service during World War II in the Armed Forces of the United States.  The sponsor of the ENLIST Act wanted to offer it to the defense authorization bill that we just passed. Last year, when the House considered the defense authorization bill, an amendment similar to the ENLIST Act was made in order.  Unfortunately, it was not made in order this time, so we didn't get an opportunity to vote on that one way or the other. The majority leader knows, Mr. Speaker, that I have been asking in almost every colloquy when we are going to consider legislation that will deal with the broken immigration system that confronts us. This was one opportunity. It was, again, rejected. It was not missed--rejected.  So many colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle--Mr. Schock--said that we need a clear path to citizenship for workers who are already here. Adam Kinzinger said that, through commonsense policies, we have the opportunity to grow our economy, and we must work hard to come to an agreement on how to bring undocumented workers out of the shadows.  John Shimkus said that we have to address the 12 million undocumented immigrants who are already here by moving them legally into the workforce. The Chamber of Commerce, the AFL-CIO, growers, farmworkers, and faith groups across the spectrum are all urging us to pass immigration reform; yet, frankly, we are not addressing it in any way even on this. I think,surely, we could have gotten a consensus on the ENLIST Act, but it was itself rejected.  I would urge the majority leader, Mr. Speaker, to perhaps give us some sense beyond ``we don't trust the President.'' We know that hardly anybody on that side of the aisle trusts the President.  If the issue is simply trusting the President, let's shut down. Let's not do anything, which, essentially, is what we have done, as a matter of fact, as I say that. Let's not do anything. Let's not pass any new laws. That is not what the American people expect, but that seems to be the premise.  Now, presumably, we passed the Defense Authorization Act because we expect the President to pass it; but if we simply don't trust him, why pass the bill?  That is not an excuse. That is not a reason. In fact, it is a derogation of our responsibility, Mr. Speaker. I would hope that the majority leader would tell me when, if ever, we are going to address the broken system that he and I agree is a broken system.  I yield to my friend, the majority leader.
