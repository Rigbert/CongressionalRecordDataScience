 Mr. Speaker, the real answer to growing job loss in the United States, the declining value of our dollar and to rising trade deficits is to balance America's trade accounts by renegotiating failed deals like NAFTA and China PNTR, by not passing any more of them, by opening closed markets like Japan's and China's, and Korea's and by stopping unfair trade practices globally.  Meanwhile, our workers continue to take the big hits by losing their jobs and benefits. What this bill does is it gives them increased notice when their plants are going to close, and it also provides a landing pad in the form of training and trade adjustment assistance. I just wish that the jobs they are being trained for would be produced. We know that often is not the case.  This is the absolute least we can do for the people of our country. They have paid the price of our failure here in Washington to produce economic policies that make America's economy robust.  I fear, without our doing that, we are going to lose the industrial and defense prowess that made the United States the leader post-World War II. I just thank the committee for providing this bill which will help the casualties reposition a bit.  The real answer to growing U.S. job loss, the declining value of the dollar, and rising budget and trade deficits is to balance America's trade accounts by renegotiating failed deals like NAFTA and China PNTR and not pass more of them, by opening closed markets like Japan's, China's, and Korea's, and stopping unfair trade practices globally.  Meanwhile, our workers continue to take the big hits--they lose their jobs, they lose their benefits.  This bill gives them some help--by giving them increased notice before their plants are closed, and it revamps trade assistance and training to help them reposition if the jobs exist in the future.  We owe it to our workers and communities to give them a better chance to adjust. They are the casualties of economic policy here in Washington that is not working. This legislation will require employers to provide 90 days of notice in the event of a proposed plant closing or layoff.  Trigger the notification requirements if at least 25 workers lose their jobs during any 30-day period, not 50 workers as in current legislation;  Mandate notice if 100 or more workers are laid off at multiple plants or worksites during any 30-day period;  Cover both full-time and part-time hourly and salaried workers;  Require the Department of Labor to provide model educational information to employers on employer responsibilities and employee rights under WARN, as well as benefits and services available to dislocated workers;  Authorize the Department of Labor to investigate complaints and bring enforcement suits and also to notify Members of Congress who represent the affected areas;  Permit employees to recover back pay and benefits up to 90 days and also liquidated damages (doubling the compensation otherwise available) if an employer fails to give the required notice under the act; and,  Important to note is the legislation's extension of the period for COBRA (comprehensive benefits, including health care) coverage for recipients of trade adjustment assistance. Under current COBRA rules, workers who lose their jobs generally may continue their health benefits for up to 18 months at their own expense. The new legislation would give workers who are 55 years or older and have worked for an employer for 10 or more years the option to elect COBRA coverage until they become Medicare eligible at 65 or until they obtain health coverage through a subsequent employer.  While I support this bill, we must keep in mind that TAA and WARN aren't substitutes for jobs in manufacturing America. An America that does not produce not only loses the most vibrant wealth-producing sector of her economy but her defense and industrial base as well.  TAA and WARN should be used sparingly and for the short term--they are band-aids, not solutions. We need to pass legislation requiring the executive branch to balance our trade accounts, to renegotiate NAFTA/PNTR, and to open closed markets of the world.  It is no secret that we are voting on TAA today, to increase votes for the Peru Free Trade Agreement next week. Our willingness to sell out our Nation's workforce for the consolation prize of trade adjustment assistance promises to damage our country for decades to come.  I have two bills--H. Res. 336 and H.R. 169, the Balancing Trade Act, which will get our country back on the right track. By supporting H. Res. 336, we support fair, people-centered principles that promote free trade only among free peoples. The Balancing Trade Act, which already enjoys bipartisan support, demands that the President acknowledge a problem in our trade policy when our deficit with any one country exceeds $10 billion for more than 3 years. I also have a bill (H.R. 1958) to revoke PNTR from China, and I will be introducing a bill to require the President to renegotiate NAFTA. These bills are steps towards correcting our U.S. trade policy to prevent the kinds of layoffs and job loss that these bills merely ice over.                 [From the Toledo Blade, July 16, 2007]               Tiffin Workers Discover Limits of WARN Act                     (By Steve Eder and James Drew)       Tiffin.--Four days after Christmas in 2001, Gene Goshe      braved the brisk cold as he walked to his newspaper box and      unrolled his copy of the Tiffin Advertiser-Tribune.       ``National shutting down,'' blared the headline in tall      letters across the front page.       In seconds, Mr. Goshe's life changed forever.       After devoting 33 years of his life to the National      Machinery Co., Mr. Goshe read in the newspaper that morning      that the plant had abruptly closed. He didn't get a phone      call to let him know he no longer had a job.       ``It was like a snowball hit you in the hind end on the      first of January,'' recalled Mr. Goshe, then 58. ``This is      the way we are going to start the year.''       The sudden demise of National Machinery stunned Tiffin, a      town of 17,000 about 55 miles southeast of Toledo already      reeling from plant closings and layoffs.       The plant, a few blocks from the small downtown, made the      machines that made nuts and bolts since the 1880s. But while      the products of its machines embodied the ordinary, the      storied history of National Machinery was far from typical.       ``The National''--as locals affectionately called it--     provided a choice working environment for generations in and      around Seneca County, a flat, fertile part of northwest Ohio      dotted with fields and woodlots.       The company's reputation as an exceptional employer was      rooted in its traditions--a club for employees who had worked      there at least 25 years, summer picnics at Cedar Point, and      Christmas parties at the fancy Ritz Theatre.       National Machinery was like family, workers recalled. Not      surprisingly, it was begun by Tiffin's first families--the      Frosts and Kalnows, whose ownership dates to the 1880s, when      patriarch Meshech Frost convinced the company's original      owner to move its operations to Tiffin.       The Frosts, and later the Kalnows, are recognized as      Tiffin's leading community boosters, using some of their vast      fortune to support local causes and institutions, including      the city's Heidelberg College, where the families set up      scholarship programs to benefit the children of National      Machinery employees.                            a fractured bond       The bond between the privately held company and its workers      changed forever on Dec. 28, 2001--the date National shut      down.       For most of the 549 National Machinery Co. employees, there      was no notice the place where many of them had dedicated      their working lives was closing.       Paul Aley, National Machinery's president, explained to      workers in a letter dated the day the plant closed that banks      cut off the company's money because of its financial      troubles. Most employees didn't receive Mr. Aley's letter      until they had already read about National's demise in the      newspaper or heard about it from friends or co-workers.       In 1988, Congress passed a law requiring business owners to      give 60-days notice before a plant closing or mass layoff. If      National Machinery Co. had followed the Worker Adjustment and      Retraining Notification Act, known as the WARN Act, its      employees could have begun looking for new work and putting      their finances in order instead of dealing with the shock of      suddenly losing their jobs.       There were concerns about the well-being of National      Machinery Co. leading up to its closure. Citing financial      problems, the company announced some layoffs earlier in 2001      and gave most of its workers the holidays off without pay.      But the veteran workers expected business would pick back up      as it had many times over the years.       This time wasn't like the others.                        hoping for better times       In the weeks and months after National Machinery's      shutdown, employees looked to their faith for strength.       Twice a week, employees such as Mr. Goshe, a Vietnam      veteran and father of four, would gather outside the plant at      noon and form a prayer circle with 50 to 75 people. In the      cold January and February air, they would pray for each other      and for the future of National Machinery Co.       ``Everybody would go around and if anybody had something to      say, they'd say it, or they would say a prayer,'' Mr. Goshe      said. ``If anybody had anything they wanted to get off their      chest, they could get it off their chest.''       The workers took pride in their roles in National      Machinery's history and held out hope for a return to better      times.       ``National Machinery had the knowledge in town that they      were the best employer in Seneca County,'' said Mark Griffin,      a 38-year employee. ``We had some other big employers in      Seneca County, but that was the best place to work.       ``They took care of their people, they had a fair wage, you      worked your overtime, had a great retirement, and they took      care of you,'' Mr. Griffin said.       From its Quarter Century Club, which honored employees of      25 years, to its picnics, baseball leagues, and community      service, National Machinery was steeped in tradition.       Its owners, the Frosts and Kalnows, who for decades      referred to their employees as ``Our people,'' instilled an      unapologetic sense of family in and outside the plant.       They provided quality employment, fair wages, and steady      jobs, and in return they expected their workers to live up to      National Machinery standards to protect the image of the      company. Employees in the 1970s and '80s were expected to be      clean-cut and trouble-free. They were forbidden from cashing      their checks at local watering holes.       Mr. Griffin said National Machinery employees had enough      pride in their work to cash their checks at a bank, not at a      bar.       In return, Mr. Griffin said, ``If you got into trouble or      were a little short, they would always bring the money up      ahead of you. They would pick you up and you could pay 'em      back later. It was like a family thing.''                          a tiffin institution       National Machinery began four generations of ownership by      the Frost and then Kalnow families soon after Meshech Frost      convinced Bill Anderson to move the company to Tiffin in      1882.       In Tiffin, there is much folklore about National Machinery      and its family ownership.       One tale is that Mr. Frost went to New York City to get a      loan from financier ``Diamond'' Jim Brady to help purchase      the company.       After his death in 1922, Mr. Frost left the company to his      son, Earl Frost, who ran it into the 1950s. Earl Frost's      daughter, Jane Frost, who was the heiress to the family      fortune, married Carl Kalnow, a banker, and together they      owned National Machinery Co.       National Machinery employees still fondly recall the story      behind the Frost-Kalnow engagement.       ``From what I know, Mr. Kalnow came to town and he got off      the train and asked who the richest man in town was and if he      had a daughter,'' Mr. Griffin said. ``It was Miss Frost and      he ended up marrying her.''       The Kalnows had four children--Carl, Andrew, Gertrude, and      Loretta--who inherited National Machinery after their      mother's death in 1986.       In 1998, the Kalnow siblings--who were raised in Tiffin but      had moved away--sold the company for $98 million to Citicorp      Venture Capital, a New York-based firm that buys and sells      companies as investments.       Within three years, National Machinery rapidly declined      from a thriving company to an abruptly shuttered one.                          A different company       After National Machinery closed, the Kalnow siblings--who      had kept a seat on the company's board of directors and a 15      percent stake in the business as part of the sale--became the      workers' best hope for rescuing the company.       In the weeks after the company closed its doors, the      Kalnows, led by Andrew Kalnow, founder of Chicago-based Alpha      Capital Partners, a private equity investment firm, began      negotiating to buy National Machinery's debt from a      consortium of banks holding tens of millions of dollars in      notes--the debt taken on to buy the company from him and his      family.       In February, 2002, the Kalnows repurchased National      Machinery for $16 million, just a fraction of what they had      sold it for just three years earlier.       In Tiffin, many employees believed their prayers were      answered.       But they soon learned that National Machinery, under its      new ownership, would be a far different company than the one      they had devoted 20, 30, or even 40 years of their lives.       In a complex business transaction, the Kalnows established      National Machinery LLC, or limited liability company, which      they used to essentially purchase the property and assets of      the former National Machinery Co.       The sale was completed in such a way that the new company      would inherit the old company's headquarters in Tiffin, its      factory, its machinery, and its customers. But it would have      no responsibility to pay the debts of the old company. Those      debts included millions of dollars owed to suppliers and $1.5      million more owed to area doctors and health-care facilities      for medical services provided to former employees before the      plant closed.       Officials of the new company eventually agreed to pay an      undisclosed amount toward the $1.5 million in medical bills      owed by former plant workers. But the new company said it had      no legal obligation to the employees of the ``old company,''      who were left behind when the plant closed in December, 2001.       A spokesman for National Machinery LLC last week said WARN      Act issues were handled by the former plant owner and their      lawyers.       ``Like many other companies today facing the challenge of      being successful in a highly competitive world market,      National Machinery LLC is leaner and less vertically      integrated,'' said John Bolte, senior vice president of      operations and human resources. ``Many processes and      therefore jobs from the past simply do not exist in our      company in order to make us more competitive.''       Attempts by The Blade to interview Andrew Kalnow and his      siblings were unsuccessful.       In an e-mail from Mr. Kalnow last month, he told The Blade:      ``It seems like you have a politics agenda in mind that has      nothing to do with our business and contribution to the      community.''                          A sense of betrayal       The Kalnows' ``new company''--National Machinery LLC--in      the spring of 2002 hired nearly 240 full-time employees after      it reopened the plant, many of whom worked for the ``old      company.''       But many of National Machinery Co.'s 549 employees,      including some of its longest-tenured workers, such as Joe      Poignon, never received the call to come back.       ``They started it back up, but they excluded us,'' said Mr.      Poignon, a 40-year employee who worked in the company's      after-market section. ``There was people who weren't retired      out there who had more than 25 years of service and they were      not called back.''       Some grew bitter, angry, and depressed as they waited and      waited for the call from National Machinery that never came.       ``It's the way they treated us,'' said Mr. Poignon, who      tries to avoid Greenfield Street in Tiffin, where National      Machinery is located. ``Not calling us in to inform us of      anything, and not being up front and square with us, and      being ostracized after they reopened the plant. None of us      deserve that. After we have given our lives to it, our good      working years are gone. We can't go out and restart. We gave      them all our good working years.''       He added, ``You feel like you've been betrayed.''                          Depression and anger       Several former National Machinery employees fell into      depression as they tried to live without the work they had      been doing for most of their lives.       Others were angry.       Paul Martorana, a 27-year employee of National Machinery,      returned to the company's offices to settle his pension after      the new company had taken over. But before he left, he had a      request of Anne Martin, the company's secretary.       ``Would you do me one favor?'' Mr. Martorana recalled      asking. ``Take my picture off the wall. I don't want anyone      to know I was ever associated with this company.''       Mr. Martorana wanted his picture taken off the walls of      National Machinery Co.'s Quarter Century Club. The club,      which had more than 735 members since it was established in      1936, honored the company's most loyal employees.       Many members of that devoted club were among those who were      unexpectedly thrown from their jobs, instantly losing health-     care coverage, paychecks, accrued vacation time, and the      stability of employment.       ``A lot of people got hurt, financially and mentally,'' Mr.      Martorana said.       ``We didn't know what to do,'' Mr. Poignon said. ``There      were people who were scheduled for surgery. They didn't know      what to do. They didn't have insurance. Some of them had      cancer.''                         Picking up the pieces       It was difficult, if not impossible, for some former      employees to find reliable work after decades with National      Machinery. The employees had no time to plan, find new jobs,      or train for new careers.       Out of necessity, some took whatever they could find,      accepting steep pay cuts and losing benefits.       ``It's basically turned our lives upside down,'' said      Sharon Goshe, who has been married to Gene Goshe for 34      years.       Mr. Goshe said he held out hope for about three months      after the plant closed, hoping that he would get a call to      return to work. The call never came.       ``Once they opened back up and [I'd] seen the ones they      were hiring back, I was too old,'' Mr. Goshe said.       He began applying for nearly ``any job that was in the      paper,'' but he didn't have any success and began to suffer      from depression.       ``The unemployment was running out, and we got the same old      stories,'' he said. ``You go out and you look for a job and      you get your hopes up, and you hear nothing.''       Ten months after National closed, Mr. Goshe took a job for      $10 an hour with no benefits at a local lumber yard, a $4 an      hour wage cut.       Many employees of National Machinery skipped their paid      vacations over the years, believing they had accrued months      of paid time off that could be used in the future. When the      old company shuttered, employees were not reimbursed for the      time.       The workers said they were also owed thousands of dollars      in lost wages and unpaid medical bills. But when they went to      the plant office and tried to collect from National Machinery      LLC, they heard a familiar refrain: ``Sue the old company.''       But the ``old company'' no longer existed.                          Taking legal action       On Sept. 11, 2002, three former workers of National      Machinery Co.--Chad and Donald Baker and Paul Martorana--     filed a class-action lawsuit in federal court in Toledo on      behalf of all the workers who lost their jobs.       They sued National Machinery Co., Citicorp Venture Capital,      and two related entities claiming the WARN Act was violated      when the plant closed without a 60-day notice. They asked for      lost wages, vacation pay, and medical expenses they said they      were owed, totaling at least $4,000 per worker.       They received a quick education into the limitations and      loopholes of the federal law.       But the biggest obstacle they faced was the wall of legal      agreements, contracts, and documents set up by a squad of      lawyers to make sure that National Machinery LLC was not      responsible for the debts and actions of National Machinery      Co.       Attorneys for Citicorp Venture Capital argued that their      client wasn't the liable employer under the law because even      though Citicorp was the majority owner of the ``old      company,'' it didn't make business decisions on behalf of      National Machinery.       Because the ``old company'' was now a mere shell, its      former employees fell into one of the most prominent pitfalls      of the WARN Act--finding someone who could pay the workers      what they were owed.       Nearly three years after the company closed, attorneys for      the employees and Citicorp Venture Capital agreed to a      settlement that would pay $375 per worker before taxes--just      pennies on the dollar of what most employees felt they were      owed. National Machinery LLC, as a completely new entity, had      no obligation to the workers and was not involved in the      settlement.                             An ``insult''       Calling the settlement an ``insult'' and frustrated with      the law, 74 former National Machinery employees wrote the      judge to object to the settlement.       ``There were a lot of very good employees that were      completely devastated when all this happened and some      satisfaction needs to be given to all of us,'' Virginia      Coffman wrote. Mrs. Coffman, along with her husband, John      Coffman, worked for National Machinery Co. for more than 28      years. ``This type of treatment cannot be allowed to go      unnoticed and just slide by, it has hurt many responsible      people who are still trying to recover.''       In a handwritten note, Steven Webster, a former National      Machinery employee from Upper Sandusky, Ohio, explained that      the company's sudden closing triggered a financial tailspin      that caused him to fall behind on child-support payments. Mr.      Webster explained that he needed to withdraw from his 401K      plan twice to keep banks from foreclosing on his home.       ``For the six months I was without a job. I had my water,      electric, and gas shut off and had to live with my mother for      a while until I got a job because I couldn't afford food or      anything,'' Mr. Webster wrote.       Many of the workers sent copies of their letters to their      representatives in Congress and the Statehouse, including      U.S. Rep. Paul Gillmor (R., Tiffin), U.S. Sens. George      Voinovich and Mike DeWine, then-Gov. Bob Taft, and state Rep.      Jeff Wagner (R., Sycamore).       None of them was willing to fight for their constituents,      at least on the WARN Act.       On Nov. 15, 2004. a group of former National Machinery Co.      employees went to federal court in Toledo to object in person      to the proposed settlement.       On their day in court, U.S. District Judge James Carr      empathized with the plight of the workers, inviting them to      sit in the jury box and address the court. But the judge all      but told the workers that his judicial powers were limited by      a law with no teeth.       In the end, Judge Carr reluctantly approved the settlement,      declaring it a ``pittance'' and telling angry workers it was      the best settlement they could hope for under the weak      federal law.       ``Most simply put, and most unhappily, you're out of      luck,'' Judge Carr told the workers. ``That statute has      proven to be no protection to you.''                          Lingering bitterness       In Tiffin, more than five years after the ``old company''      suddenly was closed on a cold December day, time has healed      some of the wounds. But there still remains an undercurrent      of regret and bitterness.       Today there's a sign outside the headquarters of National      Machinery LLC that proudly proclaims it as a 130-year-old      company.       The former employees never called back by the ``new      company'' say the sign epitomizes the hypocrisy of what      transpired at National Machinery.       ``What I've heard is they think they've done great--     `they've saved the company,' '' Mr. Poignon said. ``You don't      want to think that the place you've worked your entire life      has done something terrible. They didn't fulfill their      promises to a lot of people who gave their whole lives to the      company.''       The laid-off workers have struggled to come to terms with      the fact that National Machinery LLC--which conducts its      business from the old headquarters of National Machinery Co.      in Tiffin, builds the same machines, and serves the same set      of clients--wasn't legally required to pay their lost wages      and benefits.       Some recognize that Andrew Kalnow may have saved National      Machinery, but they question why the rescue couldn't have      been performed more humanely, taking into account the loyalty      of many of the company's longtime employees.       They believe Meshech Frost and Jane Frost Kalnow would be      disappointed.       ``It's all about putting money in your pocket,'' Mr.      Poignon said. ``Maybe morality has changed. Maybe young      people think this is OK. But in our day, this wasn't a moral      thing to do. If you look at the business side of it, it looks      pretty good.       ``But if you look at the human side of it, there's been a      lot of damage.''                 [From the Toledo Blade, Oct. 11, 2007]                House Chairman Offers a Tougher WARN Act                            (By Steve Eder)       The powerful chairman of the House Education and Labor      Committee yesterday submitted his proposal to better assure      workers are given notice before they lose their jobs in mass      layoffs or business shutdowns.       U.S. Rep. George Miller (D., Calif.) became the second      member of the U.S. House to introduce legislation to reform      the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, known      as the WARN Act, a 19-year-old federal law that requires many      employers to provide 60 days' notice before layoffs.       Mr. Miller's bill was co-sponsored by U.S. Rep. Marcy      Kaptur (D., Toledo).       ``These are really extraordinary improvements over existing      legislation,'' Miss Kaptur said during an interview      yesterday. ``There are more teeth in this [bill] to treat the      workers with more respect.''       After a Blade investigation in July highlighted the WARN      Act and its shortcomings, a host of key politicians in      Washington have addressed the need to reform the law. Among      those who have responded are Democratic U.S. Sens. Sherrod      Brown of Ohio, Hillary Clinton of New York, Edward Kennedy of      Massachusetts, John Kerry of Massachusetts, Barack Obama of      Illinois, former Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina, and      U.S. Rep. John McHugh, a Republican from New York.       The Blade's four-part investigation showed that the WARN      Act is so full of loopholes and flaws that employers      repeatedly skirt it with little or no penalty.       The series showed that in crafting the WARN Act, Congress      didn't charge the Department of Labor with enforcing the law.      Instead, displaced workers must take their former employers      to court to uphold their rights under the law.       An analysis of 226 WARN Act lawsuits filed by employees      showed that judges threw out more than half, citing loopholes      in the law.       ``Everyone on the [House Education and Labor] committee is      familiar with the Blade's excellent work on this.'' Miss      Kaptur said yesterday. ``The Blade has really done the      country a favor in helping to highlight the importance of      this legislation and to draw national attention to it.''       Mr. Miller's bill--called The Early Warning and Health Care      for Workers Affected by Globalization Act--would overhaul the      existing WARN Act by increasing the notice period from 60 to      90 days, making the law apply to more employers, increasing      financial penalties for violators, and empowering the      Department of Labor to bring lawsuits on behalf of employees.       In addition, it covers part-time employees and groups of      100 or more workers laid off by one employer at multiple job      sites.       The legislation also extends COBRA health coverage for      recipients of trade adjustment assistance, allowing workers      who are 55 or older or employees with more than 10 years of      service to an employer to use COBRA coverage until they are      eligible for Medicare.       Miss Kaptur said Mr. Miller's new proposal has support from      the ``highest levels'' of     Congress, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.).       ``There is a significant amount of momentum that has built      for this measure,'' Miss Kaptur said.       Ms. Pelosi, in a statement yesterday, said: ``For too long,      the Bush Administration has ignored the needs of workers who      are left unemployed through no fault of their own. Chairman      Miller and Congresswoman Kaptur have been relentless      champions for the cause of working men and women, and the new      legislation incorporates those concerns.''       Alex Conant, a White House spokesman, had no immediate      comment last night on Mr. Miller's WARN Act proposal, but      defended the President's record on helping workers.       ``The President has aggressively fought for and delivered      tax relief for all taxpayers resulting in economic growth and      job creation,'' he said. ``The best thing Congress can do to      help workers and those seeking work is to keep taxes low to      grow our economy and create new jobs.''       Mr. Miller's bill shares some characteristics with a bill      introduced in the U.S. Senate by Mr. Brown and a bill in the      U.S. House by Mr. McHugh.       Mr. Brown's bill is co-sponsored by Ms. Clinton and Mr.      Obama, who are vying for the Democratic nomination for      president.       The proposals introduced by Mr. Brown and Mr. Hugh, both      called the FOREWARN Act, would lengthen the notification      period required before a plant closing or mass layoff,      increase penalties for violators, require more companies to      provide notice before layoffs, and allow the Department of      Labor and state attorneys general to represent workers in      lawsuits.       Julie Hurwitz, the former executive director of the Sugar      Law Center, a Detroit-based nonprofit legal center which      advocates for workers in WARN Act cases, said she is      ``heartened'' by the congressional efforts to reform the law.       ``These are all sorely needed revisions that have to be      made, particularly given the history of those loopholes that      have existed in the original statute giving employers all      kinds of wiggle room to essentially set their own agendas and      still not be held accountable under the original version of      the WARN Act,'' Ms. Hurwitz said.       Still, Ms. Hurwitz wants lawmakers to go a step further and      address increasingly common tactics used by employers to      evade their WARN Act duties.       ``I would love to see somebody grapple with the use of      releases or waivers that are now quite frequently used by      employers to get out from any WARN Act liability or      responsibility,'' Ms. Hurwitz said.  Mr. McKEON. Mr. Speaker, we know that there have been job losses due to trade, there have been job losses due to technology improvements. There are other different reasons why jobs are lost, and we all feel the pain of those who have lost their jobs.  Having said that, the answer is not increased bureaucracy and increased problems that employers have to deal with in providing jobs and in coming up with new technology to create new jobs. The answer would be to streamline, to cut back the bureaucracy, yes, to give temporary help to workers that have been displaced, to give them the opportunity to get additional job training so that they can prepare for other occupations, and then to try to spread that pain across the country instead of just having it targeted on those specific plans.  We will offer later an amendment to this bill, a substitute, that will do just that. In the meantime, I encourage all of my colleagues to vote against additional bureaucracy and to vote against expanded government intrusion into the marketplace that causes these disruptions.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
