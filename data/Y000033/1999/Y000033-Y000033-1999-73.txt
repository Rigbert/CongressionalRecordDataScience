Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1243, which reauthorizes the National Marine Sanctuaries Act and the National Estuarine Research Reserve System.  The National Marine Sanctuaries Program is our nation's underwater park system. This is a good bill that will improve the operation of the program. I strongly support the provision that limits NOAA's ability to designate new National Marine Sanctuaries until the management plans at existing sanctuaries are implemented and significant progress has been made toward completing on-site studies. With limited funding, it is inappropriate to spend scarce dollars to expand the system while management of the existing sanctuaries consistently falls short.  Title II reauthorizes the National Estuarine Reserve System, a program which establishes Federal-state partnerships for managing and enhancing our estuaries. The program is supported with matching funds provided by the states and the Federal Government, and much of the day-to-day management of the reserves is left to the state or local partner. The National Estuarine Reserve Program is not a regulatory program, but rather maintains a mission of research, monitoring and education.One of the newest reserves is located in Kachemak Bay, Alaska, which is contiguous with the southeastern entrance of Cook Inlet. This reserve encompasses nearly 365 thousand acres of aquatic habitat. This reserve is managed in cooperation with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, and provides an area for researching and monitoring important Pacific salmon habitat. I believe that the Kachemak Bay Reserve serves an important function for monitoring coastal resources and maintaining healthy fish stocks.  I urge the adoption of H.R. 1243.
