Speaker, today I am introducing H.R. 4820, the Save the International Space Station Act of 1998. This is a straightforward bill that contains several provisions that will restore accountability to the program while preserving our commitment to our international partners in the Space Station program. More importantly, it lays the groundwork to help prevent future cost growth and schedule delays by putting NASA on a track to solve systemic problems. The bill should be non-controversial. Most members have seen these provisions before. This legislation was drafted around the bipartisan Sensenbrenner-Brown amendment to the Civilian Space Authorization Act for fiscal year 1998 and 1999, which the Committee on Science adopted and the House of Representatives passed last year.  Basically, the bill precludes additional payments to the Russian Space Agency to meet its existing obligations unless Congress concurs that additional payments serve the taxpayer's interest. It requires the Administration to develop a contingency plan and report that plan to Congress for removing each element of the Russian contribution from the critical path for assembling the International Space Station. It does contain two new provisions from the Senate, which were worked out on a bipartisan basis. The first of these new provisions is a total cost cap on the program. The International Space Station has never had a legislatively imposed cap on the total cost of the program before. The Senate has made such a cap a priority and the bill contains a measure worked out between the Senate and the Administration. The second new provision concerns cross-waiver authority under which NASA will negotiate agreements with other Station partners to reduce our liability to one another in the event of problems with the Space Station. Ultimately, this measure must be passed for the Space Station to be assembled and operated in space.  By passing this bill sooner rather than later, Congress can do its part to contain future cost growth and put this program back on track towards developing and operating a world-class scientific laboratory in space.                          ____________________
