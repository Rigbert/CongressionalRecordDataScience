President, in the time allotted to me, I will talk about some other things. Later this afternoon, a wonderful American man who had a life that epitomizes what is best in our country will be buried in Arlington. I am speaking about Jack Valenti. Jack and his wife Mary Margaret first took my wife Marcel and I under their wings when I came here as an unknown 34-year-old Senator from Vermont. We had so many wonderful times with both of them.
