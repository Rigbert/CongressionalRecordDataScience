 President, I rise today to introduce the Social Security Privacy Act of 2001. This legislation would prohibit the sale and purchase of an individual's Social Security number by financial institutions and include Social Security numbers as ``nonpublic personal information'' thereby subjecting the sharing of Social Securitynumbers to the privacy protections of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.  I believe Congress has a duty to stop Social Security numbers from being bought and sold like some common commodity. While the Social Security number was created by the federal government to track workers' earnings and eligibility for Social Security benefits, we all recognize that it has become something much more than that. The number is now the key to just about all the personal information concerning an individual.  There was never any intention or consideration for financial institutions to use a person's social security number as a universal access number. Such easy access and extreme availability of personal information leads to adverse consequences including fraud, abuse, identity theft and in the most extreme cases--staking and death.  While Congress waits to act, the number of incidents involving identity theft are rapidly increasing. In fact, last year the Washington Post, reported that ``ID Theft Becoming Public Fear No. 1.'' The New York Times noted that, ``Law enforcement authorities are becoming increasingly worried about a sudden, sharp rise in the incidence of identity theft, the outright pilfering of peoples personal information for use in obtaining credit cards, loans and other goods.''  Not only is identity theft happening more often, recent events confirm that no one is immune from this problem. Just last month, a California man was convicted of using Tiger Woods' Social Security number to obtain credit cards that he used to run up more than $17,000 in charges in Mr. Woods' name.  Identity theft can affect anyone. It is extremely serious. It costs our economy hundreds of millions of dollars each year. Once it occurs, it is very difficult for the victim to restore his or her good name and credit rating. The incidences of identity theft are growing at an ever increasing pace.  Now, how does identity theft relate to the average financial institution? In 1999, a reputable Fortune 500 company, U.S. Bancorp, legally sold account information--including Social Security numbers--of one million of its customers to MemberWorks, a telemarketer of membership programs that offer discounts on such things as travel to health care services. Now some may believe we stopped such activity by including a provision, Section 502 (d), in the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act limiting the ability of institutions to share account information with telemarketers.  That provision, however, does not stop a financial institution from buying and selling individual Social Security numbers. Indeed, it is even legal to sell individual's birth date, and mother's maiden name. If you have those three things, you have the keys to the kingdom--not to mention any and every account that individual has.  The evolution of technology is making the collection, aggregation, and dissemination of vast amounts of personal information easier and cheaper. The longer we wait to act on this very important issue--an issue that is supported by a vast majority of Americans--the more the American people lose confidence in the U.S. Congress and out ability to lead.  This legislation would basically prohibit the sale and purchase of an individual's Social Security number. I do not know anyone in this country that believes financial institutions should be making a profit by trafficking individual's Social Security numbers. While financial institutions have used the Social Security number as an identifier, the sale and purchase of these numbers facilitates criminal activity and can result in significant invasions of individual privacy.  In addition, my legislation would include Social Security numbers as ``nonpublic personal information'' for the purpose of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, thereby subjecting the sharing of Social Security numbers to the privacy protections in that Act. Current regulations say that Social Security numbers are not considered nonpublic personal information if the number is ``publicly available,'' as in bankruptcy filings, etc.  I just cannot find a reason as to why Congress should aid and abet criminals in attaining individual Social Security numbers by having a law on the books that treats Social Security numbers as ``public information.'' Indeed, no American would agree the public good is being served by making their personal Social Security number available for anyone who wants to see it.  For those of you who are concerned that this legislation would hinder a financial holding company from sharing information among its affiliates, fear not. This legislation does not limit a financial institution's ability to share an individual's Social Security number among affiliates in any way.  I hope my colleagues will join me in protecting the Social Security numbers.                                 ______                                       By
