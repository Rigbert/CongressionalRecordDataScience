 President, today I rise to salute the service of a distinguished Kentuckian. This gentleman recently ended a long career devoted to the service of his country and our commonwealth.  His name is Jim Shane, and I am proud to say Jim is a friend of mine. Jim recently stepped down as executive director of the Kentucky Commission on Military Affairs, a post he held since 1997. During his tenure, Jim can point to many accomplishments, but he was particularly instrumental in preparing Kentucky for the rigors of the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure--BRAC--process. The commonwealth, in particular Fort Knox, was a big winner in the BRAC process, and no one was more instrumental in this success than Jim.  Jim had a vision for Fort Knox, one in which the installation would again be a home to combat troops and to a number of major Army commands. He then worked tirelessly with Federal and State officials, the BRAC Commission and the Department of Defense to make that conception of Fort Knox a reality. The result was that Fort Knox emerged revitalized from the BRAC process. Consequently, central Kentucky stands to gain immeasurably from the economic benefits stemming from the installation's enhancement, and our armed forces will be the better for Fort Knox's improved stature.  Prior to his service for Kentucky, Jim served his country with great distinction. He spent 27 years of commissioned service in the Army, rising to the rank of brigadier general. His career highlights include service as Deputy Commanding General, United States Recruiting Command, in which he was responsible for manning the Army's all-volunteer force.  Jim also received numerous medals, awards and decorations for his efforts in the Army including the Distinguished Service Medal, the Defense Superior Service Medal, the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star Medal, the Meritorious Service Medal, with three Oak Leaf Clusters, the Joint Service Commendation Medal, the Army Commendation Medal, the Army Achievement Medal, the Parachutist Badge, the Ranger Tab, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff Identification badge.  I am proud to say that Jim is also a fellow alumnus of the University of Louisville.  Mr. President, I ask that my colleagues join me in honoring this fine Kentucky patriot for his long and notable career of public service.                          ____________________
