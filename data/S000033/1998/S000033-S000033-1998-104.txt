 Speaker, I am happy to announce that 2 Members of the House have now signed a letter to President Clinton which calls for an end to U.S. support for the Suharto dictatorship in Indonesia. I hope that more of my colleagues will sign it in the coming days.  While the transition to democracy in Indonesia will not be easy, the United States should play an active role in helping to develop a process by which Suharto's political prisoners are released, free speech is guaranteed to all, and an approach is created for free and fair elections.  Most importantly, we must let the Indonesian people know that we will not continue in any way to support the corrupt Suharto dictatorship, a regime which over the last 32 years has not only killed hundreds of thousands of people, but which has enabled the Suharto family to accumulate over $40 billion in personal wealth in a country where the average income is $20 a week.  Mr. Speaker, tens of thousands of Indonesian students have put their lives on the line for freedom. We must listen to their cries.                          ____________________
