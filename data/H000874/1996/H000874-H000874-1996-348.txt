Speaker, I rise to take this opportunity to recognize the many accomplishments of the general manager of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit System [WMATA], Mr. Lawrence G. Reuter. It is indeed the Washington area's loss that Mr. Reuter has chosen to accept the position of president of New York City's transit system.  Mr. Reuter, as general manager of WMATA for the past 2 years, has consistently proven that he knows how to run a railroad. His administrative skills have been evident as he has kept the fast-track program, designed to complete the planned 103-mile metrorail system in an accelerated time period, on schedule and within budget. Under his stewardship, WMATA now has the remaining four rail segments under construction. Completion will finally provide a complete network linking all of the suburban communities to all of the District of Columbia.  Perhaps the most difficult issues Mr. Reuter has addressed during his tenure at Metro are the fiscal challenges faced by all jurisdictions throughout this region. He has had to be resourceful in order to preserve quality Metro service at a time when State and local response to these budgets are lean, and Federal transit assistance has been diminishing.  Mr. Reuter has provided the kind of leadership necessary to run a public service organization in these tight fiscal times. He has consistently encouraged private sector partnerships in order to fully capitalize on the public investment in Metro. He was instrumental in the negotiation of an agreement with the RF&P Corp. to construct, entirely with private funds, a Metrorail station at Potomac Yard in Alexandria, VA. This is the first agreement of this type ever executed in the United States. His commitment to public-private partnerships has enabled Metro to streamline its joint development program making it easier for the private sector to invest in properties near Metrorail stations. His efforts to bring private sector investment to locations in proximity to Metro reflects his firm view that this region must fully utilize our investment in Metrorail. Mr. Reuter recognizes that the Metro system provides economic opportunity to all of the communities along its lines as well as environmental benefits to the entire region.  Larry Reuter has demonstrated his extraordinary ability to lead during one of the most challenging times for the transit authority. This region owes Mr. Reuter our gratitude for preserving our investment in the Metro system and for continuing to provide quality public transit service to the entire National Capital region.                          ____________________
