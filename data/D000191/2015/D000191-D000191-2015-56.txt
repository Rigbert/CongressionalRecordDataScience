Chairman, I would point out that under the current formulas, actually, and current spending levels, Florida is getting back $1.15 on the dollar. So, actually, under the gentleman's proposal, devolving back to the States, doing away with the Federal revenues, both gas tax and general fund revenues, would actually be a net loss to Florida; but then I guess they would just have to raise their gas taxes by the 18.3 cents that is going to the Federal Government and a bit more in order to make that up.  Again, we would lose the coordination among the States. The priorities of States bordering Florida may not match the priorities of Florida in terms of access and egress to the State of Florida. So I think we are well-served as a nation by having a coordinated Federal program and streamlined and efficient reforms.  Mr. Chairman, I urge Members to oppose this amendment.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DeSantis).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it.  Mr. DeSANTIS. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida will be postponed.    Amendments En Bloc No. 1 Offered by Mr. Shuster of Pennsylvania
