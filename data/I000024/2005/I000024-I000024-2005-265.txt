President, reserving the right to object, let me state the position we have on the committee. I have chaired this committee for 3 years. As the distinguished Senator from Virginia knows--he used to chair the same committee, as did the minority leader--we have a rule that we don't name courthouses after anyone who is living. I am going to object to this. However, if you want to have a vote on this, I will record myself as opposing it because I am not going to break the record. I think it is a good rule to keep. That is my position.
