Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of our full Committee on International Relations of yielding time to me and for expeditiously moving this legislation through our full committee and bringing it to the floor today.  House Concurrent Resolution 167 is an important and timely resolution which recognizes the 10th anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, the worst in recorded history, and supports the closing of the remaining reactors in that plant.  Several weeks ago, Mr. Speaker, on April 23, I chaired a Helsinki Commission hearing that examined the devastating consequences of the Chernobyl disaster. Four experts on the subject of Chernobyl, including the ambassadors of Ukraine and Belarus, the two countries most gravely affected by the disaster, gave sobering accounts of the profound medical, environmental, economic, and political consequences of the disaster.  Mr. Speaker, as I think most Members know, in the early morning of April 26, 1986 10 years ago, reactor No. 4 at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant exploded, releasing massive quantities of radioactive substances into the atmosphere. As a matter of fact, some of the experts who have looked at this carefully have suggested that as much as 200 times the amount of radiation released at both Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined was released as a result of that explosion.                              {time}  1515  The highest level of radioactive fallout was registered in the vicinity immediately surrounding Chernobyl, near the Ukrainian-Belorussian border.  This expression of Congress draws attention to the ongoing tragedy. Ten years ago, Mr. Speaker, millions of people, including about 1 million children, were exposed to dangerously high levels of radiation. Since then children, in particular, have experienced alarming increases in thyroid cancer and other conditions, including early childhood diabetes, anemia, and illnesses associated with general fatigue. One World Health Organization expert recently forecast that the total number of thyroid cancers among children in the contaminated zones may ultimately reach 10,000. These trends have accelerated since the disaster and are expected to increase well into the future.  One of the witnesses at our hearing talked about the fact that many of the people who moved out of the affected areas who used to have farms there have grown impatient and have moved back to farm. Many are not eating the produce and selling some of it in Kiev putting some at risk of contamination. Indeed, stomach cancers are now beginning to manifest themselves among the people in these affected areas.  Mr. Speaker, given these devastating consequences, House Concurrent Resolution 167 calls upon the President to support continued and enhanced United States assistance to provide medical relief, humanitarian assistance, social impact planning and hospital development for the Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia and encourages national and international health organizations to expand the scope of research into the public health consequences of Chernobyl.  Let me just remind Members as well that there are still scattered throughout Russia some 15 different sites where Chernobyl-type reactors are today in operation. So the prospects and the specter of this kind of thing happening not just on the Chernobyl side itself, where the reactors continued to be used, but also throughout Russia, leading to what I would consider to be a unmitigated disaster should this happen again.  So we need, I think, to be encouraging the closure of those as well and upgrading if they need nuclear power, doing it in a way that is environmentally sound and safe.  Mr. Speaker, one of the most important components of this resolution is that it does indeed urge the Ukraine to continue its negotiations with the G-7 to implement the December 20, 1995, memorandum of understanding which calls for all nuclear reactors at Chernobyl to be shut down in a safe and expeditious manner by the year 2000. The resolution calls upon the President to support the process of closing Chernobyl, as envisioned by the MOU, recognizing, of course, the tremendous costs involved and its impact on the country that is undergoing a transition from a Communist state to a market oriented economy. They do have energy needs. We need to take that into consideration and assist them in every way we can.  Among the most important components of the MOU is the G-7 financial commitment, mostly in loans, as well as some grants, to help Ukrainians impose market discipline on that country's very inefficient energy sector and make it more rational and self-sustaining.  Finally, the resolution supports the broadening of Ukraine's regional energy resources, which will reduce its dependence on an individual country.  Mr. Speaker, the international community, including the U.S. Government and many nongovernmental organizations, are indeed responding to the consequences of Chernobyl, but more needs to be done, especially as Ukraine and the Belarus, the countries again that bore the brunt of Chernobyl, are undergoing this transitional period.  Mr. Speaker, I ask Members to support this measure and then, when we get down to appropriate humanitarian aid later on in the year, to support the kind of resources that will help make the mitigation of this crisis a reality.
