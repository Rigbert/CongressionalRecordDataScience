 President, obviously, like on so many issues, I happen to agree with my friends on the other side of the aisle. But where do you make this decision? You don't make it on the Budget Committee. You make it on the Finance Committee.  I am committed to having a drug benefit for all seniors. We developed such a bill last year, so we have the capability of doing it. We are going to do it this year. I do not want this decision made here. I do not want to curb the freedom of the Finance Committee.  I argued the same point on an issue that friends on the other side of the aisle would have agreed with me, on a Medicaid issue, that would have been in this budget that is not in the budget.  Leave these issues to a committee of competence, the Senate Finance Committee.
