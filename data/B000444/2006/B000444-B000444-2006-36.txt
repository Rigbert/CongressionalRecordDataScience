 President, the country of Cyprus has occupied a special place in my heart for many years. My admiration for the island and its people grew in recent months as Cypriots opened their arms to assist the thousands of American citizens who fled from Lebanon during this summer's fighting between Hezbollah and Israel. This exceptional display of Hellenic hospitality has reaffirmed Cyprus's importance as a safe harbor amid the unsettled waters of the eastern Mediterranean and a key partner for the United States.  For far too long, however, Cyprus has existed as an island divided. An invasion by Turkey in 1974 needlessly separated the island's ethnically Greek and Turkish citizens--two communities that had successfully coexisted for centuries. A generation has now grown to adulthood on either side of a Green Line that segregates Cypriots from both their peaceful shared history and their promising shared destiny. Mr. President, I believe we must correct this wrong before another generation endures a similar fate.  In 2004, United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan presented a plan to reunite the island's two communities. The Annan plan certainly wasn't perfect, but it brought the island closer to reunification than any peace initiative in the past three decades. After the plan failed to gain the support of the Greek Cypriot community in an April 2004 referendum, the drive to unify the island largely stagnated, and the U.N. closed its ``good offices'' mission in Nicosia that had worked to facilitate peace negotiations.  Over the summer, I have been encouraged by the first real signs of movement toward a settlement since the Annan plan was rejected. Ibrahim Gambari, the United Nations Under Secretary General for Political Affairs, visited Cyprus in July and presided over a joint meeting between the President of the Republic of Cyprus, Tassos Papadopoulos, and the head of the Turkish Cypriot community, Mehmet Ali Talat. The two leaders reaffirmed their commitment to seek a political settlement in an agreement signed on July 8. They are now poised to begin a new round of technical talks that I hope will move the peace process forward.  Mr. President, others have rightly stated that Cypriot problems need Cypriot solutions, but I am convinced that those solutions won't be forthcoming without the forceful support of the international community. For years, the United Nations has played a critical role in Cyprus, maintaining a ceasefire and facilitating a political settlement. Under Secretary Gambari will report to the U.N. Security Council in the beginning of December, and the Security Council and Secretary General will subsequently decide whether to renew the mandate of UNFICYP, the U.N. Peacekeeping mission in Cyprus, and reopen the Secretary General's good offices mission in Nicosia.  Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders should take advantage of this window of opportunity and launch the technical talks they committed to as part of the July 8 agreement. Once they do, the international community should be ready to support them. I am convinced that given the right conditions and adequate international backing, a solution in Cyprus is both possible and attainable. I hope that members of the Security Council will reach the same conclusion and act accordingly when the issue is before them, and that the new U.N. Secretary General will build on Secretary General Annan's leadership to facilitate a peaceful resolution of this long-running conflict.  When it finally happens, the reunification of Cyprus will have significance far beyond the shores of the Mediterranean. A united Cyprus will stand as an example to the world of how different ethnic groups can overcome past wrongs, bridge differences, and live together as neighbors. At a time when too many countries are beset by demons of ethnic and sectarian hatred, it is more important than ever to find an answer to the Cyprus question. If the United States and other members of the international community are willing to act as catalysts for a political settlement, I am confident that future generations of Cypriots can enjoy the peace they rightly deserve.                          ____________________[Page S10659]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]               U.N.
