 Under the legislative branch appropriations in fiscal year 1995, the Library of Congress awarded five contracts for a total of $10 million that would be affected by your amendment. Out of, I believe it is, well over $266 million total contracts, only five of those would be affected by your amendment. I am curious as to why you are approaching that for such a minute number on this appropriations bill.
