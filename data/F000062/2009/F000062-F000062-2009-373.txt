 Boxer, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Whitehouse) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:                             S. Con. Res. 7       Whereas Larry King was a 15-year-old boy from Oxnard,      California who was shot by a fellow student during English      class on February 12, 2008 and died in the hospital 2 days      later;       Whereas the police classified the murder as a hate crime;       Whereas in 2008, more than 150 vigils were held across the      Nation in Larry's memory, and more than 18,000 students from      more than 6,500 middle and high schools came together to      commemorate his death;       Whereas one year later, vigils continue to be organized to      call for an end to violence, bullying, and harassment in      schools in the United States;       Whereas in 2007, 85 percent of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and      transgender students were verbally harassed at school because      of their sexual orientation, and more than 20 percent of      those students were physically assaulted because of their      sexual orientation;       Whereas the Gay, Lesbian, and Straight Education Network's      2007 National School Climate Survey showed that when students      are harassed or assaulted at school, they find it difficult      to focus on their school work, their grades drop, and they      attend school less often; and       Whereas schools should be a place where all children can      learn and grow in a safe environment, free from bullying and      harassment: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives      concurring), That Congress--       (1) honors and remembers the life of Lawrence ``Larry''      King;       (2) condemns all hate crimes; and       (3) calls on the Federal Government, States, localities,      schools, and the people of the United States to take      immediate steps to stop bullying and harassment in the      Nation's schools.
