 President, it is with great pleasure that I rise today to pay tribute to Peter Zuanich, a man who has devoted 43 years of his life to serving as an elected commissioner of the Port of Bellingham, in my home State of Washington. His record of public service extends beyond his work as port commissioner; he has dedicated time and resources to building our community in so many other capacities.  During his tenure in this post, he has cultivated economic and trade relations both domestically and internationally. In particular, he has fostered economic relations between the states of Washington and Alaska. Under his leadership, the port was successful in its bid to become the southern ferry terminus for the Alaska Marine Highway System.  Throughout his entire career as commissioner, Mr. Zuanich did not spend any of the earnings he received. Instead, he invested them, believing they should eventually be spent on an important community project. He recently donated the entire amount--about $88,000--to a fund created to raise money for the construction of a local community swimming pool.  In addition to his many accomplishments as port commissioner, Mr. Zuanich has served as president of a variety of groups, including the board of directors of the Purse Seine Vessels Association, the executive board of the Commercial Fisherman's Inter-Insurance Agency, the Bellingham Jaycees, and the Washington Public Ports Association.  I admire the foresight Mr. Zuanich exhibited in his early involvement with the recycling industry. During the 1950's, he founded the first waste paper recycling facility in western Canada. His activism in this area has continued, through the establishment of recycling centers throughout our community, and I want to thank him for his efforts in this area.  He has been recognized in these professional and community involvements in many ways, winning the Bellingham Jaycees' Man of the Year Award, receiving the Master Mariner Award of the Propeller Club, accepting a Legislative Citation in 1993 from the Alaska State Legislature, and receiving a ``Citation of Merit'' award from the Washington Parks and Recreation Association.  Born in Bellingham, WA in 1916, he has worked tirelessly to promote the development of our community. Following his retirement, Mr. Zuanich will have more time to spend with his family, including his wife Marie and two sons, Robert and Peter, Jr.   I am proud to salute the leadership and dedication Mr. Zuanich has demonstrated throughout his life. Although he will be retiring on December 31, I am certain his record of selfless service will continue far into the years ahead. His hard work and philanthropy truly make him a role model for all. Mr. Zuanich, please accept my best wishes as you enter not only the conclusion of one of your careers, but the beginning of a new chapter of your life.                          ____________________
