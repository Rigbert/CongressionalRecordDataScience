Speaker, H.R. 3313, what day does the gentleman anticipate we will consider this bill? That is the Defense of Marriage Act. I yield to the gentleman.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding. I expect that that will come on Thursday. As the gentleman knows, sometimes these appropriations bills take longer than we anticipate. If they do, then it could be pushed over into Friday, but our intention is to bring that bill to the floor on Thursday.
