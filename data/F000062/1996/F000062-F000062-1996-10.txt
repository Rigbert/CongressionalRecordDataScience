 President, I rise today in appreciation of the leadership of Senator Roth, chairman of the Finance Committee, and Senator Moynihan, who brought to the Senate and secured passage of miscellaneous tariff legislation. The legislation takes a number of important steps and deserves our support.  I am particularly pleased Senator Roth and Senator Moynihan were able to incorporate S. 2021, a bill I introduced earlier this year which would reduce tariffs for certain chemicals used in a new AIDS drug that has shown encouraging test results. Upon approval, the Finance Committee bill will take an important step to reduce tariffs for these chemicals, which are not available in the United States.  We must do everything we can to find a cure for HIV/AIDS. However, until we have a cure for this urgent health priority, we need to find effective treatments and put them in the hands of people with needs. This provision will accelerate the manufacturing and finaltesting for a new protease inhibitor and deserves the full support of Congress.  S. 2021, legislation I introduced with my colleague Senator Boxer, would eliminate the tariff for several chemical compounds which are required for the manufacture of an AIDS drug, nelfinavir mesylate, which has produced promising test results.                          PROTEASE INHIBITORS  Nelfinavir is one of a new class of AIDS drugs called protease inhibitors. These drugs are designed to block an enzyme, called protease, that appears to play a crucial role in the replication of HIV.  During the 11th International Conference on AIDS in Vancouver, British Columbia, researchers released evidence that protease inhibitor drugs, when taken in combination with existing therapies, can reduce levels of the AIDS-causing virus in blood to levels so low that the virus is undetectable by even the most sensitive tests. AIDS researchers at the conference describe this new drug therapy as a major and unprecedented step in combating AIDS, one that may represent a treatment approach that may delay the onset of AIDS, extend patients' lives, and transform AIDS into a long-term, manageable disease.  Mr. President, HIV/AIDS is a critical public health issue, requiring the Nation's full attention. In America today, AIDS is the leading cause of death for young Americans between the ages of 25 and 44.  In my State of California, 1 out of every 200 Californians is HIV positive, while one of every 25 is HIV positive in my home of San Francisco.  More than 220,700 American men, women and children died of AIDS by the end of 1993. While the number of deaths trails other urgent health priorities such as cancer or heart disease, AIDS is nearly equally debilitating to the Nation when measured by the years of potential and productive life lost due to the disease.  AIDS is a paramount public health concern and every effort should be made to ensure that drugs are made available as swiftly and at as low a cost as possible. We simply cannot delay or waste time in providing drugs, treatments or materials needed to fight this disease. This tariff legislation represents a modest, but important, step.                    ZERO TARIFF FOR PHARMACEUTICALS  Under the 1994 GATT agreement, most pharmaceutical products are entitled to enter the country without a tariff. However, the zero tariff does not apply to many new pharmaceutical products or their chemical ingredients. As a result, the chemicals needed to make nelfinavir mesylate, an AIDS protease inhibitor currently undergoing research testing, but not yet a recognized pharmaceutical product under GATT, would be ineligible for the pharmaceutical zero tariff.  During negotiations with World Trade Organization nations to implement the pharmaceutical zero tariff, the administration successfully added the chemical compounds needed to manufacture the AIDS drug. As a result, the tariff will drop to zero on April 1, 1997.  Nelfinavir is on the Food and Drug Administration's fast-track approval process for AIDS drugs. Commercial production of the drug will begin well before April 1, in order that the drug can be immediately available to AIDS patients upon FDA approval. Although currently imported duty-free for use in clinical research trials, the imported chemicals will soon be used for commercial production. During the period of commercial production prior to April 1, the chemical compounds will face a 12 percent tariff, which will only add to the cost and delay the drug's production and distribution to individuals in need.  Fifteen days after enactment, this bill will eliminate the tariff for two of the essential and unique chemical inputs, as well as for the active ingredient nelfinavir, acid chloride, chloroalcohol and AG 1346, until April 1, 1997. On April 1, the tariff drops to zero under the WTO pharmaceutical agreement. Without this legislation, the manufacturer would face a 12 percent tariff for its chemicals, which are not available in the United States, as the drug proceeds into production. This tariff reduction will allow for the acceleration of drug production, providing more timely relief for the public.  The Congressional Budget Office reviewed S. 2021, concluding the legislation will have only a de minimis impact on tariff revenue. However, for AIDS patients, their families and those at risk, the impact may be profound. Congress should take this opportunity to reduce tariffs for these AIDS chemicals.  As a matter of public policy, we should do everything we can to develop AIDS drugs and treatments. Without this legislation to remove the tariff, we will be tolerating needless hurdles and delay, rather than expediting needed relief. Patients and their families do not have time to wait for the next round of drugs to be approved and added to the zero-tariff list, which is scheduled for review in 1999. By importing the chemical compounds without a tariff, we can accelerate the drug development process.  Ambassador Barshefsky and others in the Administration deserve tremendous credit for extending a zero tariff for these chemical components through international negotiations. I am pleased to support Chairman Roth and Senator Moynihan, the Finance Committee bill. I also wish to thank California Representatives Bill Thomas, Robert Matsui and Brian Bilbray for their bipartisan efforts to build support on the House. The legislation represents an encouraging step forward.                          ____________________
