President, I am necessarily absent today to attend funeral services for the former Rhode Island Superior Court's Presiding Justice, Anthony A. Giannini, in Providence.  Were I present today, I would vote ``yea'' on Executive Calendar No. 218, the nomination of R. Hewitt Pate to be an Assistant Attorney General.                          ____________________
