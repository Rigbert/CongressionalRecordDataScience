I think it is fair to say that the certification process today for the workers is almost a kind of bureaucratic water torture. It involves essentially a different process with different countries.  What we tried to do in our bipartisan discussions is to try to streamline the process, make it worker friendly. I think this is really going to expedite the processing, expedite the certification.  Obviously when these families are hurting--and we are talking about people who have been laid off after years and years of employment--they are on this economic tightrope trying to figure out how to balance and pay for essentials. The last thing they need to do is jump through hoop after bureaucratic hoop to get these benefits. The Senator from Minnesota is right, that is a significant improvement as well.  Nobody knows more about this subject than the Senator from Montana because he and his staff have worked on this issue at length. Streamlining is very helpful.
