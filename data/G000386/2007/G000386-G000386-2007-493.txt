 President, it is with a sense of sadness, but also pride, that I rise today to pay tribute to CPL. Jonathan E. Schiller of Ottumwa, IA, who gave his life on New Year's Eve in service to his country in Iraa. He is remembered by friends and family for his good humor and his patriotism. Corporal Schiller's parents, Bill and Liz Schiller, said of their son, ``Jon died doing what he loved, serving his country and protecting the freedom of our people and others. We are proud of our son's accomplishments and those of his fellow soldiers in the Army and all branches of the military. We are forever grateful to the Army for changing our boy into a man who fought and died defending something that we take for granted every day... freedom!'' My thoughts and prayers are with Bill and Liz, Jon's brothers Charlie and Max, and all of those in the Ottumwa area and elsewhere who mourn the loss of this brave young man. Jon Schiller's willingness to volunteer for military service in a time of war speaks loudly to his love of our country. He now joins the honored ranks of generations of American youth who have laid down their lives for the preservation of freedom. His courageous service and tremendous sacrifice must never be forgotten by a grateful Nation.                          ____________________
