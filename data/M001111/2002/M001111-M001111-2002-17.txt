 Collins) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:                              S. Res. 339       Whereas the prevalence of runaway and homeless youth in our      Nation is staggering, with studies suggesting that between      1,300,000 and 2,800,000 young people live on the streets of      the United States each year;       Whereas running away from home is widespread, with 1 out of      every 7 children in the United States running away before the      age of 18;       Whereas youth that end up on the streets are often those      who have been ``thrown out'' of their homes by their      families, who have been physically, sexually, and emotionally      abused at home, who have been discharged by State custodial      systems without adequate transition plans, who have lost      their parents through death or divorce, and who are too poor      to secure their own basic needs;       Whereas effective programs supporting runaway youth and      assisting young people in remaining at home with their      families succeed because of partnerships created among      families, community-based human service agencies, law      enforcement agencies, schools, faith-based organizations, and      businesses;       Whereas preventing young people from running away and      supporting youth in high-risk situations is a family,      community, and national responsibility;       Whereas the future well-being of the Nation is dependent on      the value placed on young people and the opportunities      provided for youth to acquire the knowledge, skills, and      abilities necessary to develop into safe, healthy, and      productive adults;       Whereas the National Network for Youth and its members      advocate on behalf of runaway and homeless youth and provide      an array of community-based support services that address the      critical needs of such youth;       Whereas the National Runaway Switchboard provides crisis      intervention and referrals to reconnect runaway youth to      their families and to link young people to local resources      that provide positive alternatives to running away; and       Whereas the National Network for Youth and National Runaway      Switchboard are co-sponsoring National Runaway Prevention      Month to increase public awareness of the life circumstances      of youth in high-risk situations and the need for safe,      healthy, and productive alternatives, resources, and supports      for youth, families, and communities: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That the Senate designates November 2002, as      ``National Runaway Prevention Month''.
