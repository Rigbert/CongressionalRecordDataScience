On this vote, the yeas are 60, the nays are 38. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in the affirmative, the motion to waive section 204(a)(5)(A) of S. Con. Res. 21 regarding emergency legislation is agreed to. As a result, the point of order falls.  Pursuant to the previous order which imposed a 60-vote threshold for the adoption of this conference report, this vote also constitutes the vote on the adoption of the conference report.  Pursuant to that order, the conference report to accompany H.R. 1 is agreed to, and the motion to reconsider that vote is considered made and laid upon the table.
