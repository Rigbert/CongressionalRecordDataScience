President, two days ago, we recognized World IP Day, celebrating the profound contributions that artists and inventors make to our culture and beyond. The theme of this year's World IP Day was Digital Creativity: Culture Reimagined, and events around the world focused on how to promote and protect creative efforts in the digital age. As we look forward to new and innovative digital creations we must also be vigilant in preserving the past.  We must ensure that the films and recordings that played vital roles in shaping and recording the American experience are preserved for future generations. Those works, created by previous generations, tell us who we are, and who we were, as a society. To help ensure that these records of our history, our dreams, and our aspirations can be viewed and appreciated by future generations, I am joining with Senator Grassley to introduce legislation reauthorizing the Library of Congress sound recording and film preservation programs.  Congress has long recognized the importance of cultural preservation, creating the National Film Preservation Program in 1988 and the National Sound Recording Preservation Program in 2000 within the Library of Congress. Both programs help preserve historical and cultural artifacts that would otherwise disappear or be destroyed through the passage of time. The Library of Congress uses the programs to advance important preservation efforts including recognizing filmsand sound recordings on the National Film and National Recording Registries.  The programs also created the federally chartered National Film and National Recording Preservation Foundations. The foundations provide grants to a wide array of educational and non-profit organizations to preserve films and sound recordings. To date, the National Film Preservation Foundation has given grants to organizations in all 50 States, including to Hildene, the Lincoln Family Home in Manchester, Vermont, which used the money to preserve home movies of Robert Todd Lincoln's descendants from the 1920s to the 1940s. Well over 2000 films, many of which can now be viewed online, have been preserved through the Foundation's grants. Among the preserved films is the earliest feature film shot in Vermont, ``A Vermont Romance'' from 1916.  By reauthorizing these important programs through 2027, this legislation will allow the Library of Congress and the Foundations to continue their important work in preserving America's fading treasures, as well as providing grants that will help libraries, museums, and archives preserve these works and make them available for study and research. I urge my colleagues to act swiftly to pass this legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                      Northeast Historic Film,                                    Bucksport, ME, April 20, 2016.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: Founded in 1986, Northeast Historic      Film has built the largest existing collection of moving      images documenting the history and heritage of northern New      England. And since the founding of the National Film      Preservation Foundation, the NFPF has been the largest and      most important source of funds for preserving these works.       The preserved films include A Vermont Romance (1916), the      earliest feature film shot in Vermont; film documentation of      the 1927 flood; textile mill owners and workers in Maine; the      home movies of Charles Norman Shay, a Penobscot Indian elder      who is a decorated veteran of the D-Day invasion;      Provincetown, Massachusetts, in 1915; a 4-H club in 1946; a      tuberculosis sanitarium in 1934, and over two dozen other      examples of community life and activity in the region.       Communications with colleagues in archives around the      country inform us of the crucial significance of National      Film Preservation Foundation funding. Moving image      repositories from coast to coast benefit from NFPF grants.      The dedicated staff, which efficiently shepherds NFPF      financial resources, has ensured that our nation's heritage      will continue to be available for study and enjoyment.       We are grateful to you and NFPF's friends in Congress for      help in the past--and for assistance with the upcoming      reauthorization. Our film heritage depends on it.           Sincerely,                                    David Weiss and Karan Sheldon,                                Founders, Northeast Historic Film.                                 ______                                       By
