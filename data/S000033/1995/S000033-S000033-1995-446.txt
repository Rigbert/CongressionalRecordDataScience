 Speaker, I rise in support of the Legal Service Corporation, and in opposition to the destructive 30 percent cut of that program in the Commerce-State-Justice appropriations bill.  Mr. Speaker, a bedrock principle of this Nation is equal justice for all. But we all know that access to justice for ordinary Americans usually means access to legal counsel.  Often, the most vulnerable among us--those most in need of legal help and representation--cannot afford an attorney. That is why the Supreme Court ruled everyone has a right to a lawyer in a criminal case, and it is why President Nixon founded the Legal Service Corporation to offer low-income Americans representation in civil court.  Mr. Speaker, when this House voted to slash funding for the Legal Service Corporation, in my view it voted to restrict access to justice for the over 15 percent of Americans who live in poverty. Mr. Chairman, that is unconscionable.  Legal services attorneys were there for family farmers who couldn't afford high-priced, downtown lawyers, when they helped prevent over 250,000 illegal farm foreclosures. In Vermont and across this country, they are there for battered women seeking orders of protection, child support enforcement, and divorces from abusive spouses. These attorneys were there to safeguard coal miners' rights in Kentucky, and to protect Oregon farmworkers from beatings, kidnappings and illegally low wages.  These public servants are funded by a model of efficiency and federalism. Only 3 percent of Legal Service Corporation expenditures go to administrative costs, meaning 97 percent goes directly to provide legal services for poor Americans. There is no large bureaucracy; the approximately 100 employees of the Corporation spend their time distributing Federal funds to 323 independent, local legal services programs and ensuring they receive the support needed to deliver top notch legal level help. Each individual program is a private, nonprofit corporation governed by a locally appointed board of directors.  Mr. Chairman, the Legal Service Corporation simply extends equal rights and justice to all Americans; it does exactly what Government should be doing. If we are serious about deficit reduction, we should cut the hundreds of billions of dollars in corporate welfare in the Federal budget. We should eliminate tax giveaways to the rich before we eliminate these protections for the most vulnerable members of our society.  For the benefit of my colleagues, I ask unanimous consent to insert into the Record a resolution from the New England Bar Association board of directors, which succinctly makes the case for the Legal Service Corporation.                      New England Bar Association                     board of directors resolution       Whereas, equal justice is fundamental to the American      system of government under laws; and       Whereas, the inability to afford legal counsel effectively      denies access to justice for individuals with legal needs;      and       Whereas, the New England Bar Association is strongly      committed to support adequate legal services for the poor;      and       Whereas, the federal Legal Services Corporation is the      organization charged by Congress with funding legal services      programs throughout the country to deliver civil legal      services to the poor; and       Whereas, local legal services programs funded by the Legal      Services Corporation represent the federal government's      effort to fulfill the promise that all Americans have an      equal opportunity to utilize the justice system, and       Whereas, local legal services programs funded by the      federal Legal Services Corporation are a frugal and effective      expenditure of federal tax dollars, inexpensively and      efficiently serving a broad range of persons with typical      legal problems through more than 900 local offices and      effectively leveraging local, state and private funds as well      as pro bono services from the private bar, and       Whereas, the future of the Legal Services Corporation is at      a critical juncture, facing Congressional threats to      eliminate or severely cut funding of the Legal Services      Corporation; and       Whereas, it is imperative that bar associations and others      concerned with equal access to justice and legal services for      the poor continue to express support for the civil legal      services delivery system which has served the legal needs of      the country's poorest citizens; and       Now, therefore, be it resolved that the New England Bar      Association Board of Directors urges all members of the      Congressional delegation to support adequate funding for the      Legal Services Corporation to address the tremendous unmet      need for civil legal services for the poor.       Be it further resolved that the New England Bar Association      strongly opposes any amendments to the Legal Services      Corporation Act to restrict legal services and pro bono      programs in their use of IOLTA and other government and      private monies; create obstacles to low income people      obtaining justice in the courts and legal system; impinge on      confidentiality between attorneys and their clients; or      dismantle local control and destroy the effectiveness of the      current legal services delivery system.                               ____________________
