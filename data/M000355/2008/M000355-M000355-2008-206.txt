 President, with regard to the Medicare issue upon which we just voted, we have had a number of discussions in the course of the week about the way forward. Senator Grassley has made it clear he would like to lead us in negotiations with the majority, represented by Senator Baucus, to bring us together to get this Medicare extension completed. The way to do it is on a bipartisan basis.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of a Senate bill, which I will send to the desk. It is a clean 30-day extension of the Medicare payments bill.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read the third time, and passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.
