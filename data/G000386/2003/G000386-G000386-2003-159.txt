 President, Senator Landrieu, Senator Bunning and I are happy to introduce the Adoption Promotion Act of 2003, a bill that would extend and improve the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997. Across the country there are thousands of children of all ages and needs who are waiting to be adopted into stable families. This legislation provides a reward to States that place an emphasis on finding loving homes for children who are in foster care.  The Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 rewarded States with cash incentives for increasing the number of adoptions of children in foster care, concentrating on children with special needs. Adoption levels were on the rise before the introduction of this legislation, but grew even faster after implementation of the program. Studies project that an additional 34,000 children were adopted during the first 3 years of the program. Currently each of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico have received incentive payments from the increased number of adoptions. My home State of Iowa just received a payment of $524,000 because of its success in finding children in foster care permanent homes. The results are clear, adoption incentives are working.  There are many people in this country who have opened their arms to children that do not fit the typical mold. The Lippert family of Council Bluffs, IA is just one example. Over the last 25 years, they have adopted 16 children, in addition to their two biological children. Their doors are still open to children in need. Within the next 6 months their nest will become even larger; they have three teenage girls who are in the process of being adopted. All but one of these children have special needs, ranging from emotional to physical disabilities. None of these challenges have stopped the Lippert family from helping their children become successful members of the community. The Lippert family has given these children a chance to be part of a loving and permanent family, an opportunity they would otherwise not have had.  But much remains to be done. While adoption incentives have helped states place a large number of children in families, there are still thousands of children without such luck. The incentive program helps to promote the needs of children for whom it is challenging to find an adoptive home. Take for example, children over the age of 9. The probability that these children will ever find a permanent home exceeds the probability they will be adopted into a loving family. This legislation adds an incentive for States to increase the number of older children adopted out of foster care.  Adoption is a positive life-changing experience. My bill builds upon the success of the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997. It recognizes these successes and continues to challenge States to remove children from foster care and place them with a permanent family. Adoptions give children a loving home and families an opportunity to share their love with a child in need. I encourage the Senate to consider this important piece of legislation and continue to reward States that are working to place children in permanent homes.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1686       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Adoption Promotion Act of      2003''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       The Congress finds the following:       (1) In 1997, the Congress passed the Adoption and Safe      Families Act of 1997 to promote comprehensive child welfare      reform to ensure that consideration of children's safety is      paramount in child welfare decisions, and to provide a      greater sense of urgency to find every child a safe,      permanent home.       (2) The Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 also created      the Adoption Incentives program, which authorizes incentive      payments to States to promote adoptions, with additional      incentives provided for the adoption of foster children with      special needs.       (3) Since 1997, all States, the District of Columbia, and      Puerto Rico have qualified for incentive payments for their      work in promoting adoption of foster children.       (4) Between 1997 and 2002, adoptions increased by 64      percent, and adoptions of children with special needs      increased by 63 percent; however, 542,000 children remain in      foster care, and 126,000 are eligible for adoption.       (5) Although substantial progress has been made to promote      adoptions, attention should be focused on promoting adoption      of older children. Recent data suggest that half of the      children waiting to be adopted are age 9 or older.     SEC. 3. REAUTHORIZATION OF ADOPTION INCENTIVE PAYMENTS                    PROGRAM.
