 President, I rise today to alert this body to a very special event, which took place this past weekend, called NetDay. NetDay, which began in 1996, is a unique partnership between the public, private and educational communities with the common goal of fitting K-12 classrooms with the technological infrastructure needed for the 21st century.  In the beginning of this year, on behalf of myself, Senator John Warner, Senator Conrad Burns, Senator Charles Robb, Senator Patty Murray, and Senator Barbara Boxer, I introduced Sense of the Senate Resolution 51, celebrating the success of NetDay activities and encouraging all schools to participate in 1997 NetDay activities, including the projects which took place this past weekend. As I did in February of this year, when I introduced the NetDay resolution, I would like to again commend the organizers and volunteers of NetDay, an excellent example of individuals creating a stronger community with the goal of increasing the quality of their schools.  The success of this weekend was impressive. Although it is still too early to cite official statistics of Saturday's event, NetDay organizers have stated that ``schools up and down the State, in isolated towns in the north, farming towns in the central valley, and hundreds in urban communities all participated in NetDay.'' In addition, the 38 empowerment zone schools of the Los Angeles Unified School District were involved in NetDay activities and future planning. Last year alone, NetDay was successful in bringing out more than 100,000 Americans, including 50,000 Californians to volunteer in their neighborhood schools. These students, teachers, parents, and friends of the schools, came to wire classrooms and school libraries throughout the Nation. Thousands of individuals accomplished their goal to install communications cables, connect wires and switches to upgrading their schools for the 21st century.  The success of NetDay is significant. Last year, over 25,000 elementary, junior and senior high schools were wired. I expect these numbers to dramatically increase as NetDay organizer compile results from Saturday's activities. Throughout the United States, volunteers climbed ladders and got on their hands and knees to install the wiring infrastructure needed to connect thousands of elementary and secondary school classrooms with contemporary technology.  As I have mentioned in earlier floor speeches, NetDay began in California on March 9, 1996. The term was coined by cofounders John Gage of Sun Microsystems, one of the Nation's leading technology companies and Michael Kaufman of KQED, a California public broadcasting station. Mr. Gage and Mr. Kaufman saw this initiative as a day where hundreds of Californians came out to an ``old fashioned barn raising for the modern technology age.''  Just as volunteers would gather in the Nation's early years, with neighbor helping neighbor, to build homes, barns or community buildings, California's NetDay volunteers gather in support of neighborhood schools. Amazingly, and to their surprise, NetDay succeeded in one year in wiring 3,500 schools efficiently and cost-effectively, establishing and improving our classroom information infrastructure up and down the State.  However, as our classrooms continue to modernize and improve their technological infrastructure there is much work to be accomplished, both in California and throughout the Nation. Consider the following:  According to the Department of Education half of our K-12 schools lack full access to advance technology in the classroom.  Ninety-five percent of those K-12 schools who want to but are not yet wired, do not have the needed budgetary resources or organized volunteer base to wire their schools.  Rural areas and regions with high poverty continue to have less access to advanced educational technology compared to their suburban and urban counterparts.  These few points illustrate that there is still much to be done in our children's classrooms. NetDay organizers are committed to working with under served neighborhoods and ensuring that the appropriate resources, both in volunteers and computer wiring kits, are channels to these communities. In addition, this year's NetDay will focus on communities that did not fully benefit from last years initial set ofprojects and activities. In all, NetDay continues to save schools and taxpayers millions of dollars in educational technology startup costs, while training and equipping teachers with the knowledge needed to be a successful and integral part of the technical educational experience.  According to NetDay organizers, this year's relationship between private business, the labor community, and neighborhood schools is stronger than ever. Business sponsors and corporate volunteers will be instrumental in making NetDay a successful reality. The small, and large, companies continue to supply the project the needed computer and wiring equipment, and have also encouraged their employees to work with their children's or neighborhood schools. In addition, the labor community will continue to go into schools across America, where they are committed to work with private partners in ensuring that their local schools have the educational infrastructure needed for a well trained work force for the 21st century. The most valuable asset of NetDay continues to be the commitment of thousands of volunteers who will work in their community schools.  As the communities throughout America celebrate their NetDay accomplishments and prepare for future activities for this year and beyond, it is my honor to once again, recognize the NetDay cofounders, Michael Kaufman and John Gage, and organizers, Ann Murphy and Teresa Wann, and the dozens of corporate sponsors and business partners, and the thousands of students, teachers, parents, and school administrators for their achievement. The success and commitment they have shown to America and my State of California should be applauded.  My colleague and cochair on the U.S. Senate information technology caucus, Senator John Warner, Senator Conrad Burns of Montana, Senator Charles Robb of Virginia, Senator Patty Murray from Washington, and my California colleague Senator Barbara Boxer join me in supporting the advancement of educational technology by sponsoring this resolution. Together, we urge our Senate colleagues to affirm congressional support for preparing U.S. classrooms with the needed technological infrastructure for the 21st century.  I invite my Senate colleagues to join this public-private partnership effort and I congratulate all the volunteers who participated in NetDay 1997 and encourage them to keep up the commendable and exemplary work.                          ____________________
