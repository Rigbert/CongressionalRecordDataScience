Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing H.R. 241, the Veterans Beneficiary Fairness Act of 2003. This legislation, which is cosponsored by my friend Lane Evans of Illinois, the Ranking Member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, will correct a deficiency in the law that negatively affects some surviving spouses of disabled veterans.  Currently, if a veteran dies while a claim for VA benefits (other than insurance and servicemen's indemnity) is being processed, but before his or her claim becomes final, the surviving spouse is entitled to no more than two years of accrued benefits when the claim is decided in the veteran's favor. H.R. 241 would repeal this two-year limitation so that the veteran's survivor may receive the full amount of the award and not be penalized by VA's failure to resolve a claim in less than two years.  Mr. Speaker, while VA has made great efforts to lower claims processing times, the fact remains that it can sometimes take more than 2 years to correctly determine and adjudicate a claim. When this process takes an inordinate length of time, it is simply not fair to prevent veterans' survivors from receiving disability or pension benefit payments the veteran would have received if VA had been able to process claims in a timely fashion. H.R. 241 would ensure that a veteran's survivor would not suffer because the veteran died while waiting for the claim to be adjudicated.  Mr. Speaker, it is my intention that the Veterans' Affairs Committee consider this bill as soon as possible during the 1st Session of the 108th Congress. It is a matter of fairness and I urge all of my colleagues to join in this effort.                          ____________________
