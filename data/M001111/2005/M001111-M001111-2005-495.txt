 President, the Senate is now going to consider the real amendment on whether we are going to help our veterans. The amendment we just passed was a token amount of money to help our veterans--laudable but nowhere near what we need. The amendment we are now considering will provide the funding so the 700,000 veterans who are waiting will get the services they need.  Why do we need this? Because the number of veterans receiving veterans care has gone up 88 percent. Medical inflation has gone up 92 percent. We made a commitment to those who serve us that we will be there to serve them. That is our responsibility.  Across this country, veterans are calling to see if we keep our promise to America's veterans to fund health care now. That is what this amendment will do. It is our responsibility. It implies we will keep the promise we made when we asked young people to serve us overseas, that we will be there when they come home. It is the responsibility of this body, and I urge its adoption.
