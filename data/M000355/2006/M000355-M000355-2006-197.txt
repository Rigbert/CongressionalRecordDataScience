 President and Members of the Senate, next week we will resume consideration of the Oman free trade bill. Under the time agreement, we will have a vote on passage on Tuesday. Senators should expect this vote to occur before our weekly policy lunches. This will be the first vote of the week.  We now also have an agreement to finish a very important nomination, that of Alice Fisher--of Louisville, KY, I might add--to be Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division. We will consider that nomination early next week as well. I thank all Members for their attention.                          ____________________[Page S9663]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                                PROGRAM  Mr. McCONNELL.
