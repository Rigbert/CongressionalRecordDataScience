Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the Speaker's table the bill (H.R. 2215) to authorize appropriations for the Department of Justice for fiscal year 2002, and for other purposes, with a Senate amendment thereto, disagree to the Senate amendment and agree to the conference asked by the Senate.
