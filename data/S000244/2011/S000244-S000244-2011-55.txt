Speaker, I rise today in honor of one of my longest-serving staff, Thomas B. Schreibel. Tom has been by my side for the past 27 years, serving in several roles, including my Chief of Staff for the past 10 years. While Tom's work ethic and guidance have earned him the title Chief of Staff, his loyalty, sense of humor and dedication have earned him the additional titles--friend, family and my peer.  Tom is a natural leader who has demonstrated his capabilities by setting examples and providing sound guidance and mentorship. For the past 27 years, Tom has worked with scores of interns, staffers and Members of Congress. No matter the person, he would treat everyone the same. He would avail himself to his colleagues to work through challenges when they needed his astute judgment or spend precious time with aspiring young staffers who knew that Tom's unique characteristics and insight would aid them in their own lives. Tom has also provided guidance to my colleagues in the House of Representatives who recognized that his expertise and experience in many areas have no equivalent. Throughout his career, Tom has turned many such working relationships into lasting friendships.  Tom's commitment to public service and Wisconsin's Fifth Congressional District has served our country well. As the Chairman of the House Committee on the Judiciary, I relied on Tom's depth of knowledge, counsel and political sense as I shepherded numerous bills through the House of Representatives. Tom was with me when the USA PATRIOT Act, Voting Rights Act, the Americans with Disabilities Amendments Act and the REAL ID Act were passed by Congress and presented to the President for his signature. These, and many other laws I worked on, have made America safer, guaranteed the rights of the disabled, and protected the right to vote. Upon leaving this institution, Tom should know that he played a significant role in these important pieces of legislation.  Tom's departure from the U.S. House of Representatives will leave a void. He has been a rock that I have relied on throughout much of my tenure in Congress. Tom leaves behind a legacy of leadership and dedication that will be a saving grace to my staff, and indeed this institution, long into the future. His example will serve as a beacon of light to all those on Capitol Hill who wish to serve this nation and her people. I hope that future leaders in Congress will be as blessed as I have been.  Please join me in wishing Tom, his wife Dana, and son Brent, all of the best as Tom leaves Congress for new challenges and opportunities. On behalf of my family, the House of Representatives and my staff, I thank Tom for his service to this nation and her people, and congratulate him on a job well done.                          ____________________
