Chairman, H.R. 1271 authorizes the FAA to carry out its research, engineering, and development program for fiscal years 1998, 1999, and 2000. The objective of the RE program is to develop and validate the technology and knowledge required for the FAA to ensure the safety, efficiency, and security of our national air transportation system. Advances developed through the RE program are helping transform the FAA into a modern air traffic management system capable of meeting the increased aviation demands of the coming century.  I would like to thank the Chair of the Subcommittee on Technology, the gentlewoman from Maryland [Mrs. Morella], and the ranking member of the subcommittee, the gentleman from Tennessee [Mr. Gordon], for the hard work they have done in crafting H.R. 1271. The legislation was reported out of the Committee on Science with strong bipartisan support.  Overall, H.R. 1271 authorizes $217 million in fiscal year 1998, $224 million in fiscal year 1999, and $231 million in fiscal year 2000 for the FAA to carry out the critical projects and activities of the FAA RE program, including research and development in the areas of capacity management, navigation, weather, aircraft safety, systems security, and human factors.  While including some increases for critical FAA research activities such as weather and computer security, H.R. 1271 does not provide a blank check to the FAA. The legislation contains language that restricts noncompetitive research grants and prohibits funding of lobbying activities.  Further, as chairman of the House Science Committee, I plan to work in a bipartisan fashion with the ranking member, the gentleman from California [Mr. Brown], and other members of the committee to provide responsible FAA oversight that protects our Nation's investment in aviation research and development. I have also notified the FAA that the Committee on Science intends to take an active role this year in the development of the agency's overall strategic plan as required by the Results Act.  At this point, I insert into the Record an exchange of correspondence between the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Shuster] and myself relative to jurisdictional concerns thatwill be addressed in a few minutes by an amendment that the subcommittee chair, the gentlewoman from Maryland [Mrs. Morella] will propose.  The correspondence referred to follows:                                         House of Representatives,                                         Committee on Science,                                   Washington, DC, April 23, 1997.     Hon. Bud Shuster,     Chairman, House Committee on Transportation and          Infrastructure, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Bud: On April 16, 1997, the House Committee on Science      marked up and reported out H.R. 1271, FAA Research,      Engineering, and Development Authorization Act of 1997.       Traditionally, provisions in this bill have been      incorporated into the FAA Authorization Acts when considered      on the House Floor, indicating your substantive interest in      the research components of the FAA.       Because of our Committee's desire to expeditiously consider      H.R. 1271, it is my understanding that you will not object to      its consideration by the House.       I acknowledge that H.R. 1271 in no way impacts the      traditional jurisdictional lines under which the Committee on      Science and the Committee on Transportation and      Infrastructure have operated for years. Under the Rules of      the House, the Science Committee only has jurisdiction over      civil aviation research and development funded through the      Research, Engineering, and Development account. The Committee      on Transportation and Infrastructure has jurisdiction over      FAA's other functions. Historically, the Transportation and      Infrastructure Committee has had exclusive jurisdiction over      the Facilities and Equipment account. H.R. 1271 is not      intended to change that.       I appreciate your willingness to work with us to expedite      the consideration of H.R. 1271. I look forward to continuing      to work with you on these issues.           Sincerely,                                      F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr.,     Chairman.                                                                    ____                                    Congress of the United States,                                     House of Representatives,                                   Washington, DC, April 23, 1997.     Hon. F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr.,     Chairman, Committee on Science,     Rayburn Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Jim: Thank you for your letter of April 23, 1997      concerning H.R. 1271, the FAA Research, Engineering, and      Development Act of 1997 which your Committee has reported      out. This legislation authorizes funding for FAA's R      programs for fiscal years 1998-2000.       As you correctly point out, the Transportation and      Infrastructure Committee has traditionally taken a great deal      of interest in the research components of FAA. This letter is      to confirm that because of your willingness to accommodate      our concerns about the bill and because of your desire to      take the bill to the Floor expeditiously, I have no      objections to its consideration. Also, I appreciate your      acknowledgment that the bill in no way impacts the      traditional jurisdictional lines under which our Committees      have operated, especially with regard to the Transportation      and Infrastructure Committee's exclusive jurisdiction over      the Facilities and Equipment Account.       Finally, I would ask that a copy of our exchange of letters      on this matter be placed in the Record during consideration      of the bill on the Floor. Thank you for your cooperation and      assistance on this matter.       With warm personal regards, I am           Sincerely,                                                      Bud Shuster,                                                         Chairman.  Mr. Chairman, I strongly urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1271, which continues to demonstrate our Nation's commitment to aviation research and development. H.R. 1271 will enable our country to continue to lead the world in developing and implementing new aviation technologies that make aviation more efficient while improving safety.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
