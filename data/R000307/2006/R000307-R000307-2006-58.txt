That is why our bill improves the ability of the current manufacturers to remain in the U.S. market and encourages more companies to enter the market with domestic-based production facilities. We provide grants to manufacturers for technical assistance from the Food and Drug Administration and grants for capital improvements in technology or production capacity.  Our bill also addresses the need to quickly find the medical professionals in the event of an emergency. We require the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to work with our State and local health departments to develop a registry, if you will, of medical personnel who can provide services during a public health emergency. Such a system was required under the Bioterrorism Act passed by Congress 4 years ago. But there is still no working system in place. This is unacceptable. We must have a system that can easily identify doctors and other health professionals who can assist during a public health emergency--that is common sense--especially during an emergency that affects many areas across State lines. This will allow our Federal, State, and local officials to move quickly and efficiently to provide Medicare to those in need.  During Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath, I heard from many doctors and other health professionals across Kansas--I am sure the Senator from New York did as well--who wanted to volunteer their time in the gulf coast area. However, their desire to help those in need was hampered by the inability of Government officials to easily identify a doctor who was credentialed or other health providers from other States who could provide care. This is why Senator Clinton and I now stand before our colleagues to stress that we can no longer wait for the development of such a registry of medical personnel. We are working and will continue to work with the HELP Committee to make sure this is a priority in the bioterrorism reauthorization.
