 A study recently released by the Treasury shows that under the President's proposal--this is the President's proposal but still germane--77 percent of the money going to cut the top 39.6-percent rate would go to small business owners. These small business owners make up 63 percent of the tax returns that would benefit from reducing the top rate. Small business owners are, of course, the engine of growth that runs our economy. These are the people who plow their tax money and their tax relief right back into their businesses, increasing wages, hiring more workers.  The number of small businesses that could benefit from a cut in the top rate, for instance, in the State of Arizona, is around 267,000 small businesses. I seriously question how much we really gain by attacking these small businesses with high rates.  Another twist is, for those of you who are interested in disabled children and kids with special needs, there are special needs trusts. These trusts for the disabled can be easily subject to taxation at the top rate of 39.6 percent.  I urge Members to vote down the amendment.
