Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy), the majority leader, for the purpose of inquiring of the schedule for the week to come.  Mr. McCARTHY of California. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the House will meet at noon for morning-hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business, but no votes are expected. On Tuesday and Wednesday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning-hour and noon for legislative business. On Thursday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business. Last votes of the week are expected no later than 3 p.m. On Friday, no votes are expected.  Mr. Speaker, the House will consider a number of suspensions next week, a complete list of which will be announced by close of business today.  On Monday, in addition to our usual suspensions, the House will consider H.R. 5781, the California Emergency Drought Relief Act of 2014, authored by my good friend, Representative David Valadao.  California is facing the worst drought in over a century, and that has a negative impact not only on our State's economy, but on the entire Nation's food supply. This legislation is critical so that we don't let precious water from current and future storms wash away to the ocean.  Mr. Speaker, the House is also expected to consider legislation to address the upcoming expiration of our current continuing resolution, as well as legislation on the expiration of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act.  I thank the gentleman.
