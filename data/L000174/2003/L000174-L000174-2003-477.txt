President, I know Mr. Chertoff is waiting, biting his nails, wondering if he will get through this. I would mention for those of my colleagues who might actually be watching this, I will vote for him. I will support him. I urge them to do the same.  I yield back the remainder of my time and ask for the yeas and nays.
