  So, Mr. President, I hope that this ethics manual will be useful to Members of the Senate and to others who will need to become at least generally familiar with the rules of the Senate.  Again, I thank the staff of the Ethics Committee for an outstanding piece of work. It was really quite a difficult project. I thank them on behalf of all Members of the Senate.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The clerk will call the roll.  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.
