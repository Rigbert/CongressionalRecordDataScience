Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication to the community and to the overall well-being and safety of my hometown of Corona, CA, is exceptional. The City of Corona has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give time and talent to making their communities a better place to live and work. John Robert Dalzell is one of these individuals. On Thursday, June 27, 2002, John Robert Dalzell will be retiring after 31 years of dedicated service to the community as a law enforcement officer. His outstanding work as a police officer, in addition to his personal involvement in the community, will be celebrated at a luncheon in his honor.  John Robert Dalzell was born in Illinois on September 1, 1947 and shortly after his family moved to Arizona. After graduation from high school, John enlisted for and honorably served in the United States Navy for five years which included tours of duty in Vietnam. He obtained his Bachelor's Degree from Chapman College and began his law enforcement career with the Corona Police Department as a reserve officer and police officer in 1976. He was promoted to the rank of lieutenant in 1980 and to captain in 1983.  John's exemplary career as a police officer includes serving as the commanding officer in charge of all three divisions in the police department. John holds several advanced PeaceOfficer Standards and Training certificates including Advanced and Executive Certificate and has served on law enforcement advisory boards throughout Riverside County.  John has also been actively involved in the community, as the past president and current member of the Corona Breakfast Lions club, former chairman of the American Cancer Society Charity Dinner Committee and the 2001 recipient of the Temescal District Boy Scouts of America Distinguished Citizen Award.  John's tireless work as a police officer has contributed unmeasurably to the safety and betterment of the City of Corona. His involvement in community organizations of the City of Corona make me proud to call him a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that all of Corona is grateful for his efforts and salute him as he departs. I look forward to continuing to work with him for the good of our community in the future.                          ____________________
