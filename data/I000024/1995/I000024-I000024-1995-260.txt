President, for weeks on end now we have been debating this issue, and I think we know what the arguments are.  The other night I took to the floor and spent 1 hour and 10 minutes diffusing the 11 arguments that have been given against the balanced budget amendment. The bottom line is that those are not real arguments. The bottom line is that those individuals who are going to use arguments against the balanced budget amendment really do not want to cut spending.  Mr. President, the American people do. Let us look at what happened on last November 8. Last November 8, using the two indices of the stimulus bill for spending hikes and the National Taxpayers Union rating for tax increases, virtually everyone in the House and the Senate that was defeated on November 8 voted for the stimulus increase--that is the spending increase--and was rated either a ``D'' or an ``F'' by the National Taxpayers Union.  The bottom line is the big spenders and the big taxers do not want a balanced budget amendment, but the American people do. And we have the unique opportunity to give them what they asked for on November 8.
