 President, 2 weeks ago, four Seattle firefighters died in the line of duty: Lt. Walter Kilgore, Lt. Gregory Shoemaker, and firefighters Randall Terlicker and James Brown. They are heroes in the truest sense of the word. Jon Gillis, president of the Seattle Firefighters Union, said these four men gave their lives for the noblest of causes, for the safety and protection of others. I join him in that sentiment.  In the midst of this tragedy, the community came together to pay homage to these fallen firefighters. But the pain of this loss extended beyond Seattle: More than 10,000 firefighters, police officers, paramedics, and citizens from across North America and from as far away as Australia, came to Seattle to honor these firefighters.  Too often, we fail to say thank you to these brave men and women who serve us as firefighters, police officers, and members of the Armed Forces. The professions they have chosen are full of risk. Seattle Mayor Norm Rice recently reminded us these guardians of our society play a special role, and, tragically, sometimes pay the ultimate price for their service. They are extraordinary individuals and make a real difference in our lives and in our communities. They are quiet heroes who deserve our respect, our admiration, and our gratitude.  Their families also share the hardships and pain that come along with these jobs. I know because one of my brothers is a firefighter in Tacoma, WA, and I can tell you the danger inherent in his job is felt by his immediate and extended family. I would like to take this opportunity to personally thank the men and women, and their families, who dedicate their lives to protecting our communities.  I am deeply saddened by the death of these four firefighters, and want to pay tribute to the sacrifice these extraordinary individuals have made. Lt. Walter Kilgore, Lt. Gregory Shoemaker, and firefighters Randall Terlicker and James Brown truly represent what is best about America.                          ____________________
