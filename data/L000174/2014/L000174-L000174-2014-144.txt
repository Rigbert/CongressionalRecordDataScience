President, my daughter Alicia works for the Motion Picture Association of America and sent me a report from the Wall Street Journal written by Robert Iger.  My wife Marcelle and I, as well as Alicia, have been to Mr. Iger's home and spent time with him, his highly talented wife Willow Bay, and their children. We have all been impressed with the enthusiasm and direction he brings to the Walt Disney Company, and some of my most interesting times have been with him talking about it.  Mr. President, I wanted to share with others his report, and I ask consent that it be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:              [From the Wall Street Journal, July 7, 2014]      Disney's Iger on the Future of Leisure: Technology Built on                               Storytelling                          (By Robert A. Iger)       In 1956, the year after Disneyland opened, Walt Disney was      asked to imagine what entertainment would be like a half-     century into the future.       As one of the world's great innovators, Walt had just      introduced people to a new form of leisure entertainment--the      theme park. But when it came to predicting the future, Walt      said that was beyond his powers, given the rapid pace of      change in the entertainment industry.       One thing was certain, Walt said: The centuries-old human      need for great storytelling would endure for generations to      come, enhanced by new technologies that would bring these      tales to life in extraordinary ways.       Walt was better at predicting the future than he realized.      Six decades later, technology is lifting the limits of      creativity and transforming the possibilities for      entertainment and leisure. Today's digital era has unleashed      unprecedented innovation, giving rise to an array of new      entertainment options competing for our time and attention.       As Walt also predicted, people's need to be entertained      with storytelling has endured: We gravitate to the universal      stories that bind us--tales of adventure, heroism and love,      tales that provide comfort and escape. Great storytelling      still remains the bedrock of great entertainment.       In the years ahead, this fusion of technology and      creativity will allow us to deliver experiences once      unimaginable. What will that future look like? Like Walt, I'm      hesitant to make predictions. But a few things seem certain      to me.       To start, the 20th-century concept of ``one size fits all''      no longer applies, as innovators around the world create      tools that allow us to customize entertainment and leisure      experiences to fit our own tastes and schedules and share      them instantly with friends, family and an ever-growing      digitally connected global community. In short, we are      creating what I like to call technology-enabled leisure.       Mobile storytelling, and mobile entertainment, will      dominate our lives, and offer rich, compelling experiences      well beyond what is available today. Where someone is will no      longer be a barrier to being entertained; the geography of      leisure will be limitless. One of the most exciting      developments I see on the     horizon is technology that will immerse us into entertaining      worlds, or project those worlds and experiences into our      lives. In essence, entertainment will be immeasurably      enhanced with both virtual-reality experiences and augmented-     reality experiences. Bringing us into created worlds and      bringing created worlds into our world will fundamentally      explode the boundaries of storytelling, unburdening the      storyteller in ways we can't yet imagine.       The challenges? Technology can be an invasive force,      competing for our attention and eroding the time we have for      ourselves and our families. Few of us would give up the tech      tools that keep us productive and informed; even fewer can      remember the last time we completely unplugged on vacation.      The more ubiquitous technology becomes in our lives, the more      diligent we must be to ensure it doesn't overwhelm or      diminish our leisure time.       Ultimately, technology is about connecting, not cocooning;      it's a tool that should empower us to reach more people and      bind us closer together, rather than encourage us to      disengage from one another. Even as we use technology to      create more individualized experiences, social interaction is      still a basic need, a fundamental part of our humanity.       That's why we value entertainment ``events'' that create      treasured memories, strengthen personal connections and      deliver shared experiences, whether at the movies, in a theme      park, or at a sports stadium. This is entertainment that      cannot be time-shifted or duplicated; you have to be there,      immersed in the moment.       An experience is enhanced when shared with others, becoming      something to be savored and remembered long after it's over.      These social events enrich our lives, and our need for them      will never change.       The human love of storytelling, whether individualized or      shared, will also be a constant. Although I can't predict the      precise future of entertainment, I share Walt Disney's      optimism and his belief that whatever lies ahead, it will be      defined by great storytelling. Just like it always has been.                          ____________________
