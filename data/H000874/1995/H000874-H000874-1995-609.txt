Speaker, This morning there is a cloud in the Carolina blue sky. Last night, as the final buzzer sounded and the frenzied fans spilled onto the basketball court, the scoreboard flashed--number one North Carolina 73, and the mighty Maryland Terrapins 86.  [[Page H1437]] With Smith slam-dunking, Simpkins soaring, Booth blasting-off, Hipp hopping and Rhodes rising to the occasion, the Terps beat an equally impressive North Carolina team.  Under the amazing coaching of Gary Williams, the Terrapins beat the top-ranked team in the Nation for the first time since 1986. We play them at least two times every year. They beat a North Carolina team, coached by the legendary Dean Smith, who, year after year, has produced champion basketball players.  From last year's sweet sixteen team to this year's top ten rankings and a tie for first place in the Atlantic Coast Conference, there is only one word to describe Maryland basketball--awesome.  Michael Wilbon of the Washington Post called it a night to remember. If last night's caliber of play by the mighty Maryland Terrapins is any indication of what we will be seeing in the near future, there are going to be many nights to remember for the players and fans of Maryland basketball.
