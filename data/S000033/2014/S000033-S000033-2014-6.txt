 Two      crucial paragraphs, prepared by Citigroup in conjunction with      other Wall Street banks, were copied nearly word for word.  In other words, it is not even Members of Congress writing these bills, it is Wall Street writing the bills and getting them into this legislation.  Now what does this legislation do? Well, we suffered the worst economic crisis since the 1930s because of the greed, recklessness, and illegal behavior on Wall Street. What Wall Street did is engage in absolutely reckless speculation, and then the chickens came home to roost. People could not pay back the debts they incurred on subprime mortgages, and the entire financial system of the United States of America and the world was on the verge of collapse. So Congress, a few years ago, passed Dodd-Frank. It didn't go anywhere near as far as I would go. I believe we should break up these major financial institutions. I don't believe you can control them. I don't believe you can regulate them.
