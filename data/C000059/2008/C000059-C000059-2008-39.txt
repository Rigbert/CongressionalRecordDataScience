Riverside has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Robert A. Wolf is one of these individuals. On March 27, 2008 at the 108th Inaugural Dinner, the Riverside Chamber of Commerce will recognize Bob as the 2007 Citizen of the Year.  Bob is a principal in many firms active in the financing, development, building and sale of real estate both domestically and internationally, with banking and venture relationships in Western Europe and Japan.  Bob obtained a bachelors degree in business administration and concentrated his continuing education on the field of development. Areas of study and successful completion include real estate law and development, financing, marketing, syndication, business law, group investment and construction techniques. Bob has been successful in international financing, joint ventures and marketing programs. Bob has worked in all facets of development including superintendent, project manager, project engineer, sales manager, and broker before becoming a chief executive officer. This background has helped Bob to draw upon his experience when making any decision regarding a development or investment. He has also had ``hands-on'' experience in the approval processes at every level of government and is a recognized expert in the field of real estate development, infrastructure and financing. He is a nationally known and sought after speaker on these topics.  Bob has served as Vice Chairman of the City of Moreno Valley's Planning Commission, the County of Riverside Flood Control Commission for Zone Four, and Planning Commissioner for Riverside County. He has recently served as Undersecretary of the Business, Transportation and Housing Agency for California, and has served as Chairman of the California Transportation Commission.  Bob is the author of ``How to Become a Developer'', a step-by-step description of the development process and the people involved, which was written for people who wish to enter the profession. Published by Crittenden Books, the book received excellent reviews including one from the Los Angeles Times. Bob and his family reside in Riverside, California, where they continue to be active and respected members of the community.  Bob's tireless passion for community development has contributed immensely to the betterment of Riverside, California. Bob served his country honorably in Vietnam and I am proud to call him a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for his service and salute him as he receives this prestigious award.                          ____________________
