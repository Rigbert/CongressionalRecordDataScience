President, I rise today to commend the Federal Communications Commission for its continuing work on the important broadcast flag regulations. Over-the air-television remains a critical part of the distribution of American television, and these regulations help to promote and improve over-the-air broadcasting of high quality digital programming. They do this by giving broadcasters the tools they need to protect their digitalbroadcasts against piracy. Without this protection, broadcasters would simply not broadcast their high value content over the air, and we would be left with two classes of American consumers: those who can afford, and live somewhere where they can receive, cable television with its high-value content, and those who receive only low-value over-the-air television. We must not allow this to happen.  While I am encouraged by the FCC's progress, and in particular pleased to see that they have taken steps to keep the setting of technical criteria for protective technologies open and transparent, the FCC's recent notice of proposed rulemaking raises some concerns. First, the FCC should make the process inclusive of all parties with an interest in the outcome, especially consumers. Second, a sound final regulation should address the effect of a broadcast flag on fair use rights and works that are already in the public domain. Third, the final regulation should address the broadcast flag's effect on privacy. What is intended as a technological measure to ensure the security of over-the-air broadcasts should not turn into an ability to track viewer behavior. Last, the final regulation must continue to ensure that no one player becomes dominant in this industry, and that the American consumer continues to reap the benefits of innovative new technologies. Most of all, the FCC should not lose sight of the most important goal of these regulations: to provide the highest quality content possible through over-the-air television. I am confident that it will do so.                          ____________________
