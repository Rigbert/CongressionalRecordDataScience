Chairman, I would simply also state my objection to the gentleman's amendment.  I appreciate the concerns he expressed, especially for those projects that may not make economic sense. If in those cases the gentleman is correct, there should be no loan guarantee offered. Having said that, for those programs that are in the queue that are under consideration that make sense and move our energy policy forward, we ought not to prohibit them from doing so by passing this amendment this evening.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Kucinich).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it.
