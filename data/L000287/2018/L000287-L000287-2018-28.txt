Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, let me just thank my friend and colleague from Pennsylvania for those kind words. Say hello to your grandson George.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5443. Let me begin by thanking the gentleman from Pennsylvania and the gentlewoman from Florida for their work on this good and necessary bill.  Mr. Speaker, I hope all of our colleagues will support this simple bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.
