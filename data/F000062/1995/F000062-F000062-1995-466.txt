 I would like to point out to my colleagues that there is no public outcry for term limits in football. Otherwise, the 49'ers, with the shy smile and accurate arm of Joe Montana, would not have won super bowls in the 1981 season, in 1984, or in 1989 and finally in the following year, a crushing 55 to 10 win. Now, as a native San Franciscan, I do take pride in such an exemplary record. And, frankly, while wishing San Diego well, I expect Steve Young to demonstrate his mastery of the game with an unprecedented fifth Super Bowl victory for the 49'ers.  Both teams, however, are to be congratulated for their success in reaching the Super Bowl, and for many other accomplishments, is that not right?
