President, on July 30, 1965, legislation was signed into law that created two fundamental programs: Medicare and Medicaid. The creation of those programs was a landmark for this country. When signing the Medicare legislation 40 years ago, President Johnson remarked, ``We marvel not simply at the passage of this bill, what we marvel at is that it took so many years to pass it.''  At that time, senior citizens were identified as the group most likely to be living in poverty in the U.S. Many had no type of health insurance. Since 1965, and largely thanks to Medicare and the access it has afforded seniors, the poverty rate has dropped significantly and older Americans are enjoying longer and healthier lives.  As John Gardner, Health, Education, and Welfare Secretary during President Johnson's administration, once stated, ``Medicare was a great turning point, but it has to be continually revised.'' And Medicare has changed. Since 1972, Medicare has also included Americans with disabilities and those with end stage renal disease bringing access and coverage to millions ofAmericans in need of it. In 2003, Congress passed the Medicare Modernization Act to add a prescription drug benefit. Medicare began with about 19 million seniors, but faces an estimated 77 million Americans, almost double the number of Americans enrolled in the program now in 2030. These Medicare beneficiaries will live longer, and face very different needs than the first 19 million.  With the creation of Medicaid, our Nation affirmed that we wanted those who were poor to be able to have health care. Like Medicare, Medicaid has faced changes. Other categories of people in need have been added; States like my home State of Oregon have been able to experiment in creative ways to provide care to more people; and as more seniors need long-term care and do not have the funds to pay for it, Medicaid plays an important role in providing long-term care. Medicaid has uniquely borne the brunt of the failings of the health care system. For many, this program is a lifesaver and it must be maintained.  Both Medicare and Medicaid are facing financial crises. Those who fought hard for the creation of these fundamental programs could not have foreseen the technology and scientific breakthroughs that would change health care delivery. Nor could they have foreseen the costs. We need to continually revise these programs to find better ways to provide affordable care and to assure that these programs are up to date with the best science and medicine but--that they keep their original purpose--to provide care to those who are aged, disabled, or poor.                          ____________________
