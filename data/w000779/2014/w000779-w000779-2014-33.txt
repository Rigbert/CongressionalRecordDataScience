President, at an important time for the Social Security program, the Senate now votes on three nominations to the Social Security Advisory Board which the Congress established to provide critical input and perspective on the Social Security Program. All three of these nominees are very well qualified, and they are strong and independent thinkers.  The first is Dr. Henry Aaron. Dr. Aaron is one of America's foremost experts on Social Security. His many publications and contributions to the program make him an invaluable asset. I strongly urge Senators to support his confirmation on this bipartisan board.  The second is one of the Senate's own, Dr. Alan Cohen, a veteran economist of the Finance Committee staff. He will be an excellent board member.  The third is Dr. Lanhee Chen. Dr. Chen has a particularly commendable academic record.  I yield the additional time to Senator Cardin, who has great expertise on Social Security.
