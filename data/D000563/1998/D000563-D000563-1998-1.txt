President, I would like to commend the distinguished Senator from Michigan for all of his hard work on the H1B visa program. I voted against passage of this measure in the Senate in the spring but today am happy to have it included in the omnibus. This is due to the incredible efforts of Senator Abraham. This is a well-balanced measure that addresses the needs of the business community while protecting the well-being of American workers. One of the most impressive accomplishments in this proposal is that it attempts to meet a short-term labor shortfall while instituting a program to ensure a long-term labor supply. The bill creates a new program of grants to provide technical skills training for workers.  This bill contains provisions to ensure that Americans will not be harmed by this legislation. A $500 fee paid by businesses wishing to participate in the H1B program will raise approximately $75 million annually to be split between a scholarship program for underprivileged high school students studying mathematics, computer science, or engineering and funding for job training programs which focus on information technology.  One project that I hope would be supported under this new program is the DePaul University High-Tech Workforce Pilot Program in Chicago. It was developed in conjunction with Chicago companies and local government with the goal of preparing America's workforce to compete in the dynamic high-tech industry. It has also been developed to be a model that can be replicated by other universities and cities. I believe that DePaul's training, retraining and education program will expand America's skilled labor force.  Let me again congratulate, Senator Abraham for his success and hard work.
