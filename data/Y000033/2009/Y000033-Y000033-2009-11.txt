I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1641 has been adequately explained by the majority. As the current trail is being operated successfully at a local level, we are not aware of the need for this legislation.  Apparently, though, some believe there is a compelling need for Federal involvement where Americans paddle kayaks in the Puget Sound. As this bill provides for a study of the federalization of these water trails, possible objections will likely be held until the study is completed and until actual Federal control is to be proposed.  I reserve the balance of my time.
