Speaker, I rise to congratulate Ernest ``Ernie'' R. Grecco on being honored for his fifty-five years of service to the labor movement next Tuesday evening, August 15, in Baltimore. I have known and worked closely with Ernie, who serves as President of the Baltimore Metro AFL-CIO, for thirty years. He is one of the toughest advocates for working men and women I've ever met, who has dedicated his life and his career to achieving better pay and conditions for workers and opportunity for their families in Maryland.  Ernie has worked on behalf of labor in Maryland since 1970, when he was elected Secretary-Treasurer of what was then the Distillery Workers Local 34-D. In 1976, he became Committee on Political Education (COPE) Director for the Metropolitan Baltimore Council AFL-CIO. He went on to lead the Maryland State and District of Columbia AFL-CIO COPE from 1983-1987 before taking the helm in Baltimore. Since that time, whenever working people in the greater Baltimore area have had a challenge to overcome, Ernie's been there, leading the way and bringing to bear the forces of organized labor and its allies. Under his leadership, the Baltimore Metro AFL-CIO has expanded programs for job training, placement, and community service.  Ernie also became involved in making his community a better place by serving as the Secretary of the United Way of Maryland from 1992 until this year. He also received the Samuel Gompers Award from the American Red Cross and the Joseph Beirne Award from the United Way of America. In 1995, the International Association of Firefighters Local 734 and Local 964 established the Grecco Labor Award in Ernie's honor.  I'm proud to stand with Ernie and the hardworking men and women of labor to advocate for better wages, better conditions, and greater opportunities for all our people to make it in America. I hope my colleagues will join me in congratulating Ernie on this well deserved honor and thanking him for his service and contributions to Maryland and our country.                          ____________________
