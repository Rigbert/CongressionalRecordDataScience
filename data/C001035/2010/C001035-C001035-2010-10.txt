President, if I could pose a further question to the majority leader through the Chair, I understand what the majority leader is saying, but as he discussed his plan with me, he would, in fact, allow 15 amendments--10 to be offered on the Republican side that would be amendments of the Republican side's choice as long as they were relevant to the bill--and he would ensure that there would be votes on those amendments. So I am confused when I hear he is going to fill the tree because that implies to me that he would not be allowing those 15 amendments we discussed--10 on our side, of our choice, as long as they were relevant to the bill. So I am truly trying to find out what the agreement is.
