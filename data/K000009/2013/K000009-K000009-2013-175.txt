Chairman, I would say to Congressman Hastings that I rise with sympathy toward the situation you face at Hanford, but must oppose your amendment.  The amendment essentially would cut funding from energy efficiency and renewable energy, specifically the weatherization program, which affects dozens and dozens of communities across this country, many of them very low income, as well as departmental administration, which has already been cut to the bone, to move money to Hanford.  It is true that the communities that contributed to the Manhattan Project cannot be left with the remnants of that war effort. We have a moral obligation to clean up these sites. Without question, the bill is inadequate to meet the commitments to States and local communities faced with cleanup.  However, we cannot take those dollars out of the hides of elderly people who might live in Newark, New Jersey, in the wintertime, or in Portland, Oregon, or places where they can't afford their energy bills, or we can't divert money from administration, which is already cut to such a low level at the Department in order to move dollars to Hanford.  Hanford already receives over $2 billion a year--$2 billion. I wish my community received $2 billion. I wish your communities received $2 billion a year.  Those dollars come from the River Protection program, over $1.2 billion, plus an additional $877 million, well over $2 billion a year. That's more than most communities represented by Members here can even imagine coming to their region of the country.  The defense waste cleanup in Ohio is extraordinary. We don't get $2 billion a year. So to say to senior citizens across this country we are going to take it out of your weatherization program so you can't put plastic around your windows in the wintertime and try to retrofit your houses, or we are going to take it out of departmental administration where we risk accounting for the funds properly for all of these programs that the Department has to administer, including the cleanup, some of these contracts that we've had problems with in that Department, I simply can't support the manner in which the gentleman and the gentlelady have identified where they are taking the money from.  So while I agree with their intent, as I've said many times, the allocation for this bill is $2.8 billion under last year and $4 billion under the administration's request and is simply insufficient. We can't keep picking the bones off the most needy parts of our country to try to divert additional dollars to efforts at Hanford that are spending well over $2 billion a year already.  I would ask my colleagues to oppose the amendment. I reluctantly oppose the gentleman's amendment. But in being fair and looking at all the accounts, we simply can't keep picking from the bones of other programs at the Department.  I ask my colleagues to vote against the Hastings amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Hastings).  The amendment was agreed to.        Amendment Offered by Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas
