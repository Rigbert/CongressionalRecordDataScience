 President, we are making progress. We have been working through a number of amendments over the past several hours. I thank the majority leader, the minority leader, as well as the managers of the bill in helping us move forward.                     Amendment No. 2496, withdrawn                    Amendment No. 2488, as modified  I would just reiterate what Senator Reid said earlier. I am happy that wehave finally resolved the issue regarding the amendment of the Senator from Louisiana. I believe we are at the point now where we can move forward on that.  I ask unanimous consent that the Cochran second-degree amendment No. 2496 be withdrawn; that the Vitter amendment No. 2488, as modified, be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.
