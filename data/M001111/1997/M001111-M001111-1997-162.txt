 President I introduce legislation that would protect our Nation's small children as they travel on aircraft. We currently have Federal regulations that require the safety of passengers on commercial flights. However, neither flight attendants nor an infant's parents can protect unrestrained infants in the event of an airline accident or severe turbulence. A child on a parent's lap will likely break free from the adult's arms as a plane takes emergency action or encounters extreme turbulence.  This child then faces two serious hazards. First, the child may be injured as they strike the aircraft interior. Second, the parents may not be able to find the infant after a crash. The United Sioux City, IA, crash provides one dark example. On impact, no parent was able to hold on to her-his child. One child was killed when he flew from his mother's hold. Another child was rescued from an overhead compartment by a stranger.  In July 1994, during the fatal crash of a USAir plane in Charlotte, NC, another unrestrained infant was killed when her mother could not hold onto her on impact. The available seat next to the mother survived the crash intact. The National Transportation Safety Board believes that had the baby been secured in the seat, she would have been alive today. In fact, in a FAA study on accident survivability, the agency found that of the last nine infant deaths, five could have survived had they been in child restraint devices.  Turbulence creates very serious problems for unrestrained infants. In four separate incidences during the month of June, passengers and flight attendants were injured when their flights hit sudden and violent turbulence. In one of these, a flight attendant reported that a baby seated on a passenger's lap went flying through the air during turbulence and was caught by another passenger. This measure is endorsed by the National Transportation Safety Board and the Aviation Consumer Action Project.  We must protect those unable to protect themselves. Just as we require seatbelts, motorcycle helmets, and car seats, we must mandate restraint devices that protect our youngest citizens. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation that ensures our kids remain passengers and not victims.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 398       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. CHILD SAFETY RESTRAINT SYSTEMS ON COMMERCIAL                    AIRCRAFT.       (a) In General.--Chapter 447 of title 49, United States      Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new      section:     ``Sec. 44725. Child safety restraint systems       ``(a) In General.--Not later than 90 days after the date of      enactment of this section, the Secretary of Transportation      shall issue regulations requiring the use of child safety      restraint systems that have been approved by the Secretary on      any aircraft operated by an air carrier in providing      interstate air transportation, intrastate air transportation,      or foreign air transportation.       ``(b) Age or Weight Limits.--The regulations issued under      this section shall establish age or weight limits for      children who use the child safety restraint systems.''.       (b) Clerical Amendment.--The chapter analysis for chapter      447 of title 49, United States Code, is amended by adding at      the end the following new item:``44725. Child safety restraint systems.''.     SEC. 2. INTERNATIONAL STANDARD.       It is the sense of Congress that the United States      representative to the International Civil Aviation      Organization should seek an international standard to require      that passengers on a civil aviation aircraft be restrained--       (1) on takeoff and landing; and       (2) when directed by the captain of such aircraft.      By Mr. McCAIN:  S. 399. A bill to amend the Morris K. Udall Scholarship and Excellence in National Environmental and Native American Public Policy Act of 1992 to establish the U.S. Institute for Environmental Conflict Resolution to conduct environmental conflict resolution and training, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.      THE ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY AND CONFLICT RESOLUTION ACT OF 1997 Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I introduce legislation to promote fair, timely and efficient resolution of our Nation's environmental disputes.  This bill would establish, within the Morris K. Udall Foundation, the United States Institute for Environmental Conflict Resolution. The institute would offer alternative dispute resolution services, including assessment, mediation, and other related services, to facilitate parties in resolving environmental disputes without resorting to protracted and costly litigation in the courts. I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the legislation be included in the Record at the conclusion of my statement.  This legislation simply gives the Udall Foundation the means to do what Congress asked it to do 5 years ago. When the Udall Foundation was established in 1992, it was charged with the task of establishing a program for environmental dispute resolution. Since then, the foundation has sponsored seminars and workshops on conflict resolution. But it has lacked the funding and explicit direction that would enable it to run a program that could provide conflict resolution services. This bill provides both the direction and the authorization for funding.  It is particularly fitting that an institute devoted to environmental conflict resolution would operate under the auspices of the Udall Foundation. Morris K. Udall's career was distinguished by his integrity, service, and commitment to consensus-building.  I had the distinct pleasure of working with Mo Udall on one of his greatest legislative achievements--the Arizona Wilderness Act. That act protects 2.5 million acres in the Arizona wilderness in perpetuity and was passed thanks, in large part, to Mo Udall's efforts to achieve consensus within the Arizona delegation.  Using Mo Udall's success in passing the Arizona Wilderness Act as its model, the U.S. Environmental Conflict Resolution Institute at the Udall Foundation would seek to promote our nation's environmental policy objectives by reaching out to achieve consensus rather than pursuing resolution through adversarial processes.  Mr. President, over 5,000 Federal court decisions on environmental litigation have been handed down in the past two decades. Today, some 400 to 500 environmental lawsuits are filed each year in Federal courts. In its 16th annual report, the Council on Environmental Quality estimated that fully 85 percent of Environmental Protection Agency regulations are challenged at some time in the courts, either by groups that find the rules too stringent or by groups that believe them to be too lax. In short, resorting to the courts is all too common in disputes over environmental issues.  This bill seeks to move our Nation away from this litigious trend by providing an alternative conflict resolution process. This process is intended to preclude the need for lawsuits by engaging the parties in professionally mediated discussions. It could also be used as a solution of last resort, if the parties agreed to put aside litigation already filed in the courts and instead utilize the services of the institute.  The benefits to be gained by the Federal Government through a national environmental dispute resolution program include more than litigation cost savings. Delay associated with litigation can also prevent the timely enforcement of our environmental laws.  For more than ten years, I have been working to promote safety and quiet in Grand Canyon National Park. This issue, as well as any other, exemplifies how alternative dispute resolution could perhaps help us achieve national environmental policy objectives far better than litigation.  In 1987, legislation I authored to promote safety and provide for the substantial restoration of natural quiet in the Grand Canyon was signed into law. Ten years later, the Federal Aviation Administration [FAA] this year issued a final rule on overflights over the Grand Canyon. This rule was scheduled to go into effect on May 1, 1997. However, despite the substantial time and effort that both the FAA and the National Park Service have put into this rulemaking, including consultations with many outside interests, lawsuits have now been filed challenging the rule and delaying its implementation.  Mr. President, I do not mention this to criticize those who have exercised their right to file suit in the Grand Canyon overflights matter. I refer to this situation because it concerns me that protecting the Grand Canyon could be significantly delayed through litigation, when the parties might reach a more timely and mutually acceptable resolution if they were provided an opportunity to work through their differences in a nonadversarial forum. The institute created by this legislation would provide an alternative to litigation in this and similar situations and create an opportunity for more constructive problem-solving and effective policymaking.  One hundred twenty-six years ago, Abraham Lincoln wisely counseled:       Discourage litigation, persuade your neighbor to compromise      whenever you can. Point out to them how the nominal winner is      often the real loser in fees, expenses, and waste of time.  That advice could not be more sound today as we seek to resolve our Nation's environmental conflicts and topromote timely and effective implementation of laws and regulations to protect and preserve our natural environment.  I am pleased that the Council on Environmental Quality has registered their support for the goals and concepts in this bill. In addition, the Udall Foundation, the Grand Canyon Trust, the National Parks and Conservation Association, Friends of the Earth, and Trout Unlimited have given their support to this effort. I ask unanimous consent that copies of support letters from these groups be included in the Record.  I urge my colleagues to join me and support this legislation that would bring common sense and efficiency to the resolution of our Nation's environmental disputes.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:        Environmental Policy and Conflict Resolution Act of 1997       Purpose: To establish, within the Morris K. Udall      Foundation, the United States Institute for Environmental      Conflict Resolution to assist in implementing national      environmental policy. The Institute would provide alternative      dispute resolution services, including assessment, mediation,      and other services, to facilitate resolving environmental      disputes without litigation.       Bill authorizes use of the Institute by Federal agencies:       Federal agencies could use the Institute's conflict      resolution services for a fee.       Bill creates a revolving fund to:       Fund operations and fully support the Institute through a      one-time $3 million appropriation.       Receive fees from parties using the Institute's services.       Supplement an annual appropriation for a five-year period      beginning in 1998.       The Council on Environmental Quality would:       Receive notification when a federal agency requests to use      the Institute's services.       Concur in any request to use the Institute's services for      interagency dispute resolution.       The Institute would be under the Udall Foundation because:       One purpose for which the Udall Foundation was established      in 1992 was to establish a program for environmental conflict      resolution.       The Udall Foundation has hosted seminars, workshops and      research related to environmental dispute resolution but, has      lacked funding to provide mediation services.       Conflict resolution and consensus building were major      themes of Udall's thirty year public career as a member of      the House of Representatives.                                  ____                   S. 399--Section-by-Section Summary       Section 1: Short title--``The Environmental Policy and      Conflict Resolution Act of 1997''.       Section 2: Definition of Terms.       Section 3: Adds the Chair of the Council on Environmental      Quality as an ex officio non-voting member of the Udall      Foundation Board.       Section 4: Bill Purpose: To establish as part of the Udall      Foundation the U.S. Institute for Environmental Conflict      Resolution (Institute) to assist the Federal Government in      implementing national environmental policy.       The Institute would provide assessment, mediation and other      related services to resolve environmental disputes involving      agencies and instrumentalities of the United States.       Section 5: Authorizes the Udall Foundation to establish the      Institute and provide assessment, mediation, and other      alternative dispute resolution services.       Section 6: Revolving Fund:       Creates a Revolving Fund for the Institute to operate. The      revolving fund would be administered by the Udall Foundation      and would be maintained separately from the Trust Fund      established for scholarships awarded by the Udall Foundation.       Section 7: Use of the Institute by a Federal Agency:       Authorizes use of the Institute by a federal agency which      may enter into a contract to expend funds for the use of the      Institute's services. Any funds spent by an agency on the      Institute would go into the Revolving Fund.       Requires concurrence by the Council on Environmental      Quality (CEQ) for two agencies to seek to resolve a dispute      at the Institute. CEQ would be notified of any agency request      to use the Institute's services.       Section 8: Authorization of Appropriations:       Authorizes a one-time appropriation of $3 million to the      Revolving Fund for fiscal year 1998 and $2.1 million in      appropriations over a 5 year period beginning in 1998 to      fully operate the Institute.       The Revolving Fund would be replenished by fees from      parties using the Institute's services.       Section 9: Conforming amendments.                                  ____         Executive Office of the President, Council on            Environmental Quality                                    Washington, DC, March 5, 1997.     Hon. John McCain,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McCain: Thank you for requesting the      Administration's views on your draft legislation entitled the      ``Environmental Policy and Conflict Resolution Act of 1997.''       The legislation represents a commendable effort to assist      private entities and government in resolving environmental      and natural resource conflicts by expanding the range of      services available from the Morris K. Udall Foundation to      include resolution of disputes involving federal agencies.      The Administration supports the concepts and goals embodied      in your legislation. However, the Administration needs to      complete its review of the bill language prior to providing a      comprehensive Administration position. We expect to provide      additional comments on the bill in the near future.       As you know, last September, the President awarded the      Medal of Freedom to Congressman Udall. The President's      remarks at the time bear repeating:       ``During a remarkable 30-year career, Morris Udall was a      quiet giant of the Congress. Warm, funny, and intelligent, he      was truly a man of the center, who forged consensus by      listening to others and by reasoned argument. His landmark      achievements--such as reforming campaign finance, preserving      our forests, safeguarding the Alaskan wilderness, and      defending the rights of Native Americans--were important      indeed. But he distinguished himself above all as a man to      whom others--leaders--would turn for judgment, skill, and      wisdom. Mo Udall is truly a man for all seasons and a role      model for what is best in American democracy.''       It is entirely fitting to ask the institution established      by Congress in Congressman Udall's name to help with the hard      job of helping people solve their disagreements over the      lands, waters, and resources we all share and must steward      responsibly. This Administration has made every effort to      break down the barriers between government and citizens.      Voluntary mechanisms to enhance communication and      understanding within government and between agencies and the      people they serve can assist meaningfully in this regard.       I appreciate your willingness to incorporate provisions      that recognize the important dispute resolution purposes of      the National Environmental Policy Act and the inter-agency      coordination function of the President's Council on      Environmental Quality.       The Administration would be pleased to work with you as      your legislation proceeds.           Sincerely,                                              Kathleen A. McGinty,     Chair.                                  ____         National Parks and Conservation Association, Friends of            the Earth,                                                    March 5, 1997.     Hon. John McCain,     U.S. Senate, Russell Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McCain: The National Parks and Conservation      Association and Friends of the Earth are pleased to endorse      the concept of a U.S. Institute for Environmental Conflict      Resolution, the subject of legislation you intend to      introduce on March 5.       Resolving environmental disputes before they reach the      litigation stage is a goal we strongly support. Your      legislation would enable federal agencies to solve disputes      among themselves or with other non-federal parties by using      the institute's staff for mediation and other services.       In general, we believe litigation should be the last resort      in enforcing or upholding our environmental laws, provided      that negotiated agreements clearly adhere to statutory      mandates. We also believe negotiated solutions, in general,      allow disputants more creativity and flexibility to solve      problems and issues in cost effective ways.       Many environmental disputes, including those involving our      national parks, could be resolved by good-faith negotiations      led by an honest broker. The unfolding case of buffalo      management in Yellowstone is a case in point. Here, a lawsuit      filed by Montana against two federal agencies has      precipitated the killing of almost one third of Yellowstone's      buffalo herd. A court order is driving the slaughter.      Although this wildlife tragedy is abhorred by all of the      parties involved, collectively they did nothing effective to      prevent it. In retrospect, it is clear that the slaughter      might have been avoided had the parties committed themselves      to good faith negotiations years ago when the issue first      emerged.       Thank you for your leadership on environmental issues      generally and for your constructive approach to conflict      resolution.           Sincerely,     Paul C. Pritchard,       President, National Parks and Conservation Association.     Brent Blackwelder,       President, Friends of the Earth.                                  ____                                              Trout Unlimited,                                    Washington, DC, March 5, 1997.     Hon. John McCain,     U.S. Senate, Russell,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McCain: On behalf of Trout Unlimited's 95,000      members nationwide, I am     writing to support the bill that you intend to introduce      today. The bill would amend the Morris K. Udall Scholarship      and Excellence in National Environmental and Native American      Public Policy Act of 1992 by establishing a new environmental      conflict resolution program within the Morris K. Udall      Foundation. We believe the new conflict resolution program      holds great promise for resolving the intractable      environmental disputes that continue to plague federal      natural resources agencies and other interests involved with      federal environmental laws.       The mission of Trout Unlimited is to conserve, protect and      restore North America's trout and salmon resources and the      watersheds on which they depend. Our work often takes us into      difficult environmental conflicts involving many federal      agencies. Over the past two decades, we have been deeply      involved in disputes regarding implementation of the      Endangered Species Act, the Clean Water Act, and the federal      land management laws, in which federal agencies have had very      difficult conflicts. Failure to resolve these conflicts in a      timely fashion has adversely affected trout and salmon      resources. We are particularly hopeful that the new      interagency conflict resolution mechanism proposed by your      bill will yield a new and better way of resolving these      disputes.       We salute your authorship of the bill and look forward to      working with you to get it enacted.           Sincerely,                                                      Steve Moyer,     Director, Government Affairs.                                  ____                                   Morris K. Udall Foundation,                                        Tucson, AZ, March 3, 1997.     Hon. John McCain,     U.S. Senate, Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McCain: It gives me great pleasure as Chairman      of the Board of Trustees of the Morris K. Udall Scholarship      and Excellence in National Environmental Policy Foundation to      inform you that the trustees unanimously and enthusiastically      endorse your unique concept for the creation of the United      States Institute for Environmental Dispute Resolution as part      of the Udall Foundation.       As you know, federal agencies have been increasingly      involved in environmental disputes as parties to lawsuits      based upon their regulatory actions. Continuing to wage these      conflicts in the costly and time-consuming arena of the      courts drains federal resources and can serve to delay      federal actions to protect the environment. Alternative forms      of environmental conflict resolution for federal agencies are      needed to prevent these and other adverse effects associated      with protracted litigation.       Since it began in May 1995, the Udall Foundation has worked      to create a national environmental conflict resolution      program, as directed in its authorizing legislation. The      Foundation has sponsored workshops and seminars on      environmental conflict resolution and has begun funding      several research projects.       On April 4-5, 1997, the Foundation will host      ``Environmental Conflict Resolution in the West'' in Tucson,      Arizona. This will be the largest gathering of its kind.      Several hundred people from around the country, including      professional mediators, facilitators, researchers, and      federal, state and local agency officials are expected to      attend this conference to discuss alternative approaches to      environmental dispute resolution and collaborative problem      solving.       Despite these efforts, the Foundation has lacked the      funding to directly pursue conflict resolution by providing      mediation and other services to resolve environmental      disputes. The legislation you are introducing will finally      enable the Foundation to provide a program to conduct      environmental conflict resolution at the national level.       We believe that your legislation will allow the Foundation,      through the U.S. Institute for Environmental Conflict      Resolution, to make a positive impact on the cost and pace of      environmental dispute resolution for years to come. The      Foundation is prepared to do all it can to establish a      program committed to helping to resolve these conflicts      fairly and as efficiently as possible.           Sincerely,                                                Terrence L. Bracy,     Chairman.                                  ____                                           Grand Canyon Trust,                                    Washington, DC, March 4, 1997.     Hon. John McCain,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McCain: On behalf of the Trustees of the Grand      Canyon Trust, a conservation organization dedicated to the      conservation of the Grand Canyon and Colorado Plateau, I am      pleased to endorse and offer our support for your bill      creating the United States Institute for Environmental      Conflict Resolution.       The Trust has long held that many conflicts that arise from      differences between parties regarding environmental policy      and regulation could best be solved through mediation and      alternative dispute resolution rather than in courts of law.      Too often the will of the American public to protect our      natural resources and ecological treasures is lost amid      posturing and polarization by parties embroiled in conflict      over environmental issues. We believe that your legislation      will enable the United States Institute for Environmental      Conflict Resolution to actively mediate and conduct      environmental conflict resolution in a positive, constructive      manner.       The Grand Canyon Trust pledges to work in concert with the      Morris K. Udall Foundation and the United States Institute      for Environmental Conflict Resolution in every possible way      to support and ensure its success. Thank you again for your      vision and leadership on this difficult issue.           Sincerely,                                              Geoffrey S. Barnard,     President.                                  ____                                   Morris K. Udall Foundation,                                     Tucson, AZ, January 17, 1997.     Hon. John McCain,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McCain: I am pleased to report that the Board      of Trustees of the Morris K. Udall Foundation has unanimously      endorsed your proposal to create an institution for      environmental conflict resolution within our jurisdiction.      The board reviewed in detail both the concept and the      financials and is in agreement with the draft bill provided      by your staff.       The board expressed tremendous enthusiasm for your concept      and we look foward to helping in any way that you wish.       Attached is the resolution that was passed.           Sincerely,                                                Terrence L. Bracy,                                                         Chairman.       Enclosure.                               Resolution       The Board of Trustees of the Morris K. Udall Scholarship      and Excellence in National Environmental Policy Foundation      commends Arizona Senator John McCain for his originality and      initiative in introducing a bill to establish the United      States Institute for Environmental Conflict Resolution as      part of the Udall Foundation.       The Trustees enthusiastically endorse this unique concept      to contract with other Federal agencies to resolve disputes      or conflicts related to the environment, public lands or      natural resources and congratulate Senator McCain for      recognizing the need for such an entity.                                 ______                                       By
