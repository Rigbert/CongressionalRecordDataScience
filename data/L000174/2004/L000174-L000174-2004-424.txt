President, we all agree that among the things we learned from the September 11 attacks was that we need to do a much better job of enforcing our immigration laws. While no system is foolproof, we should at least make it as difficult as possible to evade our border controls and enter this country illegally.  In doing so we must also be sure that we protect the rights and dignity of innocent travelers, to ensure that those who have every right to come to this country are able to do so with a minimum of delay and difficulty. We must also ensure that we do not betray our historic commitment to asylum, a dedication to provide refuge to those who flee oppression.  Since September 11, we have thwarted some illegal immigrants, although we do not know how many of them, if any, sought to come here to commit acts of terrorism. But we have also read about instances where innocent people were swept up by our border patrol agencies, and subjected to unnecessary and humiliating treatment.  These abuses not only damage the individual, but they damage our image around the world. As a result, people who would otherwise travel to the United States, as tourists, students, or for business, are deciding against coming out of fear that because of their race, or ethnicity, or nationality, or just because of the chance of a mistake, they might be mistreated or imprisoned.  Today I want to call attention to two cases. The first case involves Ms. Antje Croton, a German citizen married to an American school teacher from Brooklyn, whose ordeal was described in the January 21, 2004 edition of the New York Times.  Ms. Croton encountered a nightmarish immigration fiasco as she and her infant daughter tried to re-enter the United States after spending the holidays in Germany. The New York Times called Ms. Croton's ordeal ``Kafkaesque.'' There is no better word for it.  Concerned that her travel permit had expired in July, Ms. Croton visited a Department of Homeland Security, DHS, office in New York City before leaving the country for Germany on December 9, 2003. After talking to officials there, she was assured that her permit was valid through April 2004. Believing her documents were in order, Ms. Croton left for Germany.  Upon her return, Ms. Croton was told by an immigration official at the airport in New York that her travel permit had expired, and that she could not enter the country. With her infant daughter, Ms. Croton was interrogated until 2 a.m. and told she was to be put on the next plane back to Germany, all without informing her husband, who was waiting in the terminal.  At one point, Ms. Croton and her daughter were taken to a room where a dozen individuals, including some who were suspected of transporting drugs and illegal firearms, were being held. After several more hours of back and forth, immigration officials finally gave Ms. Croton the option of leaving the airport if she bought a return ticket that left for Germany within 30 days.  Ms. Croton and her husband spent the next 30 days negotiating layers of byzantine immigration rules and regulations in an effort to resolve her case before she was forced to depart. Even with the help of elected officials and immigration lawyers, the couple was getting nowhere. It was only after an inquiry from a New York Times reporter that the DHS began to pay attention.  The second case involves Sonam, a 30-year-old Buddhist nun whose plight was recounted in the January 27, 2004 edition of the Washington Post. Sonam, who goes by only one name, was detained at Dulles International Airport last August after arriving from Nepal.  After her father was arrested and tortured, Sonam fled from her native Tibet, controlled by China, to Nepal 3 years ago. She reached Nepal by walking for 8 days across mountainous territory. She then fled Nepal last summer, after the government there began returning Tibetan refugees to China, where they face prison and torture.  Sonam was granted asylum by a United States immigration judge last November, but the DHS immediately appealed the ruling and refused to release Sonam from custody during the pendency of the appeal. As a result, she may spend years in a local jail outside Richmond where she has been detained. In this jail, she is housed among common criminals and is unable to communicate with anyone because she does not know English.  The DHS defends its punitive policies toward asylum seekers on the grounds that it is concerned that terrorists may manipulate the asylum process. It strains belief to imagine that the DHS believes that a nun from Tibet with no knowledge of English or history of violence, whom a U.S. Government official has found deserving of asylum, is a potential terrorist.  Even Asa Hutchinson, the DHS Undersecretary for Border and Transportation Security, told the Post that ``[e]ven a well-balanced policy can get out of kilter on an individual case because someone has exercised poor judgment.'' It is clearly the case here that someone at DHS is exercising poor judgment, and Secretary Ridge or Undersecretary Hutchinson should do something to rectify this injustice.  There is no question that securing our borders from international terrorists, criminals, and illegal immigrants is one of the most important responsibilities of the Federal Government. We are more aware of this today than ever before.  But this does not give DHS a license to act in a bureaucratic and heavy-handed manner, which is precisely how it appears they behaved in these cases.  Border security involves striking a balance. Instead of wasting time and resources scaring and harassing a German woman and her baby or a Tibetan nun, who pose no threat to the security of the United States, DHS should be focused on stopping real terrorists and criminals. Moreover, in the Croton case, an immigration official told Ms. Croton that her paperwork was in order before she left the United States.  Thanks to the New York Times and others, the Croton case may be headed for a happy ending. But this is an instance where the victim spoke English,is married to an American, and is a citizen of a nation that is a close ally of the United States.  What if this had involved someone who spoke little or no English? What if the person in question were not married to an American citizen? What if the media and elected officials had not been aware of it, and had not gotten involved? I suspect the individual would have been deported, even though their only offense was listening to the advice of an immigration official.  Meanwhile, the outcome of the Sonam case remains unclear, and unless the DHS acts, she can expect to spend most if not all of 2004 behind bars.  There are probably dozens, if not hundreds of other cases, of would-be immigrants and asylum seekers that do not have happy endings that we do not know about. Even one case like this is too many. Immigrants are responsible for the diversity of cultures, ideas, and practices that make up our society. We have an important responsibility to help those attempting to come to this Nation legally.  Equally important, we have an interest in treating immigrants fairly and with respect. Poor treatment of legal immigrants squanders goodwill that the United States spends billions of dollars each year--through foreign aid, international exchanges, and public diplomacy programs--to cultivate.  To be sure, we want our DHS officials to do their jobs effectively. We have to make sure that people entering this Nation are doing so legally, and are not a threat to the United States. But, we also have to make sure that DHS officials act in a fair and professional manner.  I hope that the DHS is reviewing what went wrong in these cases, and taking whatever steps are necessary to prevent it from happening again. I ask unanimous consent that the New York Times and Washington Post articles be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, Jan. 21, 2004]            Trip Home From Europe Becomes Kafkaesque Ordeal                          (By Nina Bernstein)       A German woman married to a Brooklyn schoolteacher had been      told that she had all her papers in order when she took a      quick trip to show off her infant daughter to her parents in      Germany.       But her return home in late December turned surreal and      terrifying when Homeland Security officials at Kennedy      Airport rejected her travel documents, confiscated her      passport, then detained her and the 3-month-old overnight in      a room with shackled drug suspects. They let her go only      after ordering her to leave the country no later than      tomorrow.       After a month of desperate efforts by her American husband,      their lawyers and legislators, late yesterday a spokeswoman      for the Homeland Security Department said that the woman,      Antje Croton, 36, would be granted a last-minute reprieve.      But Mrs. Croton said she had received no written      notification. ``I'm in a nightmare,'' she said as she packed      yesterday afternoon, having abandoned hope of straightening      out the problem. ``I feel like I'm in the wrong movie.''       Her husband, Christopher Croton, said the couple was not      convinced their ordeal was over. ``The experience has been      like trying to open a door to a room that does not exist,''      Mr. Croton said. ``That's the irony here. My German-born wife      has to come here to experience this wall of, just The      State.''       He pointed out that other foreigners with fewer resources      have been caught in the same kind of bureaucratic confusion      ever since the Immigration and Naturalization Service was      absorbed by the Department of Homeland Security last year.       Mrs. Croton has lived in Park Slope for five years, and her      application for a green card has been pending for nearly two.      When her sister urged her to visit Germany, she wanted to      take no chances. So in October, she said, she asked      immigration officials at 26 Federal Plaza about getting a new      travel permit.       According to her account, an immigration official, C.E.      Herndandez, insisted that her old permit was still valid,      though it had a July expiration date, because it bore a stamp      saying ``April 2004.'' Reassured, Mrs. Croton departed on      Dec. 9. ``I did everything by the rules,'' Mrs. Croton said.       But on Dec. 22, when she returned to Kennedy Airport at 9      p.m., exhausted after a 10-hour trip alone with her baby      daughter, Clara, front-line border security officers barred      her way. They said the immigration official had been wrong:      the July 2003 expiration, not the April 2004 stamp, applied,      and she could not enter the United States.       They interrogated her until 2 a.m., she said, as she wept,      tried to nurse her baby and pleaded with officials to call      her husband, who was waiting without word in the terminal.       Mrs. Croton, who has worked for an ad agency in Hamburg and      as a journalist in New York, and who recently started her own      Internet business as a handbag designer, said she was      astonished that the official questioning her had to struggle      to enter her replies in an archaic computer, hunting and      pecking and calling for help to save the document file.       ``Then this man says, `We are going to put you on the next      plane going back home.' ''       ``I said, `This is my home,' '' recalled Mrs. Croton, who      has lived in the same apartment with her husband since before      they were married in 2001.       She was then taken from the airport's terminal 1 to      terminal 4, she said, to a fluorescent-lit room where a dozen      detainees included a man who had been carrying an illegal gun      and several suspected drug couriers in shackles.       ``I couldn't even spell my name anymore,'' Mrs. Croton      said. ``Nobody who hasn't had a little infant and traveled on      a long-distance flight can understand. I said, `I need to lie      down. I'm shivering, I'm exhausted, I'm nursing.' '' But she      said an officer retorted: ``Stop crying. There were other      people here with kids, and it's not going to get you      anywhere.''       The most humane response, Mrs. Croton added, came from the      low-level worker who had driven her from one terminal to the      other. Learning that the mother had no diapers left for her      baby, the driver returned with three toddler-sized disposable      diapers, the only ones she could find.       In the morning, a supervisor told Mrs. Croton that she had      to board a plane to Germany, but she refused, fearing for her      health and the baby's. She was then offered another option:      to buy a ticket for a flight to Germany leaving within 30      days, with no guarantee she could ever return.       The couple hoped to straighten out the mess before her      forced departure, but the red tape seemed impervious. Two      weeks ago, the couple went back to see Ms. Hernandez at      Federal Plaza, and she again told Mrs. Croton that her travel      document was still valid until April.       When told what had happened at the airport, other officials      said that without Mrs. Croton's confiscated passport and      file, their hands were tied. They were at an impasse until an      inquiry by a reporter for The New York Times to Janet      Rapaport, a spokeswoman for the Border Security section of      Homeland Security.       That resulted in a flurry of activity. Ms. Rapaport said      yesterday that a decision had been reached by Susan T.      Mitchell, director of New York field operations for Customs      Enforcement and Border Security, based on a review of Mrs.      Croton's file. Mrs. Croton would be allowed to stay and      pursue her green card application. ``I guess for humanitarian      reasons,'' Ms. Rapaport said.       ``I want to believe it,'' Mrs. Croton said. ``But they tell      me I can stay, and then I stay, and then what if they tell me      I'm a real lawbreaker?''                                  ____                [From Washingtonpost.com, Jan. 27, 2004]                  Granted Asylum, Nun Held in Va. Jail                 tibetan entangled in post-9/11 caution                             (By David Cho)       Hopewell, VA.--Sonam always feared her devotion to Buddhism      would land her behind bars in her native China. As it turns      out, she is serving a long term in jail--not in East Asia but      in central Virginia.       The 30-year-old Buddhist nun, who grew up in a Tibetan      village near the foot of Mount Everest, fled to the United      States in August after family members had been tortured and      friends jailed for their faith, she said. But when she      arrived at Dulles International Airport and requested asylum,      federal immigration officials detained her and placed her in      the local jail in this small city outside Richmond.       Sonam, who is known by that one name, has been here ever      since except for a brief visit in November to a court room in      Arlington where a federal immigration judge granted her      asylum. But even as she was hugging her attorney in      celebration, the lawyer from the Department of Homeland      Security announced that she was appealing the case.       Sonam was then shackled and returned to her cell, where she      waits for their next court date, which is likely to be in the      fall at the earliest, her attorney said.       Sonam is among thousands of asylum seekers who have fled      persecution in their homelands only to be jailed in the      United States, a new report by the New York-based Lawyers      Committee for Human Rights shows.       By law, the Department of Homeland Security detains all      asylum seekers who arrive without proper documents. But since      the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, federal immigration      officials have also been denying parole to those immigrants      and appealing rulings in their favor, a practice that can      keep them locked up for years, according to the report, which      monitored the department's activities for a year and details      scores of cases, including Sonam's.       Homeland Security officials deny they are trying to keep      asylum seekers behind bars, although they acknowledge that      long incarcerations occur. They say they are reviewing their      practices in responses to the report and are tallying      statistics on how many asylum seekers have been detained,      refused parole or seen their cases appealed.       ``Even a well-balanced policy can get out of kilter on an      individual case because someone     has exercised poor judgment,'' said Asa Hutchinson, the      Homeland Security Department's undersecretary for border and      transportation security.       At the same time, he and others say their is concern that a      terrorist could slip into the country under the guise of an      asylum request.       ``People who come here may have no legitimate [reason].      They are here for economic reasons or for criminal reasons      and have been trained to assert asylum,'' Hutchinson said.       ``That requires us to be careful and . . . sometimes it      makes people more skeptical of asylum cases than they should      be.''       Last week, during an interview at the Riverside Regional      Jail, Sonam spoke of her journey to the United States that      began with a desperate, eight-day walk to Nepal across snow-     capped mountains and ended with her first ride on an      airplane, which frightened her so much she couldn't look out      the window.       Sonam Singeri, a Tibetan working for Radio Free Asia who      has befriended Sonam, was at the interview to translate. As      soon as Sonam walked into the visitors' room and saw Singeri,      she collapsed into her arms and sobbed uncontrollably.       ``It's so lonely. It's so hard. Why is this happening?''      she cried out, Singeri said.       Sonam told a story of flight and fear. She said her father      has been jailed in Tibet and tortured with electric shock.      She described hiding from police patrols as she made her way      across the Himalaya Mountains to Nepal, where she lived for      three years.       But even there, she said, she worried about her safety. In      May, the Nepalese government began to round up Tibetan      refugees and send them back to China, where they were sure to      face prison and torture, she said.       Even after asylum seekers such as Sonam have convinced      immigration judges that they are bona fide and pose no      threat, Homeland Security lawyers continue to press appeals      in many cases, the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights report      says.       ``They are indefinitely detaining asylum seekers who have      already been granted relief, who present no risk, who have      often been tortured in their home countries,'' said Archi      Pyati, who works in the lawyers committee's asylum program.       ``We are sending a message that in the United States . . .      we don't hope that asylum seekers find their way here because      if they do they will find themselves in a very difficult      situation and in prolonged detention.''       Immigrants seeking asylum in this country must prove not      only their identities but also that they are in danger in      their native countries.       Sonam's case was appealed because she did not have enough      documentation to back up her story, according to a brief      filed by Homeland Security attorney Deborah Todd. The fact      that Sonam lived in Nepal for three years indicated that she      could have safely stayed there and did not need to come to      the United States, Todd argued in her appeal.       Asked to comment, a spokesman for Homeland Security said      the department does not talk about ongoing cases.       Sonam said she had no way to get identity documents in      Nepal because the government does not recognize refugees from      China. She feared that she would be deported to China along      with other Tibetans who were being sent back at the time. So      she sought a way to get to the United States.       Using the money she had made as a seamstress before she      joined her monastery in Nepal, Sonam booked a flight through      Calcutta to Dulles.       After she was jailed in Virginia, her attorney, who has      taken the case pro bono, twice asked the Department of      Homeland Security to release her from detention, arguing that      Sonam poses no danger. But immigration officials denied both      requests without much explanation, according to Sonam's      attorney.       The hardest part of Sonam's life these days is that she      cannot speak or understand the language of the inmates or      guards. (She is also illiterate in her native Tibetan      tongue.) She has not been able to have a conversation with      anyone since her hearing in November and wept as she      recounted her seemingly endless days of silence and isolation      in jail.       ``I live in a prison but always in my mind, I hold onto a      picture of His Holiness [the Dalai Lama] in my heart,'' she      said. ``This prison has become my monastery.''       An hour into the interview, a guard tapped the window of      the visitors' room. It was time to go.       Sonam shed a few more tears. It might be months before her      next conversation. She hugged Singeri again and then followed      the guard back to her part of the jail where she does not      speak, cannot understand anyone and where she waits in her      prison within a prison.                          ____________________
