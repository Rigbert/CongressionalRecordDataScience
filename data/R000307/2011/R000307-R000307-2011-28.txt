President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the quorum call be rescinded.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). Without objection, it is so ordered.  All time has expired. The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination of Edward Milton Chen, of California, to be United States District Judge for the Northern District of California?
