Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise today to pay tribute to retiring St. Joseph County Clerk Pattie Bender. Pattie is a staple of our Southwest Michigan community and my dear friend. I rise to thank her for 45 years of distinguished public service.  A life-long resident of Southwest Michigan, Pattie currently serves in a dual capacity as county clerk and register of deeds. She began her career with St. Joseph County in 1970 and has served as county clerk since 1991.  The office of town or county clerk is one of the oldest known offices in local government, essential to the functioning of our democracy. It is an office of trust that demands the utmost integrity and diligence. As clerk, Pattie is entrusted with the supervision of all national,state, and local elections; administers the Michigan Campaign Finance Reporting Act; and maintains all government records for the county.  Having known Pattie for many years, I can attest to the fact that no one is better suited for such a position. Throughout the years, she has faithfully served the people of St. Joseph County, fairly and competently executing her duties. Personally, I have come to rely on her extensive institutional knowledge and good judgment. There is no doubt that the citizens of St. Joseph County, having reelected her to the office of county clerk six times, share my good opinion.  In January, Pattie announced that she will retire in June of this year, planning to travel and spend time with her family. As she embarks on the next chapter of her life, I would like to congratulate her on a well-deserved retirement and thank her for her many years of public service to the citizens of St. Joseph County.  It has been an honor to work with Pattie and to count her as a true friend. She will be greatly missed in her capacity as county clerk, but I am confident she will continue to serve as a source of wisdom in Southwest Michigan for years to come.                          ____________________
