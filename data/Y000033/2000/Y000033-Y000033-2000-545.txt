Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Representative Bono for her follow through on the KATY issue. It was three or four years ago when her late husband, our colleague Sonny Bono, began to tackle the problem of keeping a small radio antenna on the edge of the San Bernardino National Forest for an important local radio broadcaster. With the introduction of this bill, Mrs. Bono begins the last chapter to settle an important issue for her constituents.  The station is KATY-FM, and it is the only radio link for emergency broadcasting that covers a large sector of the San Bernardino valley. An elderly couple, the Gills, owned the station. Mr. Gill passed away recently, so it is an important tribute to him that this bill is being introduced today. We will get right to work on it in my committee, the Committee on Resources, this year.  I offer thanks to the Forest Service for working hard to settle this issue, and for protecting the public by ensuring that fair market value will be paid for the small parcel by KATY-FM. While we hoped to help the Forest Service move two unrelated administrative provisions in this bill, it could not be done before introduction. However, I will make every effort to accommodate the needs of the Service on the two unrelated matters, working with the other committee with joint jurisdiction over those provisions, as the bill moves through the Committee and the House. I appreciate the Service's good faith work on these matters, and we will work in the same manner.  Congratulations again, Mrs. Bono. Your follow through is commendable.                          ____________________
