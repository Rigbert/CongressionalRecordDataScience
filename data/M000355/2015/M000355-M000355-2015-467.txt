 President, before discussing the bill currently before the Senate, I would like to note that President Obama will be heading to West Virginia today with Drug Czar Botticelli to announce additional steps the Federal Government will take to address America's prescription drug abuse and heroin epidemic.  This epidemic has been particularly devastating to my constituents. Today, drug overdoses--principally driven by painkillers--claim more Kentucky lives than car accidents. Today, increased heroin overdose rates account for nearly one-third of all drug overdose deaths in the Commonwealth. Today, thousands of innocent babies are born dependent on opioids.  I recently hosted Director Botticelli in Kentucky to discuss critical issues such as these. I am encouraged to see him and the President engaged and proposing certain steps that my home State of Kentucky has already embraced.  Drug abuse certainly isn't a partisan issue. Many Members of the Senate are actively engaged on the matter. I know the President will be joined today by West Virginia's Republican Senator and Democratic Senator. Finding solutions to this epidemic will require all of us, Republicans and Democrats alike, to work together at the Federal, State, and local levels. Today's announcement is encouraging because it is always positive to see Republicans and Democrats working together to address this epidemic.  Here is another bipartisan opportunity for us to work together on this issue: Let's pass S. 799, the Protecting Our Infants Act. I hope the Senate will pass that important bipartisan legislation very soon.                          ____________________
