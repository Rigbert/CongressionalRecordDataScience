On Thursday, September 16, 2010, Vic passed away at the age of 82 with his wife of 49 years, Bernice, by his side. Though Vic has passed on from this life, he leaves a lasting legacy in Riverside, the community he loved so dearly.  Vic graduated from the University of Pittsburgh Law School in 1952 and went on to serve in the Army as a judge advocate general and later practiced civil law in a private practice. Although he originally hailed from Meadville, Pennsylvania, Vic came to Riverside after having been appointed to the Superior Court bench in 1986 by former California Governor George Deukmejian.  When he retired from the bench in 2001, Vic's work in the community was far from over. Vic turned his focus and efforts to the restoration of downtown Riverside, including the $24.7 million renovation of the 1903 beaux-arts Riverside Historic Courthouse, which was rededicated in 1998 and complied with new earthquake standards. Vic himself has attributed this as his proudest professional accomplishment. He also advocated for a new federal courthouse in Riverside, and the transfer of the 4th District Court of Appeal, Division Two headquarters from San Bernardino to Riverside. Additionally, he was a dedicated partner in the preservation and continued care of the historic Evergreen Cemetery.  Vic did so much for the community, the term the ``Micelian Footprint'' was coined, affectionately referring to Vic's ability to positively influence whatever he touched. In fact, 101-year-old retired Appellate Justice John Gabbert called Vic the person who has done more for the community in his lifetime, and said his contributions were ``beyond measure.''  Despite his passion and gusto, Vic always had a way of charming those around him--and perhaps that is what helped him get so much done. He will be remembered for his great sense of humor and optimistic outlook on life just as much as his drive to accomplish projects and lead others.  Although his career flourished, Vic always put his family first, and set aside time every summer to take his two sons on road trips around the country. His wife remembers him as the kindest and most generous husband.  Vic is survived by his wife and their two sons, Victor Miceli II and John Michael Miceli.  On behalf of all those who knew him, it is an honor to offer these remarks as a tribute to the life and legacy of my friend Victor Miceli. His life and presence will be sorely missed and I extend my condolences to his dear family and friends.                          ____________________
