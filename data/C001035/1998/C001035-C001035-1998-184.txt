President, today I am introducing a bill to curtail a fraudulent practice known as slamming--the unauthorized change of a customer's telephone service provider. Telephone slamming is a widespread and growing problem. In Maine, for example, slamming complaints to the local telephone company increased by 100% from 1996 to 1997. Nationwide, slamming is also the number one telephone-related complaint to the FCC. While the FCC received a total of more than 20,000 slamming complaints in 1997, a significant increase over the previous year, estimates from phone companies indicated that as many as one million people were slammed last year.  Last fall, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I chair, undertook an extensive investigation of the slamming problem. On February 18th, I chaired a field hearing on slamming in Portland, Maine. My distinguished colleague, Senator Richard Durbin, joined me at the hearing, and we heard first-hand from several consumers about the problems they experienced with telephone slamming.  At the Subcommittee hearing, Maine slamming victims explained how some long-distance companies used fraudulent or deceptive practices to change their telephone service. Witnesses used words such as ``stealing,'' and ``criminal,'' and ``break-in'' to describe practices employed by unscrupulous telephone companies to switch unsuspecting customers and boost profits.  One witness, Pamela Corrigan from West Farmington, Maine, testified that she was sent an unsolicited ``welcome package'' in the mail, which looked like the stacks of junk mail that we receive every day. However, this ``junk mail'' was not what it appeared to be. This ``welcome package'' automatically signed her up for a new long distance service unless she returned a card rejecting the change. She was amazed and appalled that it was possible for a company to change her long distance service simply because she did not respond that she did not want their service.  Another witness, Susan Deblois from Winthrop, Maine, testified that when she was slammed, her children were unable to use the 800 number she had for them to call home in case of an emergency.  Slamming not only affects families but also small businesses and communities. For example, Steve Klein, the owner of Mermaid Transportation Company in Portland, Maine, testified that his business phone lines, which are critical to his livelihood, were tied up for four days which he was slammed by a long-distance telephone reseller which falsely represented itself as AT  Similarly, Ms. Corrigan, who is the town manager of Farmington, Maine, reported that the town's phone lines were also slammed. Simply put, Mr. President, no one is immune from this illegal activity.  Victims of slamming are frustrated. They are angry. They should not have to spend their time and energy resolving problems that are not of their own making. People rely on their home and business telephone service, and they should be able to choose their own long-distance company without fear that their decision will be changed without their consent.  Deliberate slamming is like stealing and should not be tolerated. The FCC must step up enforcement efforts to make sure that existing laws and regulations are followed by telephone companies, and Congress must act to strengthen penalties to halt this pernicious practice.  The comprehensive legislation that I am introducing today, along with my colleague Senator Durbin, will attack the problem of slamming from all sides.  First, the bill gets tough with those who engage in deliberate slamming. It would increase civil penalties and establish new criminal penalties for intentional slamming. Specifically, civil penalties would be increased to a minimum of $50,000 for the first slamming offense and $100,000 for a subsequent offense.  Criminal penalties would be established for intentional slamming, the same as those for any other federal crime: a maximum of $100,000 and one year imprisonment for a misdemeanor and $250,000 and five years imprisonment for a felony. In addition, anyone convicted of intentional slamming will be disqualified from being a telecommunications service provider. The bill would also allow the states to bring action in federal court against slammers on behalf of its residents, a provision suggested by Senator Durbin.  Second, our legislation increases consumer protection. It would give control back to consumers by taking the financial incentive away from companies that engage in slamming. Rather than paying the slamming company, consumers could pay their original carrier at their previous rate. It would further protect consumers by eliminating the so-called ``welcome package'' method of verification, a favorite tool of slammers, which is misused and deceptive.  Third, the bill strongly encourages the FCC to step up its enforcement efforts against slamming. It would require local telephone companies to report a summary of slamming complaints to the FCC for further investigation, and it would require the FCC to report to Congress on its enforcement actions against slammers.  Finally, the legislation would require the FCC to report to Congress on whether or not its current procedures contain sufficient safeguards to prevent unscrupulous telecommunications providers from receiving an FCC license in the first place.  Mr. President, consumers have lost control over their telecommunications service to unscrupulous providers. The Collins-Durbin legislation would go a long way toward halting slamming. I urge my colleagues to join me in the fight against slamming by co-sponsoring the ``Telephone Slamming Prevention Act of 1998.''  For the information of all my colleagues, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record a detailed summary of the provisions contained in this comprehensive anti-slamming bill.  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:          Summary of Telephone Slamming Prevention Act of 1998       (1) Clarification of Verification Procedures: The bill      amends current law, which allows the FCC to determine the      verification procedures that telecommunications carriers can      use when executing a change in subscriber service, to place      some restrictions on the approved verification methods.      Specifically, this provision will eliminate the ``welcome      package'' method of verification. It will still allow the FCC      to determine the appropriate forms of verification and the      time and manner in which such verification must be retained      by carriers.       (2) Liability for Charges: The bill also allows subscribers      who have been slammed, and who have not yet paid their      telephone bill to the unauthorized carrier, to pay their      original carrier for their phone usage, at the rate they      would have been charged by their original carrier. The      provision will not change existing law and FCC regulations      that make the slamming carrier liable to the original carrier      for any charges it collects from a slammed subscriber. This      provision is designed to take away the financial incentive      for slamming.       (3) Additional Penalties: The bill also increases the civil      penalties for slamming and creates criminal penalties.       The civil penalties provision will require the FCC to      assess a minimum of $50,000 for the first slamming offense,      and $100,000 for any subsequent offense, unless the      Commission determines that there are mitigating      circumstances. Currently, the penalty typically assessed by      the FCC is only $40,000 for each offense.       In addition, this provision will allow the Commission, at      its discretion, to assess civil penalties against carriers      that make unauthorized carrier changes on behalf of their      agents or resellers. It will require the Commission to      promulgate regulations on the oversight responsibilities of      the underlying facilities-based carriers for their agents or      resellers. This will make it clear to carriers, who sell      access to their telephone lines, that they have some      responsibility for the actions of their agents or resellers.       Currently, slamming is not a crime. The criminal penalties      provision will make intentional slamming a misdemeanor for      the first offense (not more than one year imprisonment), and      a felony for subsequent intentional slamming offenses (not      more than five years imprisonment). Criminal fines for      intentional slamming are the same as those for any other      federal crime: a maximum of     $100,000 for a misdemeanor and $250,000 for a felony. In      addition, anyone convicted of the crime of intentional      slamming will not be allowed to be a telecommunications      service provider, and any company substantially controlled by      a person convicted of intentional slamming will also be      disqualified from providing such services. After five years,      however, the FCC shall have the option to reinstate such      individuals or companies disqualified under this provision,      if it is in the public interest to do so.       (4) State Actions: The bill gives the states the right to      take action against slammers on behalf of its residents, and      makes it clear that nothing in this section preempts the      states from taking action against intra-state slammers. This      provision is necessary because some state supreme courts have      ruled that FCC regulatory authority preempts the states from      acting in this area.       (5) Reports on Slamming Complaints: The bill requires all      telecommunications carriers, including local exchange      carriers, to report on the number of subscriber slamming      complaints against each carrier. The provision allows the FCC      to determine how often these reports would have to be      submitted. This provision would not require carriers to refer      complaints on an individual basis, only a summary report that      could be used by the FCC to determine which companies are      engaging in patterns and practices of slamming.       (6) FCC Report on Slamming and Enforcement Actions: The      bill establishes a requirement that FCC submit a report to      Congress on its slamming enforcement actions. The FCC already      provides this information in its Common Carrier Scorecard, so      this provision does not establish a new report. It is      designed to make it clear to the FCC that Congress considers      slamming enforcement important.       (7) FCC Report on Adequacy of FCC License Process: This      bill requires the FCC report to Congress on whether current      licensing requirements and procedures are sufficient to      prevent fraudulent telecommunications providers from      receiving an FCC license. Currently, the FCC does not review      telecommunications provider applications prior to issuing FCC      licenses, allowing fraudulent companies into the      telecommunications marketplace.                          ____________________
