Chairman, I, too, thank the gentleman for this amendment. As the gentleman may know, there have been similar amendments that the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wolf) and I offered to this bill all throughout the 1980s.  This is a good amendment. Clearly, the United States needs to be on the side of ensuring that this kind of abuse does not occur to children, women, and workers generally. This is a very good amendment, and I thank the gentleman for offering it.
