Mr. Speaker, I again thank the gentleman for bringing this legislation to the floor. It is ironic, we listen to the gentleman from Massachusetts say that there has been no hearings. This is the 12th time we have passed this legislation concerning the needs of energy for this country. And by the way, for those listening to this program and those watching, Alaskans want to drill. Alaskans want to produce this oil for America. This is not our oil. We have never claimed that. Alaskans think it is necessary for this Nation.  It is ironic, I heard the gentleman from Massachusetts mention the fact that it will not relieve the high gas prices for 10 years. 10 years ago he said the same thing. I have been trying to do this for 15 years, actually 25 years. Passed it 12 times. President Clinton, by the way, vetoed it. President Clinton vetoed the same piece of legislation. We would have had a million barrels a day now flowing to the American consumer. Your gas prices would not be $3.25 today. That would not have occurred.  Ironically, it is on the other side, the other side where all those wisdom people live, on the other side there are a group of individuals of the other party that continue to block this source of fossil fuels to our consumers. Now, it might be, I am not sure it is, it might be they have a gas station in the Russell Building. For some reason, they do not want to produce any more gas. I am not sure that is real, but it could be. For some reason, they do not see the light.  I keep hearing about people supporting alternate sources of energy. And I have been advocating that. I have talked about nuclear. We cannot have nuclear. I have talked about let's burn more coal. We cannot burn coal. I talk about let's build a dam. Let's control the water flow in some of our rivers as it roars into the sea, let's control it and use it because it is truly a renewable source. But they cannot do that either.  All they ask us to do is conserve our way into prosperity. I will suggest to you respectfully that might happen if we did not have any more Americans. If we stopped our childbirth period, you might be able to conserve yourself into prosperity or into energy self-sufficiency. But as long as our population increases, we will consume more fossil fuel.  Now, I have done a little reading on this and ironically, we have a tremendous amount of coal in this country that we do not need to use just for electrical power. We can use it for liquid fuels. Unfortunately, Adolph Hitler did that because he had to. South Africa did it because they had to. Maybe some day we will get to a point we will have to use our coal for liquification also; but in the meantime, the largest source of oil that we know of in America is in Prudhoe Bay and in ANWR. ANWR is 74 miles away from Prudhoe Bay.  By the way, the gentleman from Massachusetts has never been to Prudhoe Bay. He was asked to go there to see this really pristine area which he speaks of. And by the way the people that live there want to drill. The Eskimos, the Inuits, want to drill there, but no, he didn't have the courtesy to go see when we had a hearing in Kaktovik because he knows all, and so do these Senators, they know all. But in the meantime, you are paying $3.55 for a gallon of gasoline. And yes, that is a lot. But unfortunately, it is going to be more because if we have another Katrina which we might have, God help us, or if there is a hiccup in Iran, or someplace else in the Middle East, or if we have Venezuela who decides not to ship us 1.5 million barrels, you are going to pay more, and yet we have the domestic supply here.  Some would say we have to get off the fossil fuel habit. All right. Let's everybody buy a bicycle. Let's all buy a bicycle, and break our leg, and let's go back to being China. And by the way, who is the largest consumer of automobiles today? It is China, not us. China. They also, when somebody takes me to task, they say, well, they don't burn much fuel. They burn over 2.6 billion barrels of oil a year.                              {time}  1245  Think about that a moment, and they are going to consume more. We are not the only buyers around the world. There are other buyers.  We have to start developing our fossil fuels. We should be drilling offshore. Some people don't want that. We should be drilling in the Rockies; they don't want that. Most of all, we should be drilling in Alaska, and we want that. So if you don't want to drill in those other areas, if you don't want to burn coal, then at least recognize the valuable oil resource in Alaska.  Let's pass this legislation. Let's get it to the public. Let's make sure they have a source of energy they need. Let's stop listening to the naysayers. Let's do the job today.
