 President, before the recess, I tried to get a short-term extension of three provisions that will expire at midnight tonight: section 215, business records; section 206, roving wiretap authority; and the ``lone wolf'' provision. Unfortunately, those efforts were unsuccessful.  ``Lone wolf'' and roving wiretap are not--I repeat, not--the subject of controversy with the House bill. So I would propose that we extend at least the ``lone wolf'' and the roving wiretap authorities while we continue to litigate the differing views on section 215. More specifically, I would propose that we extend those two provisions--``lone wolf'' and roving wiretaps--for up to 2 weeks.                       Unanimous Consent Request  Mr. President, having said that, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of a bill, which is at the desk, to extend the expiring provisions relating to ``lone wolf'' and roving wiretaps for 2 weeks, and that the bill be read a third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.
