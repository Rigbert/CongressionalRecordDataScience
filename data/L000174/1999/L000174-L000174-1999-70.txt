President, I am pleased that the Senate has voted today on the confirmation of Judge Florence-Marie Cooper to be a United States District Court Judge for the Central District of California.  Florence-Marie Cooper is a distinguished Californian. She has distinguished herself with a long career of service in the California state court system. She was a Deputy City Attorney for the City of Los Angeles in 1977. From 1978 to 1983, she was a Senior Research Attorney for the California Court of Appeal Second Appellate District. Then, from 1983-1990 she was a Court Commissioner for the Los Angeles Superior Court. From 1990-1991 she was a Judge in the Los Angeles Municipal Court. Since 1991 she has been a Judge in the Los Angeles Superior Court.  Judge Cooper received her undergraduate degree in 1971 from the City College of San Francisco, and her law degree from Whittier College School of Law in 1975. Following law school, she clerked for the Honorable Arthur Alarcon on the Los Angeles Superior Court Appellate Department.  The Senate could help Judge Florence-Marie Cooper's future workload if it would likewise take up and consider the nominations of the other nominees to her District Court: Judge Virginia Phillips, Dolly Gee and Frederic Woocher. Virginia Phillips was first nominated back in May 1998 and is still awaiting a hearing in order to fill a judicial emergency vacancy on that Court. The Judiciary Committee recently received a letter from Chief Judge Hatter of that Court in which he implored the Senate to act promptly on the nomination of Judge Virginia Phillips. Judge Hatter notes that the Eastern Division of the Central District is one of the fastest growing areas in the nation and has only one judge with a ``staggering caseload.'' He explains that the reassignment of cases to Los Angeles from San Bernadino ``results in a large number of litigants, witnesses, lawyers, and law enforcement officers having to travel to Los Angeles, some sixty (60) miles away, by way of the most traffic congested roads in the United States.'' I thank Chief Judge Hatter for his letter and want him to know that I, for one, understand. Those who say there is no judicial vacancies problem ought to consider Chief Judge Hatter's perspective and the problems created for thousands of people each year in his District.  The Senate also has before it ready for a final confirmation vote the nominations of Judge Richard Paez, Marshal Berzon and Ronald Gould, to the Ninth Circuit. The nomination that has been longer before the Senate is that of Judge Richard Paez, 44 months. The nomination that has been longest on the Senate Executive Calendar is that of Marshal Berzon, whose nomination was reported on July 1, before the 4th of July recess, before the extended August recess and before the Columbus Day recess.  The Senate could and should be voting up or down on the Paez and Berzon nominations. The Senate needs to fulfill its duty to each of these outstanding nominees and to the tens of millions of people served by the Ninth Circuit. A few anonymous Republican Senators are holding up action on these important nominations. Two weeks ago, the Majority Leader came to the floor and said that he would try to find a way to have these two nominations considered by the Senate. The way is to call them to a fair up-or-down vote. I want to help the Republican leader and help the Senate find its way clear to do that without additional delay and obstruction.  Despite the policy announced at the beginning of this year doing away with ``secret holds,'' that is what Judge Paez and Marsha Berzon still confront as their nominations continuing to be obstructed under a cloak of anonymity after 44 months and 20 months, respectively. That is wrong and unfair. This continuing delay demeans the Senate, itself.  I have great respect for this institution and its traditions. Still, I must say that this use of secret holds for extended periods that doom a nominationfrom ever being considered by the United States Senate is wrong and unfair and beneath us. Who is it that is afraid to vote on these nominations? Who is it that must hiding their to these nominees? After almost 4 years with respect to Judge Paez and almost 2 years with respect to Marsha Berzon, it is time for the Senate to vote up-or-down on these nominations.  The Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court wrote in January last year:       Some current nominees have been waiting a considerable time      for a Senate Judiciary Committee vote or a final floor vote.      * * * The Senate is surely under no obligation to confirm any      particular nominee, but after the necessary time for inquiry      it should vote him up or vote him down.  At the time the Chief Justice issued this challenge, Judge Paez' nomination had already been pending for 24 months. The Senate received the Berzon nomination within days of the Chief Justice's report. That was almost 2 years ago and still the Senate stalls and refuses to vote. Let us follow the advice of the Chief Justice. Let the Republican leadership schedule fair up or down votes on the nominations of Judge Paez and Marsha Berzon so that the Senate can finally act on them. Let us be fair to all.  The debate on judicial nominations over the last couple of weeks has focused the Senate and the public on the unconscionable treatment by the Senate majority of selected nominees. The most prominent current examples of that treatment are Judge Paez and Marsha Berzon. With respect to these nominations, the Senate is refusing to do its constitutional duty and vote. I challenged the Senate last Friday, in the aftermath of the rejection of the nomination of Justice Ronnie White by the Republican caucus, to vote on the nominations of Judge Paez, Marshal Berzon, Judge Julio Fuentes, Judge Ann Williams, Judge James Wynn, Kathleen McGee Lewis and Enrique Moreno.  Nominees deserve to be treated with dignity and dispatch--not delayed for 2 and 3 and 4 years. I continue to urge the Republican Senate leadership to proceed to vote on the nominations of Judge Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon. There was never a justification for the Republican majority to deny these judicial nominees a fair up or down vote. There is no excuse for their continuing failure to do so.  I know the Senate has done the right thing and confirmed Judge Florence-Marie Cooper to the Central District of California and that she will be an outstanding judge. I will continue my efforts to bring to a vote the nominations of Judge Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon.                          ____________________
