I urge Senators, if they really have something they feel is absolutely urgent for the good of the world and the Nation and their States and the Senate, and so forth, that they discuss it with the Senator from Kentucky and myself during these rollcall votes, so that we can wrap this bill up.  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I might say that, other than the Hutchinson amendment, I am not aware of any other votes that we will need before going to final passage.  When the subcommittee marked up this bill, the situation in Cambodia was grim. The Far Eastern Economic had labeled Phnom Penh, the Medellin on the Mekong. In a shocking series of stories, the Review described a nation's slide into corruption and the close collaboration between senior Cambodian officials and drug smugglers. Making matters worse, a senior officer said, ``Cambodia is now like Noriega in Panama. Nobody dares to speak out because they will be killed.''  Journalists who have called attention to the corruption and smuggling have been fined, jailed, and assassinated. Days after running a story detailing the criminal kingdom built up by a close associate of Hun Sen, the newspaper's editor was gunned down midday in downtown Phnom Penh.  However, this is not a situation which has just unraveled over the past month. This is a story which has unfolded over the past 2 years and unfortunately, U.S. Government officials and policy appear to have aided and abetted this sorry turn of events.  As the committee report notes, the evidence of corruption and political violence is not new. Democracy has been under attack for the past 2 years.  In testimony before the House International Relations Committee, the president of the International Republican Institute pointed out in 1995, tiring of his attacks on their corruption, Government officials engineered the ouster from the party and Parliament of Sam Rainsy. The testimony then went on to say the following:       Building on their success in removing one vocal critic, the      government has targeted up to six other parliamentary members      for expulsion . . . the number of newspapers is declining by      the month. Journalists are regularly harassed and beaten and      several have been killed . . . The government has been      largely successful in silencing all internal opposition and      criticism.  Unfortunately, for the past 2 years as the problems mounted, the administration failed to use our assistance programs, strong ties, and close relationships to leverage reforms crucial to the country's survival.  A few short months ago, in testimony before the subcommittee, AID's administration compared Mongolia and Cambodia, citing both as democratic success stories. At the same time, the lives of opposition candidates were being threatened, Hen Sen was actively thwarting all efforts to appoint independent judges or create a commission to establish the framework for the planned 1998 elections.  When weeks of Mr. Atwood's testimony, 16 people were killed and another 120 wounded in a grenade attack on a public rally against corruption. Human rights organizations claimed this was a clear attempt to assassinate one of the Government's most vocal critics, Sam Rainsy.  As the political violence escalated, the administration continued to endorse Cambodia as a responsible candidate to join ASEAN. Evidence that narcotics traffickers were subsidizing the leadership was dismissed. In May, in the face of overwhelming evidence that drug related corruption taintedthe most senior leaders in government, Secretary Albright testified before the subcommittee, that ``we are very careful in the way we do the certification'' and expressed confidence that Cambodia deserved to be recognized as fully cooperating in our international counternarcotics efforts.  During his visit here this spring, Sam Rainsy, the critic who has been targeted by Hen Sen's henchmen, pleaded with the State Department to change course and move quickly to condition aid to his country--to take every step necessary to force Prince Ranariddh and Hen Sen back to the negotiation table--to make every effort to salvage what was left of his country's hope for democracy. He called attention to the increasingly public efforts both leaders were making to arm private militias--a sign, he warned of the civil conflict to come.  While the administration continued to talk of Cambodia's success, the committee listened to the Cambodians and international observers who urged action to stop the slide toward war. In response to the deteriorating situation, we reported out a bill which required the Secretary to certify that four conditions had been met prior to the release of any additional assistance. Specifically, she had to determine that the Government had taken steps to: First, end political violence and intimidation of opposition parties and members; second, establish an independent election commission; third, protect the rights of voters, candidates and election observers and participants by establishing laws which guaranteed freedom of speech and assembly; and fourth, eliminate all official corruption and collaboration with narcotics smugglers.  We had hoped that the Secretary would deliver a similar tough message during a planned June trip to Phnom Penh. Many of us held out the slim hope that she would be take on the important challenge of getting the two leaders to the table to work toward reconciliation and free and fair 1998 elections. I believe her planned visit represented the last window of opportunity to effect any change. Unfortunately, there were sufficient uncertainties about the outcome that prompted her advisors to recommend the visit be canceled--and with that, the window of opportunity slammed shut.  The rest, as they say, is history.  Since the coup, it is clear, the administration continues to be reluctant to challenge or confront Hun Sen. I think this is a serious mistake. It not only causes friends and allies to doubt our commitment to democracy, we risk further instability in a vital part of he world. If an interest in South East Asian stability does not persuade my colleagues of the merits of engagement, they might consider the need to see some good come out of the substantial bilateral and multilateral commitment we have supported which now exceeds $4 billion.  To address the changes which have occurred since the bill was reported from committee, I would now like to offer two amendments which modifies the two Cambodia-related sections in the bill. They are virtually identical but affect two different spending accounts. In each, I have added a new condition which prohibits aid to Cambodia unless there is a certification that the Government has not been installed by the use of force or a coup.  I understand that some of my colleagues believe there should be language linking aid to the restoration of a democratically elected government. In theory, I agree. However, given the fact that Hun Sen actually participated in the election, I believe the administration would continue on the wrong policy track and take advantage of such a provision and simply certify that an elected official was serving in office.  Prince Ranariddh must be restored to office and his party must be given the opportunity to actively and freely engage in the political process. But that will not happen unless the Administration takes the first basic step and acknowledges that he has been the victim of a bold, ruthless military coup. These amendments compel the administration to make that decision.  To address the changes which have occurred since the bill was reported, I have an amendment at the desk which adds a new condition banning aid until the Secretary certifies the government was not installed by force or coup.                Amendments Nos. 886 and 887, As Modified  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I now send modifications to amendments 886 and 887, which are already at the desk, and ask that Senators Kerrey of Nebraska and Hagel be added as cosponsors.
