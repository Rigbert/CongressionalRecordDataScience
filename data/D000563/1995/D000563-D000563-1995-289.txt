She was able to continue to go to work, and continue to make money to help raise her family, because of the assistance she received from the Government.  And they asked her in this interview, What are you going to do if you do not receive that assistance? And she said, ``It is hopeless for me. I would have to stay home and take care of my child. I would not be able to work.''  At a time when we are trying to reduce welfare dependency, she is doing the right thing. She is facing a challenge that many of us would wither under and doing the right thing. And we are giving her a helping hand for that purpose.  I would hate to see us turn that hand and slap her and say, No, now you're on your own. Show us how you can do it personally without our help, because we know that just a little bit of help has made a significant difference in her family's future.
