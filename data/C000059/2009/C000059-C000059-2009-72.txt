. 2892, the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Bill, 2010.  Requesting Member: Congressman Ken Calvert  Bill Number: H.R 2997  Account: National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA)  Legal Name of Requesting Entity: University of California--Agriculture and Natural Resources  Address of Requesting Entity: 1111 Franklin Street, Room 6402, Oakland, California 94607  Description of Request: I have secured $3,000,000 to continue the highly successful Pierce's Disease and Invasive Species Research Program. This program funds competitively awarded research grants to find solutions to this potentially devastating bacterial disease that threatens California's wine grape industry, as well as other grape varieties, citrus, almonds and tree fruit.  This program also focuses on other invasive species impacting California and the nation. These include pathogens (West Nile virus, Avian Influenza, Sudden Oak Death), insects (vine mealy bug, light brown apple moth), marine and fresh water species (green crab and quagga mussel), and weed species (yellow star thistle). Greater knowledge of these species, understanding of invasion biology parameters, and potential control and eradication strategies is critical for California and the U.S.  Requesting Member: Congressman Ken Calvert  Bill Number: H.R 2997  Account: Natural Resources and Conservation Service (NRCS)  Legal Name of Requesting Entity: Municipal Water District of Orange County (MWDOC)  Address of Requesting Entity: 18700 Ward St., Fountain Valley, California 92708  Description of Request: I have secured $500,000 to expand an existing program and add an additional 5,500 Smart Irrigation Controllers to residential and commercial properties in Orange County, CA by 2011. These Smart Irrigation Controllers assist water customers in delivering the appropriate amount of water to residential and commercial landscapes by monitoring and accounting for soil type, slope, plant type, sun exposure and current weather conditions.  Smart Irrigation Controllers, as a part of MWDOC's overall Water Use Efficiency Program, will assist water users in the district in more efficiently utilizing water resources and reduce the dependence of the area on water imported from Northern California and the Colorado River. The implementation and demonstration of this technology can serve as a demonstration project for areas of the arid west and other regions of the United States subject to water shortages who may be interested in utilizing this technology to decrease water consumption.                          ____________________
