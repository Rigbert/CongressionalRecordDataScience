Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule, and specifically would like to address the comment that the gentleman from California [Mr. Thomas] made earlier about the views that somehow Democrats are a little bit frightened of managed care or skeptical of its benefits.  I come from an area with one of the highest concentrations of Medicare and managed care in our country, and we know that there can be good managed Medicare. But in our programs, there is real choice. There are real options. And that is why we are concerned about this rule, because we think it takes away needed options from senior citizens.  Frankly, because I believe that when we come back the other side will be proposing major cuts in Medicare that are going to take additional choices and options away from seniors, I think it is very important that in Medicare select we build in some more choices and some more consumer protections.  For example, my friends on the other side are not worried about attained age pricing in their bill. What that means is that the prices the senior citizens pay go up with the age of the older person. A lot of these older people have no idea about the rate hikes that are going to hit them with Medicare select.  We hear that seniors are happy at this point about Medicare select. Of course they are, because the product is new. A lot of these older people may have only had it for 18 months. They got a statement, maybe a disclosure form, that said there was going to be attained age pricing. It did not prepare them for the rate shock that is coming.  Let us vote against this rule, let us fashion an alternative, that provides real choice to older people. Let us offer an alternative that protects senior citizens against draconian rate hikes.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote against this rule, and then fashion a bipartisan program that will protect the rights of older people in our country.
