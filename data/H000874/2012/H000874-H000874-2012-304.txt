These are scheduling questions as to whether or not we're going to have legislation on the floor that can get us from where we are to where we want to be.  The gentleman knows that the Senate has passed a bipartisan bill out of committee with Senator Inhofe, a Republican, and Senator Boxer--not exactly ideological soul mates--coming together and agreeing on infrastructure. Why? Because they believe it creates jobs.  What I'm trying to figure out from you, you go from other aspects of the bill that create jobs, and you say infrastructure is necessary for growth. Myreading of that is, as the President's pointed out, investing in infrastructure does, in fact, grow jobs.  To the extent that we can pass a bill, scheduling a bill that has bipartisan support here and bipartisan support there, and the support of the President of the United States, is what we ought to be doing. Doing it in a partisan fashion undercuts our scheduling of moving that forward. That's my point. I think the gentleman understands that point.  But I would hope that, as we work on this bill, we could do what the Senate's done, which they don't do very often, and come together in a bipartisan way, as we have historically done in this House on Transportation and Infrastructure bills, so important for the growth of our country and the creation of jobs and the moving forward--as you say, and I believe as well, we ought to come together and accomplish.  Unless the gentleman has anything further, I yield back the balance of my time, Mr. Speaker.                          ____________________
