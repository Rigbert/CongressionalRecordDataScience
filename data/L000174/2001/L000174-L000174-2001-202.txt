President, I am going to do that. I am trying to do it in a relatively compressed amount of time, while some Senators are still around. There are a lot of judges on that list. Two Senators from each State will want to introduce them, plus those that are on the agenda.  The distinguished majority leader has helped us in finding space in the Capitol to do it. We are also going to try to finish the terrorism bill, if we can. We are trying to juggle all that. I ask Senators to please show up on time when we start because there is going to be only so much of a window. If people don't show up, if we can't get a quorum, we can't go forward. I picked this time when everybody has to show up for a vote anyway, the best time to get a quorum, and we will go on with the others so that my staff and I can get back to finishing up the work of the terrorism bill.  I yield the floor.
