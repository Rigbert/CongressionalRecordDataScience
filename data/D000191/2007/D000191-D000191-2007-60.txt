Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  That was an extraordinary and revealing exchange. I was also going to point out that Mr. Price was supporting the recent mandatory rulings of the Republican-run SEC for disclosure, but then deprive the public, the stockholders, from being able to do anything meaningful once they find out about scandalous levels of executive compensation or board compensation.  Everyone talks about the board as the remedy. The board is often a part of the problem, being paid huge amounts of money for showing up once or twice a year at meetings.  So, now, I mean, at least this is a little more honest. They don't even want the stockholders to be able to find out how much the executive is being paid, out of fear that somehow they might be able to do something about it, I guess. I mean, this is absolutely extraordinary.  I heard some other things. They say, if a corporation feels it is warranted, the gentleman from Georgia says, they can vote on executive salary. Oh, the board, who got a sweet deal, who are supporting the CEO who has got a sweet deal, if they feel it is warranted, they will allow those little peons, the stockholders, to vote on it. This is America. These are public corporations.  Now, would the gentleman say if someone inherits some stock, or someone has been a lifelong investor in a company, and there is a coup by somecorporate raiders, and they install a board, and they just start dumping an excessive, as the gentleman said, sometimes greater than warranted salary on a CEO, that they should not have the power to do something about it?  He says, well, you know, they can elect other people to the board. Well, no, because the election to the board process is fixed too. You get either to vote for the nominees or withhold. But if they get a single vote, and their buddy sitting next to them is going to vote, they will get their own stock for themselves. They are elected to the board. Ninety-nine percent of the people may have withheld, 99.999 may have withheld. That one person votes for himself. He is still on the board.  That is the way the rules work now. Apparently you think that is just fine. You admit that there is excessive salary being paid here, excessive compensation. No one can look at those numbers and say that they aren't, the gentleman even admitted, greater than warranted in some cases.  Well, then, give the stockholders a meaningful remedy. That is all we are doing here. We are just saying, it is not even mandatory, just that you can have, once you get the mandatory disclosure put in place by the Republicans, we Democrats are saying the stockholders should be allowed to have a referendum on that and not have a runaround by the board or not have their capability to put a measure before the corporation denied by the board.                              {time}  0930  I have a major stockholder of Bank of America stock in my district, and he has been constantly frustrated in attempting to move forward questions about board compensation, about executive compensation, about governance. And he is a major stockholder, as are the rest of his family. But he is thwarted. It is a little bit like the old Soviet Union: They are in charge, they don't have to listen to him. It is not democratic.  But the gentleman from Georgia says, well, sell your stock. That is a great remedy. Let the corporate raiders take it over, sell your stock. Now, come on. Give people recourse. And, you know, the reason that some investors are going to Europe is because they have more regulation in Europe and they have less excessive compensation to boards and CEOs, and they know that their dollars and/or pounds or Euros are being better cared for within that investment. That is why we are losing people overseas, not because of disclosure of excessive compensation or the possibility stockholders might be able to vote on it.
