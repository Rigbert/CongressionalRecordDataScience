President, on January 12 of this year, the Indonesian military tortured and murdered six unarmed civilians in Liquisa, near Dili, in East Timor.  The Indonesian Army Chief of Staff, while reportedly admitting ``procedural violations,'' claimed the victims were supporters of the guerrillas. However, the National Human Rights Commission of Indonesia, which released a scathing report on March 2, accused the military of ``unlawful'' killings of innocent civilians.  As anyone who follows events in East Timor knows, the Liquisa shootings were not an isolated incident. They were part of a pattern of political violence on the island in which Indonesian troops have been implicated for decades.  However, the fact that the National Human Rights Commission published such a conscientious report is encouraging. The Indonesian Government now has two choices.  One choice is to repeat its mistakes after the November 1991 Dili massacre. Many here will recall how back then, the unarmed demonstrators were sentenced to long prison terms, while a handful of lower ranking soldiers who fired the deadly shots went to jail for a few months and the officers who gave the orders and tried to cover up the crime went scot free.  The other choice is to take responsibility, and use this opportunity to punish severely all those implicated in these crimes, and by doing so deter others from committing such atrocities in the future. Only when the impunity ends will the abuse of human rights end.  Let us hope that the Indonesian Government seizes this opportunity to demonstrate that no one is above the law, because it is long overdue in a country that seeks to be accepted as a respectable world power.                          ____________________
