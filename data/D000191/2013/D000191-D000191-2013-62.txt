Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.  The text of the amendment is as follows:       Add at the end the following:                   TITLE __--MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS     SEC. _01. PROHIBITION ON LEASING IN BRISTOL BAY OFF THE COAST                    OF ALASKA.       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of      this Act or any other law, the Secretary of the Interior may      not issue any oil and gas lease for any area of the outer      Continental Shelf (as that term is defined in the Outer      Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1331 et seq.)) in      Bristol Bay off the coast of Alaska.       (b) Offset.--Notwithstanding any other provision of this      Act, title III of this Act shall have no force or effect.  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 274, the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is to remove from the bill provisions that would mandate leasing off of the fabulous Bristol Bay area of Alaska.  Now, I've said this bill is a little bit like Groundhog Day because we have passed it before, and we talked about that yesterday, but this is about a bizarre version of Groundhog Day and why I am forced to offer this amendment.                              {time}  0920  Actually, after the Exxon Valdez oil spill, I traveled up to the spill with then-Subcommittee Chairman George Miller and saw what an extraordinary mess had been created, something that in those cold waters is very difficult to deal with and very persistent and caused tremendous damage to the fisheries. Congress chose then, in 1989, under President George H.W. Bush, to revoke the leases in the Bristol Bay area in order to protect this $2 billion a year fishery.  In fact, the American people, the taxpayers of the United States of America, paid $100 million to buy back those leases that had been sold in the 1980s. That moratorium remained in place until then-President George W. Bush lifted the moratorium.  The Obama administration has done the right thing and reversed George W. Bush's decision and excluded Bristol Bay from drilling in the 2012-2017 OCS leasing program. So we had the first President Bush agree that a permanent protection of that area was warranted because of the $2-billion-a-year renewable fishery and other precious resources, the cold water, the difficult conditions. George W. Bush then reversed that, and President Obama has reinstated a moratorium.  Now this bill would mandate leasing off of Bristol Bay. Obviously, there's always division over these issues, but there is strong public opposition to drilling in Bristol Bay--55 tribes, Native Alaskan associations, and fishing organizations are opposed to the drilling in that area. National environmental groups like Trout Unlimited, Wild Salmon Center, and Natural Resources Defense Council also support this amendment.  This is a precious and irreplaceable area. One major spill in that area would devastate the environment, the fishery that supports thousands of jobs in Alaska. Actually jobs all up and down the west coast of the United States are dependent upon the fabulous fishery of Bristol Bay, both the commercial and the sport fishing. I have guides in Oregon who spend their summers in Alaska guiding in the Bristol Bay area. It attracts people from around the world.  We should not put this extraordinary resource at risk in this bill for some possible, potential future oil revenues in a State which is already quite rich in oil, where the former Naval Petroleum Reserve has been leased but, as in the case of many leases that the oil industry holds, is not developed. That is why it was the Naval Petroleum Reserve. There are known and large resources under that area of Alaska. The balance is clearly in favor of protecting this area, not another area to drill given the resources already available in Alaska.  I had to do a so-called ``pay-for.'' Last night we passed the Cassidy amendment, which increases the Federal deficit by $15 billion--excuse me, $14,999,999,970--over 30 years by lifting the cap on revenue sharing with the Gulf States. That's costing, they say, $1 less than $500 million a year. That didn't have to be paid for. They waived the rules. But because I want to protect this fabulous resource, they're saying you're forgoing potential possible future revenues for the government, you must pay for it. So unfortunately, given that, I had to move to strike title III so we could protect this resource.  With that, I yield back the balance of my time.
