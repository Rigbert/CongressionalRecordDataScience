 President, I am pleased that the Senate passed the budget plan this morning. I was hoping to be here in time to cast my vote in favor of this agreement, but I was a few minutes late. I want my colleagues to know, and the record to reflect, that I was paying last respects to one of Delaware's finest citizens and a man who was a good friend to me for the past four decades. I am speaking of William T. ``Bill'' McLaughlin, also known as ``Mr. Mayor,'' who passed away last Friday. He presided as Mayor of Wilmington from 1977 to 1984 and shaped it as the financial center it is today. This morning I attended the mass in his honor and presented the eulogy.                          ____________________
