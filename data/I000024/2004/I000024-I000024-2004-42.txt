President, I ask unanimous consent that a cost estimate prepared by the Congressional Budget Office to accompany Senate Report 108-314, the committee report to S. 2773, the Water Resources Development Act of 2004, be printed in the Record. The estimate was not available when the report was filed by the Committee on Environment and Public Works on August 25, 2004.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                          Cost of Legislation       Section 403 of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment      Control Act requires that a statement of the cost of the      reported bill, prepared by the Congressional Budget Office,      be included in the report. That statement follows:                               __________                                                     CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE     S. 2773, Water Resources Development Act of 2004, as reported          by the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works          on August 25, 2004.     Summary       S. 2773 would authorize the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps)      to conduct water resource studies and undertake specified      projects and programs for flood control, inland navigation,      shoreline protection, and environmental restoration. The bill      would authorize the agency to conduct studies on water      resource needs and feasibility studies for specified projects      and to convey ownership of certain Federal properties.      Finally, the bill would extend, terminate, or modify existing     authorizations for various water projects and would authorize      new programs to develop water resources and protect the      environment.       Assuming appropriation of the necessary amounts, including      adjustments for increases in anticipated inflation, CBO      estimates that implementing S. 2773 would cost about $2.9      billion over the 2005-2009 period and an additional $4      billion over the 10 years after 2009. (Some construction      costs and operations and maintenance would continue or occur      after this period.)       S. 2773 also would allow for the spending of certain      receipts from hydroelectricity sales associated with Army      Corps of Engineers projects for facility planning, operation,      maintenance, and upgrades, without further appropriation.      Most of the receipts would come from electricity sold by the      government's power marketing administrations (PMAs),      including the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA). This      provision also would direct the PMAs to reduce the      maintenance component of the electricity rate charged to      customers. The bill would convey parcels of land to various      nonFederal entities and would forgive the obligation of some      local government agencies to pay certain project costs.      Finally, the bill would allow the Corps to collect and spend      fees related to training courses and permit processing. CBO      estimates that enacting those provisions would increase      direct spending by $803 million in 2005, $5.3 billion over      the 2005-2009 period, and $10.8 billion over the 2005-2014      period. Enacting the bill would not affect revenues.       S. 2773 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector      mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act      (UMRA). Federal participation in water resources projects and      programs authorized by this bill would benefit state, local,      and tribal governments, and any costs to those governments to      comply with the conditions of this Federal assistance would      be incurred voluntarily.     Estimated Cost to the Federal Government       The estimated budgetary impact of S. 2773 is shown in the      following table. The costs of this legislation fall within      budget functions 300 (natural resources and the environment)      and 270 (energy).                    TABLE 1. ESTIMATED BUDGETARY IMPACT OF S. 2773 OVER THE 2005-2009 PERIOD                                     By Fiscal Year, in Millions of Dollars----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                  2005      2006      2007      2008      2009----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                  CHANGES IN SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATIONEstimated Authorization Level.................................       599       623       619       593       604Estimated Outlays.............................................       419       609       614       595       595                                           CHANGES IN DIRECT SPENDINGEstimated Budget Authority....................................     1,065     1,071     1,134     1,198     1,311Estimated Outlays.............................................       803       981     1,109     1,170     1,274----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------     Basis of Estimate       For this estimate, CBO assumes that S. 2773 will be enacted      near the beginning of fiscal year 2005 and that the necessary      amounts will be appropriated for each fiscal year.       Spending Subject to Appropriation       S. 2773 would authorize new projects related to      environmental restoration, shoreline protection, and      navigation. This bill also would modify many existing Corps      projects and programs by increasing the amounts authorized to      be appropriated to construct or maintain them or by      increasing the Federal share of project costs. Assuming      appropriation of the necessary funds, CBO estimates that      implementing this bill would cost $2.8 billion over the 2005-     2009 period and an additional $4 billion over the 10 years      after 2009. For ongoing construction costs of previously      authorized projects, the Corps received a 2004 appropriation      of $1.6 billion.       For new water projects specified in the bill, the Corps      provided CBO with estimates of annual budget authority needed      to meet design and construction schedules. CBO adjusted those      estimates to reflect the impact of anticipated inflation      during the time between project authorization and      appropriation of construction costs. Estimated outlays are      based on historical spending rates for Corps projects.       Significant New Authorizations. S. 2773 would authorize the      Army Corps of Engineers to conduct water resource studies and      undertake specified projects and programs for flood control,      inland navigation, shoreline protection, and environmental      restoration. For example, the bill includes authorizations      for enhanced navigation improvements on the Upper Mississippi      River at an estimated Federal cost of $1.7 billion and an      ecosystem restoration project, also on the Upper Mississippi      River, at an estimated Federal cost of $1.46 billion. Another      large project authorized by this bill is the Indian River      Lagoon project in the Florida Everglades at an estimated      Federal cost of $604 million. Construction of those projects      would likely take more than 15 years.       Fish and Wildlife Mitigation. Section 1011 would amend the      Water Resources Act of 1986 to establish a standard for fish      and wildlife habitat mitigation on certain Corps projects. S.      2773 would require the Corps to develop a mitigation plan      that restores the same number of acres of habitat that would      fully replace the hydrologic and ecological functions that      are lost because of construction of a Corps project. For this      estimate, CBO assumes that this provision would apply to      potential projects that are being studied but have not yet      been submitted to the Congress for authorization. CBO      estimates this provision would have no significant cost.      However, it is possible that the Administration could      interpret this provision to be applicable to authorized      projects that have not yet begun or completed construction.      Under that interpretation, this provision would increase      future construction costs significantly.       Deauthorizations. S. 2773 would withdraw the authority for      the Corps to build over 55 projects authorized in previous      legislation. Based on information from the Corps, however,      CBO does not expect that the agency would begin most of those      projects over the next 5 years. Some do not have a local      sponsor to pay nonFederal costs, others do not pass certain      tests for economic viability, and still others do not pass      certain tests for environmental protection. Consequently, CBO      estimates that canceling the authority to build those      projects would provide no significant savings over the next      several years.       Direct Spending       Based on information from affected agencies, CBO estimates      that enacting S. 2773 would increase direct spending by about      $800 million in 2005 and $10.8 billion over the 2005-2014      period. Table 2 presents the direct spending components of      the bill. Most of the direct spending under the bill would      stem from provisions to allow for the spending of certain      receipts associated with Corps projects for facility      planning, operation, maintenance, and upgrades without      further appropriation.       Improvement of Water Management at Corps of Engineers      Reservoirs. Section 1006 of the bill would designate that all      receipts associated with Corps projects be spent, without      further appropriation, on operations, maintenance, and      upgrades at its facilities. The Federal power marketing      administrations (including the Bonneville Power      Administration) collect receipts from the sale of      hydroelectric power at Corps dams. The Corps also collects      fees associated with other activities at its projects.      Overall, the bill would make available for spending, on      average, about $1 billion per year of those receipts. Because      those receipts would otherwise be deposited in the Treasury,      CBO estimates that enacting section 1006 would increase      direct spending by $595 million in 2005 and $9.7 billion over      the 2005-2014 period.       The bill specifies how the funds would be spent. Most of      the funds, 80 percent, would be spent within the same Corps      district from which they are collected. The remaining 20      percent would be available agencywide for any Corps project.       Spending of Receipts Collected by the Bonneville Power      Administration. The bill would make receipts collected by BPA      from the sale of hydroelectric power at Corps dams available      for spending by the Corps. Unlike hydroelectricity receipts      collected by the other PMAs, all receipts collected by BPA go      into a revolving fund and are spent for operating its      electricity system and repaying previous appropriations and      Treasury borrowing. Because a portion of BPA's generating      revenues from Corps dams are used to keep its system      functioning, CBO assumes that only those receipts that would      be used to repay previous appropriations and Treasury      borrowing, that is, BPA's intergovernmental payments, would      be available for spending by the Corps.       Under current law, CBO estimates that BPA's      intergovernmental payments will be, on average, about $730      million per year over the 2005-2014 period. Under S. 2773, we      assume that such payments would continue to made but would be      spent without further appropriation for operations and      maintenance at Corps facilities. BPA's Treasury payments      fluctuate from year to year based on how much cash is      available at the end of each fiscal year (changing water      conditions and electricity prices can swing BPA's annual      revenues significantly) and the maturities and interest rates      of Treasury bonds issued on BPA's behalf. CBO estimates that      spending of BPA receipts by the Corps would total $457      million in 2005 and $7.1 billion over the 2005-2014 period.       Spending of Receipts Collected by the Other Power Marketing      Administrations. Receipts collected by the Southwestern,      Southeastern, and Western Power Administrations from the sale      of hydroelectric power at Corps dams are currently deposited      in the Treasury. Under this bill, those funds would be spent      by the Corps, without further appropriation, for operations      and maintenance at its facilities. CBO estimates that      spending of PMA receipts by the Corps would total $117      million in 2005 and $2.4 billion over the 2005-2014 period.                                TABLE 2.

Spending of Receipts Collected by the Corps. S. 2773 also      would allow the Corps to spend any proceeds that it collects      in grazing fees, shoreline management permit fees, and      municipal and industrial water supply fees. The Corps could      spend such funds for operations and maintenance at its      facilities. CBO estimates that spending of such receipts      would total $21 million in 2005 and $288 million over the      2005-2014 period.       Impact on Future Corps Appropriations. By making about $1      billion a year available for operations and maintenance at      Corps facilities without further appropriation, the bill      could lead to future reductions in the amounts appropriated      for such purposes. In fiscal year 2004, the Corps received an      appropriation of almost $2 billion for operations and      maintenance costs. Enacting this bill could result in a      reduction in future appropriations if the Congress chose to      maintain total Corps spending at a level similar to the      amount appropriated in 2004. For this estimate, however, CBO      assumes that Corps appropriations would remain at current      levels and that new spending authorized by the bill would be      in addition to what is annually made available.       Reduction in the Maintenance Component of Electricity      Rates. CBO assumes that section 1006 of S. 2773 would result      in an overall reduction in electricity receipts collected by      the PMAs. Under current law, electricity sales rates charged      by the PMAs are set to recover the cost of generating      electricity, including operations and maintenance expenses      associated with hydroelectricity generation at Corps      projects. Over the 2005-2010 period, the bill would lower the      portion of electricity rates charged to PMA customers for      Corps-related expenses to 0.22 cents per kilowatt-hour. (BPA      rates are explicitly exempted by that provision.)       The PMAs currently charge their electricity customers for      Corps-related expenses more than the 0.22 cents per kilowatt-     hour that would be mandated by the bill. Such rates range      from as much as 1.2 cents per kilowatt-hour to 0.4 cents per      kilowatt-hour for the various Corps projects associated with      the Western Area Power Administration. CBO estimates that      this provision would reduce electricity receipts collected by      the PMAs by an average of about $180 million a year, over the      2005-2010 period.       Spending of Recreation Fees. Section 1004 would direct the      Corps to establish a new system of recreation fees, including      charges for admission to Corps recreationsites and for the      use of recreation facilities, visitor centers, equipment, and      services. Under the bill, the new fees (which would be based      on the value of the admission or service purchased) would      replace charges authorized under the more-restrictive fee      authority contained in the Land and Water Conservation Fund      Act (LWCFA), which currently governs the Corps' recreation      fee program. The bill also would authorize the agency to      provide recreational services through contractors by leasing      Federal land or establishing other concession-like      arrangements with nonFederal entities. Finally, section 1004      would allow the Corps to retain and spend without further      appropriation all recreation user and admission fees it      collects under the LWCFA. CBO estimates that enacting this      provision would have a net cost of $27 million in 2005 and      $21 million over the 2005-2009 period. We estimate the      provision would result in a net reduction in direct spending      of $14 million over the next 10 years.       CBO estimates that, once the fee authority that would be      provided by this section has been fully implemented, Corps      offsetting receipts would increase by $7 million a year from      the current annual level of about $34 million. (We estimate      that the increase would begin in fiscal year 2006 and would      initially amount to $4 million to $5 million a year because      of delays in determining the market value of similar local      recreation opportunities and establishing appropriate fee      schedules.) We estimate that the contracting and leasing      provisions of this section would have no effect on the budget      because such authorities already exist.       CBO further estimates that the authority that would be      provided by the bill to spend without appropriation any      offsetting receipts earned under the LWCFA would increase      direct spending by $27 million in fiscal year 2005 and by $17      million in 2006. After the Corps implements the new fee      program mandated by the bill (in mid-2006), no additional      receipts would be earned under the LWCFA, and the authority      to spend such amounts would no longer be in effect. Because      the bill would not specifically authorize the appropriation      of, or spending of, any fees collected under the new program,      CBO assumes that those recreation receipts would be deposited      into the general fund of the Treasury.       Various Land Conveyances. S. 2773 would authorize the Corps      to convey certain land in Alabama, Pennsylvania, Georgia, and      Missouri. CBO estimates that those conveyances would have no      significant impact on the Federal budget.       The bill also would convey at fair market value 13 acres of      land and the structures on the land, including a loading dock      with mooring facilities, in Alabama. In addition, S. 2773      would convey at fair market value 650 acres at the Richard B.      Russell Lake in South Carolina to the state. Based on      information from the Corps, CBO estimates that the Federal      Government would receive about $7 million in 2008 from this      sale.       Arcadia Lake, Oklahoma. Section 5303 would eliminate the      obligation of the city of Edmond, Oklahoma, to pay      outstanding interest due on its water storage contract with      the Corps. CBO estimates that this provision would result in      a loss of receipts of about $8 million in 2005.       Waurika Lake Project. Section 5304 would eliminate the      obligation of the Waurika Project Master Conservancy District      in Oklahoma to pay its outstanding debt related to the      construction of a water conveyance project. Due to an      accounting error, the Corps inadvertently undercharged the      district for costs associated with a land purchase related to      the water project in the early 1980's. Under terms of the      construction contract, the district is required to pay all      costs associated with building the project, including the      full cost of the land purchases. CBO estimates that enacting      this section would cost less than $200,000 a year over the      2005-2014 period.       Funding to Process Permits. Section 5401 would extend the      Corps' current authority for two more years to accept and      spend funds contributed by private firms to expedite the      evaluation of permit applications submitted to the Corps. CBO      estimates that the Corps would accept and spend less than      $500,000 during each year of this extension and that the net      budgetary impact of this provision would be negligible.       Training Funds. Section 1003 would allow the Corps to      collect and spend fees collected from the private sector for      training courses. CBO estimates that the Corps would accept      and spend less than $500,000 annually and that the net      budgetary impact would be negligible.     Intergovernmental and Private-Sector Impact       S. 2773 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector      mandates as defined in UMRA. Federal participation in water      resources projects and programs authorized by this bill would      benefit state, local, and tribal governments, and any costs      to those governments to comply with the conditions of this      Federal assistance would be incurred voluntarily.     Previous CBO Estimate       On September 3, 2003, CBO transmitted a cost estimate for      H.R. 2557, the Water Resources Development Act of 2003, as      ordered reported by the House Committee on Transportation and      Infrastructure on July 23, 2003. CBO estimated that enacting      H.R. 2557 would increase direct spending by $32 million over      the 2004-2013 period. In addition, assuming appropriation of      the necessary amounts, CBO estimated that implementing H.R.      2557 would cost about $2.6 billion over the 2004-2008 period.      The differences in the cost estimates stem from different      levels of authorized funding.
