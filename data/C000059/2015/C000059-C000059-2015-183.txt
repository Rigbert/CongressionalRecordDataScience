Chairman, I don't necessarily oppose where the gentleman wants to go; I just oppose the offset right now because, under the budget scenario that we are operating under, we obviously have cut back a lot of these agencies somewhat.  I am sympathetic to the job that the United States Geological Survey has. As you know, in California, we probably have the most adjudicated water rights in the world. I will work on this in the future as this process moves forward.  If it is necessary, after some conversations with USGS, that they need additional resources, I will be happy to work with the gentleman to attempt to do so, but this offset, we could not accept at this time.  I reserve the balance of my time.
