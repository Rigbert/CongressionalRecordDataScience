President, I would like to salute Jeffrey R. Immelt for agreeing to chair the President's new Council on Jobs and Competitiveness.  Mr. Immelt knows quite a bit about creating jobs, promoting innovation, and competing in the marketplace. As the chairman and chief executive officer of General Electric, Mr. Immelt has led the company through a major expansion into growth markets overseas and made GE a leader in manufacturing a new generation of environmentally friendly technologies. Now, as we transition from stabilizing our economy to increasing employment and growth, Mr. Immelt's experience leading GE will help him counsel the President through our long-term recovery.  Mr. Immelt knows that innovation is the key to America's economic growth.Consequently, GE relies heavily on the U.S. patent system. I have been very happy to work with Mr. Immelt and GE as strong proponents of bipartisan patent reform legislation.  I recently met with Mr. Immelt and was impressed by his determination to make GE even more competitive in the future than it has been in the past. He has original ideas on investing in research and development and understands that reviving and updating America's manufacturing economy is critical to creating jobs in this country. I have always been impressed with his commitment to manufacturing in Rutland, VT, where GE Aviation has a major plant.  In honor of his willingness to serve in this new capacity, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record Mr. Immelt's recent op-ed, ``A blueprint for keeping America competitive.''  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 21, 2011]              A blueprint for Keeping America Competitive                         (By Jeffrey R. Immelt)       President Obama has asked me to chair his new President's      Council on Jobs and Competitiveness. I have served for the      past two years on the President's Economic Recovery Advisory      Board, and I look forward to leading the next phase of this      effort as we transition from recovery to long-term growth.      The president and I are committed to a candid and full      dialogue among business, labor and government to help ensure      that the United States has the most competitive and      innovative economy in the world.       Business leaders should provide expertise in service of our      country. My predecessors at GE have done so, as have leaders      of many other great American companies. There is always a      healthy tension between the public and private sectors.      However, we all share a responsibility to drive national      competitiveness, particularly during economic unrest. This is      one of those times.       My hope is that the council will be a sounding board for      ideas and a catalyst for action on jobs and competitiveness.      It will include small and large businesses, labor, economists      and government. Areas that we will focus on include:       Manufacturing and exports: We need a coordinated commitment      among business, labor and government to expand our      manufacturing base and increase exports. The assumption made      by many that the United States could transition from a      technology-based, export-oriented economic powerhouse to a      services-led, consumption-based economy without any serious      loss of jobs, prosperity or prestige was fundamentally wrong.      But there is nothing inevitable about America's declining      manufacturing competitiveness if we work together to reverse      it. For example, we have returned many GE appliance      manufacturing jobs to the States by collaborating with our      unions and making our operations more efficient.       Working with Boeing CEO Jim McNerney, who leads the      President's Export Council, the Council on Jobs and      Competitiveness will look for ways to harness the power of      international markets--home to more than 95 percent of the      world's consumers. Currently, the United States ranks lowest      among the world's largest manufacturing nations in the ratio      of domestically produced goods sold overseas, or export      intensity. We must set as our highest economic priority not      just increasing our exports, as the president has pledged,      but also making the United States the world's leading      exporter in the 21st century.        Free trade: America cannot expand its manufacturing base      without reatly increasing the volume of goods it sells      overseas. That is why I applaud the free-trade agreement      recently concluded between the United States and South Korea,      which will eliminate barriers to U.S. exports and support      export-oriented jobs. We should seek to conclude trade and      investment agreements with other fast-growing markets and      modernize our systems for export finance and trade control.      Those who advocate increasing domestic manufacturing jobs by      erecting trade barriers have it exactly wrong.       Innovation: Businesses should invest more of their cash and      resources in advanced products and technologies that will      create jobs in the United States, and government should      incentivize this investment in innovation. Today, GE is      investing more than ever in research and development--about 6      percent of revenue--aimed at solving challenges in      transportation, energy and health care. As one of America's      largest exporters, GE remains committed to producing more      products in the United States, which is our home and largest      market. In the past two years, GE has created about 6,000      manufacturing jobs in the States, many resulting from      investments in innovations such as advanced batteries, which      we will make at our 100-year-old plant in Schenectady, N.Y.       GE sells more than 96 percent of its products to the      private sector, where America's future must be built. But      government can help business invest in our shared future. A      sound and competitive tax system and a partnership between      business and government on education and innovation in areas      where America can lead, such as clean energy, are essential      to sustainable growth.       It is possible to be a competitive global enterprise and      still care about your home. In fact, it is not just possible      but imperative. There is no easy solution to ``fix'' the      American economy. Persistent and high unemployment--and the      pessimism it breeds--should not be accepted. We must work      together to construct an economy that creates more      opportunity for more people.                          ____________________
