Speaker, I rise today to congratulate fifteen individuals who were recently recognized for outstanding achievement by the Toledo African American Legacy Project. The Toledo African American Legacy Project is dedicated to bringing together people to document and preserve the history of Northwest Ohio's African American communities and to celebrate their impact and influence upon Toledo and the greater world community. The organization honored six people, as well as two posthumously and eight up-and-coming residents during its ninth annual celebration.  The six people receiving honors this year were: Myra Waters, who graduated from Toledo's Libbey High School and is now the Director of the Counseling Center and Adjunct Faculty Member at the University of Baltimore. Samuel L. Price, a Scott High School graduate, is a respected businessman and restaurateur. Joseph Sommerville is a Professor Emeritus in the University of Toledo's College of Education. Lola Glover is a champion for our region's marginalized residents and founder of the Coalition for Quality Education. Dr. Crystal Ellis, a Springfield High School graduate, is an educator who became the first African-American superintendent of the Toledo Public Schools. Wilma Brown, also a graduate of Toledo's Scott High School and the first African-American to become president of the Toledo City Council, served the citizens of Toledo in elected office.  The Toledo African American Legacy Project also posthumously recognized Daniel Mack, who owned and operated the highly regarded Candlelight Cafe and Robert Powell who owned Toledo's iconic Powell's Beauty and Barbershop.  In addition to honoring current leaders from northwest Ohio's African American community, the Toledo African American Legacy Project also highlights young, emerging African American leaders from the region. This year, eight people were recognized for their efforts: Kenyetta Jones an autoworker from Toledo who last year introduced President Obama in Ohio and later addressed the Democratic National Convention; Alicia Smith, an educational coordinator at Toledo's Padua Center; Hope Bland, a field instructor at the University of Toledo and Wayne State University School of Social Work; Merdia Allen, Associate Director of the Office of EXCELlence and Multicultural Student Success programs and part-time instructor at the University of Toledo; Joshua Peterson, an associate at Eastman & Smith Attorneys at Law; William Pierce, Interim Director of Undergraduate Admission at the University of Toledo; Rodney Eason, Jr., Director of Human Resources at The Andersons; and Keith Jordan, President of the Toledo Board of Community Relations.  I join our community in congratulating this year's African American Legacy Project honorees. Each person's contributions have made us stronger and bettered the lives of many in our region. We salute the efforts of each honoree.                          ____________________
