He has worked very hard on this bill. I know it is an issue he cares deeply about, and I very much appreciate his taking the time to come to the floor and to urge Members to vote for the motion to proceed to the debate on this absolutely vital piece of legislation.  I must say I was disappointed to hear some of the comments made on the Senate floor today in opposition to this bill. The fact is both Republican and Democratic officials have, with veryfew exceptions, endorsed the framework of this bill and urged us to move forward. In fact, they have warned us repeatedly in saying the only question is when a major cyber attack will occur. Not whether it will occur, but when it will occur. We have letter after letter, statement after statement from national and homeland security experts, representing both President Bush's administration and the current administration, urging us to act.  Indeed, yesterday the Aspen Institute Homeland Security Group put out a statement, stating the following:       The Aspen Homeland Security Group strongly urges the U.S.      Senate to vote this week to take up S. 3414, the cyber-     security bill, for debate on the Floor.  The statement goes on to say:       We urge the Senate to adopt a program of voluntary cyber-     security standards and strong positive incentives for      critical infrastructure operators to implement those      standards. The country is already being hurt by foreign      cyber-intrusions, and the possibility of a devastating cyber-     attack is real. Congress must act now.  This letter is signed by officials from the previous administration, such as Charles Allen, Stewart Baker, Michael Leiter, and Michael Chertoff. There are numerous representatives of past administrations and individuals who are renowned for their expertise. How can we ignore their warning that we must act, that it is urgent, and that we must have voluntary standards for critical infrastructure--infrastructure that, if it were attacked, would result in mass casualties, mass evacuations, a severe blow to our economy, or a serious degradation of our national security?  That is the definition of the core critical infrastructure we want to cover and to help make more secure through a partnership with the private sector. And it has to be a partnership because 85 percent of critical infrastructure is owned by the private sector. We have worked hard to alter our bill to take suggestions from the private sector, from our colleagues, from the administration, and from experts across the philosophical range to improve our bill.  I heard a Member saying this morning that somehow we are going to be hurting the high-tech sector of our society. Well, that is not what Cisco and Oracle think--certainly two of the leading businesses in the high-tech sector. This morning they wrote to us, the chief sponsors of the bill--Chairman Lieberman, Chairman Rockefeller, Chairman Feinstein, myself, and Senator Carper--and I want to read a brief excerpt from their letter. They said:       . . . we appreciate your efforts to craft legislation that      addresses the important issue of cybersecurity by supporting      American industry in its efforts to continue to be the      world's leading innovators.  The fact is, it is American businesses that are being robbed of billions of dollars every year due to cyber intrusions from foreign governments, from transnational criminals, and from hackers. This is a threat not only to our national security but to our economic prosperity.  That is why the letter from Cisco and Oracle goes on to say:       We praise your continued recognition of the importance of      these objectives through the provisions of S. 3414.  They say they support those provisions. Continuing to read from the letter:       We also commend your commitment to ensuring that the IT      industry maintains the ability to drive innovation and      security into technologies and the network.  So the idea we heard this morning on the Senate floor that somehow we are going to bring innovation in America to a standstill or hurt this important sector of our economy is not supported by a reading of our bill, and it is certainly contradicted by the letter we received from Cisco and Oracle, leading companies in the high-tech sector.  Finally, I would point out they thank us for our outreach, our willingness to engage in an exhaustive process around this issue set, and to consider and to respond to the views of America's technology sector. That is what we have done. That is what we are continuing to do with our colleagues on both sides of the aisle who bring varying views to this issue. But what we cannot do is to fail to act when the warnings are so constant and alarming about the threats to our Nation, to our economy, and to our way of life.  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the statement from the Aspen Institute Homeland Security Group as well as the July 26 letter from Cisco and Oracle.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                    July 24, 2012.

Collins,     Ranking Member, Committee on Homeland Security and          Governmental Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Hon. John D.

Dianne Feinstein,     Chairman, Select Committee on Intelligence, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.     Hon. Thomas R. Carper,     U.S. Senator,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Lieberman, Collins, Rockefeller, Feinstein      and Carper: As two of the industry-leading companies      providing information technology across the nation and the      world, we appreciate your efforts to craft legislation that      addresses the important issue of cybersecurity by supporting      American industry in its efforts to continue to be the      world's leading innovators. This matter deserves the      continuing attention of industry, the Congress and the      Administration, and we commend you for having constructively      engaged stakeholders throughout this process.       As you know, effective cybersecurity must be driven by an      IT industry that is free to drive innovation and security and      maintain world leadership in the creation of secure systems.      Effective cybersecurity depends on our having the ability to      drive innovation globally--it is our core value. We have long      advocated a cybersecurity approach based on the importance of      real information sharing that can help protect important      assets. We thank you for your leadership in recognizing that      any cybersecurity legislation must incorporate iron-clad      protections to ensure American industry remains the world's      leader in the creation and production of information      technology, and to make certain that legislation maintains      and protects industry's ability and opportunity to drive      innovation and security in technologies across global      networks.       We praise your continued recognition of the importance of      these objectives through the provisions of S. 3414, the      Cybersecurity Act of 2012. The provisions regarding the      designation of critical cyber infrastructure, the specifics      of cybersecurity practices, and the treatment of the security      of the supply chain demonstrate your continued recognition of      these core principles, and we support them. Wherever the      important cyber debate takes this legislation, these core      principles should be promoted and preserved. We believe these      provisions as written capture that principle and believe it      is in the interest of cybersecurity and critical      infrastructure that they remain explicit. We also commend      your commitment to ensuring that the IT industry maintains      the ability to drive innovation and security into      technologies and the network. Further, we appreciate the      recognition that more needs to be done in advancing      innovation through increased research and development, and in      raising awareness and education, and importantly on      increasing global law enforcement.       By explicitly maintaining these principles and provisions,      your legislation proposes a number of tools that will enhance      the nation's cybersecurity, without interfering with the      innovation and development processes of the American IT      industry. Ultimately, the ability of the tech industry to      continue to innovate will provide the best defense against      cyber attacks and data breaches.       We also note the shift toward a voluntary framework for      critical cyber infrastructure in the new bill, and commend      and support the great strides you have made toward that goal.      We look forward to continuing to work with you on this issue.       We thank you for your outreach, willingness to engage in an      exhaustive process around this issue set, and to consider and      respond to the views of America's technology sector. We look      forward to working with you and others in the Congress to      continue the public-private collaboration and to make sure      that what results continues to meet our common goals.           Sincerely,                                               Blair Christie,     Senior Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer, Government                                                           Affairs,                                               Cisco Systems, Inc.                                               Kenneth Glueck,                          Senior Vice President, Office of the CEO                                               Oracle Corporation.
