Speaker, it is with great sincerity and enthusiasm that I wish to congratulate Father Evagoras Constantinides for his numerous contributions to the citizens of Northwest Indiana. Father Constantinides has been a fixture of the community since 1969, and he will be honored at a dinner presented by Friends of Hospice on Friday, May 2, 2003.  Mr. Speaker, Father Constantinides was born in Lapithos, Cyprus in 1918 and was educated in his village through his second year of high school, where he graduated with the Gold Medal Award for academic excellence. He entered Athens College in 1932, where he was accepted on a yearly scholarship with the school's science section. Father Constantinides had no trouble maintaining his scholarship for six years, and he graduated with honors while receiving the Delta Public Speaking Prize and the English Language Prize. This dedication and commitment to his studies exemplifies the hard work on which Father Constantinides prides himself.  After finishing his collegiate studies in Greece, Father Constantinides journeyed across the world to America to continue his studies and broaden his experiences. In 1938, he enrolled at Fenn College, which is now Cleveland State University, to study civil engineering. During his four years at the University, he served as a Greek teacher and as the Hellenic Board of Education Secretary for the Greek Orthodox Community of the Annunciation of Cleveland, Ohio. Although he enjoyed his time in Cleveland, his final year was interrupted by World War II. As a British subject, Father Constantinides entered the Canadian Army as a private in the fall of 1942. After completing his basic training, he was enrolled in the officer training program, from which he graduated as a 2nd Lieutenant in the Engineer Corps with proficiency in explosives, mines, and demolitions. His outstanding ability as a military officer, coupled with his excellent intellect, allowed Father Constantinides the opportunity to work for the United States Central Intelligence Group translating Japanese documents and the Greek Constitution into English.  After returning to the United States following his discharge in 1947, Father Constantinides began extensively studying theology, and on March 11, 1956 he was ordained into the priesthood. He was appointed pastor of the SS. Constantine and Helen parish in Gary on September 1, 1969, and his gracious presence has been felt throughout Northwest Indiana since his arrival. In 1971, Father Constantinides was instrumental in the construction of the Hellenic Cultural Center in Merrillville. His efforts also led to the design and construction of the SS. Constantine and Helen Cathedral, one of the ten largest Orthodox churches in the Americas, in 1975. It was during this time that Father Constantinides became deeply involved in the work of Hospice of the Calumet Area.  In addition to the many contributions within his own parish, Father Constantinides hasdedicated his talents to improving the community, the Nation, and the world. During his 26-year tenure at SS. Constantine and Helen, he trained ten assistants who are now serving the Greek Orthodox Church with distinction. He was honored with the office of Protopresbyter in 1972, and he served as the Treasurer and member of the National Presbyters Council from 1970-1974, and again from 1980-1982. He received the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of North and South America Service Award and Gold Cross in 1976 for his struggles and lobbying activities for the liberation of invaded Cyprus, a cause he continues to pursue. Father Constantinides offered his wisdom and his faith in various countries, including Russia, Kenya, Uganda, and India. He has also authored four Sunday school books for children, and has translated six Orthodox Service books from Greek to English.  Since his retirement in June 1995, Father Constantinides has devoted his time to the Orthodox Christian Mission Center, as well as writing, lecturing, and substituting at churches in the Chicago Diocese. In September and October 2002, he traveled to Argentina, Chile, and Ecuador at the behest of His Eminence Metropolitan Taraslos of Buenos Aires to perform missionary work. Father Constantinides also devotes much of his time to his loving wife, Maria, and their four children.  Mr. Speaker, at this time I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in thanking Father Evagoras Constantinides for his contributions to the citizens of Northwest Indiana, and to citizens of countries throughout the world. His love for his fellow man is an inspiration to us all, and I am proud to represent him in Congress.                          ____________________
