Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an exceptional town in my congressional district. The town of Norco, California, was dedicated on May 13, 1923. Founded by a dynamic entrepreneur, Rex B. Clark, and funded by his wife Grace Scripps Clark, daughter of powerful newspaper mogul James Scripps. This 15-square-mile community of Norco began as a California agricultural powerhouse and today is known as ``Horse Town U.S.A.'' Clark's original concept was to develop a community of ``go-getters'' whereby a man could live and feed his family off the land. With a town motto of ``Acres of Neighbors,'' the dream was wildly successful as Norco brand tomatoes, grapes, berries, lettuce, chickens, and other produce were sent all over the United States.  A chance discovery of hot mineral water in 1926 led Rex Clark to yet another dream: The Norconian Resort Supreme--a 700-acre masterpiece that opened to worldwide acclaim on February 2, 1929, complete with 60-acre manmade lake, magnificent golf course, Lake Casino, hotel, spa, separate chauffeurs' quarters and the only Southern California AAU Qualifying outdoor pool until the 1932 Olympic games. Hollywood flocked to the resort and stars such as Clark Gable, Norma Shearer, Buster Keaton and Joan Crawford were regular visitors at what may well have been the finest resort of its kind on the west coast. MGM and Fox Studios held company picnics on the site as did Disney Studios who held a famous party in 1938 to commemorate the success of ``Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs''.  On May 20, 1928, the lavish swimming and diving pools opened to greet the 1928 USAMen and Women's Olympic Swimming and Diving Team. Swimmer Cecily Cuhna highlighted the day with setting a world record. If a swimmer or diver participated in the 1928, 1932 or 1936 Olympics those athletes competed, trained or exhibited at the Norconian Resort.  Many more memorable events and activities occurred in the coming years and in the most unlikely of places: the poultry town of Norco. On December 8, 1941, the depression-weary resort became one of the preeminent naval hospitals in the Nation and at its peak in 1945 serviced 5,000 wounded, sick and battle-weary sailors and marines. The first patients were casualties of the infamous Pearl Harbor attack and recuperated in the exquisite hotel rooms. The Naval Hospital quickly set the standard in a number of areas which included the treatment of polio, use of penicillin to conquer malaria and tuberculosis, and the development of prosthetics and occupational therapy.  Norco was also the birthplace of wheelchair basketball on the wheels of the fabulous ``Rolling Devils.'' The stars, who once were guests of the former Norconian Resort, turned out ``for the boys''; Gary Cooper, Abbott and Costello, The Three Stooges, Marlene Dietrich, Jack Benny, Bob Hope and dozens of other stars entertained wounded heroes from battles in the Pacific. Eleanor Roosevelt was also a visitor, as was Helen Keller, and ball club owner Bill Veeck, a wounded marine, guided his Cleveland Indians to a World Series Championship from a hospital bed in Norco.  Norco citizens rallied behind the war effort with record bond sales and patriotism on many occasions raising thousands of dollars more than cities ten times larger in size and population. After World War II and Korea, Norco once again became an agricultural powerhouse, but, with the closing of the Naval Hospital in 1957, the entire area went into an economic tailspin. However, in 1963 a long forgotten real estate agent scrawled the words ``Horse Property for Sale'' on a piece of white butcher paper and very quickly Norco became the home to horse lovers. Incorporated in December of 1964 to protect its ``rural lifestyle,'' Norco is home to a community fiercely devoted to the equestrian lifestyle with large properties, extensive open space and a horse trail on every street--120 miles of horse trails to be exact.  Over the weekend of May 9, 10, and 11, 2008, Norconians will remember their past and celebrate a truly unique Southern California Equestrian lifestyle. It is an honor to represent the town of Norco in Congress and I congratulate the town and residents on 85 years of service to their country and community.                          ____________________
