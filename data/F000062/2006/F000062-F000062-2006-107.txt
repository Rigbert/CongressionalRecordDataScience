 President, I thank Senator Salazar for his dedication to our Nation's veterans and to the effort to provide comprehensive care to blinded veterans in particular. I certainly understand the devastating impact that severe eye injuries have on the lives of service men and women returning from combat and agree we must work to ensure that our efforts in Congress keep pace with the rising costs of providing care to these men and women and with the growing numbers of service members returning home in need of such care.  The language contained in this report is strong, and I am confident it will help to push the VA in the right direction as we strive to provide care for blinded veterans in the most comprehensive and efficient way possible. I remain committed to that effort and to working with my colleagues in both parties to see that blinded veterans receive the best services our government can provide.
