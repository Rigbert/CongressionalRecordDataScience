Does he believe that people, including the press, might be surprised to know that in the 17 months the Democrats controlled the Senate during President Bush's current term, we confirmed 100 of President Bush's nominees and during the 17 months the Republicans were in charge of the Senate, they confirmed 68?  My point is not to say what a poor record they have; 68 would be a fine record, and they confirmed those 68 with the support of most of the Democratic Senators.  But my question to the senior Senator from Nevada is, does it seem like a little bit of crocodile tears when we hear from our friends on the other side, What is this terrible slow-up, when actually during the 17 months the Democrats were in charge, we confirmed more of President Bush's nominees, considerably more, than the Republicans had during the 17 months they have been in charge?
