 Speaker, today marks the day the Ngawang Choephel, a Tibetan musicology student at Middlebury College in Vermont, was detained by the Government of China four years ago. Ngawang Choephel studied musicology at Middlebury College on a Fulbright scholarship, and he was reported missing in 1995 while researching folk music in Tibet as part of his studies. It was more than a year before the Government of China acknowledged his arrest and imprisonment.He is currently serving an 18-year prison term in a remote area of China. His mother has not seen him in more than 3 years, and officials of the Government of China refuse to allow her to see him.  Mr. Speaker, the Government of China has never produced any evidence whatsoever that Ngawang Choephel engaged in any political or illegal activity. His imprisonment is part of the Government of China's brutal campaign of repression in Tibet, Choephel's home.  We must not let Ngawang Choephel be forgotten. We must continue to use all the means at our disposal to secure his release from an unjust imprisonment on trumped-up charges, and we must continue our efforts to keep human rights high on this country's foreign policy agenda. Until we see genuine progress on human rights in China, we should withhold the granting of Most Favored Nation trading status, and we should urge U.S. corporations to stop investing in China. This kind of effort helped topple apartheid in South Africa, and there is no reason to believe it would not have an effect on the human rights situation in China.  I urge my colleagues to hold the Government of China accountable for its human rights abuses, and hasten the day that Ngawang Choephel is free again.                          ____________________
