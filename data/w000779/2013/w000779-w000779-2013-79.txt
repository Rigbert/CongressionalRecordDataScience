President, I commend the Senator from Colorado on a fine amendment. I hope we are going to get a chance to vote on it. I think he mentioned that commercial buildings consume almost half of the energy used in the United States.  What I think is important for the Senate to see is the bipartisan amendments are now piling up. We started off with a very good amendment, the Inhofe-Carper amendment in terms of thermal power, Senator Udall and Senator Collins talking about retrofitting schools, getting more for the kids and for a better environment without spending new Federal money, and now we have the Bennet-Ayotte proposal to deal with commercial buildings consuming almost half of the energy consumed in the United States.  You have bipartisan amendments, I say to my colleagues, in effect, stacking up on the floor of the Senate. I think the reason that is the case is because Senators are coming back from the August break. They were home having community meetings and talking to folks, and people said--whether you are from Ohio, like the Presiding Officer, or Oregon or New Hampshire, different parts of the country--you go back there and find a way to deal with some real challenges, and do it in a bipartisan way. So that is what the underlying bill does. That is what the three amendments we seek to be able to vote on do.  In the case of this particular amendment, the voluntary ENERGY STAR Program has created an incentive for commercial building owners to increase the efficiency of their buildings by recognizing the most efficient. So today there are over 20,000 commercial buildings in the country certified as highly efficient ENERGY STAR buildings.  The challenge, however, is that about half of the energy used in commercial buildings is under the control of the tenants, not the owners. This amendment would promote efficiency in commercial buildings by establishing aTenant Star program to recognize the energy efficiency achievements of building tenants, as ENERGY STAR does for the owners.  We looked at this in the committee, particularly in the Energy Subcommittee on June 25. To me, again, trying to build on successful approaches is simply what the country wants us to be doing here in the Senate. It is the focus of the underlying bill. It is the focus of the amendments that are pending--each one of them supported in a bipartisan way.  This amendment, as far as I can tell, has a real cross section of businesses interested, for obvious reasons. It constitutes almost half the buildings in the United States.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support we received be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                    June 24, 2013.     Re Better Buildings Act (S. 1191--``Tenant Star'').     Hon. Ron Wyden,     Chair, Committee on Energy & Natural Resources, U.S. Senate.     Hon. Al Franken,     Chair, Subcommittee on Energy, U.S. Senate.     Hon. Michael Bennet,     U.S. Senate.     Hon. Lisa Murkowski,     Ranking Member, Committee on Energy & Natural Resources,U.S.          Senate.     Hon. Jim Risch,     Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Energy, U.S. Senate.     Hon. Kelly Ayotte,     U.S. Senate.       Dear Senators: We represent real estate owners, developers,      building managers, energy service companies, efficiency      financing sources, environmental and efficiency advocates,      and other stakeholders who support market-based solutions to      lower energy consumption in our built environment. As the      Senate considers energy legislation, we support proposals      that encourage cooperation by landlords and tenants in our      nation's commercial buildings to save energy as leased spaces      in these structures are designed, constructed, used, and      occupied.       We thus commend Senators Bennet and Ayotte for introducing      S. 1191, the ``Better Buildings Act of 2013.'' The act takes      a market-driven, voluntary, ``best practices'' approach to      align building owners and their tenants to reduce demands on      the energy grid. As this proposal fits within existing      voluntary programs, it has no regulatory impact and does not      require new appropriations.       To date, bills addressing energy efficiency have focused on      how real estate owners and developers may lower energy      consumption at the ``whole-building'' level. But in fact,      owners and managers of large buildings control only about 50%      of their structures' total energy; tenants consume at least      half. The Better Buildings Act takes a holistic approach by      considering office tenants' impact on energy consumption and      behaviors. Notably, the act brings the voluntary ENERGY STAR      rating for whole-buildings to the next level by authorizing a      ``Tenant Star'' program to certify leased spaces in buildings      as energy efficient. Considering the overwhelming success and      private sector acceptance of ENERGY STAR for buildings--which      are located in all 50 states, represent billions of square      feet of commercial floorspace, and saved American businesses      over $2.7 billion in utility bills in 2012 alone--it is sound      energy policy to evolve this program to the ``Tenant Star''      level of leased spaces.       We strongly support the Better Buildings Act and its      ``Tenant Star'' provisions. We urge the Senate to enact S.      1191 whether on its own or as part of any energy package that      may be put to a vote.  better buildings act (s. 1191/h.r. 2126)--``tenant star'' endorsers       Alliance to Save Energy, American Council for an Energy-     Efficient Economy, American Hotel & Lodging Association,      American Institute of Architects, American Resort Development      Association, American Society of Interior Designers (ASID),      ASHRAE, Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), Bayer      MaterialScience LLC, Boston Properties, Brandywine Realty      Trust, Building Owners and Managers Association (BOMA)      International, CBRE, Inc., CCIM Institute, Danfoss, EIFS      Industry Members Association (EIMA), Empire State Building      Company/Malkin Holdings, Energy Systems Group, First Potomac      Realty Trust, Illuminating Engineering Society (IES).
