President, I rise today to congratulate Olivet Nazarene University on its 100th-year anniversary.  Olivet Nazarene University was founded by a group of families led by Edward Richards and Orla Nesbitt in 1907, first as a grade school and later as a liberal arts college. From humble beginnings, the university has endured bankruptcy, fire, a change of location to Bourbonnais, and tornado devastation to become the fine institution of higher learning that it is today. Olivet Nazarene University has grown as a liberal arts institution, with additional locations now throughout the greater Chicago area and in Hong Kong.  The university also has the distinction of serving as the summer home of the Chicago Bears. Olivet has hosted the NFL team for its training camp since 2002.  Currently, 4,400 undergraduate and postgraduate students attend the university. Olivet Nazarene offers these students 100 undergraduate fields of study, nearly 20 master's degrees, nontraditional adult degree completion programs, and a doctor of education in ethical leadership.  Olivet Nazarene University has graduated many notable alumni who have given back to the university, the State of Illinois, and this country in significant ways. An estimated 30,000 Olivet Nazarene University alumni live and work around the world, including Georgia Southwestern State University president Kendall A. Blanchard and Ticketmaster cofounder Cecil Crawford.  Olivet Nazarene University sets a standard of affordable excellence, with a cost below average for private colleges nationwide. Approximately 96 percent of traditional undergraduates receive a total of $24.9 million in scholarships and grants.  I congratulate Olivet Nazarene University, its president, Dr. John C. Bowling, and all the staff on 100 years of service to their students and alumni, the State of Illinois, and our Nation.                          ____________________
