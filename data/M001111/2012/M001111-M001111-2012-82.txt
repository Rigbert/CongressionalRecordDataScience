 We all agree the bipartisan sequestration agreed to in the Budget Control Act is a terrible way to cut spending. It was included as a trigger in order to bring both sides to the table ready to compromise.  I am hopeful we can get together and get the bipartisan deal required to replace these automatic cuts responsibly and fairly. But as we work toward that we all should know exactly how the administration would enact sequestration if we don't get a deal.  I was very proud to work with Senators McCain, Levin, and Thune to come together on a bipartisan compromise to make sure Congress has the information we all need on sequestration from the painful cuts to the Defense Department, border security, food safety, education, and programs for middle-class families, on which the most vulnerable Americans depend.  So I thank all my colleagues for working with me on this bipartisan compromise, and I thank the families and advocates who called and wrote letters urging us to examine all aspects of sequestration.
