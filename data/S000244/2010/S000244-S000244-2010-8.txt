 It is evident that, while this legislation increases disclosure requirements, it imposes unconstitutional restrictions on free speech just in time to influence the outcome of the midterm elections.  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the DISCLOSE Act and vote ``no'' on the rule and uphold their oath of office.  Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, let me again point out that one of the reasons why the American people overwhelmingly support this bill is because they don't want financial institutions, TARP recipients, to be able to use taxpayer money to run negative ads.  One of the reasons why the American people overwhelmingly support this act is because they know the status quo basically is the BP protection policy, which is you allow foreign companies to be able to set up these sovereign wealth funds and be able to funnel money into elections to run ads for and against people.  We know that the insurance industry wants to spend a lot of money in this election, but they don't want to tell anybody they're an insurance industry when they attack the health care plan.  We know that the Big Oil companies are going to want to run a lot of ads to try to keep their friends in Congress, those who apologize for their bad behavior; but they also know if they announce to the American people that oil companies are paying for this that they will get a different reaction.                              {time}  1110  So this is important. And I think the American people are way ahead of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle.  At this point, Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), a member of the Judiciary Committee.
