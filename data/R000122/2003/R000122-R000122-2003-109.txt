President, I rise today to recognize the accomplishment of Major Anthony W. Hamel of the Rhode Island Air National Guard. MAJ Hamel was awarded the Bronze Star Medal for meritorious achievement while serving as Executive Officer and Director of Staff of the 376th Expeditionary Wing at Manas Air Base in Kyrgyzstan from 6 November 2002 to 6 May 2003 in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.  Major Hamel was recognized by the United States Air Force for ``outstanding leadership . . . essential to the effective prosecution of operation Enduring Freedom and the fight against global terrorism.'' As Director of Staff, he ``acted as a catalyst in virtually every aspect of the wing's day-to-day operations resulting in efficient and seamless coordination among the eight-nation coalition.'' His leadership as Wing Executive Officer enabled the Wing Commander to focus his time on combat sorties and the successful delivery of weapons on target in Afghanistan. He is cited for ``exemplary leadership, personal endeavor, and devotion to duty'' which reflects ``great credit upon himself and the United States Air Force.''  Major Hamel's accomplishments also show great credit to the Rhode Island Air National Guard and the state of Rhode Island. His selfless service to Rhode Island and the nation is an example of all the men and women from my state who volunteer to help keep our nation safe from threats around the world.  I echo the praise of the United States Air Force in recognizing Major Hamel with the award of the Bronze Star Medal. I ask my colleagues to join with me today in thanking Major Hamel on behalf of a grateful nation for his unselfish service to our country.                          ____________________
