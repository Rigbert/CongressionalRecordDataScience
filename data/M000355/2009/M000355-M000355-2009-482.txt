 President, regarding the AIG bonuses, it is hard to overstate the outrage that I and others experienced over the weekend to learn that AIG, which already has received nearly $175 billion from the American taxpayer, is planning to hand out $165 million in bonuses to its employees. This is absolutely appalling, and it is particularly disturbing given the fact that I sent a letter to Secretary Paulson more than 5 months ago insisting that if taxpayers were going to help private businesses, then the Treasury would need to use its ``full enforcement powers to prevent any misuse of taxpayer funds.''
