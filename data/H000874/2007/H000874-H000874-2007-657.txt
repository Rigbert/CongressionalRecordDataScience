Chairman, I have had the opportunity to speak to Mr. Blunt, the Republican whip. I want to put Members on notice early enough so they will know before they run out of here. There are going to be votes, maybe two, at least, revotes when we come out of the Committee of the Whole and into the full House.  There will be at least two votes. In conjunction with the Republican whip, we have agreed that they will be 2-minute votes. The reason I am giving that announcement now, I want all the Members to know they will be 2-minute votes so that we can try to get Members out of here on time.                  Announcement by the Acting Chairman  The Acting CHAIRMAN. Without objection, 5-minute voting will continue.  There was no objection.
