President, Mr. Fletcher has waited a long, long time--nearly 3\1/2\ years--for this moment. He has been voted out of the Senate Judiciary Committee by an overwhelming margin twice. He is strongly supported by both Republicans and Democrats in this body. He has waited long enough.  I yield back the remainder of my time so we can go to a vote on Professor Fletcher.
