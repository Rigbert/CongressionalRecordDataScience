Mr. Speaker, on May 3, 2001, eighteen of our colleagues from both sides of the aisle and I introduced H.R. 1692, a bill to simplify and make more equitable the tax treatment of Settlement Trusts established pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act.  I am very pleased today to add the names of two of our distinguished colleagues, Representative Wes Watkins, a cosponsor from last Congress and Member of the Ways and Means Committee to which the bill was referred, and Representative Mark Souder.  Also, in my statement upon introduction of the bill, there were two items that need correcting. First, Representative Frost, Representative Bono, and Representative Stupak should have been referred to as ``Representative'' as were the other cosponsors. And, in the last paragraph of the statement, the word ``vetted'' was inadvertently transcribed in the Record to read ``vetoed.'' With that edit, that paragraph should have read:       A version of this bill was included by the Ways and Means      Committee in legislation last Congress that was vetoed and a      version of it passed the Senate as well. This current version      of the bill we are introducing today has been vetted over the      past several years with the tax writing committees of      Congress in the House and Senate, the Joint Committee on      Taxation and the Department of Treasury. It addresses the key      deficiencies in the current law. I urge that it be included      in tax-related legislation considered by the House in this      session of the 107th Congress and that our colleagues join      the co-sponsors of the bill in supporting this meritorious      legislation.                               ____________________
