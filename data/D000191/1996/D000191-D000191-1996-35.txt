Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  The issue here is a subsidy, subsidy. That side of the aisle is consistently against government programs and subsidies except when it goes to their own parochial interests. This bill does nothing, nothing to prevent predator control by individuals, by counties, by States. As I said previously, when I was a county commissioner, we canceled the predator control program, walked away from the Federal match. They engaged in private predator control, and the losses did not go up. But that is the issue here.  Will we continue a $13.4 million subsidy to a selected few of the livestock producers in the Western United States?  As I stated earlier, yes, the losses are largely due to predation. Almost 3 percent of the losses last year were due to predation. The other 97 percent were due to a number of causes, some of which are not preventable, like weather, but others which could be preventable with research, like respiratory problems, 27 percent; digestive problems, 25 percent. Fifty-two percent of the losses in this industry were due to respiratory and digestive problems.  Maybe we should invest this money in our veterinary schools. Maybe we should invest it in a vaccination program for livestock. I do not know. But there would be a heck of a lot better return than the 3 percent that was due to predation.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
