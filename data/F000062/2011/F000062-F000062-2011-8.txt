 Lorelei Shepard, who will be retiring from the United States Senate at the end of the year. Lorelei began her career on the Hill in 1993, working for the Secretary of the Senate as an elevator operator in the Capitol. She eventually became a supervisor where she was responsible for managing the weekly schedule of 20 operators and supervising their day to day duties. Her pleasant demeanor and calm nature served her well as she guided and delivered confused visitors and harried staff and Senators to their destinations in the Capitol.  She joined the staff of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in 1995, as the Committee's receptionist, where once again her calm and friendly approach and knowledge of the Capitol served her well. In 2000, Lorelei decided to pursue one of her dreams and she moved to a beautiful home in a little town in Vermont. As a Californian, I think it is safe to say that although beautiful, the winters in Vermont leave something to be desired. Thanks to that New England winter, Lorelei decided she needed to thaw out and she soon returned to Washington. Through a combination of good luck and timing, the Committee was able to have Lorelei join the Committee staff again, at the end of 2001.  She has served for the last 10 years on the Committee's staff, including for the last 5 years as our security assistant, making sure that classified documents are logged and distributed appropriately, handling classified correspondence, and keeping track of the secrets entrusted to the Committee.  It is the Intelligence Committee's constitutional responsibility to oversee the intelligence activities of our nation. Through her many years of service on the Committee, Lorelei has made a quiet but critical contribution to this effort. For that, I thank her.  Though Lorelei will be leaving, the Shepard family still remains a part of the Senate community. Lorelei's daughter, Lori, and son, Peter, have followed in their mother's footsteps and both work in the Senate today. This is quite a testament to their family's commitment and dedication to our nation and one for which they should be proud.  I wish Lorelei all the best as she retires and eventually returns to Vermont. I know she will enjoy the new-found time she will have to pursue her love of quilting, writing and the myriad of other talents with which she has been blessed.  On behalf of the Intelligence Committee, many thanks Lorelei, best wishes, and stay warm.                          ____________________
