SMITH of New Hampshire. Yes. I am very much aware of it. In terms of licensing medicines and doing the research, you know where it is happening. It is happening in the private sector. We can't shut it down.  I want health care for Americans, and my constituents want real choice and control over their own decisions. We should not reform something or change something in the name of reform that causes the Federal Government to get in the way of the doctor providing services to the patient.  My friend from Missouri pointed out earlier that thousands, if not millions, of Americans could lose their insurance under this bill as it is currently drafted. Is that really what the intent is--to have millions of Americans lose their insurance? I hope not.  Over the next few days we could discuss amendments to this bill that will make those badly needed improvements, such as the Senator from Arkansas has just done. I urge my colleagues to cross the partisan divide, enact responsible and reasonable health care, stop the attacks on each other, roll up your sleeves and do something good for the American people. We can do it.  I think if we do that we would get the thanks of the American people, rather than this partisan rhetoric that gets nowhere.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). Who yields time? The Senator from Arkansas.
