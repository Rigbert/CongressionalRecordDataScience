 President, I would like to say a few words about my good friend Police Chief Rick McCubbin of the Bardstown Police Department. We learned yesterday that he will be retiring from service after 5 years as chief and nearly 30 years in law enforcement.  Chief McCubbin led his officers through some of the most troubling times in the police department's history. He did so with rigor and resolve, with grit and with grace.  Nearly 3 years ago, the Bardstown Police Department took a blow to its very core with the tragic assassination of Officer Jason Ellis, who was killed in an ambush while driving home in uniform and in a marked vehicle. Authorities have strong reason to believe the killing was retaliation from drug traffickers against a police department that was making significant progress in rooting out trafficking and making drug arrests.  Chief McCubbin was the leader of that effort to stamp out drug crime. He spoke eloquently on behalf of the whole department about the loss of their brother Jason, who will never be forgotten. I know that while the case remains unsolved today, he has led the effort to see Officer Ellis's killers brought to justice.  Chief McCubbin continued the fight against drug trafficking by seeing to it that Bardstown's surrounding Nelson County earned inclusion in the Appalachia High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area program, which we call HIDTA, back in 2014. HIDTA is not just another government acronym but a model that works. It couples Federal law enforcement with State and local task forces and the supplies, training, and technology they need. By getting Nelson County included in the HIDTA program, Chief McCubbin brought a powerful force multiplier to his department's own efforts to fight drug trafficking and keep the citizens of Bardstown safe.  It has been an honor to work with Chief Rick McCubbin over the years. He received the honor of Kentucky's Police Chief of the Year in 2015, and I know the people of Bardstown and Nelson County certainly appreciate his diligence and determination to fight crime and to keep them safe. I thank him for his service to Bardstown, to Kentucky, and to the Nation.                          ____________________
