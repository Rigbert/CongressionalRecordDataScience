                              Exhibit 1                                Congress of the United States,                                    Washington, DC, July 24, 2009.     Wayne LaPierre,     Executive Vice President, National Rifle Association of          America, Fairfax, VA.     Chris Cox,     Executive Director, National Rifle Association of America,          Fairfax, VA.       Dear Messrs. LaPierre and Cox: As Members of Congress whose      strong support for the rights of gun owners has earned us      consistently high ratings from the NRA, we are disappointed      by the NRA's opposition to the nomination of Judge Sonia      Sotomayor to the U.S. Supreme Court. It is not merited by      either Judge Sotomayor's judicial record or hearing      testimony. Even more troubling, it appears that you are      holding Judge Sotomayor to a different standard than you held      Judges Roberts and Alito when they were nominated to the      Court, or for that matter, any previous nominee to the Court.
