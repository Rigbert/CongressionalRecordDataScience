 And there is no question that with a $150 plus billion trade deficit, what that translates into is millions of decent manufacturing jobs that should exist in this country but that do not.  When we talk about the global economy, I think what we have got to deal with is the fact that major corporations would much prefer to go to China where they could pay workers 20 cents an hour in an undemocratic society where workers cannot form free unions, where the environmental conditions or the workers' conditions are very, very bad.  Obviously what has happened is companies have invested tens of billions of dollars in China. They have invested huge amounts of money in Mexico, in Malaysia, in countries where desperate people are forced to work for starvation wages, and at the same time they have thrown American workers out on the street.  We must demand and create a process by which large American corporations reinvest in America and put our people back to work at good wages. Clearly as you indicate, current trade policy is doing exactly the opposite.
