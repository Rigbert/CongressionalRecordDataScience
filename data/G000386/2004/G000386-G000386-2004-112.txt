 President, for staff and Senators who are not on the floor, I call attention to the fact that we are starting the debate on the United States-Australia Free Trade Agreement. We have 3 hours on this side. I have not had many requests for time, and I know that two or three Members want to speak. I urge those Members to come over early to speak because if we can yield back time we do want to do so.  I was only going to speak about 7 or 8 minutes. The Senator from Oklahoma wanted to speak 5 minutes. Is there any problem if I give the Senator from Oklahoma 5 minutes right now and then I speak 7 or 8 minutes and then the Senator from North Dakota can have the floor?
