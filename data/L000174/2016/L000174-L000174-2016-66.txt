I don't think people realize how many men and women on both sides of the aisle work so hard to make the Senate work, to keep things going. I've often said, only partially in jest, that U.S. Senators are merely constitutional impediments to the staff who do all the work. One of those people is Tim Mitchell.  I have been here from the day he began, 25 years ago tomorrow. I know his wonderful wife, Alicia, and his son, Ben, who is in my grandson's class. We see them playing sports together.  If I am ever feeling down about the prospects of the Red Sox, I simply ask Tim, and know the sun will come up tomorrow because Tim will point outwe still have a chance because of this or that. I have also been at the White House with him when the Red Sox came to town with their World Series trophy.  More importantly, Tim is a true professional, and one of the most honest people I've known. If it is bad news, he will give you the bad news, but he is so nice, it is almost acceptable. I can always go to him because he will keep confidences if we ask him to. He understands the Senate, every single aspect of the Senate, as well as anybody I have ever worked with and I have been here 42 years. He is a person that everyone who works for the Senate should model themselves after. He works very well with his Republican counterparts, and has the respect of all Senators.  I don't want to embarrass Tim, but as the Dean of the Senate, the one who has served here the longest, I think it is safe for me to say that I know of no one finer. He is a wonderful person, and I commend him. I commend the sacrifices that Alicia and Ben have made, because there are some nights we are here very late. I know what it is like to miss a child's game, play or school event. Tim has had to do that. I would like to address this part to Alicia and to Ben. Ben, you should be extraordinarily proud of your father and Alicia, I know you love, respect and are proud of your husband.  I yield the floor.
