President, Darn Tough Vermont says that their factory in Northfield, Vermont, is the ``Sock Capital of the World.'' I'm loath to object to that claim. Over the past 15 years, Darn Tough has steadily grown from a small sock producer for other companies into a world-renowned brand of their own. They've created good paying jobs to Vermont and have a deep commitment to American manufacturing. Darn Tough is a great example of the many hearty small businesses that drive Vermont's economy. It is with pride that I recognize their achievements.  Marc Cabot opened Darn Tough's factory, Cabot Hosiery Mills, in 1978. He started by producing private label socks--other companies sell these under their brand name--for large companies like Brooks Brothers and Old Navy. This was a steady business. But things became difficult in the 1990s when many of those customers began to move their production overseas. By the early 2000s, Cabot Hosiery Mills was struggling.  Marc's son, Ric, who had been involved in the family business from a young age, came up with an idea to save the company. He decided to transition Cabot Hosiery Mills from a private label producer to its own brand: Darn Tough Vermont. Ric envisioned a superior, outdoor-oriented sock that was knit right in Vermont. Its quality would speak for itself.  At first, Ric had to give Darn Tough socks away to get noticed. He gave out 3,500 pairs of Darn Tough socks at the Vermont City Marathon in 2004, and soon after word, began to spread about a mysteriously durable sock with a lifetime warranty produced right in Vermont. Darn Tough's brand and sales have been growing steadily ever since.  Over the past 15 years, the Cabots have rebounded from the brink of bankruptcy to a company nearing $50 million in sales annually. Ric, who is now the CEO and president, is leading Darn Tough in its latest expansion. They've added over 50 new knitting stations and are in the process of expanding their workforce of over 250 Vermonters. Darn Tough doubled down on American manufacturing when their partners wouldn't--now they're seeing their reward.  I am proud to recognize the contributions and achievements that Darn Tough and the Cabot family has made over their over 40 years in Vermont. I ask consent to enter into the Record a VTDigger article titled ``Making it in Vermont: Darn Tough doubles down on Northfield facilities.'' It describes the hard work that goes into making each Darn Tough sock and highlights Darn Tough's commitment to Vermont and Vermont values.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                    [From VTDigger, March 31, 2019] Making It in Vermont: Darn Tough Doubles Down on Northfield Facilities       Ask Kirk Smith how many colors of yarn are used at Cabot      Hosiery Mills, and he'll tell you: ``Too many.''       The family-owned factory that produces Darn Tough socks      will include up to 16 different threads in a single design.      The operation spins out 22,000 pairs of socks every single      day.       From the outside, the Northfield production facility isn't      much to look at--it's big, beige and unmarked. But inside,      thousands of spools of multicolored yarn hang from the      ceiling, while computerized machines knit the threads into      socks.       ``If you had seen me when they took me on my tour when I      was being interviewed here, I was like a kid in a candy      shop,'' said Smith, the plant's manager of manufacturing      operations. ``I didn't want to leave the line. I just wanted      to keep seeing what was going on.''       Lined up in rows with their electronic displays blinking,      the mill's 184 knitting stations resemble slot machines at a      casino. But they have a more predictable output: roughly      every five minutes, each one dispenses a fresh new sock.       Darn Tough is in the midst of an ambitious five-year      expansion plan. In order to increase production, they're      adding more machines, bringing their total to 236--for now.      Ric Cabot, the company's president and CEO, said those      machines will increase the mill's production by 1.5 million      pairs of socks per year.       ``Accommodating the new equipment required moving their      packaging and distribution areas to another building about a      mile down the road. That means the company's annual ``sock      sale''--two weekends in November when locals walk the      warehouse looking for deals on factory seconds--will take      place at the company's satellite location this year.       There are two sock seasons each year, and the factory works      about six months ahead of schedule. Right now, they're mainly      producing fall socks.       Each piece is knit, washed, dried, boarded, folded,      inspected and packaged in Northfield, before being shipped      off to the company's distribution center in Cleveland, Ohio.       ``The Cabots have always been very dedicated to their      Northfield roots,'' Smith said. ``Could there be better      places in the state? Maybe, but this is where they started.      This is where they have a connection and this is where we'll      be.''                          ____________________
