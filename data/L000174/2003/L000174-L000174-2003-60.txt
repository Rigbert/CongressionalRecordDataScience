President, I am pleased to join with Senator Hatch tointroduce legislation to extend the Undetectable Firearms Act for ten years. I appreciate working with the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee and thank him for his leadership on this legislation.  The Undetectable Firearms Act became law in 1988, long before the tragic attacks on our country on September 11, 2001. The Undetectable Firearms Act also known as the ``plastic gun law'' made it illegal to manufacture, import, possess, or transfer a firearm that is not detectable by walk-through metal detectors or airport x-ray machines. This law has been extended once, and is due to expire on December 10, 2003.  It is critical that this bill does not expire at the end of this year. Over the past two years, Congress has done tremendous work to make America a safer place and prevent any more terrorist attacks. We need to act today to ensure that Americans are not needlessly vulnerable to attacks at airports, schools, and other public buildings.  I urge all my colleagues to support this legislation to extend the Undetectable Firearms Act for the next ten years.                                 ______                                       By
