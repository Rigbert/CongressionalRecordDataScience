President, today I am introducing legislation to exclude tobacco from the Extraterritorial Income Exclusion tax benefit, which has replaced the Foreign Sales Corporation tax benefit.  This tax provision provides tax benefits to a variety of companies, including many in Illinois, and I understand how important it is to them. But one product should be clearly, in law, excluded from this benefit, and it is the one product which kills its user when used according to the manufacturer's directions--tobacco.  The FSC replacement law already contains several exclusions from its benefits. Oil, gas, and other primary products are excluded to help ensure that natural resources in the United States are not depleted.  Unprocessed timber is excluded in order to ensure no displacement of U.S. jobs.  The law also excludes certain products in order to promote congruence with other federal government policies. For example, there are exclusions relating to items subject to the Export Administration Act, which prohibits or severely restricts export of certain civilian goods and technology that have military applications. Similarly, we should not be subsidizing tobacco products that are sold overseas while at the same time trying to cut smoking rates in the U.S. Our trade and health priorities should be on the same page.  The biggest tobacco companies in America currently benefit handsomely from the Foreign Sales Corporation tax break and will benefit from the Extraterritorial Income Exclusion tax break. The latest available data from the Statistics of Income Division at the Internal Revenue Service show tobacco products sold through 10 Foreign Sales Corporations for domestic tobacco manufacturers accounted for about $100 million in lost tax revenue in 1996. There is no justification for compelling American taxpayers to support a $100 million tax subsidy annually for the benefit of U.S. tobacco companies.  Since 1990, while Philip Morris's sales have grown minimally in the U.S., they have grown by 80 percent abroad. Smoking currently causes more than 3.5 million deaths each year throughout the world. Within 20 years, that number is expected to rise to 10 million, with 70 percent of all deaths from smoking occurring in developing countries. Tobacco will soon be the leading cause of disease and premature death worldwide--surpassing communicable diseases such as AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis.  American taxpayers should not be partners in this export of disease and death where the result is more children around the globe smoking and more people getting sick and dying.  While it is true that tobacco companies are not receiving any special treatment that other corporations don't get under the old FSC law or its recent replacement, we must remember that tobacco companies are not like any other company. Internal tobacco industry documents have established that, starting as early as the 1950s, cigarette companies intentionally withheld information about smoking, including scientific research about its risks; made false and misleading statements about the harm of tobacco products; attacked research findings despite knowing that the research was valid; failed to take steps to make their products safer; and marketed their products to children and youth.  As a matter of fact, Philip Morris recently posted a statement on its website agreeing that smoking is harmful to your health and that there is no such thing as a safe or safer cigarette. The statement says, ``We agree with the overwhelming medical and scientific consensus that cigarette smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema and other serious diseases in smokers. Smokers are far more likely to develop serious diseases, like lung cancer, than non-smokers. There is no `safe' cigarette. These are and have been the messages of public health authorities worldwide. Smokers and potential smokers should rely on these messages in making all smoking-related decisions.''  It is about time that the tobacco companies faced up to the fact that their products are harmful and highly addictive. In the U.S. alone, smoking causes more than 400,000 deaths and costs more than $72 billion in health care costs every year.  We should not be subsidizing such an inherently dangerous product that is being promoted and marketed so irresponsibly here and around the world. With its devastating health effects, tobacco should not enjoy the same taxpayer-subsidized federal assistance as other products.  It's time to take another step toward bringing our nation's tax and trade priorities in line with our clear understanding of the health dangers of tobacco. My legislation simply adds one additional category to the list of products excluded from the special tax treatment in the FSC Repeal and Extraterritorial Income Exclusion Act of 2000, which was recently signed into law by the President. It shifts tobacco from being promoted by this tax benefit to being excluded from this tax benefit.  In my legislation, tobacco is defined as it is defined in Section 5702(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, so it includes cigars, cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, and pipe tobacco. It does not apply to raw tobacco, so this legislation will not affect tobacco farmers' ability to sell their product abroad.  Is it fair to exclude a legal product from this tax benefit? Absolutely! Tobacco companies spend over $5 billion each year--that's nearly $14 million every day--in the U.S. alone to promote their products in order to replace the thousands of customers who either die or quit using tobacco products each day. In other countries, U.S. tobacco companies advertise their products near schools and in video-game arcades. They also use children in other countries to peddle their products. Street lights with the Camel logo have been installed in Bucharest, Romania. Toy cars with the Camel insignia are sold to children in Buenos Aires. Children's tatoos sporting the Salem logo are distributed in Hong Kong. Arcade games in the Philippines are plastered with the Marlboro label.  I urge my colleagues to send a message to U.S. tobacco companies as well as the next Administration to take the logical next step and make changes in the way tobacco products are sold and regulated to reflect the magnitude of the danger.  The tobacco prevention agenda has been stalled in this Congress for far toolong. Let's work together, in a bipartisan fashion, to stop marketing tobacco products to children, to regulate tobacco products in a sensible way, and to adopt larger and clearer warning labels commensurate with the risks of tobacco products. Let's take a close look at all the forms of tobacco, including the new fad of bidis and the resurgent use of cigars. They all have addictive levels of nicotine and deadly levels of carcinogens. It's time to put people's health ahead of tobacco company profits.  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this important legislation, to end the contradiction of using the tax code to continue to enrich U.S. tobacco companies, which export products that addict children abroad to nicotine and push them down a path to disease and death.  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation be printed in the Congressional Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3285       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. EXCLUSION OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS FROM QUALIFYING                    FOREIGN TRADE PROPERTY.       (a) In General.--Section 943(a)(3) of the Internal Revenue      Code of 1986 (relating to excluded property) is amended by      striking ``or'' at the end of subparagraph (D), by striking      the period at the end of subparagraph (E) and inserting ``,      and'', and by inserting after subparagraph (E) the following      new subparagraph:       ``(F) any tobacco products (as defined in section      5702(c)).''.       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section      shall take effect as if included in the amendment made by      section 3(b) of the FSC Repeal and Extraterritorial Income      Exclusion Act of 2000.                                 ______
