Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to one of labor's strongest advocates in our region. Joslyn ``Jos'' Williams has been President of the Metropolitan Washington Council, AFL-CIO, for 32 years, serving as an advocate for working men and women throughout Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia. Throughout that time, he has made history as the union's first African-American president.  Mr. Williams will be honored at the Maryland State and District of Columbia AFL-CIO annual ``Salute to Leadership'' dinner on June 20, and it is an honor that is much deserved and well earned. Having risen through the ranks of the union's leadership over the course of his career as an organizer and activist, he has applied his knowledge, care, and experience each day to making sure that the organization's members are not only well represented in discussions with private and public sector managers but that they have access to opportunities that provide pathways to middle-class success.  Mr. Williams came to this country as an immigrant while still a teenager, arriving from Jamaica with the goal of pursuing his American Dream. After working for the Library of Congress and becoming active in his local chapter of the American Federation of Government Employees, Mr. Williams realized that his calling was to make sure that his fellow workers could pursue their American Dreams as well. Thanks to his leadership, membership in his local chapter grew from 100 to 600 members over the course of just two years.  Today, Mr. Williams oversees an organization that is 150,000-workers strong and that plays an important role in the life of the National Capital Region. He has fought for fair pay, safe working conditions, and access to affordable health care and secure retirement savings. His work has surely helped--and continues to help--so many workers and their families participate in growing our economy and strengthening our region's communities.  I hope my colleagues will join me in congratulating Mr. Williams on this well deserved honor, and I thank him for his service to workers in Maryland's Fifth District and throughout our region.                          ____________________
