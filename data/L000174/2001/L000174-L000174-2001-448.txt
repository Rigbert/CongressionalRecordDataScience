President, I am pleased to introduce with Senators Lieberman and Levin the Anti-Atrocity Alien Deportation Act of 2001. I introduced similar legislation in the last Congress, and was pleased when the proposal garnered bipartisan support in both the House and the Senate. The measure was introduced in the last Congress by Representatives Foley, Franks and Ackerman as H.R. 2642 and H.R. 3058, and has again been introduced on April 4, 2001, by Representatives Foley and Ackerman as H.R. 1449. Moreover, the legislation passed the Senate, on November 5, 1999, as part of the Hatch-Leahy ``Denying Safe Havens to Internationals and War Criminals Act,'' S. 1754, but unfortunately was not acted on by the House. The problem of human rights abusers seeking and obtaining refuge in this country is real, and requires an effective response with the legal and enforcement changes proposed in this legislation. The loss last week by the United States of its seat on the U.N. Human Rights Commission is highly embarrassing and unfortunate, but by ensuring that our country is no safe haven for human rights abusers, we can lead the world by our actions.  War criminals and human rights abusers have used loopholes in current law to enter and remain in this country. I have been appalled that this country has become a safe haven for those who exercised power in foreign countries to terrorize, rape, murder and torture innocent civilians. For example, three Ethiopian refugees proved in an American court that Kelbessa Negewo, a former senior government official in Ethiopia engaged in numerous acts of torture and human rights abuses against them in the late 1970's when they lived in that country. The court's descriptions of the abuse are chilling, and included whipping a naked woman with a wire for hours and threatening her with death in the presence of several men. The court's award of compensatory and punitive damages in the amount of $1,500,000 to the plaintiffs was subsequently affirmed by an appellate court. See Abebe-Jira v. Negewo, 72 F.3d 844 (11th Cir. 1996). Yet, while Negewo's case was on appeal, the Immigration and Naturalization Service granted him citizenship.  As Professor William Aceves of California Western School of Law has noted, this case reveals ``a glaring and troubling limitation in current immigration law and practice. This case is not unique. Other aliens who have committed gross human rights violations have also gained entry into the United States and been granted immigration relief.'' 20 Mich. J. Int'l.L. at 657. In fact, the Center for Justice and Accountability, a San Francisco human rights group, has identified approximately sixty suspected human rights violators now living in the United States.  Unfortunately, criminals who wielded machetes and guns against innocent civilians in countries like Haiti, Chile, Yugoslavia and Rwanda have been able to gain entry to the United States through the same doors that we have opened to deserving refugees. We need to lock that door to those human rights abusers who seek a safe haven in the United States. To those human rights abusers who are already here, we should promptly show them the door out.  We have unwittingly sheltered the oppressors along with the oppressed for too long. We should not let this situation continue. We waited too long after the last world war to focus prosecutorial resources and attention on Nazi war criminals who entered this country on false pretenses, or worse, with the collusion of American intelligence agencies. Last month, thousands of declassified CIA documents were made public, as a result of the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act that I was proud help enact in 1998, and made clear the extent that United States relied on and helped Nazi war criminals. As Eli M. Rosenbaum, the head of the Justice Department's Office of Special Investigations, noted, ``These files demonstrate that the real winners of the Cold War were Nazi criminals.'' We should not repeat that mistake for other aliens who engaged in human rights abuses before coming to the United States. We need to focus the attention of our law enforcement investigators to prosecute and deport those who have committed atrocities abroad and who now enjoy safe harbor in the United States.  When I first introduced this bill in 1999, the Pulitzer prize-winning paper, the Rutland Herald, opined on October 31, 1999, that:       For the U.S. commitment to human rights to mean anything,      U.S. policies must be strong and consistent. It is not enough      to denounce war crimes in Bosnia and Kosovo or elsewhere and      then wink as the perpetrators of torture and mass murder slip      across the border to find a home in America.  The Clinton Administration recognized the deficiencies in our laws. One Clinton Administration witness testified in February, 2000:       Right now, only three types of human rights abuse could      prevent someone from entering or remaining in the United      States. The types of prohibited conduct include: (1)      genocide; (2) particularly severe violations of religious      freedom; and (3) Nazi persecutions. Even these types of      conduct are narrowly defined.  Hearing on H.R. 3058, ``Anti-Atrocity Alien Deportation Act,'' before the Subcomm. on Immigration and Claims of the House Comm. On the Judiciary, 106th Cong., 2d Sess., Feb. 17, 2000 (Statement of James E. Costello, Associate Deputy Attorney General).  The Anti-Atrocity Alien Deportation Act closes these loopholes. The Immigration and Nationality Act, INA, currently provides that (i) participants in Nazi persecutions during the time period from March 23, 1933 to May 8, 1945, (ii) aliens who engaged in genocide, and (iii) aliens who committed particularly severe violations of religious freedom, are inadmissable to the United States and deportable. See 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1182(a)(2)(G) & (3)(E) and Sec. 1227(a)(4)(D). The Justice Department's specialized OSI unit is authorized under a 1979 Attorney General order to investigate only Nazi war criminals, not any other human rights abuser. The bill would expand the grounds for inadmissibility and deportation to (1) add new bars for aliens who have engaged in acts, outside the United States, of ``torture'' and ``extrajudicial killing'' and (2) remove limitations on the current bases for ``genocide'' and ``particularly severe violations of religious freedom.''  The definitions for the new bases of ``torture'' and ``extrajudicial killing'' are derived from the Torture Victim Protection Act, which implemented the United Nations' ``Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.'' These definitions are therefore already sanctioned by the Congress. The bill incorporates the definition of ``torture'' codified in the federal criminal code, 18 U.S.C. Sec.  2340, which prohibits:       an act committed by a person acting under the color of law      specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental      pain or suffering (other than pain or suffering incidental to      lawful sanctions) upon another person within his custody or      physical control. 18 U.S.C. Sec.  2340(1).  ``Severe mental pain or suffering'' is further defined to mean:       prolonged mental harm caused by or resulting from: (A) the      intentional infliction or threatened infliction of severe      physical pain or suffering; (B) the administration or      application, or threatened administration or application, of      mind-altering substances or other procedures calculated to      disrupt profoundly the senses or personality; and (C) the      threat of imminent death; or (D) the threat that another      person will imminently be subjected to death, severe physical      pain or suffering, or the administration or application of      mind-altering substances or other procedures calculated to      disrupt profoundly the senses or personality. 18 U.S.C. Sec.       2340(2).  The Torture Victim Protection Act also included a definition for ``extrajudicial killing.'' Specifically, this law establishes civil liability for wrongful death against any person ``who, under actual or apparent authority, or color of law, of any foreign nation . . . subjects an individual to extrajudicial killing,'' which is defined to mean ``a deliberated killing not authorized by a previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples. Such term, however, does not include any such killing that, under international law, is lawfully carried out under the authority of a foreign nation.''  The bill would not only add the new grounds for inadmissibility and deportation, it would expand two of the current grounds. First, the current bar to aliens who have ``engaged in genocide'' defines that term by reference to the ``genocide'' definition in the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)(E)(ii). For clarity and consistency, the bill would substitute instead the definition in the federal criminal code, 18 U.S.C. Sec.  1091(a), which was adopted pursuant to the U.S. obligations under the Genocide Convention. The bill would also broaden the reach of the provision to apply not only to those who ``engaged in genocide,'' as in current law, but also to cover any alien who has ordered, incited, assisted or otherwise participated in genocide. This broader scope will ensure that the genocide provision addresses a more appropriate range of levels of complicity.  Second, the current bar to aliens who have committed ``particularly severe violations of religious freedom,'' as defined in the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998, IFRA, limits its application to foreign government officials who engaged in such conduct within the last 24 months, and also bars from admission the individual's spouse and children, if any. The bill would delete reference to prohibited conduct occurring within a 24-month period since this limitation is not consistent with the strong stance of the United States to promote religiousfreedom throughout the world. As Professor Aceves opines:       This provision is unduly restrictive . . . The 24-month      time limitation for this prohibition is also unnecessary. A      perpetrator of human rights atrocities should not be able to      seek absolution by merely waiting two years after the      commission of these acts. William J. Aceves, supra, 20 Mich.      J. Int'l L., at 683.  In addition, the bill would remove the current bar to admission for the spouse or children. This is a serious sanction that should not apply to individuals because of familial relationships that are not within an individual's control. None of the other grounds relating to serious human rights abuse prevent the spouse or child of an abuser from entering or remaining lawfully in the United States. Moreover, the purpose of these amendments is to make those who have participated in atrocities accountable for their actions. That purpose is not served by holding the family members of such individuals accountable for the offensive conduct over which they had no control.  Changing the law to address the problem of human rights abusers seeking entry and remaining in the United States is only part of the solution. We also need effective enforcement. As one expert noted:       [s]trong institutional mechanisms must be established to      implement this proposed legislation. At present, there does      not appear to be any agency within the Department of Justice      with the specific mandate of identifying, investigating and      prosecuting modern day perpetrators of human rights      atrocities. The importance of establishing a separate agency      for this function can be seen in the experiences of the      Office of Special Investigations. 20 Mich. J. Int'l L., at      689.  We need to update OSI's mission to ensure effective enforcement. Our country has long provided the template and moral leadership for dealing with Nazi war criminals. The Justice Department's specialized unit, OSI, which was created to hunt down, prosecute, and remove Nazi war criminals who had slipped into the United States among their victims under the Displaced Persons Act, is an example of effective enforcement. Since the OSI's inception in 1979, 61 Nazi persecutors have been stripped of U.S. citizenship, 49 such individuals have been removed from the United States, and more than 150 have been denied entry.  OSI was created almost 35 years after the end of World War II and it remains authorized only to track Nazi war criminals. Specifically, when Attorney General Civiletti established OSI within the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice, that office was directed to conduct all ``investigative and litigation activities involving individuals, who prior to and during World War II, under the supervision of or in association with the Nazi government of Germany, its allies, and other affiliated [sic] governments, are alleged to have ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise participated in the persecution of any person because of race, religion, national origin, or political opinion.'' (Attorney Gen. Order No. 851-79). The OSI's mission continues to be limited by that Attorney General Order.  Little is being done about the new generation of international human rights abusers and war criminals living among us, and these delays are costly. As any prosecutor, or, in my case, former prosecutor, knows instinctively, such delays make documentary and testimonial evidence more difficult to obtain. Stale cases are the hardest to make. Since I introduced this bill in the last Congress, there have been no further developments in the Kelbessa Negewo case, he still remains living in Atlanta. In addition, there has been no action taken on Carlos Eugenio Vides Casanova, the former head of the Salvadoran National Guard, a unit whose members kidnaped, raped, and murdered four American churchwomen during the El Salvadoran civil war. Vides Casanova remains in the United States.  We should not repeat the mistake of waiting decades before tracking down war criminals and human rights abusers who have settled in this country. War criminals should find no sanctuary in loopholes in our current immigration policies and enforcement. No war criminal should ever come to believe that he is going to find safe harbor in the United States.  The Anti-Atrocity Alien Deportation Act would amend the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. Sec.  1103, by directing the Attorney General to establish an Office of Special Investigations (OSI) within the Department of Justice with authorization to investigate, remove, denaturalize, prosecute or extradite any alien who has participated in Nazi persecution, torture, extrajudicial killing or genocide abroad. Not only would the bill provide statutory authorization for Office of Special Investigation, it would also expand its jurisdiction to deal with any alien who participated in torture, extrajudicial killing and genocide abroad, not just Nazis.  The success of OSI in hunting Nazi war criminals demonstrates the effectiveness of centralized resources and expertise in these cases. OSI has worked, and it is time to update its mission. The knowledge of the people, politics and pathologies of particular regimes engaged in genocide and human rights abuses is often necessary for effective prosecutions of these cases and may best be accomplished by the concentrated efforts of a single office, rather than in piecemeal litigation around the country or in offices that have more diverse missions.  The bill directs the Attorney General, in determining what action to take against a human rights abuser seeking entry into or found within the United States, to consider whether a prosecution should be brought under U.S. law or whether the alien should be deported to a country willing to undertake such a prosecution. As one human rights expert has noted:       The justifiable outrage felt by many when it is discovered      that serious human rights abusers have found their way into      the United States may lead well-meaning people to call for      their immediate expulsion. Such individuals certainly should      not be enjoying the good life America has to offer. But when      we ask the question ``where should they be?'' the answer is      clear: they should be in the dock. That is the essence of      accountability, and it should be the central goal of any      scheme to penalize human rights abusers.  Hearing on H.R. 5238, ``Serious Human Rights Abusers Accountability Act,'' before the Subcomm. on Immigration and Claims of the House Comm. On the Judiciary, 106th Cong., 2d Sess., Sept. 28, 2000 (Statement of Elisa Massimino, Director, Washington Office, Lawyers Committee For Human Rights).  I appreciate that this part of the legislation has proven controversial within the Department of Justice, but others have concurred in my judgment that the OSI is an appropriate component of the Department to address the new responsibilities proposed in the bill. Professor Aceves, who has studied these matters extensively, has concluded that OSI's ``methodology for pursuing Nazi war criminals can be applied with equal rigor to other perpetrators of human rights violations. As the number of Nazi war criminals inevitably declines, the OSI can begin to enforce U.S. immigration laws against perpetrators of genocide and other gross violations of human rights.'' 20 Mich. J. Int'l. 657.  Similarly, the Rutland Herald noted that the INS has never deported an immigrant on the basis of human rights abuses, by contrast to OSI's active deportations of ex-Nazis, while maintaining a list of 60,000 suspected war criminals with the aim of barring them from entry. Based on this record, the Rutland Herald concluded that the legislation correctly looks to OSI to carry out the additional responsibilities called for in the bill, noting that:       It resolves a turf war between the INS and the OSI in favor      of the OSI, which is as it should be. The victims of human      rights abuses are often victimized again when, seeking refuge      in the United States, they are confronted by the draconian      policies of the INS. It's a better idea to give the job of      finding war criminals to the office that has shown it knows      how to do the job.  Unquestionably, the need to bring Nazi war criminals to justice remains a matter of great importance. Funds would not be diverted from the OSI's current mission. Additional resources are authorized in the bill for OSI's expanded duties.  Finally, the bill directs the Attorney General to report to the Judiciary Committees of the Senate and the House on implementation of the new requirements in the bill, including procedures for referral of matters to OSI, any revisions made to INS forms to reflect amendments made by the bill, and the procedures developed, with adequate due process protection, to obtain sufficient evidence and determine whether an alien is deemed inadmissible under the bill.  We must honor and respect the unique experiences of those who were victims in the darkest moment in world history. We may help honor the memories of the victims of the Holocaust by pursuing all human rights abusers and war criminals who enter our country. By so doing, the United States can provide moral leadership and show that we will not tolerate perpetrators of genocide, extrajudicial killing and torture, least of all here.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a sectional analysis be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 864       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

(a) Section 212(a)(2)(G) of the Immigration and Nationality      Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(2)(G)) is amended to read as follows:       ``(G) Foreign government officials who have committed      particularly severe violations of religious freedom.--Any      alien who, while serving as a foreign government official,      was responsible for or directly carried out, at any time,      particularly severe violations of religious freedom, as      defined in section 3 of the International Religious Freedom      Act of 1998, are inadmissible.''.

Sec. 2340, and extrajudicial killing, as defined in      the Torture Victim Protection Act, abroad, as well as expand      the scope of the current prohibitions on aliens who have      engaged in genocide and particularly severe violations of      religious freedom;       Amend the INA to make clear that aliens who have committed      torture, extrajudicial killing or particularly severe      violations of religious freedom abroad do not have ``good      moral character'' and cannot qualify to become U.S. citizens      or for other immigration benefits;       Direct the Attorney General to establish the Office of      Special Investigation (OSI) within the Criminal Division and      expand the OSI's authority to investigate, remove,      denaturalize, prosecute, or extradite any alien who      participated in torture, genocide and extrajudicial killing      abroad--not just Nazi war criminals; and       Direct the Attorney General, in consultation with the INS      Commissioner, to report to the Judiciary Committees of the      Senate and House of Representatives on implementation of      procedures to refer matters to OSI, revise INS forms, and      procedures to obtain adequate evidence to develop ``watch      lists'' of aliens deemed inadmissible under the bill.                          sec. 1. short title       The bill may be cited as the ``Anti-Atrocity Alien      Deportation Act of 2001.'' sec. 2. inadmissibility and removability of aliens who have committed             acts of torture or extrajudicial killing abroad       Currently, the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA)      provides that (i) participants in Nazi persecutions during      the time period from March 23, 1933 to May 8, 1945, and (ii)      aliens who engaged in genocide, are inadmissible to the      United States. See 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1182(a)(3)(E)(i)&(ii).      Current law also provides that aliens who have participated      in Nazi persecutions or engaged in genocide are deportable.      See Sec. 1227(a)(4)(D). The bill would amend these sections      of the Immigration and Nationality Act by expanding the      grounds for inadmissibility and deportation to cover aliens      who have committed, ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise      participated in the commission of acts of torture or      extrajudicial killing abroad and clarify and expand the scope      of the genocide bar.       Subsection (a) would first amend the definition of      ``genocide'' in clause (ii) of section 212(a)(3) of the INA,      8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)(E)(ii). Currently, the ground of      inadmissibility relating to genocide refers to the definition      in the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the      Crime of Genocide. Article III of that Convention punishes      genocide, the conspiracy to commit genocide, direct and      public incitement to commit genocide, attempts to commit      genocide, and complicity in genocide. The bill would modify      the definition to refer instead to the ``genocide''      definition in section 1091(a) of title 18, United States      Code, which was adopted to implement United States      obligations under the Convention and also prohibits attempts      and conspiracies to commit genocide.       Specifically, section 1091(a) defines genocide as      ``whoever, whether in time of peace or in time of war, . . .      with the specific intent to destroy, in whole or in      substantial part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious      group as such: (1) kills members of that group; (2) causes      serious bodily injury to members of that group; (3) causes      the permanent impairment of the mental faculties of members      of the group through drugs, torture, or similar techniques;      (4) subjects the group to conditions of life that are      intended to cause the physical destruction of the group in      whole or in part; (5) imposes measures intended to prevent      births within the group; or (6) transfers by force children      of the group to another group.'' This definition includes      genocide by public or private individuals in times of peace      or war. While the federal criminal statute is limited to      those offenses committed within the United States or      offenders who are U.S. nationals, see 18 U.S.C. 1091(d), the      grounds for inadmissibility in the bill would apply to such      offenses committed outside the United States that would      otherwise be a crime if committed within the United States or      by a U.S. national.       In addition, the bill would broaden the reach of the      inadmissibility bar to apply not only to those who ``engaged      in genocide,'' as in current law, but also to cover any alien      who has ordered, incited, assisted or otherwise participated      in genocide abroad. This broader scope will ensure that the      genocide provision addresses a more appropriate range of      levels of complicity.       Second, subsection (a) would add a new clause to 8 U.S.C.      Sec. 1182(a)(3)(E) that would trigger operation of the      inadmissibility ground if an alien has ``committed, ordered,      incited, assisted, or otherwise participated in'' acts of      torture, as defined in section 2430 of title 18, United      States Code, or extrajudicial killings, as defined in section      3(a) the Torture Victim Protection Act. The statutory      language--``committed, ordered, incited, assisted, or      otherwise participated in''--is intended to reach the      behavior of persons directly or personally associated with      the covered acts. Attempts and conspiracies to commit these      crimes are encompassed in the ``otherwise participated in''      language. This language addresses an appropriate range of      levels of complicity for which aliens should be held      accountable, and has been the subject of extensive judicial      interpretation and construction. See Fedorenko v. United      States, 449 U.S. 490, 514 (1981); Kalejs v. INS, 10 F. 3d      441, 444 (7th Cir. 1993); U.S. v. Schmidt, 923 F. 2d 1253,      1257-59 (7th Cir. 1991); Kulle v. INS, 825 F. 2d 1188, 1192      (7th Cir. 1987).       The definitions of ``torture'' and ``extrajudicial      killing'' are contained in the Torture Victim Protection Act,      which served as the implementing legislation when the United      States joined the United Nations' ``Convention Against      Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or      Punishment.'' This Convention entered into force with respect      to the United States on November 20, 1992 and imposes an      affirmative duty on the United States to prosecute torturers      within its jurisdiction. The Torture Victim Protection Act      provides both criminal liability and civil liability for      persons who, acting outside the United States and under      actual or apparent authority, or color of law, of any      foreign nation, commit torture or extrajudicial killing.       The criminal provision passed as part of the Torture Victim      Protection Act defines ``torture'' to mean ``an act committed      by a person acting under the color of law specifically      intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or      suffering (other than pain or suffering incidental to lawful      sanctions) upon another person within his custody or physical      control.'' 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2340(1). ``Severe mental pain or      suffering'' is further defined to mean the ``prolonged mental      harm caused by or resulting from (A) the international      infliction or threatened infliction of severe physical pain      or suffering; (B) the administration or application, or      threatened administration or application, of mind-altering      substances or other procedures calculated to disrupt      profoundly the senses or personality; and (C) the threat of      imminent death; or (D) the threat that another person will      imminently be subjected to death, severe physical pain or      suffering, or the administration or application of mind-     altering substances or other procedures calculated to disrupt      profoundly the senses or personality.'' 18 U.S.C.      Sec. 2340(2).       The bill also incorporates the definition of      ``extrajudicial killing'' from section 3(a) of the Torture      Victim Protection Act. This law establishes civil liability      for wrongful death against any person ``who, under actual or      apparent authority, or color of law, of any foreign nation .      . . subjects an individual to extrajudicial killing,'' which      is defined to mean ``a deliberated killing not authorized by      a previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted      court affording all the judicial guarantees which are      recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples. Such term,      however, does not include any such killing that, under      international law, is lawfully carried out under the      authority of a foreign nation.''       Both definitions of ``torture'' and ``extrajudicial      killing'' require that the alien be acting under color of      law. A criminal conviction, criminal charge or a confession      are not required for an alien to be inadmissible or removable      under the new grounds added in this subsection of the bill.       The final paragraph in subsection (a) would modify the      subparagraph heading to clarify the expansion of the grounds      for in admissibility from ``participation in Nazi persecution      or genocide'' to cover ``torture or extrajudicial killing.''       Subsection (b) would amend section 237(a)(4)(D) of the INA,      8 U.S.C. Sec. 1227(a)(4)(D), which enumerates grounds for      deporting aliens who have been admitted into or are present      in the United States. The same conduct that would constitute      a basis of inadmissibility under subsection (a) is a ground      for deportability under this subsection of the bill. Under      current law, assisting in Nazi persecution and engaging in      genocide are already grounds for deportation. The bill would      provide that aliens who have committed any act of torture or      extrajudicial killing would also be subject to deportation.      In any deportation proceeding, the burden would remain on the      government to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the      alien's conduct brings the alien within a particular ground      of deportation.       Subsection (c) regarding the ``effective date'' clearly      states that these provisions apply to acts committed before,      on, or after the date this legislation is enacted. These      provisions apply to all cases after enactment, even where the      acts in question occurred or where adjudication procedures      within the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) or      the Executive Office of Immigration Review were initiated      prior to the time of enactment.    SEC. 3. INADMISSIBILITY AND REMOVABILITY OF FOREIGN GOVERNMENT     OFFICIALS WHO HAVE COMMITTED PARTICULARLY SEVERE VIOLATIONS OF                            RELIGIOUS FREEDOM       This section of the bill would amend section 212(a)(2)(G)      of the INA, 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1182(a)(2)(G), which was added as      part of the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998      (IFRA), to expand the grounds for inadmissibility and      removability of aliens who commit particularly severe      violations of religious freedom. Current law bars the      admission of an individual who, while serving as a foreign      government official, was responsible for or directly carried      out particularly severe violations of religious freedom      within the last 24 months. 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1182(c)(2)(G). The      existing provision also bars from admission the individual's      spouse and children, if any. ``Particularly severe violations      of religious freedom'' is defined in section 3 of IFRA to      mean ``systematic, ongoing, egregious violation of religious      freedom, including violations such as (a) torture or cruel,      inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment; (B) prolonged      detention without charges; (C) causing the disappearance of      persons or clandestine detention of those persons; or (D)      other flagrant denial of the right to life, liberty, or the      security of persons. While IRFA contains numerous provisions      to promote religious freedom and to prevent violations of      religious freedom throughout the world, including a wide      range of diplomatic sanctions and other formal expressions of      disapproval, section 212(a)(2)(G) is the only provision which      specifically targets individual abusers.       Subsection (a) would delete the 24-month restriction in      section 212(a)(2)(G) since it limits the accountability, for      purposes of admission, to a two-year period. This limitation      is not consistent with the strong stance of the United States      to promote religious freedom throughout the world.      Individuals who have committed particularly severe violations      of religious freedom should be held accountable for their      actions and should be admissible to the United States      regardless of when the conduct occurred.       In addition, this subsection would amend the law to remove      the current bar to admission for the spouse or children of a      foreign government official who has been involved in      particularly severe violations of religious freedom. The bar      of inadmissibility is a serious sanction that should not      apply to individuals because of familiar relationships that      are not within an individual's control. None of the other      grounds relating to serious human rights abuse prevent the      spouse or child of an abuser from entering or remaining      lawfully in the United States. Moreover, the purpose of these      amendments is to make those who have participated in      atrocities accountable for their actions. That purpose is not      served by holding the family members of such individuals      accountable for the offensive conduct over which they had no      control.       Subsection (b) would amend section 237(a)(4) of the INA, 8      U.S.C. Sec. 1227(A)(4), which enumerates grounds for      deporting aliens who have been admitted into or are present      in the United States, to add a new clause (E), which provides      for the deportation of aliens described in subsection (a) of      the bill.       The bill does not change the effective date for this      provision set forth in the original IFRA, which applies the      operation of the amendment to aliens ``seeking to enter the      United States on or after the date of the enactment of this      Act.''SEC. 4. BAR TO GOOD MORAL CHARACTER FOR ALIENS WHO HAVE COMMITTED ACTS  OF TORTURE, EXTRAJUDICIAL KILLINGS, OR SEVERE VIOLATIONS OF RELIGIOUS                                 FREEDOM.       This section of the bill would amend section 101(f) of the      INA, 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1101(f), which provides the current      definition of ``good moral character,'' to make clear that      aliens who have committed torture, extrajudicial killing--     severe violation of religious freedom abroad do not qualify.      Good moral character     is a prerequisite for certain forms of immigration relief,      including naturalization, cancellation of removal for      nonpermanent residents, and voluntary departure at the      conclusion of removal proceedings. Aliens who have committed      torture or extrajudicial killing, or severe violations of      religious freedom abroad cannot establish good moral      character. Accordingly, this amendment prevents aliens      covered by the amendments made in sections 2 and 3 of the      bill from becoming United States citizens or benefitting from      cancellation of removal or voluntary departure. Absent such      an amendment there is no statutory bar to naturalization for      aliens covered by the proposed new grounds for      inadmissibility and deportation.     SEC. 5. ESTABLISHMENT OF THE OFFICE OF SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS       Attorney General Civiletti established OSI in 1979 within      the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice,      consolidating within it all `investigative and litigation      activities involving individuals, who prior to and during      World War II, under the supervision of or in association with      the Nazi government of Germany, its allies, and other      affiliated [sic] governments, are alleged to have ordered,      incited, assisted, or otherwise participated in the      persecution of any person because of race, religion, national      origin, or political opinion.'' (Att'y Gen. Order No. 851-     79). The OSI's mission continues to be limited by that      Attorney General Order.       This section would amend the Immigration and Nationality      Act, 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1103, by directing the Attorney General to      establish an Office of Special Investigations within the      Department of Justice with authorization to investigate,      remove, denaturalize, prosecute or extradite any alien who      has participated in Nazi persecution, genocide, torture or      extrajudical killing abroad. This would expand OSI's current      authorized mission. In order to fulfill the United States'      obligation under the ``Convention Against Torture and Other      Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment'' to hold      accountable torturers found in this country, the bill      expressly directs the Department of Justice to consider the      availability of prosecution under United States laws for any      conduct that forms the basis for removal and      denaturalization. In addition, the Department is directed to      consider deportation to foreign jurisdictions that are      prepared to undertake such a prosecution. Statutory and      regulatory provisions to implement Article 3 of that      Convention Against Torture, which prohibits the removal of      any person to a country where he or she would be tortured,      may also be part of this consideration. Additional funds are      authorized for these expanded duties to ensure that OSI      fulfills its continuing obligations regarding Nazi war      criminals.              SEC. 6. REPORT OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ACT       This section of the bill would direct the Attorney General,      in consultations with the INS Commissioner to report within      six months on implementation of the Act, including procedures      for referral of matters to OSI, any revisions made to INS      forms to reflect amendments made by the bill, and the      procedures developed, with adequate due process protection,      to obtain sufficient evidence and determine whether an alien      is deemed inadmissible under the bill.                                 ______                                       By Mr. McCONNELL (for himself and Mr. Lieberman):  S. 865.

TITLE III--EFFECTIVE DATESec. 301. Effective date.            TITLE I--SMALL BUSINESS LAWSUIT ABUSE PROTECTION     SEC. 101. FINDINGS.       Congress finds that--       (1) the United States civil justice system is inefficient,      unpredictable, unfair, costly, and impedes competitiveness in      the marketplace for goods, services, business, and employees;       (2) the defects in the United States civil justice system      have a direct and undesirable effect on interstate commerce      by decreasing the availability of goods and services in      commerce;       (3) there is a need to restore rationality, certainty, and      fairness to the legal system;       (4) the spiralling costs of litigation and the magnitude      and unpredictability of punitive damage awards and      noneconomic damage awards have continued unabated for at      least the past 30 years;       (5) the Supreme Court of the United States has recognized      that a punitive damage award can be unconstitutional if the      award is grossly excessive in relation to the legitimate      interest of the government in the punishment and deterrence      of unlawful conduct;       (6) just as punitive damage awards can be grossly      excessive, so can it be grossly excessive in some      circumstances for a party to be held responsible under the      doctrine of joint and several liability for damages that      party did not cause;       (7) as a result of joint and several liability, entities      including small businesses are often brought into litigation      despite the fact that their conduct may have little or      nothing to do with the accident or transaction giving rise to      the lawsuit, and may therefore face increased and unjust      costs due to the possibility or result of unfair and      disproportionate damage awards;       (8) the costs imposed by the civil justice system on small      businesses are particularly acute, since small businesses      often lack the resources to bear those costs and to challenge      unwarranted lawsuits;       (9) due to high liability costs and unwarranted litigation      costs, small businesses face higher costs in purchasing      insurance through interstate insurance markets to cover their      activities;       (10) liability reform for small businesses will promote the      free flow of goods and services, lessen burdens on interstate      commerce, and decrease litigiousness; and       (11) legislation to address these concerns is an      appropriate exercise of the powers of Congress under clauses      3, 9, and 18 of section 8 of article I of the Constitution of      the United States, and the 14th amendment to the Constitution      of the United States.     SEC. 102. DEFINITIONS.       In this title:       (1) Crime of violence.--The term ``crime of violence'' has      the same meaning as in section 16 of title 18, United States      Code.

(3) Economic loss.--The term ``economic loss'' means any      pecuniary loss resulting from harm (including the loss of      earnings or other benefits related to employment, medical      expense loss, replacement services loss, loss due to death,      burial costs, and loss of business or employment      opportunities) to the extent recovery for such loss is      allowed under applicable State law.       (4) Harm.--The term ``harm'' means any physical injury,      illness, disease, or death or damage to property.       (5) Hate crime.--The term ``hate crime'' means a crime      described under section 1(b) of the Hate Crime Statistics Act      (28 U.S.C. 534 note).       (6) International terrorism.--The term ``international      terrorism'' has the same meaning as in section 2331 of title      18, United States Code.       (7) Noneconomic loss.--The term ``noneconomic loss'' means      loss for physical or emotional pain, suffering,      inconvenience, physical impairment, mental anguish,      disfigurement, loss of enjoyment of life, loss of society and      companionship, loss of consortium (other than loss of      domestic service), injury to reputation, or any other      nonpecuniary loss of any kind or nature.       (8) Person.--The term ``person'' means any individual,      corporation, company, association, firm, partnership,      society, joint stock company, or any other entity (including      any governmental entity).       (9) Punitive damages.--The term ``punitive damages'' means      damages awarded against any person or entity to punish or      deter such person, entity, or others from engaging in similar      behavior in the future. Such term does not include any civil      penalties, fines, or treble damages that are assessed or      enforced by an agency of State or Federal government pursuant      to a State or Federal statute.       (10) Small business.--       (A) In general.--The term ``small business'' means any      unincorporated business, or any partnership, corporation,      association, unit of local government, or organization that      has fewer than 25 full-time employees as determined on the      date the civil action involving the small business is filed.

SEC. 103. LIMITATION ON PUNITIVE DAMAGES FOR SMALL                    BUSINESSES.       (a) General Rule.--Except as provided in section 105, in      any civil action against a small business, punitive damages      may, to the extent permitted by applicable Federal or State      law, be awarded against the small business only if the      claimant establishes by clear and convincing evidence that      conduct carried out by that defendant with a conscious,      flagrant indifference to the rights or safety of others was      the proximate cause of the harm that is the subject of the      action.       (b) Limitation on Amount.--In any civil action against a      small business, punitive damages awarded against a small      business shall not exceed the lesser of--       (1) three times the total amount awarded to the claimant      for economic and noneconomic losses; or       (2) $250,000,     except that the court may make this subsection inapplicable      if the court finds that the plaintiff established by clear      and convincing evidence that the defendant acted with      specific intent to cause the type of harm for which the      action was brought.       (c) Application by the Court.--The limitation prescribed by      this section shall be applied by the court and shall not be      disclosed to the jury.     SEC. 104. LIMITATION ON JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY FOR                    NONECONOMIC LOSS FOR SMALL BUSINESSES.       (a) General Rule.--Except as provided in section 105, in      any civil action against a small business, the liability of      each defendant that is a small business, or the agent of a      small business, for noneconomic loss shall be determined in      accordance with subsection (b).       (b) Amount of Liability.--       (1) In general.--In any civil action described in      subsection (a)--       (A) each defendant described in that subsection shall be      liable only for the amount of noneconomic loss allocated to      that defendant in direct proportion to the percentage of      responsibility of that defendant (determined in accordance      with paragraph (2)) for the harm to the claimant with respect      to which that defendant is liable; and       (B) the court shall render a separate judgment against each      defendant described in that subsection in an amount      determined under subparagraph (A).

TITLE II--PRODUCT SELLER FAIR TREATMENT     SEC. 201. FINDINGS; PURPOSES.       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--       (1) although damage awards in product liability actions may      encourage the production of safer products, they may also      have a direct effect on interstate commerce and consumers of      the United States by increasing the cost of, and decreasing      the availability of, products;       (2) some of the rules of law governing product liability      actions are inconsistent within and among the States,      resulting in differences in State laws that may be      inequitable with respect to plaintiffs and defendants and may      impose burdens on interstate commerce;       (3) product liability awards may jeopardize the financial      well-being of individuals and industries, particularly the      small businesses of the United States;       (4) because the product liability laws of a State may have      adverse effects on consumers and businesses in many other      States, it is appropriate for the Federal Government to enact      national, uniform product liability laws that preempt State      laws; and       (5) under clause 3 of section 8 of article I of the United      States Constitution, it is the constitutional role of the      Federal Government to remove barriers to interstate commerce.       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title, based on the      powers of the United States under clause 3 of section 8 of      article I of the United States Constitution, are to promote      the free flow of goods and services and lessen the burdens on      interstate commerce, by--       (1) establishing certain uniform legal principles of      product liability that provide a fair balance among the      interests of all parties in the chain of production,      distribution, and use of products; and       (2) reducing the unacceptable costs and delays in product      liability actions caused by excessive litigation that harms      both plaintiffs and defendants.
