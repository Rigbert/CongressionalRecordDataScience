Speaker, let's hope we cannot go home, as we went home one recess, without doing Zika. Let's hope we certainly don't go home this recess without meeting this health crisis confronting our people. I am hopeful that the conference will come to agreement and we can pass it here on the floor. Hopefully, it will be at a level necessary to fund the work that needs to be done to respond to that.  The administration obviously has asked for $1.9 billion. The Senate was less; the House was less. Hopefully, we can come to a number that will be sufficient.  On the appropriations, the Financial Services bill will be on the floor. Obviously, there has been an announcement from the Rules Committee about when amendments will be received and the deadline for amendments, clearly indicating it would be a structured rule.                              {time}  1345  I would simply, again, express concerns. We had structured rules. The gentleman made that point, and I agree with that point. Very frankly, we went from open rules, which we started out with, to structured rules because, frankly, it was our perception that what we were having is filibuster by amendments--amendment after amendment after amendment--from your side of the aisle.  As the gentleman well knows, the amendment process largely has been more amendments from your side on your bills than from our side. So we clearly have not been doing that. The gentleman mentioned something about abusing the process. Frankly, the Speaker said that as well. I totally disagree with that, and I don't think there is any indication of that.  As I pointed out in the Energy and Water bill, a majority of your Members voted against your own bill, largely because it precluded discrimination against LGBT, which some people expressed that was the reason they voted against the bill, which I think is deeply unfortunate.  I quote from the Congressional Quarterly: ``The use of a so-called structured amendment rule abandons the open-ended process that GOP leaders had hoped to adopt as part of a return to `regular order' for appropriations bills.''  Again, we did that, but we didn't make a big thing about not doing it. We didn't say that it is the wrong thing to do and the House was acting out of regular order. We did structured rules so we could get the bills done on time. I, frankly, see no evidence--none, zero--that we have delayed consideration of these bills in any way. That was not true, I guarantee you, when I was majority leader of the House. The strategy on your side of the aisle--not you, but on your side of the aisle--was to delay these bills and undermine them.  Now, we had a lot of amendments offered by your side that we didn't like. It was very uncomfortable politically for a number of our people. But those amendments were provided for. And you are absolutely correct, when it got to a point where we obviously couldn't get the bills done in a timely fashion, we did go to a structured rule. So I don't criticize so much the fact that you are having structured amendments as I am the fact that you so complained about that not being regular order, and as soon as you had a difficult amendment, the LGBT discrimination amendment, thereafter, within days, you announced that, oh, no, you were going to go to a structured rule because the amendment process was being abused.  Now, I don't want to belabor the point any more than I have, but, again, on the Defense bill, we have seen an egregious, tragic, and horrific event. And, Mr. Speaker, this is on policy and what I firmly believe is a mistake that we are making. Mr. Sean Patrick Maloney of New York wanted to offer an amendment to say you shouldn't discriminate against citizens who are members of the LGBT community.  We saw a horrific event Sunday morning where a hate crime was committed, a hate crime directed at LGBT members and, perhaps as well, members of the Latino community by an American citizen--not by foreigners, not an international, however he may have been motivated. But it was clear the animus was a hate crime.  To the extent that we allow discrimination or do not prevent discrimination, I suggest respectfully that we, in a way, convey that it is okay to discriminate, it is okay to not like thesepeople, whoever these people are, whether they be African Americans, whether they be LGBT, whether they be people born in another land. It is not okay, and I deeply regret that we don't allow the House to work its will.  It did work its will. It adopted the Maloney amendment. Then that bill was rejected. You are right. We voted against it. We didn't like the bill from the very beginning. But presumably, it was going to pass but for the adoption of the Maloney amendment--with your votes because it was your bill, a majority bill. We always passed our bill, if you look at the Record, with our votes when we offered appropriations bills to the floor.  So I am hopeful that, notwithstanding the fact the rule is going to be structured, the Maloney amendment, which will speak to the very tragedy that occurred this past week--in part, not totally--will be allowed to be made in order so the House can loudly, clearly, and unequivocally say we do not believe in discrimination against fellow citizens because they are LGBT citizens.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend if he wants to make a comment.  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, and I understand the gentleman's concern. I want to make it a point to make sure that we do have voices heard and Members have amendments.  I went back and looked at the numbers. Now, I know there are hundreds of amendments because these bills go through subcommittee, then they go through full committee, and at all times, Members from both sides of the aisle can offer amendments.  When I looked at last year's bill, under an open process, open rule, we considered 65 amendments on DOD. Well, we just considered 75. So it is a very open, structured rule. I went back and thought, let me look at overall. Is there history within Congress that we could measure ourselves to?  Well, if I take as of May, the 114th Congress has considered 1,269 amendments overall on bills on the floor that have already gone through committee with the amendment process. In the 113th Congress, we were at 1,545.  Now, how do we measure up with other Congresses?  As you spoke, during the majority of the 111th Congress, they were at 778. I understand the concerns that you have, but I feel very comfortable in the fact that voices are being heard, and it is a very open, structured rule for amendments that could be offered.  Another point to make is we just passed an appropriations bill dealing with defense in a large, bipartisan manner. So I believe it is working. It is a process that we continue to work through, and I applaud the gentlemen on both sides of the aisle who worked to help us get a bill that just got finished in a bipartisan manner.  I do want to thank the gentleman for his work on our last bill. There have been nine bills on this floor that have dealt with terrorism, the radical Islam that is attacking this country and other countries, from the task force that we put together after the attacks in Paris, three of them dealing directly with the radicalization of Americans--persons born in America and radicalized--and the damage they cause. I mourn the loss of those Americans and pray for those families, for what they are going through today.  Now, those bills have sat in the Senate, but the House had taken the action. Today, we put those bills back together to make it easier on the Senate to be able to move those to the President's desk and signed into law.  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his help and work with that.
