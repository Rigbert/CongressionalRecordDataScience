 President, that is a big bundle of money going to Mr. Schwartz.  But I am not questioning whether he earned or deserved it.  Under Grassley-Boxer, he would get it.  I owe it to my colleague to point out that Mr. Schwartz is at the high end of the defense executive wage scale.  The others' salary and bonus packages are not quite so generous.  They ranged from about $1 million up to $2,500,000 in 1995.  Some are slightly lower.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to place the latest data on defense executive compensation in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             Reasonableness Test for Executive Compensation       Made in accordance with FAR 31-205-6, compensation for      personal services.       Considers same relevant factors, i.e., We check for      conformity with firms of: same size/industry/geographic area      and gov't/non-gov't business.       Includes all remuneration paid although elements also      individually assessed.       In sync with fact that FAR places burden of proof on      company (i.e., upon challenge, company must demonstrate      reasonableness).       On balance, experience has shown process to be generally      fair/not arbitrary.               basic audit steps for reasonableness test       1. Identify exec positions, comp amts, sales volume data, &      industry.       2. Use multiple survey sources to compare cash comp amts by      exec positions & gain mkt consensus of avg pay levels.       3. Calculate mkt avg of surveys with 10% range of      reasonableness.       4. Similarly judge reasonableness of other comp elements      (FRINGES/PERQS/LTIs).       5. Challenge amounts over 110% of ``market consensus''      survey averages.       6. Ask contractor to demonstrate reasonableness.       7. Evaluate contractor's justification/rebuttal including      proposed offsets.       8. Exit with contractor. Report results.                      exec comp surveys now in use       1.
