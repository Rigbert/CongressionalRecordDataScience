President, I rise today to introduce the Telephone Consumer Fraud Criminal Penalties Act of 1997. This measure will finally allow us to strike back against ``slamming,'' the practice of changing a telephone customer's long-distance carrier without the customer's knowledge or consent.  Slamming is the Federal Communications Commission's largest source of consumer complaints. In 1995 and 1996, more than one-third of the consumer complaints filed with the FCC's Common Carrier Bureau involved slamming. Last year 16,000 long-distance telephone consumers filed slamming complaints with the FCC. Since 1994, the number of slamming complaints has tripled. Yet, this is only the tip of the iceberg-- the Los Angeles Times reports that more than 1 million American telephone consumers have been slammed in the last 2 years.  In my home State of Illinois slamming was the No. 1 source of consumer complaints to the attorney general's office in 1995, and the No. 2 source of complaints in 1996. Slamming is obviously a serious problem that must be stopped.  Slamming is not merely an inconvenience or a nuisance. It is an act of fraud that costs long-distance telephone consumers millions of dollars a year and robs them of the right to contract. The Telephone Consumer Fraud Criminal Penalties Act will now ensure that slammers are held accountable for their fraudulent acts.  My measure will help stamp out slamming in two ways:  First, the Telephone Consumer Fraud Criminal Penalties Act creates criminal fines and jail time for repeat and willful slammers. Slamming takes choices away from consumers without their knowledge and distorts the long distance competitive market by rewarding companies that engage in fraud and misleading marketing practices. This measure's criminal penalties will guarantee that slammers can no longer act with impunity.  Second, the Telephone Consumer Fraud Criminal Penalties Act charges the Attorney General with the duty of conducting a study on the fraudulent and criminal behavior of telecommunications carriers and their agents in thesolicitation, marketing, and assignment of telecommunication services. The Attorney General's study will examine the fraudulent methods by which a telecommunications consumer's local, long distance, and other telecommunications services are changed without the consumers knowledge or consent. Through this study, Congress will gain a better understanding of how slammers operate. With this knowledge we will be able to draft a well crafted, all encompassing law that will finally put a lid on slamming.  Thank you, Mr. President, for the opportunity to introduce this important initiative. I hope my colleagues will join with me and support the Telephone Consumer Fraud Criminal Penalties Act in order to protect the rights of telephone consumers.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1340       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
