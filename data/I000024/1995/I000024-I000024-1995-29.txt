Keep in mind, this is the area where there has been fighting only in the last week, since this accord, if that is what it is, has been initialed.  The problem that I see over there is that there is no way to define who the other side is in Sarajevo. In Sarajevo, we have a convolution of parties that have come in and taken up the vacuum that has been left by the pounding of the various dwellings--the single-family dwellings and apartment buildings--in Sarajevo. The true inhabitants of those dwellings, those wonderful people who were there during the winter Olympics, are not there anymore, and the ones who are in there now are refugees. We do not know where they came from. We do not know if they are Serbs, Croatians, or any other, perhaps rogue, element. So it makes it that much more difficult.  Before yielding to the Senator from Georgia, let me just make one other comment about something that the Senator from Wyoming said. He used the term ``peacekeeping.'' I suggest to you now that they are not using peacekeeping. If there is ever a classic area for mission creep, this is it, because we have already crept from peacekeeping to peace implementation.  There is a big difference between peacekeeping and peace implementation. Peacekeeping is an assumption that there is peace to keep. We know there is not peace to keep. The President stood and he said the war is over, we are in a cease-fire. I stood in Tuzla and heard areas where the war is not over. There is firing up there. The President has not been there so perhaps he does not know and perhaps his advisers are not adequately advising.  Before we go back to a budget discussion, I want to state again what I stated yesterday. I may be one last Senator standing alone, but I am going to fight with every fiber of my being to stop the President from this obsession he has been living with for a year and a half, and that is to send American troops on the ground in Bosnia.                               Conclusion  I am very concerned with the discussion we were having earlier about what is happening in our budget battle. I guess I will sign off by stating at least my position.  We passed a good bill, the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, through this body and through the other body. It is one that is consistent with the mandates of the election of 1994, and I do believe that we have done a good job.  I certainly encourage the President to use the guidelines he committed to during the last CR--that is, a balanced budget in 7 years using real numbers--and come up with something that is acceptable.  At this point, I yield the floor.
