President, I rise today to recognize the Women's Business Development Center in their efforts to help female entrepreneurs establish their niche in the corporate world. The WBDC helps train and provide technical assistance to entrepreneurial women. These are the same women who own your neighborhood dry cleaner, run your child care center, and assist with your taxes.  Mr. President, I would like to call special attention to the women who have dedicated their time expanding child-care availability in Illinois. The WBDC sponsors the Child Care Business Initiative (CCBI) in cooperation with the Hull House Association that will provide information, resources, and guidance to women seeking entry into this important and growing industry. Over 250 women have utilized CCBI to gain critical business skills and key industry information about child care.  The Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs estimates that over 1,000 child care centers would need to be created to meet the projected demand for child care in Illinois alone. In light of the fact that only 20% of the 162,000 children who are in working families receive full-day, licensed child care, the role that the CCBI plays in helping women establish day care centers may have a significant impact on the availability and accessibility of child care in Illinois.  Again, I would like to take this time to commend the WBDC for creating and expanding opportunities for ambitious, women entrepreneurs.                          ____________________
