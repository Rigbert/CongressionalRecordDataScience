Chairman. I certainly meant not to impugn the other body with that statement, just to talk about the reality of what has happened to the Water Resources Development Act in the past.  But to continue, there are a number of Federal mandates that would be helpful to our local communities and our States if the Water Resources Development Act becomes law. But even more importantly, today in the United States of America, I think, is the fact that this bill represents a real jobs program. We can cut taxes for the wealthy people until the cows come home, and it is not going to put people back to work in the United States of America. But if we invest in infrastructure, it will. We know that the return on the dividend tax cut was 5 cents on the dollar. For every dollar we borrowed to cut dividend taxes, and we borrowed all that money, we are going to get 5 cents of stimulus to the economy; not a great investment. But for every dollar we borrow, and again we would have to borrow, to invest in water infrastructure, we are going to get $7, seven times over the impact on the economy. If we spend $1 billion under the Water Resources Development Act, we get about 45,000 jobs, real jobs, putting Americans back to work. This is an economic stimulus bill.  It is also a bill, as the gentleman who preceded me from Maryland discussed, that helps to deal with environmental problems, and also I want to recognize further that the Corps of Engineers often is subject to criticism, but there is an awful lot of good work that the Corps of Engineers does. I was just up in the mountains of my district last weekend seeing a project they are doing on a reservoir which is to help with fish runs, but also the dam itself was originally built to stop the annual flooding. So there are many good things that the Corps has done and many more that they will do if this legislation becomes law, if whoever else it is who is responsible for passing this somewhere else on Capitol Hill gets their act together.
