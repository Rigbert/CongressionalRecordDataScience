 H.R. 4646 was introduced by the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goode) to designate two areas in the George Washington National Forest in Virginia as wilderness. Both areas were recommended for wilderness studies in the George Washington National Forest plan completed in 1993.  I understand these are steep rugged areas, and that there is some concern that the Forest Service will continue to allow the use of motorized equipment, such as chainsaws or access by vehicles if it is necessary to fight fire or otherwise respond to emergencies. To address this concern, my colleague wisely included language stating the wilderness designation would not prevent firefighting companies or rescue squads from doing what is needed in emergency situations.  While I would prefer to retain this language, at the request of the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goode), I am offering a substitute amendment which removes this clause. He has received assurance from the Forest Service that such access is approved quickly when needed.  With this assurance, I ask support for the Virginia Wilderness Act under suspension of the rules.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
