Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time.  Mr. Speaker, the majority whip has the same tired bogus argument. Let me remind my Republican friends that from 1981 to 1987 the Senate was a Republican United States Senate. Let me remind my friends, if they have forgotten, that Ronald Reagan was President of the United States. Let me remind my colleagues further that not one bill was vetoed by Ronald Reagan and had his veto overridden to spend more money. Not one.  So get rid of this bogus argument as to who upped the debt of this Nation.
