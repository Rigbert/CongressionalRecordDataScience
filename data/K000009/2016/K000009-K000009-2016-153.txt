Speaker, to mark this first week of spring, this week I launched a Countdown to Earth Day 2016 across our congressional district, a district that encompasses the largest watershed in the entire Great Lakes, that flows into Lake Erie.  With greater rainfall causing rising nutrient runoff and with millions of people and livestock inhabiting this watershed, the persistent and growing challenge of algal blooms into Lake Erie threatens our precious freshwater supply.  This 21st century challenge is one we must meet. Thus, each week until Earth Day, April 22, I intend to focus on practical ways citizens can help to restore our ecosystem.  This week our focus is people helping pollinators, as pollinators--bees, butterflies, hummingbirds--are key to abundant plant growth in a region that needs less erosion, more wetland filtration, better land and plant management. And one of three foods you eat is dependent on pollinators.  Citizen plantings of staple garden standards such as parsley, dill, fennel, and other herbs contribute to pollinator support and ecosystem health. They are landing pads for the growth of caterpillars and other beneficial insects.  Everyone can help. For that reason, I encourage all Americans to get outside, enjoy the new spring, restore our environment, and plant helpful herbs in your gardens and properties to passon a healthier ecosystem to the next generation.                          ____________________
