President, I am not going to make a unanimous consent request. The Senator from Alaska doesn't care for that from a member of the committee. I would like to suggest to the Senator from South Dakota that I hope there could be a conversation involving our leader on the Appropriations Committee, Senator Byrd, and Senator Stevens, as well as Senator Frist. I hope we can propose specifically to begin consideration of the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations bill on Tuesday morning and bring it to a conclusion and completion as quickly as possible.  I ask the Senator from South Dakota if he would consider trying to convene such a conversation with his fellow Senators.
