Speaker, I would like entered into the Congressional Record an article about a wonderful man, Jim Findlay.              [From the Toledo Events Magazine, Jan. 2004]                           More to the Story            Entrepreneur adds two chapters to autobiography                           (By Sue Van Fleet)       If a life can be said to correspond to the pages in a book,      then it was time for Jim Findlay to add a few more chapters.       The well-known entrepreneur. and philanthropist had written      an autobiography in 2001. ``In the Company of Friends''      almost resembles a scrapbook, its text interspersed with      photos, letters, poems, quotes and newspaper clippings.       Findlay was the chairman and co-founder of Impact Products,      a business in Sylvania Township that provided supplies to the      sanitary maintenance industry. But only six months after the      book was printed, the company was sold to Park Avenue Equity      Partners. At the time of the sale, Impact Products had 160      employees and more than $40 million in sales.       ``Since the motivating purpose of the book was to create a      permanent record of the company, I felt it would be important      to talk about its sale'' Findlay said.       Impact had become an employee-owned company in 1986 with      the establishment of an ESOP (Employee Stock Ownership      Program). In March 1998, Findlay and his children sold their      remaining interest to the ESOP trust, making the employees      100 percent owners of the company.       ``Since I was leaving, they then had an opportunity to sell      and get a 15 percent premium over what we were valued at,''      Findlay said. ``So I encouraged them to do so, so they could      diversify their holdings rather than have it all in Impact,      which they did.'' Impact's employees averaged about $156,000      each from the sale, an amount that varied according to their      seniority.       ``So they did good, and they really should, because it was      the employees that made the company,'' Findlay said. ``I've      always felt very strongly that if you take care of the      employees, they'll take care of the customers. We've always      shared with them:'       The company brought in estate planning professionals and      investment firms for seminars and individual counseling      sessions to help them make good decisions regarding their      investments.       ``Over the next two weeks there were a lot of new cars in      the parking lot,'' Findlay said. ``And a lot of them were      able to buy homes and do some things that they weren't able      to before, so, I was very proud to be able to do that for my      employees.''       If he had to do it over again, would he have gone the ESOP      route? Findlay says yes, but with some reservations. For      instance, as the company's stock price increased, it created      a debt that would have to be paid to employees who decided to      tender their stock upon retiring or leaving the company.      Findlay also fretted that he was putting his employees at      excessive risk since so much of their personal investment was      tied up in one asset. Both these problems were eliminated      with the sale of the company to Park Avenue.       On the plus side, the ESOP gave every employee ownership in      the company, increasing their motivation and giving Findlay a      way of thanking them for their part in Impact's success. It      also made it possible for he and his wife, Celia, to      establish several trusts and provide gifts to charitable      organizations. ``So we were able to do some things while      we're living rather than do it all after we passed away,''      he said.       The second chapter Findlay added to the new edition is      titled ``The Rest of the Story.'' In it he details some of      the many awards that came his way in late 2001 and 2002. Both      Celia and Jim Findlay are graduates of the University of      Toledo, she in education and he in business. They have set up      scholarships at UT in both disciplines and have supported UT      with both time and money over the years.       In August 2001, the university named a building on its      Scott Park campus after them. The Findlay Athletic Complex      houses the baseball, softball and soccer facilities. Jim      Findlay was also awarded an honorary doctoral degree from UT      and received the Alumni Association's Gold `T' Award, which      recognizes alumni who have served the university and the      community.       He was especially touched when he was invited to the home      of UT President Dan Johnson and his wife, Elaine, following      the commencement ceremony in which he received his honorary      degree. ``How could an average student and an ordinary Joe be      the guest of a college president and receive from his hand      the highest honor the university can bestow?'' Findlay wrote      in his book. ``. . . Surrounded by the happy voices of a      company of friends, consisting of wife, children,      grandchildren and esteemed friends, I knew that whatever the      future might hold, I have known and experienced the deep joy      of blessedness.'' In October 2002, Findlay was honored by      manufacturer reps at the annual convention of the      International Sanitary Supply Association, receiving the      first ever Manufacturer Representative Distinguished Service      Award. Findlay has been a standout in terms of how he treats      his reps, notably having the only corporation in his industry      with a 401(k) plan for them.       ``My manufacturer reps are the ones who did the selling and      put us on the map,'' Findlay said. ``I've always felt      extremely close to them. If the law would have allowed us to      do so, I would have made them part of the ESOP''       Although Findlay has enjoyed a life full of many successes,      there were two things he didn't accomplish that he had wanted      to: the establishment of an Impact Charitable Foundation and      the creation of an Impact School of Continuing Education.      They were close to launching the school for their employees      when the company was sold. The foundation may yet come to      fruition as others work toward that end.       Seven years ago, Findlay started Findlay Business Partners      Ltd., which leases storage and office warehouses. With units      at 3315 Centennial Rd. and 3545 Silica Road, the business is      run by his children. His son Jon is president, while daughter      Sarah and son James Jr. are vice presidents.       When asked what he is most proud of, he mentions being able      to pass the business complex on to his children, as well as      the scholarships he has set up for business and education      students at UT and for minorities at Toledo Christian School.       Although much of the book details Findlay's business, it      also covers his childhood, time in the service, college      years, relationship with his church and UT; and family. At      the end of the book he provides an update on the health of      his wife, Celia, whom he calls the love of his life. She is      in the fifth round if chemotherapy for carcinoma of the      endometrium.       ``My greatest, most fervent hope for all families is that      each child will choose a lifetime partner as well as I did,''      he writes in the 16th chapter. He and the former UT      homecoming queen were wed on Jan. 28, 1949.       ``Relationships are what it's all about,'' Findlay said.      ``I don't need yachts or luxury cars--I don't live too high.      Success is about building relationships with people and being      fair in trying to treat everybody alike.''                          ____________________
