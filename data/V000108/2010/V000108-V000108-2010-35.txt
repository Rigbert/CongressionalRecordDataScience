Chair, it is with great appreciation that I rise in support of provisions contained within H.R. 5136, the Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011, relating to the procurement of steel armor plate and the definition of the term ``produced.''  Recently, the Department of Defense has implemented a regulation that allows the use of steel armor plate that is melted in foreign countries to be used in various defense applications, and I want to thank Chairman Skelton and Ranking Member McKeon for including language that specifies that this type of steel must be melted in the United States.  I was informed of the urgency of this issue during a Steel Caucus hearing in March of this year, when we discussed that a Department of Defense regulation now merely requires the finishing processes of armor plate manufacturing to take place domestically, which is contrary to over thirty-five years of precedent requiring melting processes to occur in the United States. After this hearing, Rep. Tim Murphy and I spearheaded a Steel Caucus letter to Secretary of Defense Gates, with 35 other Members of the Caucus signing the letter, which urged him to fully examine the implications of this regulation.  Steel armor plate plays a vital role in the protection of our troops and the defense of our nation, and the Specialty Metals Amendment, as originally included under the Berry Amendment in 1973, aims to ensure that American steel is used to protect our troops. The regulation amends the definition of produced under the Specialty Metals Amendment, and I am thoroughly concerned that this threatens the safety of our troops and the defense of our nation. Steel armor plate is used in Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles and MRAP All-Terrain Vehicles, and we must do everything possible to ensure that American made material is used in the production of these vehicles.  I understand that the House Armed Services Committee has closely followed this situation and has included report language in the past cautioning the Department of Defense on the implications of this regulation, and I applaud your continued efforts today on remedying this situation and protecting our national security and the American industrial base.                          ____________________
