I cannot recall a budget such as this budget, one that is so positive, that looks to the future with such optimism, a budget based on reality and on fiscal discipline.  Many politicians on Capitol Hill throw charges around about irresponsible people, favoring increased taxes, big government spending and new programs. This budget says to America, we can continue this economic expansion if we are careful, if we make sure we bring down this debt and do it in a responsible way, with a targeted investment, so America can grow, so our families are healthy, so our children are educated.  I believe the Senator from South Dakota has made that point again. I hope during the course of this debate on the budget our friends across the aisle will be as honest with this side as we will be with their side. We should accept the premise that we are not going to raid Social Security, that we are going to reduce the publicly held debt of this Nation to zero by 2015 while making sure Social Security and Medicare are strong for years to come.  Often our friends on the Republican side of the aisle do not want to mention the word ``Medicare.'' Yet for tens of millions of Americans, Medicare is crucial. We need to make it part of this debate as well.
