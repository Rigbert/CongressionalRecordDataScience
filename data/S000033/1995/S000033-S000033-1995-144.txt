 Chairman, all over this country we have elderly people who must in their homes, in order to survive, prevent their homes from becoming very, very cold or in fact very, very warm. The Chairman is aware that today on the front page of the Washington Post was an article about the suffering of so many people whose homes have overheated and, in fact, 200 deaths have occurred.  Mr. Chairman, I will ask for support of the Fox amendment, which will follow. This is a humane amendment and a cost-effective amendment. It makes no sense to waste energy and to increase human suffering.
