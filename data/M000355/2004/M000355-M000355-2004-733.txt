 President, tomorrow the Senate will resume consideration of H.R. 3108, the pensions bill. Under the previous order, at 2:30, the Senate will proceed to vote on or in relation to the Kyl amendment No. 2234.  It is our intention to complete action on this bill no later than Wednesday of this week. Again, I encourage all Members who wish to offer amendments to contact the bill managers so they can establish an order for amendment consideration. I also inform all Senators that additional rollcall votes should be anticipated during tomorrow's session.                          ____________________
