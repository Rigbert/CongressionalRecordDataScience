Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Texas for participating in this special order and say to her that I am very grateful for her involvement and for her leadership. I think the mail that you got from my State tends to dramatize to the Nation and to all of us that the scars and stains of racism are still deeply embedded in the American society. So we must still act. We must still speak. And thank you.
