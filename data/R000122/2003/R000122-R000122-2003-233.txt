``Ted'' Pusey, Liaison Officer in the Army's Office of the Chief of Legislative Liaison, who retired February 28. Colonel Pusey's career spans 27 years of Army service during which he has distinguished himself as a soldier, leader and friend of the United States Senate.  Born in Washington, DC in 1953, Lieutenant Colonel Pusey graduated from Wofford College in 1976 and was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Armor Branch of the US Army. During his career, he commanded at many levels and served in staff positions at the highest levels of the Army, always ably leading and training America's soldiers at home and overseas. His duty locations over the years included Fort Riley, KS; Mainz, Germany; Fort Leavenworth, KS, as the Executive officer for the Army's School of Advanced Military Studies; Fort Stewart, GA, with the 24th Mechanized Division as both a Battalion and Brigade Operations Officer, as a Battalion Executive Officer and as a Brigade Adjutant during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm ; and, finally, in the Pentagon and Senate in the Office of Legislative Liaison. Lieutenant Colonel Pusey also served as a Tactics instructor at the Royal Armoured Corps Centre in Bovington Camp, England. He has always been placed in positions of responsibility throughout his Army career.  Since October 1995, Ted Pusey has served with distinction in the Army's Office of Legislative Liaison where he has superbly represented the Army Chief of Staff and Secretary and promoted the interests of soldiers and civilians of the Army. His professionalism, mature judgment and inter-personal skills earned him the respect and confidence of the Members of Congress and Congressional staff with whom he worked. In over 8 years on Capitol Hill, Ted Pusey has been a true friend of not only the Army he loves, but also of the United States Senate and the Congress. Serving as the primary point of contact for all Senators, their staffs, and committees, he helped Congress understand Army policies, actions, operations and requirements in a prompt, coordinated and factual manner. Additionally, he provided invaluable assistance to Members and their staffs while planning, coordinating and accompanying Senate delegations traveling worldwide. His substantive knowledge of the key issues, insight, and ability to effectively advise senior members of the Army leadership directly contributed to the successful representation of the Army's interests before Congress.  Throughout his career, Ted Pusey has demonstrated his profound commitment to our Nation, his selfless service to the Army, and a deep concern for soldiers and their families. Committed to excellence, he has been a consummate professional who, in over 27 years of service, has personified those traits of courage, competency and integrity that our Nation has come to expect from its professional Army officers.  I ask that my colleagues join me in thanking LTC Ted Pusey for his honorable service to the Army of the United States. We wish him and his family all the best in the future.                          ____________________
