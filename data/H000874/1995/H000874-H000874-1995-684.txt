Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Mr. Frank R. Barnett, a former member, cofounder and director of the American Bar Association's Standing Committee on Law and National Security.  As a member of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, known as the Helsinki Commission, I, like Frank Barnett, have been outspoken in our opposition to human rights violations throughout the world. Frank Barnett not only opposed tyranny throughout the world, but he was a strong advocate in promoting freedom and democracy around the globe.  Mr. R. Daniel McMichael, of the Scaife Foundation in Pittsburgh, who joined in helping Frank Barnett create the Standing Committee on Law and National Security, provided a fitting tribute last year to Frank Barnett, which was printed in the January 1995 American Bar Association National Security Law Report. I am pleased to submit for my colleagues the [[Page E865]] story of Frank Barnett's struggle against tyranny and repression around the world, as well as his efforts in creating the Standing Committee on Law and National Security. I urge my colleagues to read this fitting tribute.   [From the American Bar Association National Security Law Report,                              January 1995]        Dan McMichael Salutes Frank Barnett at Conference Dinner       Simply put, Frank Rockwell Barnett hated tyranny. As      unusually modest and low key as he was about himself and in      his work with other people, whenever the subject of brutality      came up, his voice would take a steely edge and his eyes      would grow cold with a controlled kind of fury.       This was the dynamic that drove him through most of his      professional life, that gave him the tireless energy and      unfaltering will to help shape and build in this country new      institutions and new cadres of young people who understood      and were able to articulate the emerging role of the United      States in a troubled and turbulent world.       He did not come by this naturally. Such awareness of      tyranny and all that it stands for doesn't come naturally to      an of us (would that it did). We have to learn it either      directly or vicariously, and Frank learned it in a fairly      direct manner.       As an Elizabethan scholar and teacher-turned-machine-gunner      for the 69th Infantry Division that swept through Europe in      1945, Frank saw the dying embers--the legacy, if you will--of      fascism, a pretty good lesson in itself as regards tyranny.      But when his unit became the first to link up with the Red      Army at the Elbe River--where Frank served as the interpreter      between the forces and became involved in subsequent      logistical matters--an even more stark lesson in tyranny      emerged.       To quote The London Daily Telegraph of August 23 of last      year [1993]:       ``There [at the Elba River, Barnett] witnessed the      negotiations over the repatriation of Red Army POWs captured      by the Nazis, and was shocked to see weeping Russians hug the      ground and beg to remain with the Americans. Barnett's worse      fears were confirmed when the repatriated men were      immediately placed before a firing squad. The experience      marked him for life.''       Indeed it did. Shakespeare became a hobby--beloved, but      hobby all the same. Following the war there was, first,      serving on the staff of General Lucius Clay in the Military      Government of Berlin, and then off to Oxford as a Rhodes      Scholar to read philosophy, politics, geopolitics and      economics. Then back to Wabash College for a brief time--and      with the specter of weeping Russian soldiers still hovering      over him, Frank Barnett joined forces with former OSS      Director ``Wild Bill'' Donovan and William J. Casey in a      committee to assist anti-communist Russian escapees from      Berlin and Vienna.       It was also then that Mr. Smith Richardson, Sr., found      Frank and asked him to direct the programs of the then      Richardson Foundation, which enabled Frank to begin the      process of institutionalizing means to help raise the      literacy rate of lay, political and intellectual leaders of      the nation to understand better not only the issues of the      Cold War, but to become more familiar with the imperatives      for strong, consistent and rational leadership that had      fallen upon the United States in the aftermath of World War      II.       This was not an easy task, I can tell you, during the      1950's especially--given the McCarthy hearings and other too-     shrill voices that overreached in their zeal to ``protect      America.'' Not that they weren't--most of them--sincere. They      were for the most part. But they didn't have the hang of      things, and more harm was being done than good. Polarization      was occurring when consensus should have been taking place      between Democrats, Republicans, liberals and conservatives      about the realities of tyranny and oppression and how the      United States should handle itself globally with its vital      interests.       Nobody understood this dilemma better than Frank. By now it      is late 1956--and the two of us had met and had had long      talks in Chicago about these matters. By this time, Frank was      well along in trying to find ways to build the kind of      consensus the Nation needed if it was to upgrade the literacy      of its leaders--lay and professional alike--in understanding      more clearly the dynamics of geostrategic affairs in an      increasingly more complex and dangerous world (a factor which      still plagues us today in this post-Cold War era and for      which this conference is particularly well tailored).       By the early 1960s, Frank had established an impressive,      informed, ad hoc group of talented leaders--of respectable      diversity, especially for those days--who shared the same      concerns as did he. Among them; a patrician Richmond lawyer,      name of Lewis F. Powell, Jr., an up-and-coming Northern      Virginia lawyer, name of John O. Marsh, a brusque Navy JAG,      name of William Mott, and an indescribably gifted Chicago      lawyer, name of Morris I. Leibman.       There were, of course, quite a few others. But for      tonight's purpose, I'll just stick with these extraordinary      individuals, because they are the genesis of this Standing      Committee.       It was Justice-to-be Powell's idea, you see, in answer to      the critical question all of us had raised. How can we begin      to institutionalize the increasing of geopolitical literacy      in the United States in ways that are credible and have high      leverage?       The law.       An understanding of the rule of law has to be the      cornerstone if we are trying to frame geopolitical issues      that delineate tyranny and political freedom.       So--supplied by Frank Barnett's conceptual guidance--Lewis      Powell, with Morry at his side, took the matter to the ABA's      House of Delegates in 1963, as I remember. And after a bit of      spilled blood, what is now known as the ABA Standing      Committee on Law and National Security was founded, with      Frank as its first director. Frank subsequently founded the      National Strategy Information Center, but he remained active      with the Standing Committee until his death last year.       Those of you who follow the Committee's activities are well      aware of this continuing impact of its work across the land,      from high school classrooms and college campuses to      boardrooms and the halls of government--and on distant      battlefields. The Committee's leadership and composition have      been consistently high in integrity and sense of mission,      with people like John Norton, Moore, John Shenefield. Bob      Turner and really all members of the Committee.       Frank Barnett was a man of extraordinary courage and      vision, so that he was naturally attracted to others of      courage and vision and they to him--which is what has given      this Committee a life and vitality seldom seen elsewhere in      volunteer activities.       And courage and vision are here tonight, not just a      reference in paying tribute to Frank Barnett, but in the very      people you have selected and the issues they are addressing.      You have a tough, no fooling program. You have courageous and      highly talented people to lay it out.       It is the kind of fare that Frank Barnett would have      relished!                               ____________________
