 Mr. Speaker, it appears that no one is going to be able to tell me what the schedule is for the week to come. I will tell you that that is unfortunate.  I hope there is a schedule for the week to come because there is a lot to be done. We haven't finalized Zika. We passed a bill here which we think was inadequate.  We haven't dealt with Flint.  We need to pass Puerto Rico restructuring. I think they have made some progress on that. I congratulate the Speaker and the leader for facilitating that progress.  We don't have a voting rights bill scheduled. We need to do that.  There are a number of other serious pieces of legislation this House needs to consider. We are going to go out next week, and we will have no colloquy next week, Mr. Speaker. There will be no opportunity to discuss the schedule for, obviously, the break, and we will have no schedule for June or the weeks thereafter to do some of the serious business that confronts us and to help some of the people in this country who need help.  Having said that, Mr. Speaker, it is clear that nobody on the other side is going to have any response.  I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________
