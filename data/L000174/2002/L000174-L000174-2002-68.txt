President, I rise today to offer two pieces of legislation that would close a loophole that allows Federal regulators to overrule local officials on the building of cellular and broadcast towers. I am proud to be joined by Senator Jeffords, and Senator Murray in introducing legislation that will return decision-making power on the siting of towers to local communities.  The 1996 Telecommunications Act, which I opposed, contained a provision that allowed the Federal Communications Commission to preempt the decisions of local authorities. Over the last five years, a small loophole in the 1996 Act has spurred David versus Goliath battles across the country. Small communities that pride themselves in deciding what their towns will look like, now have few options when they try to stop or even negotiate a different site for broadcast or cellular towers. In Vermont, we have had several communities, Shelburne, Bethel, and Charlotte, run directly into this problem. What used to be their right to decide these decisions under zoning laws was up-ended.  These communities understand that there will be new towers. Demand for wireless services has skyrocketed over the last few years. The mountains and hills of Vermont make many Vermonters joke that cell phones are more useful as paper weights than as a way to talk with friends and family. However, Vermonters and people across the country do not believe that we have to sacrifice our scenic views and residential areas to ensure wireless coverage.  As a Vermonter, I do not want to wake up ten years from now and see my State turned into a pincushion of antennas and towers. That is why I am introducing these bills today. In a way, these bills are the culmination of a long battle with the Federal Communications Commission and in the courts to protect local authority.  In 1997, the Federal Communications Commission seized on the legislative loophole and proposed an expansive new rule to prevent State and local zoning laws from regulating the placement of cell and broadcast towers on the basis of environmental considerations, aviation safety, or other locally-determined matters. I fought this proposed rule and was joined by many Vermonters, Governor Dean, the Vermont Environmental Board, mayors, zoning officials and others. I also joined with many Vermonters and the rest of the Vermont Congressional Delegation to file an amicus brief in the Supreme Court, arguing that the preemption of local power to issue building permits was a clear violation of the 10th Amendment.  Unfortunately, that petition failed and now I am introducing legislation to fix a problem Congress created. The preemption of local authority should never have happened. Health, safety, and local land use issues should be left in the hands of those who know these issues best and can find a way to balance the needs of their community--the local zoning authorities.  In Vermont, we actually have a very well-tested and successful way of finding a balance between protecting the environment, the health and safety of Vermonters, and meeting economic demands. It's called Act 250. It was adopted over three decades ago when Vermonters realized that our cherished hillsides and New England towns could be overrun with homes. Now, the same realization has occurred with cell and broadcast towers.  My bill will not prohibit new towers. It will simply let local officials use their state and local protections, like Act 250, find the best solution for their community.  I think that many of my colleagues would agree that it is not too much to ask that telecommunication companies follow the zoning laws that apply to everyone else.  In fact, we already have ways to meet the needs of telecommunication companies and communities. There are other viable alterative communication technologies to massive towers. I have in the past discussed how PCS-Over-Cable and PCS-Over-Fiber technologies can provide digital cellular service using small antennas, eliminating the need for large towers. These small antennas can be attached to an existing telephone pole or lamp post. Not only is this technology more aesthetically pleasing, but because the companies do not need to buy land for these antennas, these delivery mechanisms are cheaper as well. We should allow local government to require the usage of these less intrusive technologies,  This is ultimately a very simple issue. It's an issue of local control. I believe that it is local authorities, not Federal regulators, who should determine when and where these structures are built. I urge my fellow Senators to join me in supporting this legislation. I ask unanimous consent that the text of these bills and two section-by-section analyses be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the additional material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3102       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION. 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Local Control of Broadcast      Towers Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:       (1) The placement, construction, and modification of      broadcast transmission facilities near residential      communities and facilities such as schools can greatly reduce      the value of residential properties, destroy the views from      properties, produce radio frequency interference, raise      concerns about potential long-term health effects of such      facilities, and reduce substantially the desire to live in      the areas of such facilities.       (2) States and local governments have traditionally      regulated development and should be able to exercise control      over the placement, construction, and modification of      broadcast transmission facilities through the use of zoning      and other land use regulations relating to the protection of      the environment, public health and safety, and the general      welfare of the community and the public.       (3) The Federal Communications Commission establishes      policies to govern interstate and international      communications by television, radio, wire, satellite and      cable. The Commission ensures compliance of such activities      with applicable Federal laws, including the National      Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the National Historic      Preservation Act, in its decision-making on such activities.       (4) The Commission defers to State and local authorities      which regulate the placement, construction, and modification      of broadcast transmission facilities through the use of      zoning, construction and building, and environmental and      safety regulations in order to protect the environment and      the health, safety, and general welfare of communities and      the public.       (5) On August 19, 1997, the Commission issued a proposed      rule, MM Docket No. 97-182, which would preempt the      application of most State and local zoning, environmental,      construction and building, and other regulations affecting      the placement, construction, and modification of broadcast      transmission facilities.       (6) The telecommunications industry and its experts should      be expected to have access to the best and most recent      technical information and should therefore be held to the      highest standards in terms of their representations,      assertions, and promises to governmental authorities.       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to confirm that      State and local governments are the appropriate entities--       (1) to regulate the placement, construction, and      modification of broadcast transmission facilities consistent      with State and local zoning, construction and building,      environmental, and land use regulations;       (2) to regulate the placement, construction, and      modification of broadcast transmission facilities so that      their placement, construction, or modification will not      interfere with the safe and efficient use of public airspace      or otherwise compromise or endanger the health, safety, and      general welfare of the public; and       (3) to hold accountable applicants for permits for the      placement, construction, or modification of broadcast      transmission facilities, and providers of services using such      facilities, for the truthfulness and accuracy of      representations and statements placed in the record of      hearings for such permits, licenses, or approvals.     SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON ADOPTION OF RULE REGARDING PREEMPTION                    OF STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITY OVER BROADCAST                    TRANSMISSION FACILITIES.       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Federal      Communications Commission shall not adopt as a final rule or      otherwise directly or indirectly implement any portion of the      proposed rule set forth in ``Preemption of State and Local      Zoning and Land Use Restrictions on Siting, Placement and      Construction of Broadcast Station Transmission Facilities'',      MM Docket No. 97-182, released August 19, 1997.     SEC. 4. AUTHORITY OVER PLACEMENT, CONSTRUCTION, AND                    MODIFICATION OF BROADCAST TRANSMISSION                    FACILITIES.       Part I of title III of the Communications Act of 1934 (47      U.S.C. 301 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the      following:     ``SEC. 340. STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITY OVER PLACEMENT,                    CONSTRUCTION, AND MODIFICATION OF BROADCAST                    TRANSMISSION FACILITIES.       ``(a) Authority To Require Least Intrusive Facilities.--       ``(1) In general.--A State or local government may deny an      application to place, construct, or modify broadcast      transmission facilities on the basis that alternative      technologies, delivery systems, or structures are capable of      delivering broadcast signals comparable to that proposed to      be delivered by such facilities in a manner that is less      intrusive to the community concerned than such facilities.       ``(2) Considerations.--In determining under paragraph (1)      the intrusiveness of technologies, delivery systems, or      structures for the transmission of broadcast signals, a State      or local government may consider the aesthetics of such      technologies, systems, or structures, the environmental      impact of such technologies, systems, or structures, and the      radio frequency interference or radiation emitted by such      technologies, systems, or structures.       ``(3) Burden of proof.--In any hearing for purposes of the      exercise of the authority in paragraph (1), the burden shall      be on the applicant.       ``(b) Radio Interference.--A State or local government may      regulate the location, height, or modification of broadcast      transmission facilities in order to address the effects of      radio frequency interference caused by such facilities on      local communities and the public.       ``(c) Authority To Require Studies and Documentation.--No      provision of this Act may be interpreted to prohibit a State      or local government from--       ``(1) requiring a person seeking authority to place,      construct, or modify broadcast transmission facilities to      produce--       ``(A) environmental, biological, and health studies,      engineering reports, or other documentation of the compliance      of such facilities with radio frequency exposure limits,      radio frequency interference impacts, and compliance with      applicable laws, rules, and regulations governing the effects      of such facilities on the environment, public health and      safety, and the general welfare of the community and the      public; and       ``(B) documentation of the compliance of such facilities      with applicable Federal, State, and local aviation safety      standards or aviation obstruction standards regarding objects      effecting navigable airspace; or       ``(2) refusing to grant authority to such person to place,      construct, or modify such facilities within the jurisdiction      of such government if such person fails to produce studies,      reports, or documentation required under paragraph (1).       ``(d) Construction.--Nothing in this section may be      construed to prohibit or otherwise limit the authority of a      State or local government to ensure compliance with or      otherwise enforce any statements, assertions, or      representations filed or submitted by or on behalf of an      applicant with the State or local government for authority to      place, construct, or modify broadcast transmission facilities      within the jurisdiction of the State or local government.       ``(e) Broadcast Transmission Facility Defined.--In this      section, the term `broadcast transmission facility' means the      equipment, or any portion thereof, with which a broadcaster      transmits and receives the radiofrequency waves that carry      the services of the broadcaster, regardless of whether the      equipment is sited on one or more towers or other structures      owned by a person or entity other than the broadcaster, and      includes the location of such equipment.''.  Section-by-Section Summary of Local Control of Broadcast Towers Act     SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.       The subtitle may be cited as the ``Local Control of      Broadcast Towers Act.''     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.       The bill finds that as the placement of broadcast towers or      other broadcast structures (heretofore referred to as      ``broadcast transmission facilities'') can reduce property      values, create radio frequency interference, and raise      potential long-term health concerns. It also finds that state      and local authorities should have the same control to      regulate the placement of broadcast transmission facilities      as they would with any other type of construction. The      purpose of the bill is to reinstate the right of state and      local governments to regulate the placement, construction,      and modification of these facilities.     SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON ADOPTION OF RULE REGARDING PREEMPTION                    OF STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITY OVER BROADCAST                    TRANSMISSION FACILITIES.       Section 3 prohibits the Federal Communications Commission      (FCC) from implementing ``Preemption of State and Local      Zoning and Land Use Restrictions on Siting, Placement and      Construction of Broadcast Station Transmission Facilities.''      This rule prevents state and local governments from      regulating the construction or modification of broadcast      transmission facilities.     SEC. 4. AUTHORITY OVER PLACEMENT, CONSTRUCTION, AND                    MODIFICATION OF BROADCAST TRANSMISSION                    FACILITIES.       Section 4 adds a new section to Part I of title III. It      gives state and local governments the power to deny      applications to place, construct, or modify broadcast      transmission facilities on the basis that less intrusive      technologies are available to provide comparable service.      Denials can be issued for reasons of aesthetics,      environmental impact, radio frequency interference, or      radiation emissions. Burden of proof lies with the applicant.       Section 4(b) also stipulates that state and local      governments are empowered to regulate the location, height,      or modification of broadcast transmission facilities to      reduce the effects of radio interference. State and local      governments may also require environmental, biological, and      health studies, engineering studies, or other comparable      documentation from any person seeking to build or modify a      broadcast transmission facility. In addition, state and local      governments may require documentation of compliance with any      applicable Federal, State, or local regulation regarding      aviation safety standards. Failure to provide such      documentation or studies is grounds for a denial to construct      or modify a facility.       Section 4(e) defines broadcast transmission facilities.                                S. 3103       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Local Control of Cellular      Towers Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:       (1) The placement, construction, and modification of      personal wireless services facilities (also known as wireless      facilities) near residential communities and facilities such      as schools can greatly reduce the value of residential      properties, destroy the views from properties, produce radio      frequency interference, raise concerns about potential long-     term health effects of such facilities, and reduce      substantially the desire to live in the areas of such      facilities.       (2) States and local governments have traditionally      regulated development and should be able to exercise control      over the placement, construction, and modification of      wireless facilities through the use of zoning and other land      use regulations relating to the protection of the      environment, public health and safety, and the general      welfare of the community and the public.       (3) The Federal Communications Commission establishes      policies to govern interstate and international      communications by television, radio, wire, satellite and      cable. The Commission ensures the compliance of such      activities with a variety of Federal laws, including the      National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the National      Historic Preservation Act, in its decision-making on such      activities.       (4) Under section 332(c)(7)(A) of the Communications Act of      1934 (47 U.S.C. 332(c)(7)(A)), the Commission defers to State      and local authorities that regulate the placement,      construction, and modification of wireless facilities through      the use of zoning and other land use regulations.       (5) Alternative technologies for the placement,      construction, and modification of wireless facilities may      meet the needs of a wireless services provider in a less      intrusive manner than the technologies proposed by the      wireless services provider, including the use of small towers      that do not require blinking aircraft safety lights, break      skylines, or protrude above tree canopies.       (6) It is in the interest of the Nation that the      requirements of the Commission with respect to the      application of State and local ordinances to the placement,      construction and modification of wireless facilities (for      example WT Docket No. 97-192, ET Docket No. 93-62, RM-8577,      and FCC 97-303, 62 F.R. 47960) be modified so as--       (A) to permit State and local governments to exercise their      zoning and other land use authorities to regulate the      placement, construction, and modification of such facilities;      and       (B) to place the burden of proof in civil actions, and in      actions before the Commission and State and local authorities      relating to the placement, construction, and modification of      such facilities, on the person that seeks to place,      construct, or modify such facilities.       (7) PCS-Over-Cable, PCS-Over-Fiber Optic, and satellite      telecommunications systems, including Low-Earth Orbit      satellites, offer a significant opportunity to provide so-     called ``911'' emergency telephone service throughout much of      the United States without unduly intruding into or effecting      the environment, public health and safety, and the general      welfare of the community and the public.       (8) The Federal Aviation Administration must rely upon      State and local governments to regulate the placement,      construction, and modification of telecommunications      facilities near airports or high-volume air traffic areas      such as corridors of airspace or commonly used flyways. The      proposed rules of the Commission to preempt State and local      zoning and other land-use regulations for the siting of such      facilities will have a serious negative impact on aviation      safety, airport capacity and investment, the efficient use of      navigable airspace, public health and safety, and the general      welfare of the community and the public.       (9) The telecommunications industry and its experts should      be expected to have access to the best and most recent      technical information and should therefore be held to the      highest standards in terms of their representations,      assertions, and promises to governmental authorities.       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:       (1) To repeal certain limitations on State and local      authority regarding the placement, construction, and      modification of personal wireless services facilities under      section 332(c)(7) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47      U.S.C. 332(c)(7)).       (2) To permit State and local governments--       (A) to regulate the placement, construction, or      modification of personal wireless services facilities with      respect to their impacts on land use, including radio      frequency interference and radio frequency radiation, in      order to protect the environment, public health and safety,      and the general welfare of the community and the public;       (B) to regulate the placement, construction, and      modification of personal wireless services facilities so that      they will not interfere with the safe and efficient use of      public airspace or otherwise compromise or endanger the      public health and safety and the general welfare of the      community and the public; and       (C) to hold accountable applicants for permits for the      placement, construction, or modification of personal wireless      services facilities, and providers of services using such      facilities, for the truthfulness and accuracy of      representations and statements placed in the record of      hearings for permits, licenses, or approvals for such      facilities.     SEC. 3. STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITY OVER PLACEMENT,                    CONSTRUCTION, AND MODIFICATION OF PERSONAL                    WIRELESS SERVICES FACILITIES       (a) Limitations on State and Local Regulation of      Facilities.--Subparagraph (B) of section 332(c)(7) of the      Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 332(c)(7)) is amended--       (1) by striking clause (iv);       (2) by redesignating clause (v) as clause (iv); and       (3) in clause (iv), as so redesignated--       (A) in the first sentence, by striking ``may, within 30      days'' and all that follows through the end of the sentence      and inserting ``may commence an action in any court of      competent jurisdiction. Such action shall be commenced within      30 days after such action or failure to act unless the State      concerned has established a different period for the      commencement of such action.''; and       (B) by striking the third sentence and inserting the      following: ``In any such action in which a person seeking to      place, construct, or modify a personal wireless services      facility is a party, such person shall bear the burden of      proof, regardless of who commences such action.''.       (b) Prohibition on Adoption of Rule Regarding Relief From      State and Local Regulation of Facilities.--Notwithstanding      any other provision of law, the Federal Communications      Commission shall not adopt as a final rule or otherwise      directly or indirectly implement any portion of the proposed      rule set forth in ``Procedures for Reviewing Requests for      Relief From State and Local Regulation Pursuant to Section      332(c)(7)(B)(v) of the Communications Act of 1934'', WT      Docket No. 97-192, released August 25, 1997.       (c) Authority Over Placement, Construction, and      Modification of Facilities.--Such section 332(c)(7) is      further amended--       (1) by redesignating subparagraph (C) as subparagraph (D);      and       (2) by inserting after subparagraph (B) the following new      subparagraph (C):       ``(C) Additional limitations.--       ``(i) Authority to require least intrusive facilities.--       ``(I) In general.--A State or local government may deny an      application to place, construct, or modify personal wireless      services facilities on the basis that alternative      technologies, delivery systems, or structures are capable of      delivering a personal wireless services signal comparable to      that proposed to be delivered by such facilities in a manner      that is less intrusive to the community concerned than such      facilities.       ``(II) Considerations.--In determining under subclause (I)      the intrusiveness of technologies, delivery systems, or      structures for personal wireless services facilities, a State      or local government may consider the aesthetics of such      technologies, systems, or structures, the environmental      impact of such technologies, systems, or structures, and the      radio frequency interference or radiation emitted by such      technologies, systems, or structures.       ``(III) Burden of proof.--In any hearing for purposes of      the exercise of the authority in subclause (I), the burden      shall be on the applicant.       ``(ii) Radio interference.--A State or local government may      regulate the location, height, or modification of personal      wireless services facilities in order to address the effects      of radio frequency interference caused by such facilities on      local communities and the public.       ``(iii) Authority to require studies and documentation.--No      provision of this Act may be interpreted to prohibit a State      or local government from--       ``(I) requiring a person seeking authority to place,      construct, or modify personal wireless services facilities to      produce--       ``(aa) environmental, biological, and health studies,      engineering reports, or other documentation of the compliance      of such facilities with radio frequency exposure limits,      radio frequency interference impacts, and compliance with      applicable laws, rules, and regulations governing the effects      of such facilities on the environment, public health and      safety, and the general welfare of the community and the      public; and       ``(bb) documentation of the compliance of such facilities      with applicable Federal, State, and local aviation safety      standards or aviation obstruction standards regarding objects      effecting navigable airspace; or       ``(II) refusing to grant authority to such person to place,      construct, or modify such facilities within the jurisdiction      of such government if such person fails to produce studies,      reports, or documentation required under subclause (I).       ``(iv) Construction.--Nothing in this subparagraph may be      construed to prohibit or otherwise limit the authority of a      State or local government to ensure compliance with or      otherwise enforce any statements, assertions, or      representations filed or submitted by or on behalf of an      applicant with the State or local government for authority to      place, construct, or modify personal wireless     services facilities within the jurisdiction of the State or      local government.''.   Section-by-Section Summary of Local Control of Cellular Towers Act     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       The subtitle may be cited as the ``Local Control of      Cellular Towers Act.''     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.       The bill finds that as the placement of cellular towers can      reduce property values, create radio frequency interference,      and raise potential long-term health concerns. It also finds      that state and local authorities should have the same control      to regulate the placement of cellular facilities as they      would with any other type of construction. The purpose of the      bill is to reinstate the right of state and local governments      to regulate the placement, construction, and modification of      these facilities.     SEC. 3. STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITY OVER PLACEMENT,                    CONSTRUCTION, AND MODIFICATION OF PERSONAL                    WIRELESS SERVICES FACILITIES.       This section of the bill amends title 47 of the U.S. Code.       Section 3(a) strikes 47 U.S.C. 332(c)(7), clause iv, which      prevented state and local governments from regulating the      placement, construction, or modification of personal wireless      service facilities on the basis of environmental effects of      radio frequency emissions. Clause v of the same section of      the Code is amended to allow States to determine the timeline      for any appeal of a State or local decision that adversely      affects a personal wireless service provider. A personal      wireless service provider is no longer allowed to make a      further appeal to the Federal Communications Commission      (FCC). Furthermore, the bill clarifies that the party that      wishes to build a personal wireless service facility bears      the burden of proof in any appeal of state or local law.       Section 3(b) prohibits the FCC from implementing      ``Procedures for Reviewing Requests for Relief from State and      Local Regulation Pursuant to Section 332(c)(7)(B)(v).'' This      rule stipulated the procedures for appealing state and local      regulations to the FCC.       Section 3(c) adds a new subparagraph (C) to Section      332(c)(7) to give State and local governments the power to      deny applications to place, construct, or modify personal      wireless service facilities on the basis that less intrusive      technologies are available that provide comparable service.      Denials can be issued for reasons of aesthetics,      environmental impact, radio frequency interference, or      radiation emissions.       Section 3(c) also stipulates that state and local      governments are empowered to regulate the location, height,      or modification of personal wireless service facilities to      reduce the effects of radio interference. State and local      governments may also require environmental, biological, and      health studies, engineering studies, or other comparable      documentation from any person seeking to build or modify a      personal wireless service facility. In addition, state and      local governments may require documentation of compliance      with any applicable Federal, State, or local regulation      regarding aviation safety standards. Failure to provide such      documentation or studies is grounds for a denial to construct      or modify a facility.
