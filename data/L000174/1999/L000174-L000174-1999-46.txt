President, I should note just on the bankruptcy bill, we are making more progress. This morning we were able to clear four more amendments. I understand there is a total of 31 amendments that been accepted to improve the Bankruptcy Reform Act. These are amendments that have been offered on both sides of the aisle.  I commend the distinguished deputy Democratic leader, the Senator from Nevada, Mr. Reid, for his help. He hasbeen, as I described him in the caucus, indefatigable in his efforts to move this through. He and I and the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Torricelli, and the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, and the Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch, have all worked to clear amendments or to set rollcalls on those we cannot clear.  I have urged Members to have short time agreements, and they have agreed to that. I think we have gone from some 300 or more potential amendments down to only a dozen or so, if that, that are remaining.  When you are dealing with a piece of legislation as complex as this, as important as this, when we are only 2 to 3 weeks before the end of this session--when we are only 2 to 3 weeks before the end of this session--I was hoping somebody would jump up and disagree on that ``2 to 3 weeks'' bit--or possibly a few days before the end of this session, it shows how well we have done.  But as I said earlier, before he came on the floor, I commend the Senator from Nevada, who has worked so hard to bring down those numbers on the amendments.  Frankly, I would like to see us wrap this up. I would like to go to Vermont.
