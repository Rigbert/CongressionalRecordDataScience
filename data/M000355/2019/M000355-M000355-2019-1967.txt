 President, before I begin, I spoke yesterday about the evil of anti-Semitism and the recent disturbing invocation of anti-Semitic stereotypes by a Member of the House Democratic Conference. I took for granted, as a result, that the House Democrats would at least--at least--make good on their plans to symbolically condemn anti-Semitism.  Even as I called for the House Democrats to do more and pass the substantive foreign policy legislation the Senate sent them weeks ago, I at least assumed a few pages of symbolism was not too much to ask for, but alas, I spoke too soon. The House has put off consideration of a resolution to condemn anti-Semitism. Apparently, even nonbinding symbolism--this is all they were going to do--is too controversial within their own caucus. Let me say that again. Apparently, within the Speaker's new far-left Democratic majority, even a symbolic--symbolic--resolution condemning anti-Semitism seems to be a bridge too far.  Well, I expect I and other Members will have more to say on this subject, but for today I would let this speak for itself.                          ____________________
