President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee amendments be agreed to as original text, the Collins amendment, which is at the desk, be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read a third time and passed, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate, and that any statements related thereto be printed in the Record.
