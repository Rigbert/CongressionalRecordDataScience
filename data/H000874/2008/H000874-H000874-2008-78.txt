Speaker, Senator Moynihan once said, ``You are entitled to your own opinions, but you are not entitled to your own facts.''  The dominant political fact of the last 8 years has been Republican failure, serial governing malpractice. This month, we will be holding them to account.  There ought to be a heavy cost for 2.5 million lost jobs; for 5 million more of our fellow citizens thrust into poverty; for stagnating wages; for skyrocketing costs of essentials; for 8.6 million more Americans uninsured; for surpluses turned into record deficits; for an America whose respect has been reduced around the world; for foreign borrowing that has exceeded the total racked up under the first 42 Presidents combined. All of that happened under the grip of Republican ideology. Eight years in the White House, 6 years with all the levers of power, and after all that, they suggest more of the same.  Every time they try to change the subject, every time they pretend to be agents of change, we will answer with the simple facts of failure. We have faith in the facts. We will stake an election on that faith. And when we win, we will govern secure in that faith.                          ____________________
