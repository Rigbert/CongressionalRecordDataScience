Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, we are hearing a lot about the increase of $600 million over what the Pentagon asked for, but I do not hear the other side responding to the fact that they did not fund the problem we have with 15,000 GI families on food stamps, living below the poverty level, living in unsafe conditions. They are not addressing that problem.  The committee dealt with it in a cursory manner. They recognized the problem. They said it should be dealt with. Then they said they could only afford 25 percent of the funds. With this amendment, we could afford more than 100 percent of the funds to bring our GI's and their families up above the poverty level.  It is a scandal, when the greatest Nation on Earth has members of its military and their families dependent upon food stamps, and living in unsafe and unwholesome conditions, and then we are going to ask those young men and women to go overseas and forget about the suffering of their families back home, forget about the food stamps, forget about the crummy place they are living.
