The amendment numbered 810 filed by Senator Sessions would eliminate the ability of States to align the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, SNAP, eligibility rules with the temporary assistance to needy families to reduce administrative costs and simply enrollment.  Since 2008, Vermont has used categorical eligibility to reach more households and more needy individuals by simplifying enrollment. Reducing administrative costs and simplifying paperwork should be a goal we all share for Federal programs. But by adopting this amendment, about 1 million low-income Americans would lose their benefits and many more families that are newly eligible during these difficult economic times would have their benefits delayed because of the increased complexity of the additional processing time for applications.  Low-income working families with children are the majority of those who would be affected by the elimination of categorical eligibility. Additionally, roughly 200,000 children in these families would lose access to free school meals.  Improving the error rate even further in the SNAP program is an issue that the Agriculture Committee is committed to addressing in the upcoming farm bill negotiations, and one that we have already heard to chairwoman of the Senate Agriculture Committee speak about this week. Eliminating State flexibility through categorical eligibility programs does not address error rates in any meaningful way. Supporters of this amendment cite limited examples as proof that categorical eligibility is at the root of erroneous enrollments in SNAP. But allowing millions to go hungry because of a few anecdotal stories is shortsighted at best.  The Senate Agriculture Committee, which I am proud to be a senior member of, will be looking for additional ways to improve SNAP in the coming months, but eliminating categorical eligibility as this amendment does is not the answer. I urge all Senators to oppose this amendment.
