Speaker, it is with great pride and honor that I pay tribute to an outstanding American, a true patriot, and a hero to his country, Spc. Greg Sanders. Spc. Sanders was killed in action on Monday, March 24, 2003 while serving in Operation Iraqi Freedom for the 3rd Infantry Division of the United States Army. He bravely sacrificed his life to ensure the safety of his fellow soldiers, the Iraqi people, and the very idea of freedom throughout the world. He will be remembered at a candlelight vigil in his hometown of Hobart, Indiana on Wednesday, April 2, 2003.  Greg Sanders was a native of Hobart and graduated from Hobart High School in May 2001, where he thrived both as a student and as an athlete. An honor roll student and member of the Hobart High School track team, Greg was also named co-captain of his high school cross country team, which advanced to the regional finals in each of his last two seasons. Greg's outstanding motivational skills and unmatched charisma helped mold him into a natural leader. His work ethic propelled him to great accomplishments, both academically and athletically. It was this same work ethic, coupled with his dedication to the United States, which led Greg to commit to the United States Army during his junior year at Hobart High School.  Mr. Speaker, after completing his high school career, Greg was sent to Fort Knox, Kentucky for a grueling basic training. Although the physical and mental demands were extremely difficult, Greg remained undeterred in his lifelong desire to serve in the military. The son of a Naval veteran, Greg understood the hardships of military life and accepted them with the courage and fortitude befitting a soldier dedicated to the defense of his country. After completing basic training, Greg moved with his wife, Ruthann, to Fort Stewart, Georgia, where she later gave birth to their daughter, Gwendolyn. It was from here that Greg Sanders's journey to Iraq began.  Spc. Sanders deployed for Kuwait on January 23, 2003 as part of the 3rd Battalion of the 69th Armored Regiment. His duty was to load the 120 mm cannon on the M-1 Abrams tank as the armored caravan stormed through southern Iraq, a duty he carried out bravely and successfully until a sniper prematurely took his life. Greg dreamed of dedicating his life to the military, and he honored that unit on March 24, 2003 by sacrificing himself to preserve the values he treasured.  Although it was his lifelong dream to serve his nation as a career soldier, nothing was more important to Greg Sanders than his family. He is survived by his wife and daughter, his mother, Leslie, and his three siblings, Dean, Clare, and Lauryn, as well as a nation and a community who will never forget the sacrifice that he made to protect our freedom. His father, Rich Sanders, was a Navy veteran who died of a heart attack at the young ageof 37, and Greg looked to him for guidance and advice while contemplating a career in the military. Greg remained close to his family until his death, and he will never be forgotten by those he left behind.  Mr. Speaker, at this time I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring the memory of Spc. Greg Sanders, and in sending our heartfelt condolences to his family. Greg is a hero, not only to his family and friends, but also to Northwest Indiana and to the United States of America. He fought bravely for the ideals of freedom, truth, and liberty, and as our nation mourns his loss, let us honor his life and his dedication to the service of his country.                          ____________________
