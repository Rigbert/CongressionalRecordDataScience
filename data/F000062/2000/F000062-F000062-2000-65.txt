 President, today, I am introducing legislation designed to eliminate injuries and deaths that result from crib accidents.  While there are strict guidelines on the manufacture and sale of new cribs, there are still 25 to 30 million unsafe cribs sold throughout the U.S. in ``secondary markets,'' such as thrift stores and resale furniture stores. These cribs should be taken off the market, and either made safe, or destroyed.  There are a number of reasons why unsafe cribs should be taken off the market:  Each year, at least 45 children die from injuries sustained in cribs. That is almost one child a week.  The number of deaths from crib incidents exceeds deaths from all other nursery products combined.  Over 9,000 children are hospitalized each year as a result of injuries sustained in cribs.  To illustrate the need for this legislation, I want to share with you the story of Danny Lineweaver.  At the age of 23 months, Danny was injured during an attempt to climb out of his crib. Danny caught his shirt on a decorative knob on the cornerpost of his crib and hanged himself.  Though his mother was able to perform CPR the moment she found him, Danny lived in a semi-comatose state for nine years and died in 1993. This injury and subsequent death could have been prevented.  Since Danny's accident, we have passed laws mandating safety standards for the manufacture of new cribs. But this is not enough.  There are nearly four million infants born in this country each year, but only one million new cribs sold. As many as half of all infants are placed in secondhand, hand-me-down, or heirloom cribs--cribs that are sold in thrift stores or resale furniture stores. These cribs may be unsafe, and may in fact threaten the life of the infants placed in them.  This legislation requires thrift stores and retail furniture stores to remove decorative knobs on the cornerposts of cribs before selling those cribs.  Additionally, the bill prohibits hotels and motels from providing unsafe cribs to guests, or risk being fined up to $1,000.  The Infant Crib Safety Act makes the sale of used, unsafe cribs illegal. I hope my colleagues will join me in putting a stop to preventable injuries and deaths resulting from unsafe cribs.                                 ______                                       By
