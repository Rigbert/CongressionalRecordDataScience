DORGAN. I say to the Senator from Illinois, it is exactly as he states. With the wonderful economy we have had and the surpluses that are expected, there is a certain amount of revenue available. The priority, for the majority side, is to repeal the estate tax, including that top half of the estate tax that applies to the wealthiest estates in the country. If we follow this priority, that will crowd out the ability to do other things.  This is a question of making judgments about what is important, what is the priority of this Congress. Should we provide a prescription drug benefit for Medicare? Should this Congress make the investments in education that we should make? Should this Congress decide we should pay down the Federal debt? Should this Congress decide college tuition should trigger an increased tax credit that helps kids go to college? These are all priorities, and there are more of them that we ought to measure against this proposal to repeal the estate tax for the largest estates in the country.  As I said, it is a matter of priorities, and it is also a matter of will. What do we have time to do in the Senate? We are told by the majority leader that we do not have enough time to deal with Patients' Bill of Rights, prescription drugs for Medicare, the minimum wage, closing the gun show loophole. We do not have time for those things, we are told, but we have plenty of time for the things the majority wants to do. We have plenty of time to decide to repeal the estate tax completely, including repeal for the largest estates in the country. Do my colleagues know what that will do on average to an estate above $20 million? It will provide about a $12 million tax cut for the estate.
