Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, I will be briefer than 5 minutes. I appreciate the chairman's offer to work with us on this issue. This is an important issue. We have worked to date to try to narrow the language and make it more effective. I think what has been said before by my colleagues though indicates that this is a very important issue, and let me just respond very briefly to the tenor of some of their remarks.  First, there needs to be some discussion, I think, and obviously a discussion about small business and how they are oppressed, et cetera, but I would like to make the point that small business people do not run their companies simply to minimize costs. In fact, there are a lot of businesses out of business today because that is all they did. What they tried to do is maximize profit, and that is taking into consideration not only the cost, but how well they are doing, how well they are serving their customers, et cetera, so to have a single factor analysis at least cost is, I think--I am skeptical of this, and skepticism has prompted this amendment and prompted a continuing dialogue with the gentleman from Pennsylvania, and we can discuss these things in very theoretical terms, but it helps, I think, to focus on very practical, pragmatic terms.  For example, the FAA requires de-icing of aircraft.
