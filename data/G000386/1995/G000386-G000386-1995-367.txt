 President, this would require further modification. But first of all, before I suggest something, I do not want it to be suggested that I think my amendment does more or is intended to do more than what I said I wanted it to do. I did not doctor up the sense-of-the-Senate language because I do not know how much weaker you can get in any statement of public policy that this body makes in sense-of-the-Senate language. Maybe the Senator from Ohio puts it on a higher plane than I do. But I do not think it deserves such a high plane.  So I did not think about adjusting it any, because I do not think you can be much weaker than a sense of the Senate. But if it would help the Senator, we could put in the same words that we put in the second part of the amendment, and say ``to the extent practicable.''
