 President, let me echo the remarks of the majority leader. We have a number of amendments on this side, and we are prepared to offer them in the next few hours. I believe the first amendment is going to come from the Democratic side. Senator Collins is either here or on her way, and she is certainly going to manage the bill on our side, but then we will follow the Democratic amendment with an amendment on our side.  I also want to remind everyone that at 2 p.m. this afternoon the Transportation Security Administration will hold an all-Members briefing related to the provisions of S. 4, the bill we are now discussing, which will be pending today. A notice was sent to all offices, and Senators should be made aware that this briefing will be held in S407 of the Capitol.
