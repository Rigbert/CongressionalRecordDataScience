Chairman, I rise to speak in opposition to the Sabo amendment to H.R. 2607, the District of Columbia Appropriations Act for fiscal year 1998. H.R. 2607 includes a provision allowing public school contractors to waive Davis-Bacon requirements for construction and repair laborers. This provision is voluntary, not mandatory. This provision would help the District attract volunteer services to help with the emergency repairs needed at the District's public schools. Residents in the entire Washington metropolitan area, as well as most of the Nation, are aware of the dilapidated state of the District's schools. Clearly, the first priority should be to get the schools opened as soon as possible. Yet, an offer by the Promise Keepers to volunteer their services and make repairs at all the schools was denied. They were only allowed to repair one school. This is incomprehensible. Their offer was denied. Why? Davis-Bacon. Why force schools to spend scarce funding to make repairs that could be made for free? Our children cannot learn if they cannot attend school. There is no reason to give rigid David-Bacon rules a veto over the needs of Washington, DC's students. I urge all of my colleagues to oppose the Sabo amendment.
