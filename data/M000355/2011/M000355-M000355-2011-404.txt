 President, it was a great honor to have the Reverend Thad Austin, of the First United Methodist Church in Murfreesboro, TN, provide the opening prayer this morning. I thank him for his wise words. Remembering the St. Patrick in St. Patrick's Day was a wonderful way to begin the session.  I first met the Reverend Austin at his alma mater, Asbury University in Wilmore, KY, when I visited there in 2007. Asbury University's mission is to engage the world and serve the Word through public service. Our guest Chaplain today has pursued that mission with great success.  Maybe it is a family calling.
