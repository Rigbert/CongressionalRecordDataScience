 One of the points it makes is that if over-the-counter derivatives dealers were required to keep and make available for inspection records of all trades and to disclose information about trading volume and prices, abuses like the ones we have been talking about would be easier to detect and, thus, presumably less likely to occur.  That is really the purpose of this: not to allow sort of a secret niche in the trading arena where people could go to hide and trade, but to bring the sunshine into that niche and to provide--and it is very conservative--regulation of what they must do.  I know my friend and senior Senator from Nevada has proposed an amendment. Regrettably, I have to vote against the amendment. This bill had been worked out with Senator Harkinand Senator Lugar. My understanding is they believe we should close the loophole entirely, not leave one area sort of in the dark, so to speak.  I am troubled by the amendment because our reading of the amendment indicates that it effectively exempts metals entirely without any oversight or regulation by the CFTC, even less than under current law. In good conscience, I cannot do that.  So I think we made the arguments, Madam President. And with what has happened--and now that we know the extent of the fraud that has taken place online--not to close that loophole, I think, would be a terrible blot on this Congress.  So I am hopeful we will have a positive vote.  I thank the Chair for your indulgence and yield the floor.
