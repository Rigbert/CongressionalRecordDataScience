 President, for the information of all Senators, we have now gone through all of the amendments from the unanimous consent agreement. We are within a couple of minutes of having a unanimous consent request for the next group of amendments. I would ask that all Senators stay in the Chamber because it will just be a matter of several minutes and we will ask unanimous consent for the next group of amendments.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
