 The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 minutes.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Madam Chair, I certainly am sympathetic. I have heard from all of the territories throughout this process, and because of the paucity of funding in this bill, the funding to the territories, no matter what formula you use, is inadequate to the growth and the problems that they are experiencing.  I am not opposed to the idea of developing and updating statistical measures to target the limited funds. My preference would be there would be more funds.  This funding formula was set in 1992 by the Federal Highway Administration. They included consideration of population, land area, and road mileage of each of the four covered territories.  Based on that review, they came up with these allocations--obviously, that was 23 years ago--40 percent each to Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands and 10 percent to American Samoa and Northern Mariana Islands.  Before we unilaterally take steps to change the formula that has been in place for two decades, I think we need to hear from the delegates of all four. I have been contacted by the other two territories that would be impacted who are strongly opposed, and I would certainly like to work with the gentlewoman and all of the delegates to see what we could do to have a fair and balanced update of the formula.  Again, formulas are some of the most tricky things around here. You change just one factor and you get dramatic differences at the other end. So we would have to first agree on criteria and proper factors and then direct the FHWA to run those numbers.  So, Madam Chair, I reluctantly rise in opposition and urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.  Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
