Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time.  I wanted to commend the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Kucinich) for his leadership and moving the Congress to assure that consumers have quality foods and they do not have to worry about reactions, allergic reactions or dietary reactions to what are in foods. Even though at this point the gentleman has chosen to withdraw this amendment, his leadership has encouraged the subcommittee to include in the report directive language to get the U.S. Department of Agriculture to work more closely with the Food and Drug Administration to make sure that decisions are based on sound, verifiable science.                              {time}  1415  We expect the Department to provide sufficient information to consumers about bioengineered foods, and we have included language explaining that we want the Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. Department of Agriculture to work across agency lines to provide a unified approach to this type of consumer safety and consumer information.  Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman for his active leadership on this issue.
