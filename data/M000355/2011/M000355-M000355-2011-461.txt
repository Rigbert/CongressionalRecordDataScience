 President, I believe this is the first opportunity the new Senator from Missouri has had to address the Senate and his colleagues, and he certainly has chosen a most important topic to begin his career here in the Senate. I wish to express my admiration not only for the comments he just made on what many of us believe is right near the top of the list of America's priorities but also his extraordinary service in the House of Representatives over the last 14 years and also to welcome the Senator from Missouri to the Senate. As I indicated, he certainly picked an appropriate topic on which to make his maiden speech to the Senate.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
