Chairman, I would like to engage the chairman for a moment in two very important programs in which I know the chairman has a great interest.  The first is the DOD-VA medical research account. Last year the chairman graciously accepted my amendment on the floor to lift the amount of money invested in this program, a tremendous program dealing with Gulf War syndrome, traumatic nervous system injury, and other combat readiness and combat-related injuries to $15 million. Eleven million dollars is in the House bill.  I would like to know the chairman's intention, if we can be assured that in the conference the chairman will strive to make the program whole so we at least can maintain current services.
