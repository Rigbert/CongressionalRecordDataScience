 President, I know my friend has put a whole flock of kids through college, and so I know his commitment to college.  Let me just say very briefly my amendment restricts the growth of tax expenditures in those areas. It does not in fact freeze them.  No. 2, tell middle-class taxpayers that R&D is more important for corporations, which I support, than freezing--even if you were to freeze--than it is to be able to send their kid to college. Ask the average middle-class American taxpayer what is a better investment. Who is going to do the R&D if we do not get these kids to college?  Lastly, I say to my friend, the $500 cap on student loan interest is worthwhile and is necessary but it does not compare to $10,000 that a middle-class family would be able to deduct. They need help now. They need help now, Mr. President, and this is the most direct and immediate way to do it.  I thank the Chair. I thank my colleagues.
