 President, I rise today to recognize Rev. Wayne B. Smith, a man who has served his church, and central Kentucky, for more than 40 years. Reverend Smith is retiring as senior minister of Southland Christian Church in Lexington, which has the area's largest Protestant congregation.  Reverend Smith was 27 years old when he became Southland's founding pastor in 1956. Forty years later he is the only senior minister the church has had and is now one of the most well-known ministers in central Kentucky. Southland Christian has flourished under Reverend Smith, who has a congregation of more than 3,800 plus 50,000 on TV and radio. Known for his sense of humor, Reverend Smith is often referred to as ``the Bob Hope of the ministry.''  Reverend Smith has been named 1 of the 13 most influential people in Lexington. He served two terms as president of the Lexington Ministerial Association and is a past president of the North American Christian Convention. He is also the charter president of the Lexington Bluegrass Breakfast Lions Club.  Many of Reverend Smith's friends and colleagues have praised him for his humility and his many acts of kindness. Upon his announcement of retirement to the congregation, one Southland member said, ``It won't be the same. He is one of those people who you don't replace. There were several people, including me, who had tears in their eyes.''  At a farewell ceremony for Reverend Smith, which attracted a crowd of approximately 7,000, his friends gave testimonial after testimonial praising him for being a great servant of the Lord. In his resignation letter, Smith addressed his congregation saying, ``You have been a wonderful flock; but also * * * my friends. We have never, for even a moment, felt unloved.''  Reverend Smith and his wife Marjorie have two daughters and five grandchildren. Although he is retiring, Reverend Smith won't be able to rest for long as his future plans include speaking engagements and revival meetings across the country.  Mr. President, I would like to pay special tribute to Rev. Wayne B. Smith for his dedicated service to his church, his family, and his community.                          ____________________
