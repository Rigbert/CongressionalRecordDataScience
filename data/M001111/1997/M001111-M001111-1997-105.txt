 President.  Let me make this very clear again. Today, if a woman serving overseas--whether she is in Bosnia or Saudi Arabia--would like to have health services, she would have to go through a commanding officer and request permission to come home to the United States to have that procedure take place, and at the taxpayers' expense they would fly her home. Under my amendment she would be allowed to use her own money to pay for abortion-related services in a military hospital overseas.  I think that is a reasonable request for those women that we ask to serve in a country far away from home.  Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to my colleague from California.
