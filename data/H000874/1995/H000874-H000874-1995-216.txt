Ehrlich, who makes a point that this legislation was originally perceived as defunding, trying to defund the left. He points out correctly that those in the middle and those on the right have now raised similar concerns to those on the so-called left.  As a matter of fact, I have in my hand another letter from Fred Kammer, Father Kammer, who is president of Catholic Charities of the United States of America. I do not know whether the gentleman from Maryland puts them on the left or on the right or in the middle. I would suggest they probably have a number of views which fall into maybe all of those categories at any given time.
