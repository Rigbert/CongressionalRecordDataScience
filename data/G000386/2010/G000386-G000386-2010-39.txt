 President, very soon, the Senate will be asked to vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the majority leader's motion to proceed to a bill that is mislabeled the ``Creating American Jobs and Ending Offshoring Act.''  The process for this bill illustrates how the Democratic leadership has dumbed down any efforts to seriously legislate any tax policy issues. To show how far, as a body, we have run off the rails in legislating, let's compare the legislative track record of this bill with the last major piece of tax legislation designed to deal with domestic job creation.  I am referring to the bill that responded to a World Trade Organization ruling against a domestic manufacturing benefit known, at that time, as the foreign sales corporation or FSC program. Dangerous tariffs were pending with respect to many American products. How was that legislation handled?  First of all, the Finance Committee members and staff engaged in a lot of due diligence in crafting the replacement regime, the domestic manufacturing deduction. On a bipartisan basis, Finance Committee staff, principally the tax and trade staffs, met with the interested parties, including officials from the litigating group, the European Union.  Finance Committee staff, Republican and Democrat, negotiated a bill that took the revenue generated from repealing the FSC benefit, added revenue from shutting down tax shelters like the so-called SILO/LILO schemes, and channeled that revenue back into a new broader based domestic manufacturing incentive. That incentive is a 9 percent deduction for domestic manufacturing activity. It is a substantial tax incentive. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates it is worth $10 billion annually in terms of reduced taxes to domestic manufacturers, large and small. The chairman's mark was a joint mark between my friend, then-ranking Democratic member, Max Baucus, and me.  Ranking Member Baucus and I came up with a bill title. It was the Jump Start Our Business Strength or JOBS bill. The bill went through the usual transparent Finance Committee markup process. Over several days, Finance Committee members reviewed the language, asked questions, and prepared and filed amendments. When I gaveled the committee to order, several amendments were debated. Some were defeated. Some were modified and accepted. Others were discussed and withdrawn. Every Finance Committee member played a role in shaping the bill the committee approved. And it should be noted the only dissents were two members on the then majority side.  When the bipartisan JOBS bill was scheduled for floor debate, then majority leader Bill Frist brought up the Finance Committee bill. Both my friend, Senator Baucus, and I were consulted on the floor bill's contents. At that time the Democratic leadership filibustered efforts to effectively process the bill. Keep in mind there was no dissent in the Finance Committee on the substance of the bill on the Democratic side. As I said before, two members of my leadership, on very principled grounds, voted against this popular bill. Despite opposing the bill in committee, those two members supported the majority leader's efforts to bring the time-sensitive legislation to the floor and process it in a timely fashion.  It took three cloture votes to process the JOBS bill. That is right. Three cloture votes. The basis for the multiple filibusters of the JOBS bill was not opposition to material in the bill. The Democratic leadership filibustered over items not in the bill that they wanted to offer as amendments. The Republican leadership did something we seldom, if ever, see from the Democratic leadership. Majority Leader Frist yielded by allowing votes on those issues, which were not in the bill, but controversial with many in the Republican Conference. Many votes were held on the JOBS bill. Some were designed by those close to the Democratic campaign operation solely to score political points. The Republican Conference, as the majority party at the time, recognized multiple votes were the price to pay to push part of the majority's agenda.  Even if that agenda consisted of doing the people's business by processing a bill with more support on the other side.  The conference committee that considered the JOBS bill was fully open. There was a chairman's mark and several days of amendments between the House and Senate. In the end, a conference report was produced thatgarnered a majority of Senate conferee signatures from each side. The conference report passed with overwhelming bipartisan support.  Compare that JOBS bill process with the one for this bill which, as I said at the start of my remarks, is a jobs bill in name only. In the Senate, I have found over the years, that legislative substance and legislative process are symbiotic.  That is, the quality of the process often affects the quality of the substance and vice versa.  Here we are debating a bill whose proponents claim will make a material difference with job creation incentives. We are also told that this bill will materially curtail the offshoring of U.S. jobs. If it were only that simple, I am sure the bill would pass with the overwhelming bipartisan margin the JOBS bill did some 6 years ago.  I have previously discussed the defects in the bill before the Senate. I will not do it again here. But I will say this: Does anybody on the other side really believe if my friend, the chairman, were to put this bill before the Finance Committee that it would be approved in the form that is before the body today? I can tell you this Senator has several amendments that he thinks would improve this bill dramatically.  I would expect those amendments might pass with bipartisan support. This bill, like so many others, was crafted in the majority leader's office and is largely the singular work of two senior members of his leadership. That is not to say anything negative about those members or their interest or work in the area of tax legislation. My point is that, if the ideas in this bill had the kind of merit claimed by their proponents, why avoid the Finance Committee? Why not let the public see it in committee. Let members ask questions as they review the language. Test the strength of the ideas through the amendment process. If the proponents answer by blaming Republican Leader McConnell, I would point out that Senator McConnell isn't on the Finance Committee. If the proponents answer by blaming partisanship, I would ask them to take a look at the Finance Committee ratio.  It has been the most favorable to the majority since the early part of the 1990s. By intentionally skipping the committee of jurisdiction, the Democratic leadership has deliberately short-circuited the opportunity to methodically test the bill as tax policy. Unfortunately, this process defect has been more the rule than the exception. Since the stimulus bill in January of 2009, the Finance Committee has only marked up one tax policy bill, the health care reform bill. As a former chairman, I know the current chairman would not want to proceed this way. Nope. My sense is the Democratic leadership simply doesn't want this bill to undergo the extra scrutiny of a regular order process.  Unlike the 2004 JOBS bill, this bill is being presented as a take-it-or-leave-it proposition. Republicans are not supporting cloture because they are not being offered the opportunity to amend this bill with amendments that go to the supposed purposes of the bill. No amendments allowed on other tax incentives for job creation. No amendments allowed on measures to prevent offshoring of jobs. I have amendments dealing directly with the offshoring of jobs question. They are bipartisan amendments. If I vote for cloture, I have no assurances from the Democratic leadership that these amendments will be in order. Any look back on the way in which tax bills have been processed this year tells me I have good reasons for doubting that a full debate would occur. I would like to briefly describe the two amendments I filed earlier.  The first amendment mirrors a bill that the junior Senator from Vermont and I have coauthored. Known as the Employ America Act, this amendment would prevent any company engaged in a mass layoff of American workers from importing cheaper labor from abroad through temporary guest worker programs. Companies that are truly facing labor shortages would not be impacted by this legislation and could continue to obtain employer-sponsored visas. Only companies that are laying off a large number of Americans would be barred from importing foreign workers through guest worker programs.  Since the recession started in December of 2007, nearly 8 million Americans have lost their jobs and the unemployment rate has nearly doubled. In total, 15 million Americans are officially unemployed, another 8.8 million Americans are working part-time only because they cannot find a full-time job, and more than 1 million workers have given up looking for work altogether.  At the same time, some of the very companies that have hired tens of thousands of guest workers from overseas have announced large scale layoffs of American workers. The high-tech industry, a major employer of H-1B guest workers, has announced over 330,000 job cuts since 2008. The construction industry, a major employer of H-2B guest workers, has laid off 1.9 million workers since December of 2007.  The second amendment I filed yesterday mirrors a bill that the senior Senator from Illinois and I have worked on for several years. Known as the H-1B and L-1 Visa Reform Act of 2009, this amendment would improve two key visa programs by rooting out fraud and abuse while making sure Americans have the first chance of obtaining high-skilled jobs in this country.  The amendment does several things, including: one, requiring employers to try and recruit U.S. workers before hiring H-1B visa holders; two, requiring employers to pay a better wage to visa holders who take these jobs; three, expanding the powers of the federal government to go after abusers; four, creating new rules regarding the outsourcing and outplacement of H-1B and L-1 workers by their employers to secondary employers in the United States; and five, establishing a new database that employers can use to advertise positions for which they intend to hire an H-1B worker.  Too many American workers are unemployed today. Yet we still allow companies to import hundreds, even thousands, of foreign workers with very little strings attached. These businesses should be first asked to look at Americans to fill vacant positions, and they should be held accountable for displacing Americans to hire cheaper foreign labor.  These two amendments go directly to the concerns about job creation and prevention of offshoring of U.S. jobs. Both amendments are bipartisan. Yet if cloture is invoked, these amendments would fall on the Senate cutting room floor.  Unlike the 2004 JOBS bill, I have no confidence that, even if the Democratic leadership were to follow regular order for floor purposes, that we could expect anything like a conference committee to work out the issues between the House and the Senate.  We find ourselves in a very disappointing situation today. Two serious issues are supposed to be addressed in the legislation before the Senate: The first is tax incentives for job creation; the second is measures to prevent offshoring of jobs. No doubt the people who send us here expect us to take these weighty matters seriously. With all the economic pain Americans are enduring, we shouldn't be playing political games. But here we are. We have a bill whose proponents claim is a serious effort.  The Democratic leadership skipped the Finance Committee, and we are presented with a take-it-or-leave-it bill that is really nothing more than a political label. We can do better.                             Cloture Motion
