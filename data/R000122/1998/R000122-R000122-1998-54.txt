President, today I am introducing legislation at the request of Rhode Island's jewelry box manufacturers to require a permanent country of origin marking on imported jewelry boxes.  This bill is similar to another piece of legislation I am introducing today to require a permanent country of origin label on imported fashion jewelry items, and it is my hope that this jewelry box bill will be considered in tandem with that legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of this legislation be printed in the record I urge my colleagues to support this bill.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2437       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. MARKING OF IMPORTED JEWELRY BOXES.       (a) Marking Requirement.--By no later than the date that is      1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary      of the Treasury shall prescribe and implement regulations      that require that all jewelry boxes described in subsection      (b) that enter, or are withdrawn from warehouse for      consumption, in the customs territory of the United States      have the English name of the country of origin indelibly      marked in a conspicuous place on such jewelry boxes by      cutting, die-sinking, engraving, stamping, or some other      permanent method. The exceptions from marking requirements      provided in section 304 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C.      1304) shall not apply to jewelry boxes subject to this      section.       (b) Jewelry.--The jewelry boxes referred to in subsection      (a) are jewelry boxes provided for in headings 4202.92.60,      4202.92.90, and     4202.99.10 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United      States.                               ____________________
