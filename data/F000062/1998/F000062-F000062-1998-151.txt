 I think what has happened is that we have seen a net figure applied as a gross figure when in fact it is just a beginning figure. It becomes an arbitrary cost added, and then there are all these other costs that come on top that are not factored in.  I think that is why we need a very thorough, objective report on what actual street prices of cigarettes will be, what you get them for in your 7-11, what you buy them for in your supermarket, what it will be with inflated dollars in 5 years.  If we know that with specificity, then I think we can make some informed judgments as to whether, in each of our respective States, this is apt to create a black market or not apt to create a black market. We then can relate this data to the distribution table that Joint Tax has done so you know what portion of this falls on the lowest-income people versus the highest-income people.
