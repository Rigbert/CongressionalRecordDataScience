Chairman, before I left the floor I heard that the gentleman from Oklahoma [Mr. Istook] has three daughters. I have three daughters of my own. They are no longer teenagers. Obviously they all were. Like all teenagers, they had problems. Their relationship with their mother and father was dictated more by the context of our family than it was by law. I suggest that the Castle alternative does what the American public wants done. That is, they want to encourage families to be involved with one another. That is obviously beneficial to the children, to the mother, the father, and to America. But they do not want to discourage young people from getting the health care that they desperately need from time to time. That is why I believe the Castle alternative is what the American public believes is a commonsense alternative, encouraging us to attain a worthy objective but not discouraging us from having healthy teens.
