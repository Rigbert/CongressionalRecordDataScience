President, I am sorry the Republican whip was unable to yield to me for an observation, but I will make this observation. He condemns President Clinton, who is the only President since he has been here in the Senate who has brought the deficit down 4 years in a row. He says it may go up in future years. I remind the Republican whip, my good friend from Oklahoma, that the Republicans have the majority of Senators and the Republicans have the majority of House Members. If they do not like the budget of the President, all they have to do is pass their own. But to this day they have not brought forward one page, one paragraph, one sentence or one word of a budget that would do better than what Bill Clinton has done.
