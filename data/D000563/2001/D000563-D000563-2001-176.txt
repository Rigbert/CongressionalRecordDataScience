I note that Senator Torricelli is also in the Chamber. We were in a meeting yesterday to discuss security transportation security, not just aviation security. There are many of us served by Amtrak who believe that George Warrington, the CEO of Amtrak, has given us fair notice that he needs additional resources to make certain that Amtrak continues to be one of the safest ways to travel in America.  I believe there are over 600 Amtrak stations across this country. They are putting in place the kind of security we want, to make certain that no terrorist will see a target of opportunity in the metroliners or Amtrak trains that crisscross America.  I am happy, as I have noted at the beginning of my statement, to be a cosponsor of S. 1447 on aviation security. There are many provisions that I think are excellent. I am happy to join Senator Hollings and so many others, on a bipartisan basis, to support the bill. But we would be remiss to believe that passing a bill on aviation security takes care of our obligation, our responsibility. Beyond that, we have to look to the traveling public and other vulnerabilities.  I agree with my colleagues who also have Amtrak service that we need to give to Amtrak the resources and the authority to make certain they can upgrade their security and take a look at a lot of their vulnerable infrastructure.  In this Chamber yesterday, Senator Torricelli talked about some of the tunnels. George Warrington of Amtrak has brought this to my attention. Many of these tunnels date back to the Civil War in their construction.  They do not have adequate safety in the tunnels so that if anything occurred, the people on the train would be in a very perilous situation. As these trains pass in the tunnels, literally hundreds if not thousands of passengers are trusting that we are doing everything we should do for the security of their transportation. I don't think we are doing enough. In fact, I believe we should include in this aviation security bill the authorization for Amtrak to receive additional funds for security.  I am troubled--I have to say this with some regret--that a lot of my colleagues in the Senate who have had a very negative view of Amtrak as a governmental function are translating that into a reluctance to address these security and safety measures. I am not one of them. If we take a look at the annual expenditure for transportation at the Federal level, we spend roughly $33 billion a year on highways, $12 billion a year on airports--before the crisis--and about $500 million a year on Amtrak. Anyone in the State of Illinois and in many States across the Nation knows that if we are going to have a balanced transportation system, we need all three. We need aviation, good highway transportation and mass transit, and a national rail passenger corporation such as Amtrak.  It is no surprise to me, as I have been on the trains more often since September 11 than before, that more and more Americans are turning there.  We have an obligation to protect them, not to wait until there is an accident or something worse. I hope my colleagues will reconsider their opposition to Amtrak security authorization and appropriations. We should do it, and we should do it now without question.  Our commitment should be to every American to make their transportation as safe as humanly possible.  Let me address the aviation security issue for a minute. Yesterday, in my office I had representatives of the three major international corporations involved in aviation airport screening and security. They told me an interesting story. For those who may not be aware, until this moment in time, we have given to the airlines the responsibility to contract out the security and screening stations at the airports. We have found, as we have looked into it, that going to the lowest bidder in some circumstances meant that you didn't have an employee who was adequately compensated or trained.  I will quickly add that in my hometown of Springfield, IL, and many airports I have visited, the people working the screening equipment are doing an extraordinarily good job. Any one of us who has been through an airport at any time in the past few years knows that too often you have found at those security stations employees who were not taking it seriously.  Examine the analysis from the GAO, and it turns out that the turnover in some of the airports is 100 percent a year, 200 percent a year and, in the worst case, over 400 percent a year. The employees come and go if they are given an opportunity to take a job at Cinnabon or anywhere else in the airport. They are quickly gone from the screening stations. We have not taken this responsibility seriously, nor have the airlines.  Now we face a new day. The private contractors who came to me yesterday said that it is a different world altogether overseas. In fact, one of them noted the fact that in Israel it is a private company that handles the security at the airport with certification by the Government and supervision by the Government, as is the case in many European capitals. I don't know if we can safely move in our own minds from what we see today with these same companies to a model using those companies in a different context.  When I asked Secretary Mineta last week to describe for me how this might work, the details were still forthcoming. That left me a little bit cold. Many of my colleagues share the belief that the safest way to address this, as we do in the bill, is to say that we will federalize the security and safety at airports. This bill goes beyond the screening station and talks about the responsibility under this bill. Let me quote from it on the security operations:       The administrator shall establish and enforce rules to      improve the fiscal security of air traffic control      facilities, parked aircraft, aircraft servicing equipment,      aircraft supplies, automobile parking facilities, access and      transition areas at airports served by other means of ground      or water transportation.  The important thing is that this bill goes far beyond the screening stations at the airports. I believe if we are going to maintain safety at airports and on our airplanes, it has to be a secure environment. That means we are not only conscious and sensitive to what passengers bring onto airplanes but every single person who has contact with an airplane. A caterer, a clean-up crew, refueling personnel, someone who is a mechanic coming on board, or baggage handlers, all of them have to be supervised to make certain that those airplanes are secure. This bill does it. It does it through federalization.  I think we should view the safety of our airports and airplanes as mattersof national security. After September 11, we can do no less.  I hope we enact this legislation and do it very quickly so that we can have in place a system that will help to restore confidence in the flying public.  I am happy to report in my own personal experience more and more people are returning to airports. I am glad that is the case.                          ____________________
