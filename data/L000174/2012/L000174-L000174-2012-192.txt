President, while the distinguished Senator from Michigan is still on the floor--and she has done such commendable work here, as somebody who brought together the Senate Agriculture Committee on a very complex farm bill, and in a record amount of time got it passed with a heavy bipartisan majority--I think she wouldagree with me that is the way we used to and should do legislation.  For the life of me, I cannot understand why any Senator would not be supporting the Senator from Michigan on the bill. We want jobs here in the United States. Everybody will say: We want jobs in the United States. Everybody says they want to have tax laws that actually help this country. So what do they do? By refusing to allow us to go forward, they vote to allow jobs to go overseas. But worse than that, it gives special tax breaks. It is almost like saying: Hey, this company of yours, these jobs you have, come on, I know a great place for you to go overseas. By the way, here is the airplane ticket. Here is the special deal. We are not going to give that to a small business owner in Vermont or Michigan, but we will give that to you to ship your jobs overseas.  Come on, let's get real. If you took a poll of the American people on this: Do you want to close loopholes for shipping jobs overseas or do you want to give encouragement to have jobs here in the United States? I guarantee you, it would be overwhelmingly passed. The U.S. Senate better wake up and say: We will pass it too.  So I thank the Senator from Michigan.                   Release of Camp Lejeune Documents  Mr. President, the distinguished Presiding Officer and I are both from Vermont, where we have open and available government. He did in his role as mayor of our largest city. He has encouraged it all the way through.  We know that the ``right to know'' is a cornerstone of our democracy. During my three decades in the Senate, I have urged Democratic and Republican administrations alike to be open and transparent to the American people.  That is why in March I joined a bipartisan group of Members of Congress--Senator Grassley, Senator Burr, Senator Hagan, Senator Bill Nelson, and Senator Rubio--in writing to Secretary of Defense Panetta to request the release of government records regarding the contamination of drinking water that occurred over several decades at Camp Lejeune Marine Base, in North Carolina.  The drinking water contamination at Camp Lejeune was one of the worst environmental disasters in American history to occur at a domestic Department of Defense installation. Unfortunately, the Department of Defense initially refused to provide this important information to the Congress. But I am pleased to report that after I pursued it further with Secretary Panetta, the Department finally provided more than 8,500 files about this issue to the Judiciary Committee on July 9.  I commend Secretary Panetta for accommodating the committee's request for this information. But I believe that much more transparency is needed. I believe it as a U.S. Senator. I believe it as one who believes in transparency. I also believe it as a father of a Marine.  Today, thousands of active and retired Marines who lived on or near Camp Lejeune prior to 1987, and their family members, are extremely interested in learning more about what occurred, and why.  In my own State of Vermont, 402 Vermonters have signed in saying they are looking to their government to provide more information about this calamity.  Open government is neither a Democratic issue nor a Republican issue. It is an American value. It is a virtue that we all have to uphold.  It is in this bipartisan spirit that I announce I will make all the documents the Department of Defense has provided to the Judiciary Committee about what happened at Camp Lejeune available to the public. These documents can be seen on the Judiciary Committee's Web site. Go to www.judiciary.senate.gov. Find out what the documents say about what happened at Camp Lejeune.  To protect the personal privacy of our servicemembers and other private information, information that would be subject to the Privacy Act, has been redacted from these files. But the Marines and any other Americans who have been touched by this environmental disaster deserve complete candor from their government. Our uniquely American tradition of a government that is open, accountable, and accessible to its people demands nothing less.  Again, I thank Senator Grassley, the committee's distinguished ranking member, and Senators Burr, Hagan, Nelson, and Rubio for working closely with me on this important transparency issue.  I say to those Marines, we will find out what happened.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
