Chairman, this amendment requires States to consider electric utilities to allow community solar projects of up to 2 megawatts to connect to the electric grid. We do know that community solar is an exciting new technology that many communities and customers are seriously considering.  I could say that I support the gentlewoman's community solar goals, but there are some concerns with the amendment. Namely, as drafted, it could violate some State electric service laws, while also potentially being redundant of Federal standards currently imposed on States.  But because it is not a mandate and uses PURPA for States to consider, which they are free to consider or reject, we can accept the gentlewoman's amendment.  I yield back the balance of my time.
