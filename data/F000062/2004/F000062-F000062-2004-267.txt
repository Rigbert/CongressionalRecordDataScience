 President, I rise on behalf of myself and Senators Warner, Schumer, DeWine, Levin, Chafee, Dodd, Jeffords, Boxer, Clinton, Reed and Lautenberg to offer legislation that will reauthorize the 1994 assault weapons ban--which is now set to expire on September 13, 2004--for another ten years.  I would first like to thank my courageous colleague from Virginia, Senator Warner, for joining me in this effort. Senator Warner voted against the assault weapons ban in 1994.  But this year, Senator Warner was willing to revisit his position on the issue. He saw that--contrary to the fears of many in 1994--the ban has done nothing to hurt innocent gun owners. Instead, the ban has only made it harder for criminals to get access to military style firearms. A willingness to look at issues like this with an open mind, particularly this issue, shows a courage and a commitment to making the right decisions that should be emulated by all public servants, and I want to again thank Senator Warner for this.  Second, I would like to speak about who else supports this legislation.  Those who join us in supporting a reauthorization of the assault weapons ban include: Fraternal Order of Police; National League of Cities; United States Conference of Mayors; National Association of Counties; International Association of Chiefs of Police; National Association of Police Organizations; International Brotherhood of Police Officers; U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops; National Education Association; Americans for Gun Safety; The Brady Campaign/Million Mom March; NAACP; American Bar Association; and the list goes on, and on.  More than ten years ago--on July 1, 1993--Gian Luigi Ferri walked into 101 California Street in San Francisco carrying two high-capacity TEC-9 assault pistols. Within minutes, Ferri had murdered eight people, and six others were wounded. This tragedy shook San Francisco, and it shook the entire Nation.  The American people saw in that incident and so many others that came before and after it the incredible destruction that could be inflicted with military-style assault weapons--weapons designed and manufactured with one goal in mind--maximum lethality.  It all started, really, on August 1, 1966, when Charlie Whitman climbed the clock tower at the University of Texas and killed more than a dozen people in an hour and a half shooting spree before he was finally killed himself.  The day Whitman climbed that tower was the first time Americans realized that they could become the random victims of gun violence no matter where they were, and no matter what they were doing.  What made the Texas shooting so terrible was the total inability of law enforcement to get to Charlie Whitman until he had been firing shots for almost 96 minutes. The tower allowed him to do this. The tower made him, at least for that amount of time, invincible.  But gunmen no longer need the protection of clock towers, because they now have assault weapons.  We saw in the Columbine shooting, in the Long Island Rail Road shooting, and so many others, that high capacity assault weapons can make those who wield them temporarily invincible to law enforcement, because it is so difficult to get close to the shooter.  It is often only when a gunman stops to reload that bystanders or the police can move in to stop the shooting. And if the gun's magazine holds hundreds of bullets, that could take a long time, and result in a lot of deaths.  This is vitally important, because grievance killings by disgruntled members of society have taken an increasing number of lives in recent years. And when those grievance killers wield high capacity weapons, the toll on lives is exponentially increased.  The grievance killings have been across the Nation, in every forum: In a San Ysidro, CA, McDonald's in 1984, when a gunman with an Uzi killed 21 and wounded 15 others. In Stockton, CA, in 1989, when drifter Patrick Purdy walked into a schoolyard with an AK-47 and killed 5, wounding 30 others. In Long Island, NY, in 1993, when a gunman killed 6 and wounded 19 others on a commuter train--he was only brought down when he finally stopped to reload. In Pearl, MS, in 1997 when 2 students killed. In Paducah, KY, in 1998 when 3 students were killed. In Jonesboro, AR, in 1998 when 5 were killed, and 10 more wounded. In Springfield, OR, in 1998 when 2 were killed, and 22 wounded. In Littleton, CO, when 12 teens and one teacher were killed in Columbine High School. In Atlanta, GA in 1999 when a troubled day trader killed his wife, 2 children and several people trading stocks. At a Granada Hills, CA, Jewish Community Center when a gunman wounded three and killed a Filipino-American postal worker--many of us remember that one touching photo of small children being quickly led across the street to escape the gunfire. No child should have to go through that. At a Fort Worth, TX, Baptist church where seven were killed and seven more wounded at a teens church event, all by a man with two guns and 9 high capacity clips, with a capacity of 15 rounds each.  Recognizing the earliest of these shootings as a problem that needed to be dealt with, Congress finally took notice in 1993. In the aftermath of the 101 California shooting, we in Congress did something that no one had succeeded in doing before--we banned the manufacture and importation of military-style assault weapons.  We were told it could not be done--but we did it. I was even told by colleagues on my own side of the aisle that I was wasting my time--that the gun lobby was just too strong. I hear many of the same arguments today. But we succeeded in 1994, and we will succeed this year. We succeeded, and we will succeed, because the American people will accept no less of us.  The goal of the 1994 legislation was to drive down the supply of these weapons and to make them more difficult to obtain, and to eventually get them off our streets. And in the years following the enactment of the ban, crimes using assault weapons were indeed reduced dramatically--in fact, the percentage of crimes using banned assault weapons fell by more than 65 percent between 1995 and 2002.  The ATF has found that the proportion of banned assault weapons used in crime has fallen from 3.57 percent in 1995 to just 1.22 percent by 2002. Now these are not big percentages--most crimes are not committed by assault weapons.  But it is important to note that crimes committed with assault weapons often result in many more deaths than crimes committed with other guns. A simple robbery with a handgun is far less likely to result in multiple deaths than a drive-by shooting with an Uzi, or a grievance killing in a school using an AK-47 with a large capacity ammunition magazine.  And contrary to the near-hysterical rhetoric coming from the NRA at the time, no innocent gun owner lost an assault weapon. No gun was confiscated as a result of the ban. The sky did not fall. And life went on--but it went on with fewer grievance killers, juveniles, and drive-by shooters having access to the most dangerous of firearms.  Despite these results, House Majority Leader Tom Delay said last year that House Republicans will let the Assault Weapons ban die when it sunsets after ten years.  To those of us who have been in Congress for some time, this comes as little surprise--after all, the House actually voted to repeal the original assault weapons ban soon after it was signed into law.  But the good news is that the President of the United States does support reauthorizing the ban.  In April of last year, White House spokesman Scott McClellan said of the assault weapons ban, ``The president supports the current law, and he supports reauthorization of the current law.''  That is what we are doing with this legislation--reauthorizing the current law. Period.  I know the President agrees with me when I say that I don't believe that banned guns like the AK-47, the TEC-9, or the Street Sweeper should once again be manufactured or imported into the United States. These are military guns, with no purpose but the killing of other human beings. They have pistol grips and other features designed solely to allow the weapons to be more easily concealed, and more easily fired from the hip in close quarters combat--or, tragically, in places like the schoolyard in Stockton, where five children died, the McDonalds in San Ysidro, the law firm at 101 California Street in San Francisco, Columbine High School, or so many other places where maniacs with their military guns were able to shoot large numbers of people in short periods of time.  That is why I believe that Congress should reauthorize the 1994 law, which expires next September 13. And that is undoubtedly why the President also supports our efforts.  I know there will be some who will say that the current law doesn't go far enough--and frankly, I agree. I would prefer to expand the ban to California law, so that we prohibit the copycat assault weapons that manufacturers so cravenly designed following the ban.  Senator Lautenberg has introduced legislation to do this, and I co-sponsored that bill. Ideally, we would pass legislation that fully prevents craven manufacturers from circumventing the ban.  But in an environment where the NRA has such a stranglehold on gun legislation, we will need all the help we can get just to keep the current ban.  The current ban has been effective in limiting the supply of these most dangerous guns. Even the copycat guns are less dangerous, because they are harder to conceal, harder to fire from the hip.  And no matter whether the ban has been entirely effective or not, what is the argument for letting these banned guns back on the streets?  Who is clamoring for newly manufactured AK-47s?  Who is clamoring for new TEC-9s?  These are guns that are never used for hunting. They are not used for self defense, and if they are it is more likely that they will kill innocents than intruders.  These guns--and everyone knows it--have but one purpose, and that purpose is to kill other human beings. Why would we want to open the floodgates again and let them back on our streets? There is simply no good reason.  This debate should not be about whether the assault weapons ban is perfect. This debate should be about whether these guns need to come back--and the American people know that they do not.  With the President, law enforcement, and the American people behind us, wecan succeed. We can beat the NRA's narrow, special interest agenda and keep these guns off the streets.  I urge my colleagues to read the dozens of editorials in support of the ban, to listen to their constituents, to ask us questions, and to make the only decision that makes sense--to support this bill.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2109       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Assault Weapons Ban      Reauthorization Act of 2004''.     SEC. 2. 10-YEAR EXTENSION OF ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN.       Section 110105 of the Public Safety and Recreational      Firearms Use Protection Act (18 U.S.C. 921 note) is amended      to read as follows:     ``SEC. 110105. SUNSET PROVISION.       ``This subtitle and the amendments made by this subtitle      are repealed September 13, 2014.''.
