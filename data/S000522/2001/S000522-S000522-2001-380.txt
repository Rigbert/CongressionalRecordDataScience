Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. Let me just respond very briefly. I thought we would be having this debate next week, but the Hyde-Barcia-Smith-Oberstar amendment has been mentioned several times and a response is warranted.  Unfortunately, the underlying language that was adopted in committee would reverse the Bush-Mexico City policy. As a matter of historical record, I have been offering the pro-life language since 1984. We have never won, not once, in the Committee on International Relations; but this House in every instance has overturned what the committee had done in every instance as well. So I think that is important to point out, that at the end of the process, the House votes to uphold the Mexico City Policy.  It is simply inaccurate, to say we do not pay for abortions, when we fund abortion organizations overseas. It is a bookkeeping ploy to fund organizations that fund abortions. We are not fooled.
