 President, I rise today to again join my colleague, Senator Cantwell, in introducing the MediFair Act of 2005. My bill will restore fairness to the Medicare program and provide greater equity for health providers participating in Medicare. Most importantly, it will open doors of care to more seniors and the disabled in my State.  Today, in Washington state, unfair Medicare reimbursement rates are causing doctors to limit their care for Medicare beneficiaries. Throughout my State, seniors and the disabled are having a hard time finding a doctor who will accept new Medicare patients.  Unfortunately, the Medicare Modernization Act, enacted in 2003, creates even greater inequities for my State. Prior to enactment, Washington State was 41st in per beneficiary reimbursement costs. When fully implemented, this legislation will push Washington State to 45th in per beneficiary costs. This growing inequity places health care providers in my State at an economic disadvantage and further limits access to health care for Washington patients.  My bill will reduce the regional inequities that have resulted in vastly different levels of care and access to care by ensuring that every state receives at least the national average of per beneficiary spending. This measure will encourage more doctors to accept Medicare patients and will also guarantee that seniors are not penalized when they choose to retire in the State of Washington. The regional inequities in Medicare reimbursement have created a very different program for my seniors, one that offers them fewer benefits.  In addition to ensuring that no state receives less than the national average, my legislation will encourage healthy outcomes and the efficient use of Medicare payments. The current Medicare structure punishes health care providers who practice efficient health care and who produce higher levels of healthy outcomes. Physicians and hospitals in my state are proud of the pioneering role they have played in providing high quality, cost-effective medicine. Unfortunately, instead of being rewarded for their exceptional service, they are being punished with unfair Medicare payments that only cover a fraction of their actual costs.  I applaud recent efforts by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to direct Medicare resources to performance-based medicine. I believe this effort to reward providers who practice performance-based health care is an important step forward. It's a wise investment to shift Medicare from a disease-based program, which rewards over utilization and medical errors, to a prevention-based program that encourages healthy outcomes based on performance. It will mean better care for seniors and will slow the hemorrhaging of Medicare dollars. I am hopeful that CMS will expand these efforts.  Performance-based medicine will also begin to close the gap in Medicare reimbursement. We must invest in this new approach and begin to make changes system wide. In the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act, we worked to close the gap between rural and urban providers. I believe it is time to take the next step. When doctors and hospitals work to improve outcomes and lower utilization rates they should not be punished with unfair Medicare payments.  I want to acknowledge the lead sponsor of the MediFair bill in the House, Congressman Adam Smith, as well as the other House cosponsors, Congressman Baird, Congressman McDermott, Congressman Dicks, Congressman Inslee, and Congressman Larsen.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 411       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``MediFair Act of 2005''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Regional inequities in medicare reimbursement has      created barriers to care for seniors and the disabled.       (2) The regional inequities in medicare reimbursement      penalize States that have cost-effective health care delivery      systems and rewards those States with high utilization rates      and that provide inefficient care.       (3) Over a lifetime, those inequities can mean as much as a      $50,000 difference in the cost of care provided per      beneficiary.       (4) Regional inequities have resulted in creating very      different medicare programs for seniors and the disabled      based on where they live.       (5) Because the Medicare+Choice rate is based on the fee-     for-service reimbursement rate, regional inequities have      allowed some medicare beneficiaries access to plans with      significantly more benefits including prescription drugs.      Beneficiaries in States with lower reimbursement rates have      not benefitted to the same degree as beneficiaries in other      parts of the country.       (6) Regional inequities in medicare reimbursement have      created an unfair competitive advantage for hospitals and      other health care providers in States that receive above      average payments. Higher payments mean that those providers      can pay higher salaries in a tight, competitive market.       (7) Regional inequities in medicare reimbursement can limit      timely access to new technology for beneficiaries in States      with lower reimbursement rates.       (8) Regional inequities in medicare reimbursement, if left      unchecked, will reduce access to medicare services and impact      healthy outcomes for beneficiaries.       (9) Regional inequities in medicare reimbursement are not      just a rural versus urban problem. Many States with large      urban centers are at the bottom of the national average for      per beneficiary costs.     SEC. 3. IMPROVING FAIRNESS OF PAYMENTS TO PROVIDERS UNDER THE                    MEDICARE FEE-FOR-SERVICE PROGRAM.       Title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et      seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following new      section:``IMPROVING PAYMENT EQUITY UNDER THE ORIGINAL MEDICARE FEE-FOR-SERVICE                                 PROGRAM       ``Sec. 1898.
