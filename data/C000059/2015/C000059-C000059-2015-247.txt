Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose commitment and contributions to the community of Riverside County, California are exceptional. Riverside County has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Marion Ashley is one of these individuals. On Wednesday, September 16, 2015, my good friend Marion Ashley is celebrating his 80th birthday.  Marion Ashley is a dedicated family man. He has been married to his wife Mary for 54 years. Together they have six children, 19 grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. As a lifelong resident of Riverside County, Marion has had an extensive and decorated career of public service working tirelessly to improve the lives of his fellow citizens and local communities.  After years working in the private sector in both real estate and accounting, Marion started his journey of public service by serving as a Riverside Planning Commissioner in 1973. He then brought his talents over to the Eastern Municipal Water District when he was elected in 1992. In 2002, he was elected to Riverside County Board of Supervisors where he has been serving for the past 13 years. While overseeing the 5th District in Riverside County, Marion has worked to enact public policy for the 2.3 million people he serves and manages a $4.7 billion budget.  Marion has brought his expertise over the years to four very crucial areas of public policy in the state of California including water, jobs, transportation, and forward planning. His hard work and dedication has not been unnoticed by the communities he serves and his peers. Marion is the only County Supervisor that has had the honor of being chosen as the Chairman of the Board of Supervisors, the Western Riverside Council of Governments, and the Coachella Valley Association of Governments.  In addition to his many years of public service to the Riverside County community, Marion and his family have donated hundreds of acres of land in the hills close to the city of Perris, California to become a permanent nature preserve.  I am proud to call Marion a close friend, fellow community member and great American. And today, I add my voice to the many who will be congratulating him on the celebration of his 80th birthday.                          ____________________
