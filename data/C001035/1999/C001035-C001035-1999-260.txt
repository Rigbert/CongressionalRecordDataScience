These are the questions, when asked of the senior citizens whom I talked to, they find very intrusive. The nurses who are treating them are offended that they have to pry into matters that have no connection to the reason for the home health visit.  Moreover, as I pointed out earlier to my friend and colleague, this is time that is being spent on unnecessary paperwork, on intrusive questions that alienate and destroy the relationship between the nurse and the patients that could better be used for actually caring for the patient.  Agencies are not reimbursed for this time. Moreover, in a State such as Maine, which is very rural, our home health providers have to spend a lot of time traveling from patient to patient. This is time that is lost from the system.  Another issue, which the Senator has also raised, which is inexplicable to me, is why is HCFA collecting this data for non-Medicare patients? I don't understand that. Am I correct? The Senator from Kansas is much more knowledgeable about the OASIS system than I am. Am I correct that it actually applies to non-Medicare patients as well?
