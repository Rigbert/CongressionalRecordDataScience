President, we do have at least one amendment, the Lautenberg amendment, that is ready for a vote. It might be that the Harkin amendment will be ready for a vote also, if the Senator can get ready in the next 30 minutes. I announce it is our intention to have a vote at 5:30, and there will be either one or two or even three votes, depending on what comes down between now and 5:30.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
