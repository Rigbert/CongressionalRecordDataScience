Chairman, I thank the chairman for yielding time to me.  Mr. Chairman, I wish to rise in opposition to this amendment, though I think it has some very good intentions, and it will no doubt cause discussion inside the Wildlife Service offices across this country.  Nonetheless, it is the only Federal program that we have to control damage by wild animals, not just to farm property but to individuals.                              {time}  1600  I can think in my own State of Ohio, for example, this program, in cooperation with our State and local agencies, has been involved in establishing a rabies-free barrier to stop the western migration of raccoons infected with rabies.  We have seen this program operate hand in hand with the Centers for Disease Control and State health departments in control of other disease such as Lyme disease and other wildlife-borne disease. I know I am amazed myself sometimes, I live in a city, to watch city dwellers try to encourage deer to come up to their back doors, wild animals. Lyme disease all through our part of the country, and yet they do not see a connection between their behavior and the feeding that they are doing of wild animals.  Mr. Chairman, I think this is a very important program. According to Utah State University, their Institute for Wildlife Biology, overall in our country losses from wildlife damage approach $3 billion annually and fully one-third of that is estimated by the Federal Aviation Administration to be lost by the airline industry from birds.  Today, this particular amendment I think, though it is well-intentioned, would have the net effect of cutting by almost one-quarter the amount of funds we have to spend on animal damage control of our crops and of our populations.  If we take a look at the impact of this program, more than two-thirds of our Nation's farms receive some type of wildlife damage each year. Commodity crops absorb staggering losses from wildlife. These include corn, rice, sunflower, carrots, wheat, sorghum and other seed grain crops.  If we look at ducks and geese who trample, eat, and soil seed and grain crops, young growing crops such as carrots, rice and corn. Deer and smaller mammals eat corn, wheat, decorative shrubbery, sorghum, and garden vegetables.  Black bears damage timber resources by clawing the bark of young trees and disrupting the flow of nutrients necessary for proper growth. And fish-eating birds such as the great blue heron, cormorants, pelicans, and the black-crowned night heron cause aquaculturists, especially catfish and trout farmers, heavy losses each year.  There is not pure right on either side of this equation. But there is a balance which we are trying to strike here. I think that wildlife services very often provides the only viable assistance in minimizing these losses both to plant life, to other animal life, and to human life.  Mr. Chairman, I think that the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio) and the gentleman from New Hampshire (Mr. Bass) are very wise in trying to encourage modern practices at the Wildlife Service. If there are better ways to deal with these wildlife populations, we certainly should be taking the best research and information into account.  I think the message has been heard loud and clear and we hope that that message will continue. But I do think that these predator control programs are very, very important. Especially living in an area that is both urban and rural, we see this all the time.  So I would object to this particular amendment and would share the view of the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Skeen) that it is important that we keep the funding in the base bill and that we act responsibly to try to maintain levels for a balanced wildlife services program in our country.
