President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1884       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``School Access to Emergency      Epinephrine Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds the following:       (1) According to research funded by the Food Allergy      Initiative and conducted by Northwestern University and      Children's Memorial Hospital, nearly 6,000,000 children in      the United States have food allergies.       (2) Anaphylaxis, or anaphylactic shock, is a systemic      allergic reaction that can kill within minutes.       (3) More than 15 percent of school-aged children with food      allergies have had an allergic reaction in school.       (4) Teenagers and young adults with food allergies are at      the highest risk of fatal food-induced anaphylaxis.       (5) Individuals with food allergies who also have asthma      may be at increased risk for severe or fatal food allergy      reactions.       (6) Studies have shown that 25 percent of epinephrine      administrations in schools involve individuals with a      previously unknown allergy.       (7) The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious      Diseases (``NIAID'') has reported that delays in the      administration of epinephrine to patients in anaphylaxis can      result in rapid decline and death. NIAID recommends that      epinephrine be given promptly to treat anaphylaxis.       (8) Physicians can provide standing orders to furnish a      school with epinephrine for injection, and several States      have passed laws to authorize this practice.       (9) The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology      recommends that epinephrine injectors should be included in      all emergency medical treatment kits in schools.       (10) The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that an      anaphylaxis kit should be kept with medications in each      school and made available to trained staff for administration      in an emergency.       (11) According to the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network,      there are no contraindications to the use of epinephrine for      a life-threatening reaction.     SEC. 3. PREFERENCE FOR STATES REGARDING ADMINISTRATION OF                    EPINEPHRINE BY SCHOOL PERSONNEL.       Section 399L of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C.      280g(d)) is amended--       (1) in subsection (a), by redesignating the second      paragraph (2) and paragraph (3) as paragraphs (3) and (4),      respectively;
