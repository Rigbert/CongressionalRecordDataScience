If confirmed, Betsy DeVos would be responsible for administering our Nation's student loan portfolio and would have to ensure borrowers repay their loans in a timely manner. Yet, how can we believe she will demonstrate sound judgment in her responsibilities or be a role model when her own political organization has blatantly avoided paying legally obligated fines for her violations of Ohio's election laws?  Mr. Speaker, Betsy DeVos' attempt to subvert the law and buy influence are diametrically opposed to everything the President-elect advised was wrong with America. He wants to drain the swamp. No one in America should be above the law, and neither should Betsy DeVos be above the law. She ought to pay the $5.3 million she owes the people of Ohio.                          ____________________
