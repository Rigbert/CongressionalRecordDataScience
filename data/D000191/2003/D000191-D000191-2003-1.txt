Speaker, today Congress will take up one of the largest single aggregate spending bills in the history of our Nation. There are billions more for foreign aide, there are many questionable projects and priorities; but what is most glaring about this legislation is what is not in it.  The interesting thing is that much of the money that funds the agencies and the projects under this bill will be borrowed. And Americans, working Americans, for the next 30 years, will be paying that bill. But there is one glaring oversight, one thing that is left out where we would not have had to borrow money, and that is to take care of the long-term unemployed here in the United States of America.                              {time}  0945  Why would we not have to borrow money to take care of them? Because there is $20 billion in the unemployment trust fund, taxes that were paid in by employers and employees, that were set aside to take care of Americans in a time of need when they have lost their job and they cannot find another job through no fault of their own. $20 billion is there. So out of the hundreds of billions of dollars in this bill that will be borrowed and spent elsewhere, including foreign aid, we could have taken care of the unemployed in the United States at no additional cost.  So why is it that they have been omitted for the second year in a row? Last year we notified the Republican leadership and the President that unemployment is a problem outside the Beltway of Washington, D.C. People are exhausting their benefits and they need help. That fell on deaf ears here in the House. The Republican leaders refused to bring forward legislation to help the long-term unemployed. Finally, sometime between Christmas and New Year's, when these people were receiving notices that their benefits would no longer be coming, Merry Christmas, the President woke up and asked the Congress when it reconvened in January to extend benefits further.  Unfortunately, the leaders, again, here in the Congress, the Republican leaders, chose to bury deep in that reauthorization of extended unemployment benefits something called a look-back provision. What it says is if half the people in your State are unemployed today, you can get extended benefits. But if a year from today, you still only have half the people in your State unemployed, those benefits will expire. The look-back provision says your unemployment has to get worse before we will extend benefits again. Oregon and many other States are falling into this trap now. Our economy has not gotten significantly better. There are still many thousands of Oregonians unemployed who cannot find work. Many of them fall into this category of long-term unemployed. Thousands of them are going to see their benefits expire this month and tens of thousands more over the next couple of months. But because of this so-called look-back provision, they are no longer eligible to get unemployment benefits.  This is just extraordinary that this Congress would again think about leaving town for the Christmas and New Year's holidays and into the next year without authorizing extended unemployment benefits for tens of thousands of Oregonians and other Americans at no additional cost to taxpayers, just spending down those reserves in the unemployment trust fund.  But Congress, the Republican leaders, do not want to do that because that would make the obscene deficit look just a tiny bit bigger. We would not have to borrow that money to pay those benefits; but it would make their $300 billion or $500 billion, however you want to calculate it, if you calculate the fact that they are borrowing and spending every penny that is flowing into Social Security this year, no more lockbox around here, that money will be spent and borrowed and spent and borrowed and spent. But if you exclude that, we are in the $300 billion range, the largest deficit in the history of the United States and spending down the unemployment trust fund would, on paper, make it look bigger; but it would not be anything that would be borrowing to obligate future generations of Americans, unlike the hundreds of billions of other spending in this bill.  So Congress wants to do one thing for this country and one thing for some of the people who have the most merit and are hurting through no fault of their own in this so-called jobless recovery, people whose jobs have been exported, in the case of my district to Canada, Mexico and China, under the trade policies of this administration and, yes, the past administration, which I opposed. These people want to work. They are productive people. They are hardworking people. They are willing to work. They just cannot find a job in the jobless recovery. So let us just give them a little bit of help in the interim so they do not lose their home, so they can feed their kids, so they can keep the lights on.  Do not go home, Congress, until you extend unemployment benefits for all Americans.                          ____________________
