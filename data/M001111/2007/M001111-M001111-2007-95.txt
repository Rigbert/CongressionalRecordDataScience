 President, we are moving rapidly toward final passage on this critically important infrastructure bill. I thank all of our Senators for working with us in a very constricted timetable to get this very important bill to this point today. I especially thank Senator Bond, his staff, and my staff. I will thank them more after passage of the bill. But I particularly thank Senator Bond for his work on his side of the aisle for putting together this very important bill.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate insist on its amendment, request a conference on the disagreeing votes, and that the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees.
