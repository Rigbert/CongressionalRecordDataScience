Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to an outstanding craftsman and labor leader in my District. Lawrence Bankowski, retired President of the American Flint Glass Workers Union (AFGWU), left this world on April 10, 1999 at the age of 68 after a long and valiant struggle with cancer.  Born in Mt. Clemens, MI, Larry grew up in North Toledo, graduating from Woodward High School and attending the University of Toledo. He often worked up to three jobs at a time, and joined the AFGWU in 1955 when he went to work as a moldmaker for Ohio Permanent Mold Company, where he remained until 1973 when he was elected international union representative. He rose through the ranks in 25 years of dedicated service to the union, retiring as its International President in 1999. In representing the 121 year old AFGWU and its 18,000 members, Larry traveled to other countries, met with President Clinton, and served on the U.S. Department of Labor's Advisory Committee on Trade Negotiations. He always championed the cause of working people, constantly urging that U.S. companies' production remain in the United States and that trade laws benefit workers everywhere.  A very wise leader, Larry was diligent in his life long efforts and embodied the men and women he represented in the AFGWU. Throughout his years of service in the international union, he kept his focus on the needs of the rank and file, never losing sight that the men and women making up the AFGWU and their futures were what mattered most. He understood that union working men and women can unite to fight for their economic, social and political best interests.  Larry Bankowski was also a dedicated family man, relishing time spent with his wife, children, and grandchildren. In the years I have been privileged to know him, his wife Betty, or one of his children or grandchildren always accompanied him. There is no way to adequately express our heartfelt condolences to Betty, their children Carol, Kathy, and Karen, his sisters and brother and grandchildren. May you find comfort in knowing Larry is at peace, and lives in the light he left shining in each of you, and of us. His kindness, dedication, and gentlemanly demeanor make our community and world finer and more humane.                          ____________________
