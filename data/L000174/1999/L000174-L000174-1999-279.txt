The Senator from New York has sat on a number of conferences in the other body and now is a distinguished and respected Member of this body. He knows from that experience that conferences can take awhile, especially when you are dealing with criminal law. I recall the Senator from New York and I, when he served in the other body, on a major crime bill, sitting there until 5 or 6 o'clock in the morning, breaking for 45 minutes while we grabbed some breakfast, and going right back in around the clock again.  There is no guarantee if we went tonight that we could finish by August. If we wait until the last few days, it is almost impossible.
