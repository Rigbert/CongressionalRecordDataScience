Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Speaker, this is an example of the fact that there is bipartisan and bicameral cooperation in this Capitol. I think that the news media would kind of like to ignore the fact that sometimes we do get something done around here and do get something done that is good and that everybody agrees is good.  So in wishing everybody a merry christmas, happy new year, or happy holiday season, as the case may be, I would like to wish the news media equal joy and hope that they report the fact that we did do something that was really very difficult to accomplish in reauthorizing the Violence against Women Act and passing only the second reauthorization of Justice Department programs since 1980.
