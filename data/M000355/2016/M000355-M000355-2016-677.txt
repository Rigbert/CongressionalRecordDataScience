 President, if there is no further business to come before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned under the previous order under the provisions of S. Res. 493 as a further mark of respect to the late George V. Voinovich, former Senator from the State of Ohio, following the remarks of Senator Whitehouse.
