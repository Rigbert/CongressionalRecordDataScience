President, I am pleased to introduce a substitute text for S. 189, the 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act. I thank Commerce Committee Chairman McCain, Ranking Member Hollings, and my colleagues Senators Allen, Clinton and Lieberman for their tremendous bipartisan assistance and cooperation. With this bill, we pave the way for greater discoveries and applications in an area that will soon become a major economic driver for this country.  The 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act will provide a smart, accelerated, and organized approach to nanotechnology research, development, and education. This legislation will marshal America's nanotechnology efforts that are spread out across the State and Federal levels into one driving force. This bill will develop much needed strategic interagency cooperation and coordination through a National Nanotechnology Program. A National Nanotechnology Advisory Panel will advise the President on nanotechnology matters and the American Nanotechnology Preparedness Center will evaluate important workforce and ethical issues to ensure that societal and citizen concerns about nanotechnology are addressed now--at the outset of this science--and will support, not hinder, the development of this important science.  As I have said before, nanotechnology has the potential to change America on a scale equal to, if not greater than, the computer revolution. Nanoparticles and nanodevices will become the building blocks of our health care, agriculture, manufacturing, environmental cleanup, and even national security. By getting behind nanotechnology now with organized, goal-oriented support, the Federal Government will play a pivotal role in keeping the United States at the forefront of this discipline.  It is estimated that nanotechnology will become a trillion-dollar industry over the next 10 years. With the Nation's unemployment still high and real economic recovery still out of reach, nanotechnology holds the promise of new trade and jobs needed to jump start the economy. As the nanotechnology industry grows, the ranks of skilled workers needed to discover and apply its capabilities must grow too. In the nanotechnology revolution, areas of high unemployment could become magnets for domestic production, engineering and research for nanotechnology applications. I am determined that the United States will mine the opportunities of nanotechnology and this legislation will ensure that the United States takes full advantage of the opportunities nanotechnology presents.  Our Nation's current National Nanotechnology Initiative is a step in the right direction. This nation has already committed substantial funds to nanotechnology research and development in the coming years. But funding is not enough. There must be careful planning to make sure that money is used for sound science over the long-term. That is the reason for the substitute amendment to S. 189 I introduce today. The strategic planning it prescribes will ensure that scientists get the support they need to realize nanotechnology's greatest potential.  With this bill, Congress is challenging the government to accept new responsibilities in promoting and developing nanotechnology. Again, I thank the House Science Committee and House Science Chairman Boehlert for their cooperation and I thank the other cosponsors, Senators Alexander, Warner, Mikulski, Landrieu, Levin, Bayh, Cantwell, Corzine, Hutchison, Kerry, Lautenberg, Baucus, and Rockefeller, for their valuable assistance. I am also pleased to report that this amendment has the support of nanotechnology industry members, such as the Nano Business Alliance. This amended version is the work of bipartisan and bi-cameral cooperation and I look forward to working with my colleagues to get this to the President's desk.
