Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Jack Witten, a man with a distinguished record of military and private sector service. Mr. Witten's career has spanned decades and encompassed a number of notable accomplishments in the field of aeronautical engineering. Mr. Witten has also had an accomplished personal life that I am sure his seven Eagle Scout grandchildren can attest to.  It was Charles Lindbergh's 1927 flight over the Atlantic Ocean that initially sparked Mr. Witten's interest in aviation. After that historic flight, Mr. Witten began spending much of his time observing local airport hangars and taking in Army air shows and national air races in his boyhood home of Illinois. He spent many a Saturday afternoon hitchhiking to the hangars and air shows with his cousin Tom.  In 1938, Mr. Witten quit his steeple-jacking job and joined the Navy Reserve. He was put on active duty at the Wright Reynolds Airport in Glenville, Illinois almost immediately. There, he and his fellow reservists maintained a fleet of 26 aircraft and trained a reserve squadron of 400 men. During the course of his service in the Navy Reserve, Mr. Witten instructed, developed, and reorganized training programs in aircraft maintenance and engineering for both pilots and ex-GI's.  Mr. Speaker, Mr. Witten has also spent much of his career serving our area through his work for the Navy Bureau of Aeronautics at the Pax River Naval Air Station. Mr. Witten first came to Pax River in 1943, just six days after the air station was commissioned. He was able to realize his dream of both working and living on the Atlantic Coast when he and his family later moved to St. Mary's County. During his time at Pax River, Mr. Witten helped to establish aeronautical maintenance engineering as both a term and function.  Mr. Speaker, Mr. Witten has had a number of other notable accomplishments throughout his distinguished career. He created the Aircraft Maintenance Officer category of military service, established the annual meeting of the Depot Aeronautical Engineering Superintendents, revised contract requirements for military hardware design changes, and conducted materials review of new aircraft designs. Mr. Witten also instituted the use of improved aircraft testing techniques and devices, such as the spectrographic analysis of engine oil to detect failing engines, now in worldwide use byall militaries, and the use of high visibility paint to prevent collisions. Additionally, Mr. Witten made major revisions to the standard design specifications for naval aircraft to increase safety and reliability and to reduce maintenance man-hours.  Mr. Speaker, Mr. Witten's lifetime of achievement and service deserves recognition. I know the members of the House will join me in thanking Mr. Witten for over 60 years of service to the military and to our local area. I rise now to congratulate him on this tremendous record of achievement.                          ____________________
