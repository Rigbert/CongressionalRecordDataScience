President, I rise to commend my colleagues for including an extension of Temporary Protected Status for Liberians until September 30, 1999 in the Fiscal Year 1999 Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations bill.  The histories of Liberia and the United States have been intertwined since 1847 when our nation's founding fathers helped freed American slaves found the sovereign state of Liberia. The first Liberians adopted the U.S. Constitution as a model and named the capital of the new country Monrovia, after President James Madison. Diplomatic, military and trade relations flourished between the two countries until the late 1980's.  Then, in December 1989, Liberia was engulfed by a civil war that would last for seven years and continue to boil below the surface. Over 150,000 people died and more than one-half of the population fled the country or was internally displaced. During the conflict, food production was halted and the country's infrastructure was destroyed.  Several thousand Liberians who were forced from their homes because of the civil war sought refuge in the United States. In 1991, the Attorney General determined that Liberia was experiencing an ongoing armed conflict which prevented Liberian nationals from safely returning home. She granted Liberians who were present in the United States on March 27, 1991 temporary protected status (TPS), which provides temporary relief from deportation. Because the conflict in Liberia continued to rage, the Attorney General extended TPS each year for the next six years. Furthermore, conditions in Liberia deteriorated to such an extent in 1996, that the Attorney General ``redesignated'' TPS for Liberians who arrived after March 27, 1991 but were living in the United States on June 1, 1996. Never before in history had the Attorney General been compelled to redesignate a state for TPS.  Recently, however, the Attorney General declared that TPS would end for all Liberians on September 28, 1998. It is true that on July 19, 1997, Liberians elected former warlord Charles Taylor president and 300 international observers deemed the election free and fair. It is also true that this new government has pledged to rebuild the economy and reconcile the ethnic factions.  However, there are signs which indicate that Liberia is not as safe and stable as many would like to believe. In early December 1997, a prominent opposition leader was assassinated. Furthermore, a newspaper and two radio stations were temporarily shut down by the government.  A pastor of a church in my home state of Rhode Island had a conversation just yesterday with an individual who just returned from Liberia who stated that people in Liberia are afraid to criticize the government in any way. The secret police sweep neighborhoods at night, people disappear and bodies mingle with garbage under a bridge in Monrovia.  I would also like to relay the comments of Bishop Arthur Kulah to my colleagues who may wish to know why TPS is still needed. Bishop Kulah is a United Methodist leader who lost his parents and two brothers in the civil war. He recently spoke with Liberians living in Rhode Island and when they asked if it would be safe to return when TPS was terminated, he replied, ``People who have been fighting for ten years will not suddenly change. It may be quiet and then flare up overnight. The disarmament was not complete. People still have guns.''  This weekend the Liberian community in Rhode Island will celebrate the 151st anniversary of Liberia's independence. They will celebrate the history and culture of their country and look forward to the day when they can safely go home. But that time is not now, Mr. President. They came to this country seeking peace and security. We have an obligation to offer them refuge until it is truly safe to go back.
