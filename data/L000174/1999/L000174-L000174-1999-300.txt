President, today I rise to introduce the Computer Crime Enforcement Act. This legislation establishes a Department of Justice grant program to support state and local law enforcement officers and prosecutors to prevent, investigate and prosecute computer crime. I am pleased that Senator DeWine, with whom I worked closely and successfully last year on the Crime Identification Technology Act, and Senator Robb, who has long been a leader on law enforcement issues, support this bill as original cosponsors.  Computer crime is quickly emerging as one of today's top challenges for state and local law enforcement officials. A recent survey by the FBI and the Computer Security Institute found that 62% of information security professionals reported computer security breaches in the past year. These breaches in computer security resulted in financial losses of more than $120 million from fraud, theft of proprietary information, sabotage, computer viruses and stolen laptops. Computer crime has become a multi-billion dollar problem.  I am proud to report that the States, including my home state of Vermont, are reacting to the increase in computer crime by enacted tough computer crime control laws. For example, Vermont's new law makes certain acts against computers illegal, such as: accessing any computer system or data without permission; accessing a computer to commit fraud, remove, destroy or copy data or deny access to the data; damaging or interfering with the operation of the computer system or data; and stealing or destroying any computer data or system. These state laws establish a firm groundwork for electronic commerce, an increasingly important sector of the Vermont economy and of the nation's economy. Now all fifty states have enacted some type of computer crime statute.  Unfortunately, too many state and local law enforcement agencies are struggling to afford the high cost of enforcing their state computer crime statute. The Computer Crime Enforcement Act would provide a helping hand by authorizing a $25 million grant program to help the states receive Federal funding for improved education, training, enforcement and prosecution of computer crime. Our bill will help states take a byte out of computer crime.  Congress has recognized the importance of providing state and local law enforcement officers with the means necessary to prevent and combat cyber attacks and other computer crime through the FBI's Computer Analysis and Response Team (CART) Program and the National Infrastructure Protection Center. Our legislation would enhance that Federal role by providing each state with much-needed resources to join Federal law enforcement officials in collaborative efforts to fight computer crime.  In Vermont, for instance, only half a dozen law enforcement officers among the more than 900 officers in the state have been trained in investigating computer crimes and analyzing cyber evidence. As Detective Michael Schirling of the Chittenden Unit for Special Investigations recently observed in my home state: ``The bad guys are using computers at a rate that's exponentially greater than our ability to respond to the problem.'' Without the necessary educational training, technical support, and coordinated information, our law enforcement officials will be hamstrung in their efforts to crack down on computer crime.  Computers have ushered in a new age filled with unlimited potential for good. But the computer age has also ushered in new challenges for our state and local law enforcement officers. Let's provide our state and local partners in crime fighting with the resources that they need in the battle against computer crime.  I urge my colleagues to support the Computer Crime Enforcement Act and its quick passage into law.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Computer Crime Enforcement Act be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1314       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Computer Crime Enforcement      Act''.     SEC. 2. STATE GRANT PROGRAM FOR TRAINING AND PROSECUTION OF                    COMPUTER CRIMES.
