President, I rise to congratulate the people of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for taking another step down the long road towards peace. Last week the Saville Inquiry, the result of a 10-year investigation into the ``Bloody Sunday'' tragedy in Northern Ireland on January 30, 1972, was finally made public.  The inquiry definitively concluded that British Army soldiers were responsible for the shooting deaths of 14 pro-Catholic marchers. The terrible events, which took place against a backdrop of years of rioting, paramilitary violence and police brutality, contributed to increased hatred and mistrust on both sides, and led to over two more decades of violence and terror for the people of Northern Ireland.  The findings reversed those of a 1972 commission which had laid blame for the killings on the victims themselves. Parents passed away without the knowledge that their children killed that day were not at fault.  Upon the release of the new report, British Prime Minister David Cameron publicly accepted responsibility for the killings and apologized on behalf of his country for the unjustified actions of the Army. He acknowledged the great complexity engrained in the dozens of years of fighting in Northern Ireland--thousands of people were killed and terrible atrocities committed by all parties. But he also stated that the facts in this report cannot be overlooked: British Army soldiers unjustly took the lives of innocent civilians.  Self-reflection is an indispensable quality in a democracy. It is difficult for a nation to admit that the men and women protecting us are responsible for reprehensible acts, but it is undeniable that, in furtherance of truth and justice, no one in our society can be above the law.  Lasting peace comes about through the hard work, honesty and patience of those on all sides.  I extend my deepest condolences to the families of the victims and am grateful to them for their years of patience during the investigation.  I commend the people of Northern Ireland for their continued commitment to resolving their differences through the political process, as challenging as it often is, and working to leave behind the violent divisions of the past.  And I also applaud Prime Minister Cameron, the Inquiry, and the British people for acknowledging a painful truth after 38 years, and, in doing so, helping to further the cause of peace in Northern Ireland.  I ask unanimous consent that the Prime Minister's statement be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:        Statement to the House of Commons on the Saville Inquiry  (By the Prime Minister, the Rt Hon David Cameron MP on 15 June 2010)       With permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a      statement.       Today, my Rt Hon Friend, the Secretary of State for      Northern Ireland is publishing the report of the Saville      Inquiry . . .       . . . the Tribunal set up by the previous Government to      investigate the tragic events of 30th January 1972--a day      more commonly known as ``Bloody Sunday''.       We have acted in good faith by publishing the Tribunal's      findings as quickly as possible after the General Election.       Mr Speaker, I am deeply patriotic.       I never want to believe anything bad about our country.       I never want to call into question the behaviour of our      soldiers and our Army who I believe to be the finest in the      world.       And I have seen for myself the very difficult and dangerous      circumstances in which we ask our soldiers to serve.       But the conclusions of this report are absolutely clear.       There is no doubt. There is nothing equivocal. There are no      ambiguities.       What happened on Bloody Sunday was both unjustified and      unjustifiable.       It was wrong.       Lord Saville concludes that the soldiers of Support Company      who went into the Bogside ``did so as a result of an order .      . . which should have not been given'' by their Commander . .      .       . . . on balance the first shot in the vicinity of the      march was fired by the British Army . . .       . . . that ``none of the casualties shot by soldiers of      Support Company was armed with a firearm'' . . .       . . . that ``there was some firing by republican      paramilitaries . . . but . . . none of this firing provided      any justification for the shooting of civilian casualties'' .      . .       . . . and that ``in no case was any warning given before      soldiers opened fire''.       He also finds that Support Company ``reacted by losing      their self-control . . . forgetting or ignoring their      instructions and training'' with ``a serious and widespread      loss of fire discipline''.       He finds that ``despite the contrary evidence given by the      soldiers . . . none of them fired in response to attacks or      threatened attacks by nail or petrol bombers'' . . .       . . . and that many of the soldiers ``knowingly put forward      false accounts in order to seek to justify their firing''.       What's more--Lord Saville says that some of those killed or      injured were clearly fleeing or going to the assistance of      others who were dying.       The Report refers to one person who was shot while      ``crawling . . . away from the soldiers'' . . .       . . . another was shot, in all probability, ``when he was      lying mortally wounded on the ground''. . .       . . . and a father was ``hit and injured by Army gunfire      after he had gone to . . . tend his son''.       For those looking for statements of innocence, Saville      says:       ``The immediate responsibility for the deaths and injuries      on Bloody Sunday lies with those members of Support Company      whose unjustifiable firing was the cause of the those deaths      and injuries'' . . .       . . . and--crucially--that ``none of the casualties was      posing a threat of causing death or serious injury, or indeed      was doing anything else that could on any view justify their      shooting''.       For those people who were looking for the Report to use      terms like murder and unlawful killing, I remind the House      that these judgements are not matters for a Tribunal--or for      us as politicians--to determine.       Mr Speaker, these are shocking conclusions to read and      shocking words to have to say.       But Mr Speaker, you do not defend the British Army by      defending the indefensible.       We do not honour all those who have served with distinction      in keeping the peace and upholding the rule of law in      Northern Ireland by hiding from the truth.       So there is no point in trying to soften or equivocate what      is in this Report.       It is clear from the Tribunal's authoritative conclusions      that the events of Bloody Sunday were in no way justified.       I know some people wonder whether nearly forty years on      from an event, a Prime Minister needs to issue an apology.       For someone of my generation, this is a period we feel we      have learned about rather than lived through.       But what happened should never, ever have happened.       The families of those who died should not have had to live      with the pain and hurt of that day--and a lifetime of loss.       Some members of our Armed Forces acted wrongly.       The Government is ultimately responsible for the conduct of      the Armed Forces.       And for that, on behalf of the Government--and indeed our      country--I am deeply sorry.       Mr. Speaker, just as this Report is clear that the actions      of that day were unjustifiable . . . so too is it clear in      some of its other findings.       Those looking for premeditation, those looking for a plan,      those looking for a conspiracy involving senior politicians      or senior members of the Armed Forces--they will not find it      in this Report.       Indeed, Lord Saville finds no evidence that the events of      Bloody Sunday were premeditated . . .       . . . he concludes that the United Kingdom and Northern      Ireland Governments, and the Army, neither tolerated nor      encouraged ``the use of unjustified lethal force''.       He makes no suggestion of a Government cover-up.       And Lord Saville credits the UK Government with working      towards a peaceful political settlement in Northern Ireland.       Mr Speaker, the Report also specifically deals with the      actions of key individuals in the army, in politics and      beyond . . .       . . . including Major General Ford, Brigadier MacLellan and      Lieutenant Colonel Wilford.       In each case, the Tribunal's findings are clear.       It also does the same for Martin McGuinness.       It specifically finds he was present and probably armed      with a ``sub-machine gun'' but concludes ``we are sure that      he did not engage in any activity that provided any of the      soldiers with any justification for opening fire''.       Mr. Speaker, while in no way justifying the events of      January 30th 1972, we should acknowledge the background to      the events of Bloody Sunday.       Since 1969 the security situation in Northern Ireland had      been declining significantly.       Three days before `Bloody Sunday', two RUC officers--one a      Catholic--were shot by the IRA in Londonderry, the first      police officers killed in the city during the Troubles.       A third of the city of Derry had become a no-go area for      the RUC and the Army.       And in the end 1972 was to prove Northern Ireland's      bloodiest year by far with nearly 500 people killed.       And let us also remember, Bloody Sunday is not the defining      story of the service the British Army gave in Northern      Ireland from 1969-2007.       This was known as Operation Banner, the longest, continuous      operation in British military history, spanning thirty-eight      years and in which over 250,000 people served.       Our Armed Forces displayed enormous courage and      professionalism in upholding democracy and the rule of law in      Northern Ireland.       Acting in support of the police, they played a major part      in setting the condi-     tions that have made peaceful politics pos-     sible . . .       . . . and over 1,000 members of the security forces lost      their lives to that cause.       Without their work the peace process would not have      happened.       Of course some mistakes were undoubtedly made.       But lessons were also learned.       Once again, I put on record the immense debt of gratitude      we all owe those who served in Northern Ireland.       Mr. Speaker, may I also thank the Tribunal for its work--     and all those who displayed great courage in giving evidence.       I would also like to acknowledge the grief of the families      of those killed.       They have pursued their long campaign over thirty-eight      years with great patience.       Nothing can bring back those that were killed but I hope,      as one relative has put it, the truth coming out can set      people free.       John Major said he was open to a new inquiry.       Tony Blair then set it up.       This was accepted by the then Leader of the Opposition.       Of course, none of us anticipated that the Saville Inquiry      would last 12 years or cost K200 million.       Our views on that are well documented.       It is right to pursue the truth with vigour and      thoroughness . . .        . . . but let me reassure the House that there will be no      more open-ended and costly inquiries into the past.       But today is not about the controversies surrounding the      process.       It's about the substance, about what this report tells us.       Everyone should have the chance to examine the complete      findings--and that's why the report is being published in      full.       Running to more than 5000 pages, it's being published in 10      volumes.       Naturally, it will take all of us some time to digest the      report's full findings and understand all the implications.       The House will have the opportunity for a full day's debate      this autumn--and in the meantime I have asked my Rt Hon      Friends the Secretaries of State for Northern Ireland and      Defence to report back to me on all the issues that arise      from it.       Mr Speaker, this report and the Inquiry itself demonstrate      how a State should hold itself to account . . .        . . . and how we are determined at all times--no matter      how difficult--to judge ourselves against the highest      standards.       Openness and frankness about the past--however painful--do      not make us weaker, they make us stronger.       That's one of the things that differentiates us from      terrorists.       We should never forget that over 3,500 people--people from      every community--lost their lives in Northern Ireland, the      overwhelming majority killed by terrorists.       There were many terrible atrocities.       Politically-motivated violence was never justified,      whichever side it came from.       And it can never be justified by those criminal gangs that      today want to drag Northern Ireland back to its bitter and      bloody past.       No Government I lead will ever put those who fight to      defend democracy on an equal footing with those who continue      to seek to destroy it.       But neither will we hide from the truth that confronts us      today.       In the words of Lord Saville--       ``What happened on Bloody Sunday strengthened the      Provisional IRA, increased nationalist resentment and      hostility towards the Army and exacerbated the violent      conflict of the years that followed. Bloody Sunday was a      tragedy for the bereaved and the wounded, and a catastrophe      for the people of Northern Ireland.''       These are words we can not and must not ignore.       But what I hope this Report can also do is to mark the      moment when we come together, in this House and in the      communities we represent.       Come together to acknowledge our shared history, even where      it divides us.       And come together to close this painful chapter on Northern      Ireland's troubled past.       That is not to say that we must ever forget or dismiss that      past.       But we must also move on.       Northern Ireland has been transformed over the past twenty      years . . .        . . . and all of us in Westminster and Stormont must      continue that work of change, coming together with all the      people of Northern Ireland to build a stable, peaceful,      prosperous and shared future.       It is with that determination that I commend this statement      to the House.                          ____________________
