As always, he is courteous and helpful, as is the Senator from California. That is fine with me. Obviously, they are entitled to all the time they want.  I should note, again, in my comments, the distinguished Senator from Arizona and the distinguished Senator from California were working, actually moving the ball forward. The debate was not lost because it gave people an opportunity to state their positions. They were working in an effort to move us closer to a vote. I appreciate that.  I yield the floor.
