 President, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today to report some sad news to my Senate colleagues. On June 29, 2014, Mr. George Carnes Jr. of Walker, KY, passed away at the age of 87.  George was born on November 3, 1926, to George and Mossie Bargo Carnes. In the aftermath of the Second World War, he served his country as a part of the U.S. Army's German occupation force.  Upon returning from Germany, George married Lena Shelton on a summer day in 1953. Family was paramount in George's life, and the two were happily married for 52 years until Lena's passing. Together they had, and are survived by, three children Alene Foley, Sandra Howard, and George Carnes III.  I am fortunate to know well one of his four grandchildren, Andrew Howard, who is on my staff, and to see firsthand the product of George's influence. George loved most of all spending time with his family, whether it was discussing the latest Kentucky basketball and Cincinnati Reds news, passing down his farming techniques, or simply playing with his two great-grandchildren.  George was also a man of great faith. As an ordained Baptist minister, he was a member of the Salt Gum Baptist Church and former pastor of the Moore's Creek Baptist Church.  George was an exemplary citizen who served his country honorably, was devoted to his church and community, and loved his family. I ask that my Senate colleagues join me in paying tribute to George Carnes Jr.  Mr. President, Hopper Funeral Home, Inc. recently published in area newspapers an obituary for Mr. Carnes.
