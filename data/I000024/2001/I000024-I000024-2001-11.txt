That is a very significant issue. One of the best programs Congress put together was way back in the 1950s. That was whenthey made a determination that if the Federal Government came in and federalized land, either for military purposes, Indian schools, or any other purpose, and took the land off the tax rolls, they would still have to educate the kids. Slowly over the years, politicians--none in this Chamber, I am sure--have been taking money out of the impact aid account, so it has gone down to about 25 percent of what it really should be.  I will be offering that amendment and wanting to discuss it.  (The further remarks of Mr. Inhofe are located in today's Record under ``Morning Business.'')
