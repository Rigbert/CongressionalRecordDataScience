Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, this really is an overkill amendment. I think that the increases that are contained in the underlying bill will be sufficient to act as a deterrent. I think we all know as far as the border security situation is concerned, we have to put more efforts on the border to prevent illegal aliens from coming across. We also have to turn off the magnet of employment of illegal aliens in the United States. The employer verification system turns off the magnet. The increase in the fines for not using the employer verification system or hiring illegal aliens are sufficient to act as a deterrent.  I can tell you that our courts are going to be tied up horrendously because everybody who gets a citation for violating the law under Mr. Gonzalez's amendment is going to ask for a trial by jury, and I doubt we will ever be able to get very much of the money that he thinks we are going to collect.  I think what is in the underlying bill is able to do the trick. I would like to challenge those who are making the argument that we have got to get tough on the border and we have got to get tough with employers to turn off the magnet. When the time comes to vote for passage of the bill, vote ``aye.''  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gonzalez).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.
