President, I rise today to honor the service of my friend and colleague Sam Brownback. Sam was elected to the House of Representatives in 1994 during the Republican Revolution and was subsequently elected to the Senate 2 years later when former majority leader Bob Dole made his bid for the White House.  It has been both a privilege and a pleasure serving alongside Sam during these past 16 years. All of us who seek public service want to make a difference, and most certainly, Sam Brownback has done that. In these endeavors I have enjoyed working with Sam in achieving some note worthy accomplishments for our State of Kansas. As I reflect upon our mutual efforts, it is hard to figure out who was driving the stage and who was riding shotgun. Simply put, it has been a team effort, and I have been both humbled and proud to work with my colleague who has provided unique and respected leadership. Sam's record speaks for itself: bringing the Big Red One back home to Fort Riley, KS, where it started and now belongs; bringing the National Bio- and Agro-Defense Facility, NBAF, to Manhattan, KS; ensuring fair treatment of the general aviation industry in FAA bills; and working together to rebuild Greensburg, KS, after 95 percent of the community was literally blown away by an EF5 tornado.  But beyond our work together on State specific issues, it is Sam's Federal legislative initiatives that I think will have the longest impact on the Senate and the lives of so many people, pot only within Kansas and our Nation but, indeed, around the world.  Since the late 1970s, the term ``compassionate conservative'' has been tossed around quite a bit to describe a philosophy--a philosophy that states by applying conservative ideals, our government can best improve the welfare of our society. I think many of my colleagues would agree that if anyone in public service over the past 30 years embodies this philosophy, it would be Sam Brownback.  What is unique about Sam and his approach to politics these past 16 years is that his ideas went beyond words and rhetoric. The Sam Brownback approach was simple but effective. He applied his beliefs to action, reflected by the many legislative accomplishments he championed during his tenure in the Senate.  Sam is a big believer in forgiveness and second chances. How to put that belief into action? Sam introduced a bill that really shows his heart for those in society who many times are not given an opportunity to make amends: the Second Chance Act.  Signed into law during the Bush administration, this act created a grant program for State and local governments to fund job training and family mentoring programs to help reintegrate past offenders as they are granted release back into society.  But Sam's legislative victories did not focus solely on domestic issues. Sam has a great love for the continent of Africa.  Serving on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he traveled to Africa on multiple occasions to gain a better understanding of how he could help provide relief to those most vulnerable. His experiences led him to champion the Darfur Peace and Accountability Act of 2006. Enacted that same year, this law created sanctions against individuals and groups responsible for the terrible crime of genocide in Darfur, while establishing measures to protect civilians and humanitarian efforts within the borders of Sudan.  The more Sam did, the more he felt called to do, and no one did more for the protection of victims of human trafficking than Sam. In 2000, he helped enact the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. This law created criminal punishments for individuals caught in the United States operating as traffickers. It established an annual reporting mechanism to help track individuals engaged in sex trafficking and created a new immigration status for victims of sex trafficking.  Lastly, I believe Sam's prominence during his time in the Senate had a great deal to do with his willingness to work across party lines on issues where he could seek and find common passion and ground.  The legislative item I think will leave the largest impact on many of us in the Senate is the bill upon which he worked tirelessly with the late Senator Ted Kennedy.  Signed into law by President Bush, the Prenatally and Postnatally Diagnosed Conditions Act provides those families with children diagnosed with Down Syndrome the support services and networks they need to help them deal with the unique challenges they face. Put another way, what better legislation to help protect the lives of those in our Nation uniquely challenged but who deserve every right to the same opportunities we all enjoy everyday.  I could easily and proudly recount many more of Sam's achievements during his time in the Senate, but I would do so in danger of Sam saying ``enough'' and giving me ``the hook.'' I have often said that the high road of humility is not often bothered by heavy traffic in Washington, but in Sam Brownback, we have indeed enjoyed the friendship of a humble man.  In closing, I leave my colleagues with one of Senator Brownback's favorite quotes that I think sums up the man that Sam is and the love he has for all people, regardless of their nationality or place in society.  Sam likes to say: `` I am pro-life and whole-life. Applying this belief to the child in the womb and to the child in Darfur. It includes the man in prison and the woman in poverty. It does not fail to cherish the child with Down syndrome or stand for the inherent dignity of the immigrant.''  Sam, I remember the first campaign rally we attended together. The featured guest speaker, Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, introduced me as one who made significant changes in the House of Representatives and then introduced Sam as: ``One who not only wants to change things, but to make the right changes.''  Sam, you have done just that and it has been an honor to serve with you over these past 16 years. I thank you for your courtesy, cooperation, leadership, example and your friendship and support. As you head west, my friend, to lead our beloved State of Kansas, I look forward to continued cooperation and success. The people of Kansas are in good hands. God bless.                             arlen specter
