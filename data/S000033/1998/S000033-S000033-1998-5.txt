 Speaker, let me begin by expressing my strong objection to the current legislative process in the House. Some day soon, we do not know, maybe tomorrow, maybe Friday, maybe Saturday, eight appropriations bills, which as I understand it will add up to some $500 billion, will be dumped into one omnibus bill. Members here, with relatively little knowledge as to what is in that legislation, are going to vote for it. I think that is a pretty poor process.  What is of particular concern to me is that within that huge omnibus bill will be, as I understand it, an $18 billion appropriation for the expansion of the IMF, the International Monetary Fund.  Now, it seems to me that in a time when we are cutting back on veterans' benefits, when 43 million Americans have no health care, when millions of middle-class families are unable to afford to send their kids to college, that maybe, just maybe, we might want to have an open debate upon the wisdom of putting $18 billion of taxpayers' money into the IMF. Maybe we would like to hear the pros and the cons of that discussion. Maybe we would like to see an up-or-down vote on that issue. But I guess that is not going to happen.  Mr. Speaker, President Clinton wants the IMF. The gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Gingrich) wants the IMF. Every large multinational corporation in this country wants the IMF. The corporate media wants the IMF. And, I guess, they are going to get the IMF without any serious debate.  But let me just say a few words about the IMF. I happen to agree with those people who say that the international economy is in a fragile state right now and that the United States has got to act. I disagree with those people who say that the solution is to pour more money into the IMF.  In my opinion, if recent history is any indicator of what might happen in the future, giving more money to the IMF might only make a bad situation, an unstable situation even worse. All we have to do is take a hard look at what has happened throughout the world in those countries which the IMF has ``helped'' to understand that maybe the IMF path is not the road that we want to go down.  They ``helped'' the people of Mexico several years ago. Today, as a result or partially as a result of their help, the Mexican economy is in disastrous condition. Wages are down. Unemployment and child labor are up. And their Congress in Mexico is now addressing a massive bailout of their banking system.  But something did happen out of the Mexican bailout of several years ago. That is that the investors that we bailed out, the large banks and speculators, learned a very important lesson. They learned that the taxpayers of the United States would be there no matter how ill-advised or stupid their investments might be, no matter how much money they might lose. No problem, Uncle Sam was there to bail them out.  They took that lesson to Asia, and they continued that process. They pumped huge sums of money into Thailand and Malaysia and Indonesia and South Korea. And then, when that part of the world began to suffer, no problem, the President, Mr. Rubin and Mr. Summers and everyone said well, we have got to bail them out again, and we bailed them out again.  We bailed out major banks and financial investors because we do not want them to lose any money. Small businesspeople, family farmers, hey, they can lose money. But when it's the Chase Manhattan Bank, they are not supposed to lose money. They only make money, I suppose.  Then the meltdown in Russia began. Poor Russia. It is incredible that a great country with such a tragic history has got to suffer all over again. When communism fell in 1991, the Russian Government received the attention and the guidance of the IMF and all of their wonderful policy advisors. Tragically, the Russian Government listened to them and took their advice. It is fair to say that never before in modern history has a major industrialized Nation experienced the kind of decline in a 7-year period as Russia has under IMF guidance and with $20 billion of IMF loans.  Mr. Speaker, those people who are asking our taxpayers for $18 billion in order to expand the functioning of the IMF are telling us that the global economy is in a fragile state, economic contagion is a reality, and that the United States could well suffer if the crisis in the global economy is not addressed.  Well, let me say this, I believe that the global economy is in a fragile state, economic contagion is a reality, and that the United States could well suffer if the crisis in the global economy is not addressed. But I very strongly differ with our friends who believe that another $18 billion will make the situation better. In my opinion, if recent history is any indicator of what might happen in the future, giving more money to the IMF will only make a bad situation worse. Four years ago when Mexico was in dire economic circumstances Mr. Rubin, Mr. Greenspan, President Clinton, Mr. Gingrich, corporate America, and all of the Corporate media told us that we would have to pony-up and bail out investors who had lost money in that country. We were told that if Mexico went under the contagion would spread, and there would be an international economic disaster would occur. Well, some of us fought very hard against that bail out, but we lost. Today, the Mexican economy is in disastrous condition, wages are way down, unemployment and child labor are way up, and their congress is now addressing a massive bail out of their banking system.  But something did happen out of the Mexican bailout, the investors that we bailed out,the large banks and speculators, learned a very important lesson. They learned that the taxpayers of this country would be there to make sure that no matter how stupid or ill-advised Uncle Sam and the American taxpayers were there to protect their interests. And, with that knowledge in mind, these reckless and irresponsible international investors poured huge sums of money into Asia and Russia--with the full confidence that the U.S. Government and the IMF would be there to bail them out again if they suffered any losses.  Last year, when Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and South Korea suffered their economic meltdown, Mr. Rubin, Mr. Greenspan, Newt Gingrich, President Clinton, and corporate America, were chanting their mantra again. And in unison they cried out ``Let's bailout the banks and financial investors who lost money doing business in Asia because if we don't the contagion will spread.'' And, against my vote and my strong opposition, the IMF bailed out Asia.  And then the meltdown in Russia began. Poor Russia. It is incredible that a great country with such a tragic history has got to suffer again. When communism fell in 1991, the Russian government received the attention and the guidance of the IMF and all of their brilliant policy advisors, and tragically the Russian government listened to them and took their advice. It is fair to argue that never before in modern history has a major industrialized nation experienced the kind of decline in a seven-year period as Russia has under IMF guidance, and with $20 billion of IMF loans.  In Russia today millions of workers are unpaid, old people do not receive their pensions, and hunger and malnutrition are very serious concerns. Russia's GDP has fallen by at least 50 percent, capital investment by 90 percent, and meat and dairy livestock herds by 75 percent. A nation that, despite their inefficient and bureaucratic system, used to be one of the great agricultural and manufacturing producers in the world now imports a majority of its food and produces almost nothing. And, as we all know, Russia has recently defaulted on its loans.  Meanwhile, in Russia a handful of people who have accumulated billions of dollars, much of it illegally and through swindles, have enormous power over that country which is rampant with corruption. At a hearing that Spencer Bachus and I held last week, two economists from Russia, one from the left and one from the right, both stated that it would be foolish to give the IMF money because that money would simply disappear in corruption and not help the Russian people.  Given the horrendous record of the IMF in making life worse for the people of Mexico, worse for the people of Asia, worse for the people of Russia--not to mention all of the suffering that ``austerity programs'' have caused in Africa and Latin America, why in God's name would anyone want to continue along the incredible path of failure that has been developed by the IMF?  Now I should add, however, that while the taxpayers of this country are at risk for IMF expenditures, and while people throughout the world are suffering as a result of IMF policy, not everybody gets hurt. In country after country where IMF policy has developed, the richest people in those countries invariably become richer, and we now have the absurd situation in which 358 of the wealthiest people in the world own more wealth than the bottom 45 percent of the worlds population, or 2.3 billion.  The United States cannot turn its back on the world's economy, and we must address the very serious economic situation which is unfolding, but we must do it in a new way. Our goal must be to develop sustainable economies in countries throughout the world, not boom or bust economies designed to make foreign investors rich. Our goal must be to make the United States an ally of the poor and the hungry, not a spokesman for the rich, the powerful, and the corrupt.  Mr. Chairman, this is the opinion of Bernie Sanders. Now let me quote from some other sources about the role that the IMF has played. ``It's only a bit of an overstatement to say that the free-market, IMF, Bob Rubin, and Larry Summers, model is in shambles,'' said John S. Wadsworth, Jr. who runs Morgan Stanley's operations in Asia.  According to a Wall Street Journal editorial from July 20, 1998 ``The IMF helped create the very crisis that Mr. Camdessus says he now needs more money to solve.'' According to Congressman Carlos Heredia, representing 126 deputies in the Mexican Congress, ``Contrary to the view promulgated by the Clinton administration and the U.S. media, the packaging of 12.5 billion from the ESF and 17.8 billion from the International Monetary Fund to bail out Mexico benefited only foreign investors and a small group of already wealthy Mexican investors while wreaking havoc on our national economy.''  A letter from 140 American and international environmental groups, labor unions, and development organizations says and I quote, ``the disastrous impact of IMF-imposed policies on workers rights, environmental protection, and economic growth and development; the crushing debt repayment burden of poor countries as a result of IMF policies; and the continuing secrecy of IMF operations provide ample justification for denying increased funding to the IMF.''                          ____________________
