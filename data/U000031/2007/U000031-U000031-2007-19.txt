Chairman, we don't intend to take very much of our time. We have debated this amendment on each of the appropriation bills thus far. We have been very fortunate to have the support of Mr. Obey and Mr. Lewis and all the subcommittee chairmen and ranking members.  I offer this with my friend and colleague, Ms. Harman, along with Mr. English and Mr. Lipinski. It is a bipartisan amendment simply requiring that the Federal Government, beginning on October 1, purchase only ENERGY STAR light bulbs.  This will be a savings of hundreds of millions of dollars to the taxpayers over the course of the year, and it is something that has enjoyed, again, wide bipartisan support. I don't need to debate it further.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the ayes appeared to have it.
