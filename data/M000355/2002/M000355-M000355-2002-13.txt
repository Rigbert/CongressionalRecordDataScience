 The Senator from Kentucky controls 1 minute 30 seconds.  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Senator from Missouri for his solid work. Disenfranchised by this bill are dogs such as Gidget--Salish's Potomac Fervour--pictured here in front of the Capitol. A solid Republican, Gidget will nevertheless never know the joy of participating in the election process. I am advised she could have been a fine voter--with a vigorous appetite for punchcards and aptitude for touch-screens. These skills will now have to be channeled into canine agility trials, instead of the election process. I congratulate the Senator from Missouri for that. That is one of the many fine results of this outstanding piece of legislation which, regretfully, is one of the few pieces of legislation the second session of the 107 Congress has passed.  We will have passed only 2 of our 13 appropriations bills. We have no budget and no terrorism reinsurance bill. It has really been a dismal record. But we do have something to be thankful for today, which is that we are about to pass an extraordinarily important piece of legislation on an overwhelmingly bipartisan basis. This is, indeed, the way the Senate should work.
