President, Henry and Gloria Jarecki are two of my longest and best friends. I speak, of course, both because of our personal friendship, but also of their efforts with the important Scholar Rescue Fund, a program designed to provide fellowships for scholars whose are persecuted or threatened at home for the important work they do. This commitment is especially poignant, when considering that, as a child, Henry fled the Holocaust in Germany, ultimately settling in the United States.  Both Henry and Gloria have worked to bring about recognition and understanding of people of different races, religions, and cultures. To me, Henry has been more than just a friend. He has been a mentor and a confidant. Some of the happiest times for Marcelle and me have been with Henry and Gloria.  Dr. Henry Jarecki recently received the Order of Merit, Officer's Cross, in Heidelberg, Germany. The Order of Merit is the only federal decoration in the Federal Republic of Germany. This high honor is befitting not only of Henry's history, but of his long dedication to promoting the simple but sometimes difficult principles of freedom and liberty.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of Dr. Henry Jarecki's moving remarks upon receiving this prestigious honor be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:   Dr. Henry Jarecki: Acceptance of Order of Merit, Officer's Cross--                           November 17, 2016                             OPENING THANKS       It is a great honor to receive this award from the      President of the Federal Republic of Germany, Joachim Gauck,      a leader honored by Germany for transforming his experiences      with totalitarianism into support for freedom, human rights,      and democracy. Thank you, Minister Bauer and Mayor Wurzner,      for presenting it to me. Thanks also to Rektor Eitel for his      thoughtful welcome. Let me also thank two special individuals      who have played a prominent role in this award: the former      Consul General of Germany to New York, Busso von Alvensleben,      who is here with us tonight, and the current Consul General      of Germany to New York, Brita Wagener.       I am of course thrilled to have so many friends and members      of my family here with me at this special event, including my      sons Andrew, Tom, and Nick and my grandsons Alexander and      Tyler. Most of all, I acknowledge my wife, Gloria. It was on      this very day in 1957 that the lovely Gloria Friedland became      my. wife After 59 years of marriage, I think she deserves her      own award!                                  SYMMETRY       This is a very personal moment for me. When I look at my      life, I see that it has been defined by one thing: the desire      to make unruly things symmetrical, to smooth over the bumps      of life, and to identify and align the parts that do not fit.       This is how I made sense of the events that first took me      away from Germany and have now brought me back, accepting an      award in this most distinguished Alte Aula.       Over 75 years ago, I had to flee in fear from this very      country that is now presenting me with this great honor. The      Hitler regime had come to power less than three months before      my birth, gaining strength by finding scapegoats for the      troubles of the German people that were caused by World War I      and the peace treaty, and from the ensuing inflation and      depression. The Nazis alleged that the country's defeat,      hunger, and chaos were due to traitors and to Jews, whom they      called foreigners despite the fact that they had been in      Germany ever since the Romans drove them here in the 70th      year of the Christian Era. My family, which could trace      itself back for generations, was unwilling to believe that      this land of Goethe and Heine could be governed by a nativist      group of criminals: ``Surely they can't mean us,'' my family      said. But they did.       We didn't believe it until we had all been arrested and      stripped of almost everything we owned. Only then did we      flee, first to England and then to America. America welcomed      us, as it usually does welcome refugees, despite the      occasional internal bigot. This rescue and welcome gave us      the opportunity to transform ourselves into hard-working      patriots.       The Nazis had forced us out of Germany but they couldn't      force the German out of us. We held on to our roots. We held      on to some of the language, especially after we heard our      parents lapse into German when telling each other secrets.      ``Aber nicht vor den Kindem.'' Our father taught us skat and      told us about Heidelberg, where he had studied before going      to the front in the First World War.       Unlike some of our fellow refugees, we made sense of what      had happened not by rejecting Germany but by re-engaging with      it as soon as we possibly could. In fact, my brother and I      returned to Heidelberg in 1951 to pursue the same medical      studies as our father had.       Doing so was our way of re-assuming our character as      Germans. Philipp Schwartz, the Frankfurt professor of      pathology who fled to Zurich in 1933 and rescued over 1,000      dismissed German scholars, years later said of his work: ``We      committed ourselves to represent the true spirit of the      German nation to the world.''       This re-engagement, which brought my past and present into      alignment, is the reason for my award today. In seeking to      make the different parts of my life fit, I have engaged      actively with both the city of Heidelberg and the city of New      York. I have looked for ways to further strengthen the U.S.-     Germany relationship. And I have felt perfectly at home in      both places, perhaps, as my wife and closest friends would      say, just a bit more exuberantly in Germany, like the      eighteen-year-old I was when I found myself in my lost      homeland.                                REFUGEES       My U.S.-German outlook, as well as my own personal      experience as both a refugee and an academic, give me a      unique perspective on what is happening in Germany today and      have brought me to a new initiative, about which I will tell      you in a few minutes.       Germany finds itself at the center of a new refugee crisis,      and this time the country is courageously doing what it can      to help. There were 60 million people displaced after the      Second World War, 21/2% of the world's then-prevailing      population. Today, there are 65 million refugees among the      world's 7 billion people, less than 1%. The proportion makes      today's situation sound better than it is, however. After      World War II, most refugees were resettled within a few      years. Today, a refugee's average stay in a camp is over 15      years.       During both times, refugees (we called ourselves ``refs'')      remained controversial. Some people think of them only as      weak, poor, and burdensome. Others think they are smart      opportunists or terrorists just waiting for the chance to      become violent or, at the very least, take our jobs.       We need an alternative narrative. I propose this: Germany's      new incoming refugees are smart, strong, ambitious, and      young. Our support of them now will yield great results for      Germany into the future.       Throughout history, such refugee flows have always been      with us. The world has in fact made the best of them; it has      come to use them like an accelerated form of Darwinian      natural selection. Faced with the turmoil and xenophobia that      is a never-ending part of our flawed psyches and world, only      the strongest and smartest, the most resilient and the      hardest workers, are able to re-establish themselves. The      philosopher Lin-Manuel Miranda, speaking of Alexander      Hamilton, said it well: ``Immigrants get the job done.''       Their youth is part of their strength. Over two-thirds of      them are below the age of 33. Germany's rapidly aging      population makes these migrants just the people Germany needs      for its future. They are, moreover, ambitious, smart, and      anxious to learn.                        COMMITMENT TO HEIDELBERG       My own life serves as an example of the accelerated natural      selection premise.       As I mentioned before, Heidelberg readily welcomed me and      my family and gave me an education that made me thrive. We      have done what we could to reciprocate. Soon after he came to      office, I asked the Mayor what I could do to express my      gratitude. He suggested that I help to develop a dilapidated      rail yard into a science campus that would attract talent      from all over the world.       Over the past few years and through the Max Jarecki      Foundation, Tony and I have worked with a dedicated team to      develop a whole new part of the city--the Bahnstadt. I thank      Mayor Wurzner, his chief of staff Nicole Huber, Giles      Hemmings, who manages the Max Jarecki Foundation, Tobias      Wellensiek, who is not only our legal advisor but also the      son of my friend of 60 years Jobst Wellensiek, and city      officials who have helped make our Bahnstadt project a      reality--including Mr. Mevius, Mr. Dietz, and Mrs.      Friedrich--for their help. The Bahrtstadt is one of the      greenest developments in this country, with full access to      new technologies, and within minutes of Heidelberg's      preeminent educational institutions. This project is a      great example of Heidelberg's successful integration of      tradition and innovation, science and business, the past      and the future. As the British writer G.K. Chesterton      said, ``Tradition means not that the living are dead; it      means that the dead come alive.''       I am fortunate to have had an outstanding team facilitating      our efforts. This team has been led by the talented Tony      Detre, who took the ideas proposed by the Mayor and helped to      make them a reality. I simply could not have done this work      without him.       Today, I would like to make several new commitments to the      city and the university and to undertake a new partnership      with the state.       Earlier today, we dedicated a new creativity-oriented      adventure playground in the Emmertsgrund, a part of the city      in which many families of modest means live, many of them      from immigrant and refugee backgrounds.       Just as Mayor Wurzner repeatedly looks for new ways for us      to help our city, Rektor Eitel finds new ways for us to      collaborate in the development of the university. He started      by taking me to see the dilapidated Anatomy building and      asked me to help restore it. He now asks for help in      refurbishing the University's Max Weber House, an important      part of Heidelberg's recent intellectual history. I point out      to my many American guests that this university, my alma      mater, founded in 1386, is the oldest university in Germany.      It is indeed one of the oldest in the world. It, too, owes      its existence to refugees: it was the Great Schism of 1378      that made it possible for Heidelberg, a small city at the      time, to gain its own university. Two popes were elected that      year--one in Avignon by the French, and one in Rome by the      Italians. When Germany supported Rome and not France, German      students and teachers in Paris were thrown out, becoming      (yes, we see this again) academic refugees. This led to the      founding of the university, bringing to full circle its      willingness to take in today's refugees.                             SCHOLAR RESCUE       This brings me quite neatly to my final topic of the      evening: a scholar rescue partnership I wish to create with      the state of Baden-Wurttemberg.       My own scholar rescue work started in 2002. Drawing upon my      own background as an academic and a former refugee, I joined      together with several other trustees of New York's Institute      of International Education, or IIE, to form a new entity that      would respond to what seemed like an ever-present need to      rescue persecuted scholars. With IIE's long history of this      work in mind, and with the blessing of IIE's President, Dr.      Allan Goodman, who is here with us tonight, we formed the      Scholar Rescue Fund.       Over the past 14 years, IIE's Scholar Rescue Fund has saved      the lives and work of nearly 700 professors from 56      countries, placing them in over 350 safe haven universities      in more than 40 countries around the world, including      Germany. It was this work that led us, last year, to partner      with the Philipp Schwartz Initiative, fostered by Foreign      Minister Steinmeier and managed by the Alexander von Humboldt      Foundation with federal resources. I am pleased to see its      Director-General, Dr. Enno Aufderheide, and Director of      Strategy, Dr. Barbara Sheldon, here with us tonight. This      program enables German universities to host threatened      scholars from around the world, thus further emphasizing      Germany's role and status as a safe haven country.       As evidenced by the history of the University of      Heidelberg, this is a very old story. From the burning of the      great library of Alexandria, scholars have fled persecution      to safe havens, bringing their knowledge and skills with them      and greatly enriching academic life in their new homes. The      sack of Constantinople in the year 1204 caused its best      scholars to flee from Turkey to Europe, and is said to have      produced the European Renaissance. More recently, the U.S.      benefitted greatly from scientists and scholars expelled by      the Nazis, as did the Turkish higher education system, which      was rebuilt in the 1930s and 1940s by over 1,000 German      scholars. As collaborators of the Scholar Rescue Fund for the      past 10 years, Jordan's Prince Talal and Princess Ghida      valiantly made their country into a safe haven for Iraqi      scholars, welcoming hundreds of talented academics into their      universities. And now Germany has stepped up to help.       The need today is very great. Scholars around the world are      facing fresh repression and conflict. More scholars are      fleeing Iraq and Syria, a new crisis looms in Turkey, and      increasing threats to academics have emerged in countries as      diverse as Bangladesh and Ethiopia.       Today, I would like to tell you about developing a new      partnership. Over the past few weeks, several colleagues and      I have met with Theresia Bauer, Minister of Science, Research      and Art for the state of Baden-Wurttemberg, of which      Heidelberg is a part. We have discussed an innovative idea to      add to Germany's current scholar rescue efforts by joining      together SRF, private funds, and the state of Baden-     Wurttemberg. We are happy to have the Baden-Wurttemberg      Stiftung as a partner who, with the Ministry, will support a      new group of persecuted academics to be placed specifically      in this state. The supervisory board of the Baden-Wurttemberg      Stiftung just decided last week to join the program. I am      happy to welcome the Executive Director, Christoph Dahl,      today.       While the details of such a unique multi-lateral      partnership remain to be confirmed, and we all look forward      to guidance from our friends at the Humboldt Foundation, I      can say a few things. First, this very much follows in the      tradition of Baden-Wurttemberg, under Minister Bauer, showing      leadership on such issues, most recently with a new program      to provide scholarships to refugee students. Second, such a      new program makes best use of SRF's power to find and vet      persecuted academics from any country and every field. Third,      it shows both the power and promise of private philanthropy      to bring different groups together to find creative solutions      to urgent problems. It is just this type of collaborative      thinking that we need in our inter-connected world.       What we see now as a refugee problem may well become an      even greater deluge in the near future as climate change      devastates ever more of our planet, and technology enables      tyrants to maintain power more cruelly.       We live on a tiny ball spinning through a largely empty      space. And if we don't share this small world that we      inhabit, it will be its end. Building walls is futile;      equally bad, they put the people on each side into prisons,      no matter how prettily they are wall-papered.       We in the so-called first world are, with our ferocious      energy consumption, deeply implicated in the changes we see      today, and the greater ones we will see tomorrow. More and      more people will come to us, dragging their young children      across the seas and the mountains to come to a place they      don't know a continent away. We should feel deeply honored,      but we must live up to it. If we don't, the liberties they      hope we have will be lost to us all.       ``Giess Wasser zur Suppe und heiss alle willkommen'' (``Add      water to the soup and make everyone welcome'') is an old      German folk saying. Those ancestors well understood that a      meal cannot be enjoyed, a peace not maintained, and one's own      not protected without sharing and compromise. It is a bit of      German folk wisdom that has survived all imperializing      regimes and their detriments.       Once again, I thank you for the great honor of this award      and commit myself, in the spirit of true and authentic      partnership, to do this critical and urgent work together.                          ____________________
