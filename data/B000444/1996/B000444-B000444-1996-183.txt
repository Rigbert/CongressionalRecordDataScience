 President, let me explain briefly what this is. First, right now there is a statute of limitations that if you go out and impersonate Smokey the Bear, you have 5 years to track them down, if you write a bad check you have 5 years. If you make poison gas, if you make a chemical weapon, if you have a rocket propellant charge of more than 4 ounces, if you produce missiles and hide them in your garage, and they find them, without them being used, they only have a 3-year statute of limitations. So if they did not find them until 1 year after you have made them, you have 2 years. If they did not find them until 2\1/2\ years, you have 6 months. We want to make this a 5-year statute of limitations, just like impersonating Smokey the Bear.  This is mindless not to do this when you are talking about making poison gas and chemical weapons and grenade launchers.
