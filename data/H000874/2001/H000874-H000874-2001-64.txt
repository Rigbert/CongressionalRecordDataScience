Speaker, further reserving the right to object, I, of course, concur in the Chairman's characterization of the resolution.  It is appropriate that we authorize the use of the rotunda of the Capitol, the center and heart of this Nation's Capitol, to remember those who have paid the final price for living in freedom and defending freedom.  Our democracy, of course, will not crumble in the face of this disaster. Our democracy will endure this test and emerge stronger and more dedicated to freedom and justice throughout the world.  We do this to honor and remember those of our fellow citizens, those who live among us who perished yesterday, and those whose lives have been forever changed by grievous acts of cowardice.
