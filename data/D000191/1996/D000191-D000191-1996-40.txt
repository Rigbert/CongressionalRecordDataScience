Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I was a county commissioner when we were in tough budget times, and despite the Federal share, we eliminated the Animal Damage Control Program in a county as large as the State of Connecticut with an extensive livestock industry, and we heard that there was going to be cataclysm, all of these deaths were going to occur of the livestock.  Mr. Chairman, know what happened? Nothing. Nothing. There were no additional deaths in the livestock, the sheep, or the cattle industry, in a county the size of Connecticut, when we did away with this program with its indiscriminate killing of predators. In fact, it reduced other pest species such as rodents and things which the coyotes primarily prey upon.  The gentleman talked about human health and safety. There is a line item in the ADC budget for human health and safety. If that line item at $3,197,040 is inadequate, then I would certainly join with the gentleman in a unanimous-consent request to shift some of the funds into that line item. But it has its own line item. This is only the livestock line item that is affected here.
