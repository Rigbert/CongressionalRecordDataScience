 President, teacher quality is one of the most critical factors influencing student achievement and success. I urge my colleagues to support the Kennedy amendment, which would increase Teacher Quality Enhancement grants from $80 million to the fully authorized level of $300 million.  I am a cosponsor of this amendment, along with Senator Reed of Rhode Island and others, because I firmly believe that an investment in teacher quality is an investment in our children's future. We know all learners have the capacity for high achievement. We must increase our investment in teacher quality enhancement so every child in America is taught by the most qualified teacher available. We must invest in our teachers. We must help them reach the highest levels of competency, so they in turn can help their students reach the highest summits of achievement. As we work to bolster teacher quality, we must also focus our attention on reducing class size. Smaller classes have led to dramatic gains in student achievement. We must continue to reduce class size so highly qualified teachers can provide students more individualized attention. Reducing class size and increasing investment in teacher quality enhancement are key to ensuring academic success for all students.
