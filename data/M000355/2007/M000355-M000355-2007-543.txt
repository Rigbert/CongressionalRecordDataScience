 President, if the majority leader will yield for an observation, I think we have made pretty good progress on getting amendments disposed of. Hopefully, we can do more of that tomorrow. I think both sides have been operating in good faith, and we will consider tomorrow what other possibilities there might be.  I think I can speak for the majority on this side in saying that we certainly look forward to wrapping up this bill in the near future. There are a few other amendments we would like to have considered, and those discussions are ongoing between my staff and the majority leader's staff.
