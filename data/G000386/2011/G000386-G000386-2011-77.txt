 President, today the Senate will vote on the nomination of Cathy Bissoon to be U.S. District Judge for the Western Districtof Pennsylvania. Today's vote marks the 49th judicial confirmation this year and the 11th in just 2 weeks.  In committee we continue to achieve great progress as well. Eighty-four percent of the judicial nominees submitted this Congress have been afforded hearings. We have reported 77 percent of the judicial nominees. We have another hearing scheduled for later this week, our 16th nomination hearing of this year. In total, the committee has taken positive action on 85 of the 98 nominees submitted this Congress, or 87 percent.  Let me say just a few words about the nominee we are considering today.  Judge Bissoon graduated summa cum laude from Alfred University with a bachelor of arts in 1990. In 1993, she earned her juris doctorate from Harvard Law School. Judge Bissoon began her career at Reed Smith in Pittsburgh, PA, and then clerked for Judge Gary Lancaster of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania.  Following her clerkship, Judge Bissoon returned to private practice at Reed Smith where she worked primarily with employment and labor litigation. Judge Bissoon also served as the Firmwide director of diversity and as the firmwide practice group leader of Reed Smith's employment practice group. From 2007 to 2008, Judge Bissoon continued to practice employment and labor law as the Director and Department head of the labor group at Cohen & Grigsby.  In August 2008, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania appointed Judge Bissoon as a U.S. magistrate judge.  Judge Bissoon received a unanimous ``Qualified'' rating from the ABA Committee on the Federal Judiciary.  I support this nomination and congratulate her on her professional accomplishments.
