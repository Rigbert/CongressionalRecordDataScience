 However, I      believe that much of that opposition is based not on what      Brad has said or written about campaign finance regulations,      but on crude caricatures of his ideas that have been      circulated. . . . I think that the FEC and the country in      general will benefit from Brad's diligence, expertise, and      solid principles if he is confirmed to serve on the      Commission.  Second, Professor Larry Sabato, Director of the University of Virginia Center for Governmental Studies, appointed by Senator George Mitchell to the Senate's 1990 Campaign Finance Reform Panel:       Contrary to some of the misinformed commentary about      Professor Smith's work and views, his research and opinions      in the field of campaign finance are mainstream and      completely acceptable. For example, Professor Smith has      argued in several of his academic papers for a kind of      deregulation of the election rules in exchange for stronger      disclosure of political giving and spending. This is      precisely what I have written about and supported in a number      of publications as well. Bradley certainly supports much of      the work of the Federal Election Commission and understands      its importance to public confidence in our system of      elections. I have been greatly disturbed to see that some are      not satisfied to disagree with Professor Smith and make those      objections known, but believe it necessary to vilify the      professor in an almost McCarthyite way. I do not use that      historically hyper-charged word lightly, but it applies in      this case. Any academic with a wide ranging portfolio of      views on a controversial subject could be similarly tarred by      groups on the right or left.  Third, Professor John Copeland Nagle of Notre Dame Law School:       Professor Smith's view is shared by numerous leading      academics from across the political and ideological spectrum,      including Dean Kathleen Sullivan of the Stanford Law School      and Professor Lillian BeVier of the University of Virginia      School of Law. His understanding of the First Amendment has      been adopted by the courts in sustaining state campaign      finance laws.  Fourth, Professor Burt Neuborne of the Brennan Center at New York University. There is no group in America that disagrees more passionately with Professor Smith on campaign finance than the Brennan Center. Yet, listen to what Burt Neuborne, the Legal Director of the Brennan Center had to say about Smith's scholarship.  Neuborne considers Professor Smith's writings to be ``thoughtful discussions of topics of extreme importance'' and concludes that Smith has done ``excellent work in debunking the status quo.'' He goes on to say of Professor Smith's scholarship:       I learned from it and altered aspects of my own approach as      a result of his argument. It is, in my opinion, thoughtful      scholarship that helps us move toward a better understanding      of an immensely important national issue. Higher praise than      that I cannot give.  It also speaks well of Professor Smith that constitutional scholars and election law experts that know him personally and are familiar with his work, including some who have served on the board of Common Cause, are confident that he will faithfully enforce the law as enacted by Congress and upheld by the courts. Here are just a few examples of the confidence these experts have in Brad Smith's integrity and commitment to the rule of law.  Fifth, Professor Daniel Lowenstein of UCLA Law School, served six years on Common Cause National Governing Board:       Anyone who compares his writings on campaign finance      regulation with mine will find that our views diverge      sharply. Despite these differences, I believe Smith is highly      qualified to serve on the FEC. . . . Smith possesses      integrity and vigorous intelligence that should make him an      excellent commissioner. He will understand that his job is to      enforce the law, even when he does not agree with it. . . .      In my opinion, although my views on the subject are not the      same as theirs, [the Senate Republican Leadership] deserves      considerable credit for having picked a distinguished      individual rather than a hack. . . . Although many people,      including myself, can find much to disagree with in Bradley      Smith's views, I doubt if anyone can credibly deny that he is      an individual of high intelligence and energy and      unquestioned integrity. When such an individual is nominated      for the FEC, he or she should be enthusiastically and quickly      confirmed by the Senate.  Sixth, Professor Daniel Kobil of Capital Law School, former governing board member of Common Cause, Ohio:       Knowing Brad personally, I have no doubt that his critics      are wrong in suggesting that as a FEC Commissioner, Brad      would refuse to enforce federal campaign regulations because      he disagrees with them. I have observed Brad's election law      class on several occasions and he always took the task of      educating his students about the meaning and scope of      election laws very seriously. I have never heard him      denigrating or advocating skirting state and federal laws,      even though he may have personally disagreed with some of      those laws. Indeed, several times in class he admonished      students who     seemed to be suggesting ignoring what they considered overly      harsh election laws. Brad is an ethical attorney who cares      deeply about the rule of law. I am confidant that he will      fairly administer the laws he is charged with enforcing as a      Commissioner.  Seventh, Professor Randy Barnett of Boston University Law School:       I . . . can tell you and your colleagues that [Professor      Smith] is a person of the highest character and integrity. If      confirmed, Brad will faithfully execute the election laws      which the Commission is charged to enforce--including those      with which he disagrees . . . . Brad's critics need not fear      that he will ignore current law, but those who violate it may      have reason to be apprehensive.  Let me close my opening comments by sharing with you Brad Smith's own closing remarks in his statement before the Senate Rules Committee:       [S]hould you confirm my nomination to this seat, which I      hope that you will, here is my pledge to you. First, I will      defer to Congress to make law, and not seek to usurp that      function to the unelected bureaucracy. Second, when the      Commission must choose under the law, whether to act or not      to act, or how to shape rules necessary for the law's      enforcement, faithfulness to congressional intent and the      Constitution, as interpreted by the courts, will always be      central to my decision making. Third, I will act to enforce      the law as it is, even when I disagree with the law. . . .      Finally, I pledge that I will strive at all times to maintain      the humility that I believe is necessary for any person      entrusted with the public welfare to successfully carry out      his or her duties.  I think, with all due respect to current and past members of the FEC, this is clearly the most outstanding individual ever nominated for that commission. We all regret that this nomination has taken on some level of controversy because of Professor Smith's views, which are similar to those of 95 percent of the Republicans in the Senate. But that happens occasionally.  I am confident that well-meaning Senators on both sides of the aisle will remember that this is a bipartisan agency. It is supposed to have three Democrats, picked by the Democrats, and three Republicans, picked by the Republicans. It is important for us to honor each others' choices if the FEC is to work. So I am hopeful and confident that Professor Smith's nomination will be confirmed tomorrow when the roll is called.  With that, I yield the floor.                               Exhibit 1                                          University of California                                                School of Law,                               Los Angeles, CA, February 17, 2000.     Re Bradley Smith nomination.     (Attn: Andrew Siff)     Senator Micth McConnell,     Senate Rules Committee, Senate Office Building, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC       Dear Senator McConnell: I write in support of the      nomination of Bradley Smith to serve on the Federal Election      Commission. My support is not based on either partisan or      ideological grounds. To the contrary, I have been an active      Democrat since 1970, whereas, as is well known, Smith's      appointment to the FEC was proposed by Republicans. Anyone      who compares Smith's writings on campaign finance regulation      with mine will find that our views diverge sharply. Despite      these differences, I believe Smith is highly qualified to      serve on the FEC.       The difficulties that have affected the performance of the      FEC since its creation have not been caused by the      ideological views of its members, but by excessive      partisanship and, sometimes, by mediocrity. Smith possesses      integrity and vigorous intelligence that should make him an      excellent commissioner. He will understand that his job is to      enforce the law, even when he does not agree with it.       That the Senate Republican leaders should have proposed an      individual who matches their ideological views on campaign      finance regulations should not have surprised anyone. Law and      custom assume that the members of the FEC will have different      partisan and ideological backgrounds. In my opinion, though      my views on the subject are not the same as theirs, these      leaders deserve considerable credit for having picked a      distinguished individual rather than a hack.       That Smith is indeed distinguished can hardly be doubted.      He has published numerous articles on campaign finance      regulation in distinguished law journals. These articles are      widely recognized as leading statements of one of the major      positions in the campaign finance debate. In 1995 I published      the first American textbook of the twentieth century on      election law (Election Law, Carolina Academic Press). Not      long after the book was published, Smith published his first      major article on campaign finance in the Yale Law Journal.      With his permission, I included extended excerpts from that      article in the supplements that have been published for my      textbook. I certainly would not have done so unless I      regarded his article as intellectually distinguished.       It is understandable that in an area such as campaign      finance regulation, whose effects are so far-reaching for all      competitors in American politics, appointments should be      highly contested. However, as I mentioned above, the system      contemplates that individuals with different backgrounds and      beliefs will serve on the FEC. Although many people,      including myself, can find much to disagree with in Bradley      Smith's views, I doubt if anyone can credibly deny that he is      an individual of high intelligence and energy and      unquestioned integrity. When such an individual is nominated      for the FEC, he or she should be enthusiastically and quickly      confirmed by the Senate. If such an individual is denied      confirmation, the result inevitably will be to compound the      already prevalent gridlock in this difficult area of public      policy.       If I can provide any additional information I should be      happy to do so. I can be reached at 310-825-5148, and at                 Sincerely,                                             Daniel H. Lowenstein,     Professor of Law.                                  ____                                                Capital University                                      Law School, Columbus OH,                                                February 15, 2000.     Re nomination of Professor Bradley A. Smith for Commissioner          on Federal Election Commission.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Chair, Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, Russell          Senate Office Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: I am writing in support of      Professor Bradley A. Smith's nomination for a position as a      Commissioner on the Federal Election Commission. I have known      Brad since he joined the faculty of Capital Law School in the      Fall of 1993 as a visiting professor, and have served as the      chair of his committee for purposes of considering his tenure      and promotion, most recently to Full Professor. He is, in my      view, an outstanding candidate for the position and should      certainly be confirmed.       As a friend and colleague of Brad's, I am of course aware      of the controversy surrounding his nomination to a position      on the FEC. Indeed, as a former governing board member for      Common Cause, Ohio, I can understand why groups seeking to      expand campaign regulations dramatically might have      misgivings about Brad's nomination. However, I believe that      much of that opposition is based not on what Brad has written      or said about campaign finance regulations, but on crude      caricatures of his ideas that have been circulated.       Although I do not agree with all of Brad's views on      campaign finance regulations, I believe that his scholarly      critique of these laws is cogent and largely within the      mainstream of current constitutional thought. I have taught      Constitutional Law at Capital Law School for nearly thirteen      years. I was also counsel for amicus curiae, the ACLU of      Ohio, in a significant case dealing with the intersection of      the First Amendment and election law, Pestrak v. Ohio      Elections Commission, 926 F2d 573 (6th Cir. 1991).       Brad's central premise, that limits on political      contributions burden expression and should only be upheld for      the most compelling reasons, is hardly radical. It has long      been a basic tenet of the Supreme Court's First Amendment      jurisprudence that the amount and content of speech cannot be      limited except for the most important reasons. Brad's      writings do question the Supreme Court's conclusion in      Buckley v. Valeo that the government's interest in preventing      the appearance of corruption is sufficient to outweigh the      burden campaign finance regulations place on speech. However,      this critique is not outlandish, but calls attention to the      one of the obvious tensions in Buckley that in my view ought      to be continuously reexamined by courts and scholars if the      basic values underlying the First Amendment are to be      adequately protected.       Moreover, having come to knowing Brad personally, I have no      doubt that his critics are wrong in suggesting that as a FEC      Commissioner, Brad would refuse to enforce federal campaign      regulations because he disagrees with the laws. I have      observed Brad's Election Law class on several occasions and      he always took the task of educating his students about the      meaning and scope of election laws very seriously. I have      never observed him denigrating or advocating skirting state      and federal election laws, even though he may have personally      disagreed with some of those laws. Indeed, several times in      class he admonished students who seemed to be suggesting      ignoring what they considered overly harsh election laws.      Brad is an ethical attorney who cares deeply about the rule      of law. I am confident that he will fairly administer the      laws he is charged with enforcing as a Commissioner.       In conclusion, I think that the FEC and the country in      general will benefit from Brad's diligence, expertise, and      solid principles if he is confirmed to serve on the      Commission. Please contact me if I can provide additional      information or assist the Committee in any way regarding      Brad's nomination.           Very Truly Yours,                                                  Daniel T. Kobil,                                                Professsor of Law.                                       ____                                           University of Virginia,                                    Woodrow Wilson Department,                               Charlottesville, VA, March 1, 2000.     Senator Mitch McConnell,     Chairman, Senate Rules Committee, Russell Building, U.S.          Senate, Washington, DC.     (Attention Andrew Siff)       Dear Senator McConnell: I am pleased to write this letter      in support of Professor Bradley Smith's nomination to the      Federal Election Commission. I believe Professor Smith is a      solid and informed choice for the vital federal agency at a      critical moment in its history. I am pleased to be able to      add my voice to many who support Professor Smith.       My own credentials in this field are outlined in the      attached vita. I have published several books and many      articles in the field, including Pac Power: Inside the World      of Political Action Committees, Paying for Elections, and      Dirty Little Secrets. In addition, I was honored and      privileged to serve on the U.S. Senate's campaign finance      reform panel back in 1990, having being jointly appointed by      then-majority leader George Mitchell and minority leader      Robert J. Dole.       Contrary to some of the misinformed commentary about      Professor Smith's work and views, his research and opinions      in the field of campaign finance are mainstream and      completely acceptable. For example, Professor Smith has      argued in several of his academic papers for a kind of      deregulation of the election rules in exchange for stronger      disclosure of political giving and spending. This is      precisely what I have written about and supported in a number      of publications as well. Bradley certainly supports much of      the work of the Federal Election Commission and understands      its importance to public confidence in our system of      elections. I have been greatly disturbed to see that some are      not satisfied to disagree with Professor Smith and make those      objections known, but believe it is necessary to vilify the      professor in almost a McCarthyite way. I do not use that      historically hyper-charged word lightly, but it applies in      this case. Any academic with a wide-ranging portfolio of      views on a controversial subject could be similarly tarred by      groups on the right or left. I hope and trust that under your      able leadership, the Senate Rules Committee will not give in      to this kind of vicious sloganeering and character      assassination.       I should note that I don't completely agree with Professor      Smith's views and opinions in all respects. Even though we      have our differences, I fully respect his scholarship and the      clear argumentation and documentation that undergirds it. I      have not been a long acquaintance of Professor Smith so I      cannot be accused of simply backing an old chum! Instead, I      am supporting Bradley Smith because he is fully qualified for      the Federal Election Commission and I believe that he will do      an outstanding job, putting in long hours and thoroughly      analyzing the complicated subjects that come before the      Commission. I trust him to fulfill his public      responsibilities with great care and a determination to be      fair and honest. That is all one can reasonably ask from a      nominee.       Thank you for permitting me the opportunity to offer these      observations. Please let me know if I can be of any      additional help as Professor Smith's nomination moves      forward, as it should.       With every good wish,           Yours respectfully,     Dr. Larry J. Sabato.     Robert Kent Gooch,       Professor Of Government and Foreign Affairs, and Director      of the University of Virginia Center for Governmental      Studies.                                  ____                                        Notre Dame Law School,                                Notre Dame, IN, February 18, 2000.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.     (Att'n: Andrew Siff)       Dear Senator McConnell: It is my privilege to recommend      Bradley A. Smith for appointment to the Federal Election      Commission (FEC).       Professor Smith is a leading scholar in election law. His      work--which has appeared in such prestigious publications as      the Yale Law Journal and the Georgetown Law Journal--is      innovative, academically rigorous, and an exciting      contribution to the existing literature in the field of      campaign finance legislation. He is one of the few scholars      who has investigated how campaigns were financed before the      second half of the twentieth century, see Bradley A. Smith,      Faulty Assumptions and Undemocratic Consequences of Campaign      Finance Reform, 105 Yale L.J. 1049, 1053-56 (1996), and his      scholarship builds upon the lessons that history teaches. For      example, he dispels a common perception by observing that      ``the role of the small contributor in financing campaigns .      . . has increased, rather than declined, over the years.''      Id. at 1056. He has closely examined the way in which money      affects both political campaigns and the legislative process,      concluding that the precise relationship between campaign      spending and corruption is far more complicated than many      commonly assume. See id. at 1057-71; Bradley A. Smith. Money      Talks: Speech, Corruption, Equality, and Campaign Finance, 86      Geo.L.J. 45, 58-60 (1997). Yet that is exactly the kind of      analysis that should be performed when considering what legal      regulation is merited, especially in light of the frequent      laments that the federal campaign finance laws enacted in the      1970's have not performed as Congress hoped or expected.       Professor Smith questions the compatibility of campaign      restrictions with the first amendment. In doing so, he gives      voice to the many organizations across the political and      idelolgical spectrum who fear the impact of some of the      proposed legal regulation on the ability of citizens and      groups of communicate their message to the public. Professor      Smith's view is shared by numerous leading academics, again      from across the political and ideological spectrum, including      Dean Kathleen Sullivan of the Stanford law School and      Professor Lillian BeVier of the University of Virginia School      of Law. His understanding of the first amendment has been      adopted by the courts in sustaining state campaign finance      regulations. See Toledo Area AFL-CIO v. Pizza, 154 F.3d 307,      319 (6th Cir. 1998) (quoting Professor Smith's description of      the first amendment). But Professor Smith sees the first      amendment in an affirmative light rather than a negative one.      As he has so eloquently explained:       ``By assuring freedom of speech and of the press, the First      Amendment allows for exposure of government corruption and      improper favors and provides voters with information on      sources of financial support. There is no shortage of      newspaper articles reporting on candidate spending and      campaign contributions, and candidates frequently make such      information an issue in campaigns. By keeping the government      out of the electoral arena, the First Amendment allows for a      full interplay of political ideas and prohibits the type of      incumbent self-dealing that has so vexed the reform movement.      It allows challengers to raise the funds necessary for a      successful campaign and keeps channels of political change      open. By prohibiting excessive regulation of political speech      and the political process, the First Amendment, properly      interpreted, frees individuals wishing to engage in political      discourse from the regulation that now restrains grassroots      political activity. And because the First Amendment, properly      applied to protect contributions and spending, makes no      distinctions between the power bases of different political      actors, it helps to keep any particular faction or interest      from permanently gaining the upper hand. In each respect, it      promotes true political equality.''     Smith, 105 Yale L.J AT 1090. This positive explanation far      better serves the first amendment than the frightening      prospect that the meaning of the Constitution's protections      might soon depend upon the perceived majority desire for the      stringent regulation of political campaigns. See Nixon v.      Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 120 S. Ct. 897 (2000)      (Breyer, J., concurring)(suggesting that the Supreme Court's      interpretation of the first amendment should change if it      ``denies the political branches sufficient leeway to enact      comprehensive solutions to the problems posed by campaign      finance'').       Yet Professor Smith understands the problems evidence in      our current system. He recognizes the need for ``radical''      reform, see Bradley A. Smith, A Most Uncommon Cause: Some      Thoughts on Campaign Reform and a Response to Professor Paul,      30 Conn. L. Rev. 831, 837 N.37 (1998) , a sympathy that I      share. See John Copeland Nagle, The Recusal Alternative to      Campaign Finance Reform, 37 Harv. J. Legis. (forthcoming      February 2000). What impresses me most about Professor Smith      is his insistence that the problems evident in our existing      system be addressed in a manner that protects constitutional      rights. It is far too easy to assume that the first amendment      must be discarded when it is inconvenient to adhere to its      teachings. Moreover, apart from the commands of the      Constitution, Professor Smith has questioned whether the same      kinds of proposed solutions that have been tried and failed      for nearly thirty years are best suited for the kinds of      problems that we face today. Indeed, he has identified a      number of unintended effects of the standard restrictions on      campaign contributions and expenditures, including the      entrenchment of the status quo, the promotion of influence      peddling, the favoritism of select elites and special      interests, and perhaps most obviously, the encouragement of      wealthy candidates. See Smith, 105 Yale L.J. at 1072-84.      Instead, Professor Smith had advocated other actions that      could be taken to solve the problem, including increased      disclosure requirements. See Smith, 45 Geo. L.J. at 62-62.      But Professor Smith has clearly stated his preferred remedy:      ``I believe strongly that the best solution to any ills in      our political system lies in the American voter.'' Smith, 30      Conn. L. Rev. at 862. I cannot imagine a more attractive view      to be possessed by a member of the Federal Election      Commission.       Perhaps most importantly, Professor Smith has displayed a      fidelity to the law. His writing about the first amendment      shows that the he abides by the Constitution regardless of      the consequences. Professor Smith is also faithful to the      laws enacted by Congress. He has counseled that both the      statues enacted by Congress and the constitutional decisions      of the courts are entitled to respect whether or not one      agrees or disagrees with them.

Senator Mitch McConnell,     Chair, Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, Russell          Senate Office Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: I am writing to strongly urge the      Senate to confirm the nomination of Brad Smith as a      commissioner on the Federal Communications Commission. I have      known Brad well since he was a student at Harvard Law School,      and have followed his academic career closely, and can tell      you and your colleagues that he is a person of the highest      character and integrity. If confirmed, Brad will faithfully      execute the election laws which the Commission is charged to      enforce--including those with which he disagrees--and he will      also take seriously the rights guaranteed by the      Constitution.       Though election law is not my specialty, I am generally      familiar with Brad's writings in the field and I have written      extensively on the Constitution and, in particular, the      constitutional protection of liberty. I believe that Brad's      positions on federal election laws in general, and campaign      finance laws in particular, are far more consonant with the      requirements of both the First Amendment and the Supreme      Court's first amendment jurisprudence than are the views of      his critics. These critics would deny public office to anyone      who disagrees with their views of good policy, or to anyone      who believes in reforming existing law in a manner with which      they disagree.       I share Brad's policy view that the goal of free, fair, and      competitive elections would be better served with less rather      than more regulation of elections. But I have no doubt      whatsoever that he will vigorously enforce current law.      Indeed, in recent years, we have seen wholesale and flagrant      violations of current election laws which have gone largely      unenforced by the FEC and the Justice Department. Brad's      critics need not fear that he will ignore current law, but      those who violate it may have reason to be apprehensive.           Sincerely,                                                 Randy E. Barnett,                                     Austin B. Fletcher Professor.
