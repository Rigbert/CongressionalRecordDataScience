 Speaker, I submit for the Record statements by high school students from my home State of Vermont, who were speaking at my recent town meeting on issues facing young people today. I am asking that you please insert these statements in the Congressional Record as I believe that the views of these young persons will benefit my colleagues.                              Hate Crimes   (On behalf of Ryan Creedon, Jeff Davis, Demere Kasper, and Jesse                                 McCall)       Ryan Creedon: Hate crimes have been prevalent in America's      history since its conception. A hate crime has been legally      defined by Congress in the Violent Crimes and Law Enforcement      Act in 1994 as a crime in which the defendant intentionally      selects a victim, in the case of property crime, property      that is the object of a crime because of the actual or      perceived race, color, national origin, ethnicity, gender,      disability or sexual orientation of any person.       The Violent Crimes and Law Enforcement Act does not serve      as the nation's hate crime law. The law that does act as the      nation's hate crime law does not include crimes that are      gender- and sexually-orientated and motivated.       Currently, it is being debated whether or not a hate crime      should be separated from what would usually be a crime. Take      for example the unfortunate suffering Matthew Shepard was      subject to in Wyoming. Shepard, a homosexual man, was tied to      a fence and assaulted numerous times with the butt end of a      pistol by two men because of his sexual orientation. Should      the two men be convicted of murder alone, or should they be      charged for a hate crime as well?       Jeff Davis: In this case, it is not logical to take the      time, energy or money to further try the subjects. They will      spend the rest of their lives in jail. However, it does make      sense to further punish less severe crimes that are committed      by the aggressor because of the subject's race, ethnicity,      religion, sexual orientation or gender.       In these circumstances, you can look at the case of Re      Beaver St. Paul, 1992. The defendant, along with other      juvenile delinquents, built a cross by taping together pieces      of wood and burning it in a nearby neighbor's yard. The      teenagers were punished under the St. Paul bias-motivated      crime ordinance, which prohibits the placement of racial      symbols on public property. The balancing test guarantees the      rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness better      than any other legislation to date, and sets forth a division      line between what is personally offensive and what is free      expression.       Demere Kasper: The balancing test weighs the importance of      one's rights to express themselves against another's rights      to live comfortably. This test is used in many cases. For      example, the state of Kansas responds to the actions of      Reverend Fred Phelps, the antihomosexual activist. Phelps,      along with protesters, verbally directed antigay slander      towards those of a homosexual AIDS victim. The Kansas      legislature voted that Phelps' actions were immoral, and      passed a ban which prohibited such acts, citing a balancing      test as the reasoning.       When delivering biased beliefs, the line should be drawn      when one begins to attack (inaudible). This insures that the      freedom of free expression is still protected. The case of      Comver versus Smith in 1949 proves this. When the Nazi party      wanted to march through a predominantly Jewish town of      Skokie, Illinois, they were denied a permit to march by civil      courts. The Supreme Court cited the balancing test and      overruled the decisions of the lower courts, which indicated      that the denial was fair and just.       Jess McCall: Currently, in the Vermont state legislature,      they are trying to pass a bill that would allow the victims      of bias-motivated crimes to obtain a court order similar to      abuse-prevention orders, prohibiting their attackers from      further harassment.       To guarantee freedom of speech and the security of      minorities, one's rights to freedom of speech must be      outweighed when that speech is intended to harm an individual      because of their minority status. Legislation must be passed      to significantly increase punishment to those who violate      this test. However, this must only be applied when trying a      crime that does not already include a life sentence. While it      is important to protect our nation's freedom of speech, it is      more important to protect the individuals of our nation from      racial, gender, ethnic, sexual-orientation, or religious-     based slander.                                       ____                           Income Tax System                (On behalf of Erin Gray and Sara Voight)       Sara Voight: The problem with the current tax system is it      is complex, unfair, inhibits savings, and imposes a heavy      burden on families. It cannot be replaced by a little change;      it must be completely replaced.       The U.S. income tax code is a burden and a waste. The IRS      publishes 480 tax forms, and 280 forms to explain the 480 tax      forms. Annually, the IRS sends out 8 million pages of tax      forms. If you were to lay these out end to end, they would      circle the earth 28 times. This amount of paper is wasteful      and would be better used for other things.       The main reason the tax code is so complex is the      deductions, credits and other special preferences in the tax      law. Because of all these loopholes, Americans with very      similar incomes can pay vast differences in the amount of      taxes. The progressive tax is complicated, but it has the      right idea about giving a separate percentage to each income      bracket.       Erin Gray: An example of a flat-tax solution was introduced      by Congressman Dick Armey and Senator Richard Shelby. The      Armey-Shelby flat tax scraps the entire tax code and replaces      it with a flat-rate income tax. The flat rate would be phased      in over a three-year period, with a 19-percent rate for the      first two years and a 17-percent rate for later years.       Individuals and businesses would pay the same rate. This      particular plan eliminates all deductions. The only income      that is not taxed is a generous personal exemption that every      American would receive. For a family of four, the first      $35,000 in income are not taxed. No loopholes, no checks;      just a simple plan that treats everybody in America the same.       Sara Voight: Both plans have their positive sides. The flat      tax has its simplicity, but it also makes it unfair for      people with largely different incomes. The progressive tax,      which we have now, has the right idea, but all the loopholes      and deductions make it unfair. But if you were to combine      both plans, and make a progressive flat tax, you will have a      tax system that is simple, fair, and works for everyone.       Congressman Sanders: Thank you for dealing with an issue      that receives a great deal of attention and debate, and      people have great differences of opinion on it.                                       ____                International Student Activism Alliance        (On behalf of Jess Field, Claire Bove, and Tara Quesnel)       Tara Quesnel: The International Student Activism Alliance      was formed almost three years ago by a group of high school      students in Connecticut. Since then, it has grown to include      over 1,200 members, with at least one chapter in each of the      50 states. The ISAA strives to empower students and give them      a voice in issues that concern them.       Past and present ISSA issues include censorship of student      publications, community curfews, and getting students with      voting rights on state boards of education.       Claire Bove: The ISAA is different from any activism      organizations and extracurricular opportunities open to      students. First, it is entirely student-run. The power      structure consists of a national chair, the official head of      the organization, and a cochair in each state. The national      chair is assisted by an executive board. Members of the board      include the newsletter editor, the national technology      fundraising and recruiting directors, and the national      coordinators. At the chapter level, there are chapter      representatives. All these positions are filled by high      school students.       The second thing that differentiates the ISAA from any      other organization is the freedom individual chapters have.      Chapter members organize around issues that are important to      them. The issues are not partisan, they're student.      Additionally, there is no action required of any member.       Jess Field: I believe that organizations like the ISAA are      very important. As Congressman Sanders said earlier, voter      turnout in our country is incredibly law. We need to find      ways to allow young people to become more involved and      interested in the government. Opportunities like becoming      active in organizations like ISAA should not be passed up.       The experience goes well beyond the actual activism.      Organizations like this teach youth self-confidence and self-     respect as well as giving us a sense of what power we      actually hold in a democracy like this one.       Our government needs to endorse positive civic involvement      with youth. This could be accomplished with grants toward      student organizations like the ISAA. Forums like this one are      also very effective ways of allowing students to speak out      and have their voices heard. If any members of the audience      are interested in becoming more involved with the ISAA, they      should find me afterward.       Congressman Sanders: Thank you very much for an excellent      presentation on an important issue.                               ____________________
