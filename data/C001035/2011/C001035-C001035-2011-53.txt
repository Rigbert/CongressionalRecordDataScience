President, in the aftermath of September 11, Americans found strength in each other and in our common values. At a time when polarization and division seem to characterize the public debate on many of the important issues confronting our Nation, including terrorism and border security, the 10th anniversary of September 11 has been an occasion for us to reflect and refocus on the core values that unite us as Americans, including the belief that each person should be free to live without persecution, regardless of race, religion, or ethnicity.  It is in that spirit that I wish today to recognize the work of the Anti-Defamation League; which has carried out important work in opposition to the anti-Semitic sentiments of those promoting September 11 conspiracy theories. As we mark the 10th anniversary of September 11, we must strongly condemn the anti-Semitic conspiracy theories that blame Jews or Israel for carrying out the September 11 terrorist attacks that continue to this day.  The ADL also plays an important role in addressing the consequences of hate and fostering a dialog through its recent work with a broad coalition of groups. In its retrospective, ``9/11 Ten Years Later: The Changing Face of Hate, Terrorism and Democracy in America,'' the ADL assesses the proliferation of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories related to the September 11 terrorist attacks, the nature and magnitude of homegrown extremism and terrorism, the growing problem of anti-Muslim bigotry, and the recalibration of the balance between security and individual rights. The ADL also has been a leader in promoting police-community partnerships and expanding training for law enforcement.  We face serious challenges in the fight against terrorism and violent extremism. In meeting those challenges, we as lawmakers should be inspired by efforts like those of the ADL to transcend division and differences.  On the occasion of the 10th anniversary of September 11, it is an honor for me to recognize the work of the ADL and underscore the importance of their message.                          ____________________
