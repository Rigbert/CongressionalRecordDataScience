On your time, I would be happy to answer a question.                  The Supplemental Appropriations Bill  Mr. President, the other point I would like to make, before we return to the issue at hand, is this: People say, What has happened? It seems as if there is more criticism of the Bush administration in the last few weeks. And I think that is true. I think once the President went on national TV and announced that $87 billion pricetag for our continued presence and occupation of Iraq, the American people were awakened to reality. This $87 billion pricetag is a bone in the throat of America's taxpayers and families. They understand that we are not cutting spending or raising taxes to come up with that money; we are, in fact, adding to the deficit--the biggest deficit in our history--and we are taking it out of the Social Security trust fund.  I, for one--and I am sure I speak for every Senator--will not compromise when it comes to our military. We will give them every single dollar they need to be successful and come home safely.  When it comes to spending billions of dollars in Iraq to do things which we obviously cannot do, according to the President of the United States, hard questions will be asked, and the hardest question is going to be posed by my colleague from the State of North Dakota, Senator Byron Dorgan. I think he has really touched a nerve because he has reminded this administration that time and again they told us this day would never come, that Iraq was so bountiful in its oil reserves that it could finance its own reconstruction. Those are statements made by Vice President Cheney, Secretary Rumsfeld, Assistant Secretary Wolfowitz; the list goes on and on.  Now they come to us and say they need $20 billion that is going to rebuild Iraq. Well, the Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, raised the question earlier. It is clear that the money to rebuild Iraq is going to be borrowed. The question is, From whom will it be borrowed? From the American people or the Iraqi people?  I agree with Senator Dorgan. Let's take this bountiful oil supply that they have in Iraq and use that as security, as collateral for what they need to rebuild their country. We can help them. I am sure we will. But, honestly, shouldn't the Iraqi people and their future oil revenues be on the line before our Social Security trust fund and our investments in education and health care? It is fairly obvious to me and to many of the people I represent.  Let me conclude and say again to Senator Schumer, thank you for your leadership on calling for this special prosecutor. It is my belief that a special prosecutor at this point is the only way to make sure that justice is served. If we have in any way seen a compromise of intelligence gathering in the United States, it could not have come at a worse time.  If we are going to successfully fight the war on terrorism, we have to stand behind the men and women at those intelligence agencies. We have to support them. And in my oversight capacity with the Intelligence Committee, from time to time I am sure I will be critical of some of the things they will do, but we should never, ever compromise their identity or professional integrity or ability to do their job.  Whoever decided to leak the identity of Ambassador Wilson's wife to Robert Novak, who writes a regular column, decided that the political price they had to pay was worth it. They were going to make that family pay a price that few others would be asked to pay because they were so bold as to criticize this administration's policy in Iraq. We have to get to the bottom of it. And I do not think Attorney General John Ashcroft's Department of Justice is up to that job.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
