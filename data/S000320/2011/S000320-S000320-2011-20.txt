 President, I rise today to pay tribute to Mr. W.R. ``Willie'' Jones, who passed away on Friday, March 25, 2011. Willie was dedicated to providing hope for a better life for underprivileged children in Montgomery, AL, and he was a personal friend. Along with the children and families whose lives Willie helped to change, I mourn his passing.  Willie Jones was born on April 3, 1955, and was an alumnus of Alabama State University. He began his life of dedication to the YMCA by participating in the organization's programs as a youth. Starting in 1968, he worked part time as an aquatic instructor at the Cleveland Avenue YMCA in Montgomery, where he would later become the executive director. His involvement didn't stop there; Willie also served as a senior vice president of the Montgomery YMCA. He held famous father/son banquets that attracted top sports talent to the Cleveland Avenue YMCA and provided inspiration for young boys and their fathers.  I have always recognized the Cleveland Avenue YMCA as an important place for the advancement of underprivileged youth. The facility opened in 1960 in conjunction with Martin Luther King's efforts to obtain equal opportunities for all people, including children. Willie and I worked together to fund and open the Cleveland Avenue Cultural Arts and Education Center, CAEC, in 2000. The CAEC is the largest YMCA facility in the country that is entirely dedicated to the arts. It is a true testament to Willie's commitment to helping America's youth through creative and educational initiatives.  In addition to his work for the YMCA, Willie served as the chairman of the Montgomery County Community Punishment and Corrections Authority and advocated for prison alternatives for nonviolent offenders, another passion of his. He also served on the Montgomery Housing Authority board of directors and the Montgomery County Recreation Commission.  Willie's advocacy extended beyond the boardroom and into city and county meetings, which he regularly attended. He was often spotted around the community networking with nearly everyone he met. Willie was a great friend to me and to all people, young and old. His selfless life's mantra was, ``This isn't about Willie Jones, it's about the kids at the YMCA.'' I am honored to have assisted with obtaining Federal funding for the Cleveland Avenue YMCA and to have known this man who was so committed to his community and to the greater world around him.  Willie is loved and will be missed by his wife Versie and two children, Jeff and Jennifer. My thoughts and prayers are with them as they struggle with Willie's premature and unexpected death. A tireless advocate for underprivileged children and nonviolent offenders, Willie championed the notion of a ``second chance'' for kids throughout the community and will be fondly remembered for the legacy of service he left behind him.                          ____________________
