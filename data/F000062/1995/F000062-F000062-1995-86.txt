  I have listened carefully to the debate this evening, but I think the simple fact is that no State in the Union is impacted by this amendment and this bill to the extent that California is.  Senator Rockefeller asked earlier where the money comes from to pay for this amendment. Mr. President, I'll tell you where the money comes from.  $4.2 billion of it comes from Medicaid that in the earlier version went to California. California is the biggest loser in this amendment. This will affect more than 8.6 million people in the State of California.  This bill, I believe, is immoral, egregious, and in my 2\1/2\ years I never thought I would stand here on the floor of the Senate and see the largest State in the Union treated the way it is in this bill.
