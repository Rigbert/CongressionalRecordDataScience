The service people requested all 3 hours every day. They ended up with some stations giving them 1 hour, nobody giving them more than 1 hour. So if you take 1 hour for some of these stations every day and you can find two instances of something that in, your interpretation, is lewd, and you compare that to Howard Stern whose programming is based on this type of thing--the profanity and the things that we find offensive and would not want to be throughout the world, the Arab world, or the rest of the world--then I think that is a real stretch.  The bottom line is, we have an opportunity. Right now it is working well. As I say, I don't know how many times the Senator from Iowa has been to Iraq. In his last 20 seconds, he might mention how many times he has been there. I have been there almost every month. I carry on a dialog with these people. I know they tell me the type of programming they want, the complaints they have. We have yet to receive any complaints saying they think the current system of programming is wrong in any way.  I yield the floor.
