 I want to say I have a lot of respect, as the gentleman knows and I have expressed on this floor, for Mr. Ryan. I think Mr. Ryan is a very able and dedicated and conscientious Member of this House. I have equal respect for and confidence in Senator Murray, who chairs the Senate Budget Committee.  And while I'm appreciative of the fact they're having discussions, frankly, the American people need to have atransparent view of discussions that would occur in a conference committee. So not only would the chair of the House Budget Committee and the chair of the Senate Budget Committee--now, that implies, therefore, that in the Senate there are no Republicans participating in those discussions and in the House there are no Democrats participating in those discussions.  In light of the fact that we have 315 million to 320 million people who are represented by both Democrats and Republicans, Mr. Leader, I think it would be very useful and would accelerate--not impede--the process of getting to an agreement so the American public could weigh in with their views as they saw a conference committee debating and discussing the alternatives between the Ryan budget and the Murray budget and, indeed, the President's budget.  I've seen press reports that Mr. Ryan wants to have discussions and he wants to have parameters, but, frankly, you and I both know that if we wait to have Mr. Ryan and Ms. Murray agree, we're going to be probably waiting a long time. Senator Murray participated along with Jeb Hensarling in the supercommittee which met for many months and ultimately came to no conclusion. That's not good for the country; it's not good for our economy; and it's not good for jobs and growth.  As I understand, Mr. Ryan has said he's having discussions with Senator Murray; but I would urge us to have the ability to go to conference, move to go to conference, appoint conferees, and pursue regular order.  If the gentleman wants to respond to that, I yield to the gentleman; if not, I'll go on to another subject.  Mr. Leader, I don't think it was on the announcement, but I do know there is discussion in your memorandum and you've been quoted about a debt ceiling, a debt prioritization piece of legislation that would be considered. I would hope, as I said last week, that we could deal with, in a nonpartisan, bipartisan, nonpolitical fashion, the protection of the creditworthiness of the United States of America and to the maintenance of America's credit rating. It was reduced for the first time in history when we had a debt cliff debate in 2011, and we were reduced by one point in the creditworthiness of our country. That was unfortunate, and I think it hurt our country.  President Reagan said in 1986:       Unfortunately, Congress consistently brings the government      to the edge of default before facing its responsibility. This      brinkmanship threatens the holders of government bonds and      those who rely on Social Security and veterans benefits.  Interest rates, et cetera, would skyrocket if we did that, and he was urging the then-Democratic Congress and Republicans to support an increase in the debt, which, as you know, was done.  In addition, Keith Hennessey, who was George Bush's National Economic Council Director, said on January 14:       Payment prioritization doesn't stop payments; it just      delays them. Then the aggrieved party sues the government and      probably wins, and it turns into a bloody mess.  That was Keith Hennessey, who was Bush's National Economic Council Director.  Tony Fratto, Deputy Press Secretary for President George Bush, said:       Prioritization is impossible. Is the government really      going to be in the position of withholding benefits,      salaries, rent, contract payments, et cetera, in order to pay      off Treasury bondholders? That would be a political      catastrophe.  I suggest not only would it be a political catastrophe, with which I agree--and I presume he's referring to the Republican Party, as he's a member of the Republican Party--but also a disaster for our economy and not, I think, something that would be helpful in growing jobs and expanding confidence, which the gentleman has talked a lot about and with which I agree with him on. We need confidence.                              {time}  1320  This constant utilization of the debt limit for political leverage, I think, is not in the best interest of our country or the people we represent, and I would hope that bill would not be brought to the floor but that we could together, in a bipartisan fashion, resolve that the debt limit will not be put in question by this Congress.  I yield to my friend.
