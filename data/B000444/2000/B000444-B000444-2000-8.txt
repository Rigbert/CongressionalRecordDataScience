 President, I rise today to honor our respected colleague, my friend, and a true gentleman of the United States Senate--Bill Roth.  I have had the honor to serve side-by-side with the senior senator from Delaware for nearly 28 years. Never once have any of you nor anyone in our home State of Delaware--ever heard me say an ill, unkind or negative word about him. And I might add --nor he of me. In my case, there is a good reason for this. He has never given me cause to say anything negative.  I, personally, and my state collectively--genuinely respect and like Bill Roth. He is a true gentleman--with all the politeness, honesty and integrity that word connotes.  Personally, I will greatly miss his companionship and friendship. We have racked up more miles on Amtrak between Wilmington and Washington than probably anyone in history! On our train rides, we would often talk about how we could best work together on a project for Delaware. And we would discuss pressing legislative business. But we'd also talk about family and children and grandchildren.  Bill Roth has served Delawareans with great distinction for 34 years. Since 1970, he has served in the Senate, and before that, four years in the U.S. House of Representatives. Bill Roth is a living legend in Delaware. In a sentence--he is the longest-serving elected official in the history of Delaware.  And he has made his name known across this country, and throughout the world.  Think about the men and women who have served in the United States Senate--the true giants. Only a handful have programs or laws named after them and for which they will forever be known. Bill Roth is one of those giants. He has not one, but two historic laws that bear his name--the Roth-Kemp tax cut of the 1980s, and of course, the Roth I.R.A.  On foreign affairs, Senator Roth is an internationalist. He has met with and is respected by more world leaders than most U.S. Presidents. There is no doubt in my mind that without Bill Roth, we would not have NATO enlargement or Normal Permanent Trade Relations with China. He is the former President of the North Atlantic Assembly--which is a parliamentary arm of NATO--and served as co-chair with me of the Senate NATO Observer Group. As a staunch believer in strong security alliances in not only Europe, but also Asia, he helped lead the effort for NATO enlargement and currently serves on the boards for the Center for Strategic and International Studies and the Board of the Pan-Pacific Association. He also is active in the Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum.  Beside the international and financial arenas, Senator Roth has made his mark on environmental issues as well. He is a recipient of the Wilderness Society's prestigious ``Ansel Adams'' Award for his work to protect pristine lands, such as the coastal plain of Alaska--fighting many in his own party who want to open up that national treasure to oil exploration.  The breadth of Bill Roth's contributions to this nation seem to be without limits. He understands how government works and when it doesn't serve the public the way it should, he's stepped forward to fix things. Whether it's general government restructuring, overhauling the IRS to end taxpayer abuses, or reforming the welfare system, he has left his mark. And when Amtrak needed critical support to advance to high speed rail, he championed the act to commit more than $2 billion for capital improvements.  With all his distinguished awards and landmark legislation, Bill Roth also is part of the so-called ``Greatest Generation,'' serving our country in World War II. He rose to the rank of captain and earned the Bronze Star for his service in the Pacific.  Like his war service, there is much Senator Roth does in Delaware for which he never seeks headlines nor credit. Every year, for the past 30 years, he has hosted and organized a Youth Conference for high school students throughout the State. This is an enormous undertaking to coordinate--involving high school principals, teachers, students and well-known keynote speakers. He has done it all solely for the kids. I am certain many of those students over the years are now serving as leaders in our businesses, non-profit organizations, and some even hold public office now themselves.  I realize it's rare, and somewhat awkward, for one member of this body to stand up and so publicly honor his fellow, distinguished Senator. But Bill Roth deserves that and much more. Senator Roth has been a friend, partner and confidant to me over the years.  Delawareans also will miss the pleasant, extremely competent and caring service of Senator Roth's staff. From veterans to members of the business community--from seniors to school students--from the fire service to the armed forces--from the City of Wilmington to the beach communities--Senator Roth and his staff were highly regarded for their friendly, responsive and highly-professional constituent services.  And I know that beyond all his legislative accomplishments, Senator Roth is most proud of his wife of 35 years--The Honorable Jane Richards Roth--his son Bud who is an attorney in Delaware--his daughter, Katy who is a physician--and his two grandsons, Bobby and Charlie.  This body is losing more than a powerful Committee chairman, who used that power wisely, judicially and compassionately. The United States Senate is losing a genuine gentleman. He has served the citizens of Delaware with honor and integrity for nearly 34 years. Our State, our country and the United States Senate are so much better for his service.  The British statesman and philosopher, Edmund Burke, said in a speech at Bristol:       The worthy gentleman who has been snatched from us at the      moment of the election, and in the middle of the contest,      whilst his desires were as warm and his hopes as eager as      ours, has feelingly told us what shadows we are, and what      shadows we pursue.  Senator Roth's shadow will stay with this body for years to come as we pursue the principles he stood for.                          ____________________
