 President, today, I would like to offer a tribute to one of the outstanding citizens of my State, one of those citizens who truly represents the best not only of Delaware but of America--the best of our heritage and our hope, the best of our national spirit of community.  It will surprise no one to learn that the citizen I'm describing is a volunteer firefighter.  Wayne A. Steen, Sr., joined the Mill Creek Fire Co. on October 2, 1967, as a member of its youth division, Explorer Post 921. In the course of his 4 years of membership, Wayne served as both president and chief of the post.  On September 22, 1971, just a few days passed his 18th birthday, Wayne Steen became a full member of the Mill Creek Fire Co. For 20-plus years after, he served the company in virtually every office and on virtually every committee, putting in more than a thousand hours and responding to about 600 fire and ambulance runs--those are not career totals; that's 1,000 hours and 600 runs per year--and earning three citations for heroism and leadership.  In addition, Wayne Steen has served as a director of both the New Castle County and the Delaware State Fire Chiefs Associations, and he was long an active member of the Delaware Valley regional association and the International Society of Fire Service Instructors.  Wayne Steen's fire service career represents literally the best of the best--exceptional leadership in a group of exceptional leaders, exceptional citizenship and commitment in a group defined by active concern for neighbors and community, and by selfless dedication to protect and promote the public safety.  Because of Wayne's extraordinary community leadership and service, June 12, 1995, marked a great public as well as personal tragedy.  At this point, this tribute becomes a little difficult for me. First, Wayne Steen is someone I've known and worked with for many years, someone I'm proud to call a friend. And second, Wayne fell victim to a medical condition that I was lucky to survive without any long-term disability. Wayne was not as lucky, and it is hard to reconcile my good fortune with the challenge he and his family continue to face every day.  On that date last June, Wayne was in command of a group of firefighters at the scene of a fatal traffic accident. While on duty, he fell victim to the sudden strike of a brain aneurysm, which left him in a coma. When I went to see Wayne in the hospital, there seemed to be little doubt that his condition would do anything but worsen. He was 41 years old.  With medical care, the support of his family and friends, and, I have absolutely no doubt, by some force of his own will that no mere physical condition could defeat, Wayne's condition was stabilized, and he was able to leave that hospital room where I saw him last summer. But still the struggle had just begun, and it will be a lifelong battle for Wayne and for the family and friends who fight by his side.  It is tempting to describe Wayne Steen as a fallen hero, but I do not think it would be right to do so.  Certainly, he is a hero, and had earned the right to be thought of as such long before last June. His fire service career was, in fact, as good a living definition of citizen-heroism as we are likely to find, and we should--and must--honor such service always.  But Wayne Steen is not fallen, because he has stood too tall, and he has elevated us all too much. Wayne Steen devoted much of his spirit--as well as his time and his talents--to serving a great and essential ideal, and if some part of his spirit has left this life, I have no doubt that it has risen to a higher one. Wayne is not fallen because he serves us still, as long as his example of citizenship continues to call to the best in all of us.  We honor leaders like Wayne Steen best not with our words but when we continue their work, when we learn that they have given so much because their purpose is so important to us all.  And we honor them best when we recognize and fulfill our obligation to those who put themselves at risk to protect our families, our homes, and our communities--our obligation to support them in their service and, when tragedy strikes, in their need. We must be there for people like Wayne, who have always been there for us.  Wayne's family--especially his wife, Terry, and their children, Phillip, Wayne, and Heather--have been there for him in the way we would all hope to support a loved one through such a traumatic ordeal. Their courage, dedication, and strength continue an inspiring family tradition.  The members of the Mill Creek Fire Co., as well as the broader fire service community, have also kept their faith with Wayne and with the Steen family, another great tradition--members of the fire service always keep the faith.  There is no escaping that what happened to Wayne Steen is a tragedy, the kind that cannot be explained, and I do not want to minimize in any way the depth of the loss or the difficulty of the struggle. Our tears are more than justified.  Yet still, through our sadness and in asking Americans to offer prayers and good wishes in support of Wayne and his family, I would also ask that we not forget the immeasurable triumphs of Wayne Steen's life and spirit. Let us not forget the lessons he has taught us by his citizenship, let us not forget the purpose to which he sacrificed so much.  Let us not forget the bond and obligation we share as fellow citizens--let's take care of each other more often, let's work together better. Let's remember how lucky we are.  That's what Wayne Steen would want, and we owe it to him.                          ____________________
