 President, Senator Murkowski is here for the purpose of modifying his own amendment. We are going to go to Senator Brownback, who has two amendments to offer which have been cleared on both sides; then to Senator Allard, who has an amendment on which I understand it is possible to get a 30-minute time agreement equally divided.  So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Allard amendment, when it is offered, be limited to 30 minutes of debate equally divided.
