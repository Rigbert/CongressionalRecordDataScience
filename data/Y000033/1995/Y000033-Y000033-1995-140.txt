Mr. Speaker, I strongly support S. 268 and feel it is appropriate to allow private fish producers to fully reimburse the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for the costs of their certification to triploid grass carp.  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service began its involvement in the DNA certification of triploid grass carp nearly two decades ago. Since that time, the program has grown to more than 550 inspections per year for private producers whose fish are shipped to some 30 States. In fiscal year 1994, over $70,000 was spent by the Service on this program.  This certification process is necessary to ensure that only sterile grass carp are released in public and private waters to control aquatic vegetation.  Earlier this year, the Fish and Wildlife Service announced its intention to terminate this certification program. Since States will not allow the release of grass carp without the Service's stamp of approval, this legislation has become necessary.  S. 268 will establish a fee-for-service system and it will allow the Fish and Wildlife Service to retain those collected funds to cover the expenses of the triploid grass carp certification inspections.  I urge an ``aye'' vote on this measure and compliment our colleague, Blanche Lambert Lincoln, for her leadership in bringing this matter to our attention.
