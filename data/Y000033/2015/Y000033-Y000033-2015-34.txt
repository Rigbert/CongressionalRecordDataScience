I appreciate the comments from the gentlewoman.  I would suggest, respectfully, we should follow the law. We have given up the responsibility in this Congress to the President--not just this President, other Presidents. It is clear in the law nothing more than 5,000 acres can be withdrawn and put in the wilderness, without the okay of the Congress, in Alaska. No more clause. It stands for no more.  Now, we have a President that says ``up yours'' to the Congress. That is not the way to run this business. We have a responsibility as Congressmen to do our job. And when he goes against the law through executive order, that is against this Constitution of America.  Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from California (Mr. Calvert).
