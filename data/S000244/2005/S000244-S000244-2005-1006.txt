Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Speaker, the argument that has been made against this amendment is that it infringes upon free speech guaranteed by the first amendment. As all of the people who served as Justices of the Supreme Court during the 20th century, I think everybody would recognize that the strongest first amendment absolutist was Justice Hugo L. Black. Let me read you what Justice Black said in the case of Street v. New York, decided in 1969:  ``It passes my belief that anything in the Federal Constitution bars a State from making the deliberate burning of an American flag an offense.''  The court changed its mind twice at the end of the decade of the 1980s. I do not think that anybody's free speech rights to express whatever they want to say about a policy, about the position of the American Government, about a stand that a candidate makes, a vote that a Congressman makes is going to be infringed by the passage of this amendment.  What is going to be stopped is deliberately burning the symbol of our country or otherwise desecrating it. That is what this amendment seeks to prescribe. And if you want to stop it, vote ``yes.'' If you do not, vote ``no.'' I am voting ``yes.''
