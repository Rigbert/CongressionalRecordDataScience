 Chairman, I heard a moment ago an estimate from the DOE that this amendment would lower the cost of gas by one cent. Well, let me tell my colleagues that Goldman Sachs has studies which suggests that it would be 10 to 25 cents. They are the largest crude oil trader in the world, 10 to 25 cents a gallon.  People say this is a new and radical idea. It is not a new and radical idea. George Bush, the first, did it; Bill Clinton did it; and in both instances, it was successful. It drove down the price of gas that consumers were purchasing.  This is an amendment and a concept supported by Republicans and Democrats.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore (Mr. Bass). The question is on the amendment, as modified, offered by the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. Sanders).  The question was taken; and the Chairman pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it.
