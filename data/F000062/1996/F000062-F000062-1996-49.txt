 President, as a nation, we must do everything we can to find a cure for HIV/AIDS. However, until we have a cure for this urgent health priority, we need to find effective treatments and put them in the hands of people with needs.  I rise today to introduce legislation, joined by my colleague Senator Boxer, to eliminate the tariff for several chemical compounds. These compounds are required for the manufacture of an AIDS drug, nelfinavir mesylate, which has produced promising test results.                          protease inhibitors  Nelfinavir is one of a new class of AIDS drugs called protease inhibitors. The drugs are designed to block an enzyme, called protease, that appears to play a crucial role in the replication of HIV.  As the Wall Street Journal reported in its coverage of the recently concluded 11th International Conference on AIDS in Vancouver, BC, researchers have evidence that protease inhibitor drugs, when taken in combination with existing therapies, can reduce levels of the AIDS-causing virus in blood to levels so low that the virus is undetectable by even the most sensitive tests. AIDS researchers at the conference describe this new drug therapy as a major and unprecedented step in combating AIDS, one that may represent a treatment approach that may delay the onset of AIDS, extend patients' lives, and transform AIDS into a long-term, manageable disease.  Mr. President, HIV/A is a critical public health issue, requiring the Nation's full attention. In America today, AIDS is the leading cause of death for young Americans between the ages of 25 and 44.  More than 220,700 American men, women and children have died of AIDS by the end of 1993. While the number of deaths trails other urgent health priorities such as cancer or heart disease, AIDS is nearly equally debilitating to the Nation when measured by the years of potential and productive life lost due to the disease.  In my State of California, 1 of every 200 Californians is HIV positive, while 1 of every 25 is HIV positive in my home of San Francisco.  AIDS is a paramount public health concern and every effort should be made to ensure that drugs are made available as swiftly and at as low a cost as possible. We simply cannot delay or waste time in providing drugs, treatments or materials. This tariff legislation represents a modest, but important step.                    zero tariff for pharmaceuticals  Under the 1994 GATT agreement, most pharmaceutical products are entitled to enter the country without a tariff. However, the zero tariff does not apply to many new pharmaceutical products or their chemical ingredients. As a result, the chemicals needed to make nelfinavir mesylate, an AIDS protease inhibitor currently undergoing research testing, but not yet a recognized pharmaceutical product under GATT, would be ineligible for the pharmaceutical zero tariff.  During negotiations with World Trade Organization nations to implement the pharmaceutical zero tariff, the administration successfully added the chemical compounds needed to manufacture the AIDS drug. As a result, the tariff will drop to zero on April 1, 1997.  Nelfinavir is on the Food and Drug Administration's fast-track approval process for AIDS drugs. Commercial production of the drug will begin well before April 1, in order that the drug can be immediately available to AIDS patients upon FDA approval. Although currently imported duty-free for use in clinical research trials, the imported chemicals will soon be used for commercial production. During the period of commercial production prior to April 1, the chemical compounds will face a 12 percent tariff, which will only add to the cost and delay the drug's production and distribution to individuals in need.  This proposed legislation would eliminate the tariff for two of the essential and unique chemical inputs, as well as for the active ingredient nelfinavir (Acid Chloride, Chloroalcohol and AG 1346), from August 1 when the drug production increases, until April 1, 1997 when the tariff drops to zero under the WTO pharmaceutical agreement. Without this legislation, the manufacturer would face a 12 percent tariff for its chemicals, which are not available in the United States, as the drug proceeds into production. This tariff reduction will allow for the acceleration of drug production, providing more timely relief for the public.  The Federal Government needs to do everything it can to expedite the development and distribution of AIDS drugs. Without this legislation to remove the tariff, we will be tolerating needless hurdles and delay, rather than needed relief.  The Congressional Budget Office is reviewing the cost of the proposed legislation. However, because the WTO negotiations will already provide a zero tariff for the chemical compounds on April 1, the legislation may have a de minimis impact on tariff revenue. For AIDS patients, their families and those at risk, it's a step Congress should take.  I have also requested various Federal agencies and other organizations to review the legislation and ensure that other important Federal policies, like narcotics enforcement or maintaining a strong, domestic chemical industry, are not undermined. The Drug Enforcement Agency and U.S. Customs Service indicate the chemicals present no risk for law enforcement or anti-narcotics enforcement priorities. Similarly, the U.S. Trade Representative's Industry Sector Advisory Committee for chemicals and the International Trade Commission also reviewed and approved the administration's efforts to include the chemicals in the pharmaceutical appendix negotiations. PhRMA, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, also has reviewed the proposal and does not oppose the legislation.  The administration deserves tremendous credit for extending a zero tariff for these chemical components. It is my hope that miscellaneous tariff legislation, which is currently pending before the Finance Committee, could accommodate this noncontroversial tariff issue, which can accelerate the development and production of an AIDS drug, with the potential to provide meaningful relief.  As a matter of public policy, we should do everything we can to develop AIDS drugs and treatments. Patients and their families cannot wait for the next round of drugs to be approved and added to the zero-tariff list, scheduled for review in 1999. By importing the chemical compounds without a tariff, we can accelerate the drug development process.  I am pleased to introduce this tariff legislation, along with my colleague Senator Boxer, and will work with the chairman and ranking members of the Finance Committee to pursue the legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2021       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
