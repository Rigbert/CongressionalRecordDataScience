Or on vacation. How he got all the way to Florida, I do not know.  Remember now the farmers wanted to keep the puma. This is a Florida puma, in their minds. But Fish and Wildlife said in their minds, and in fact made an edict; they got him in a cage now, said that he is not indigenous to the area, he is a western mountain lion, or a puma, and thus they are going to transfer him via air to New Mexico because he does not belong and because they decided he did not belong there.  Now keep in mind, if I am sure how ridiculous this is under the Endangered Species Act, and in the meantime this same thing, Mr. Babbitt and the Fish and Wildlife Department saying in fact the wolves are endangered in Yellowstone Park, and in Idaho and Utah. And they go to Canada, get a foreign wolf, and tranquilize those foreign wolves, and, by the way, they killed five of them in doing so at a cost of $7 million and transferred foreign wolves down into the United States, which are not the same DNA.
