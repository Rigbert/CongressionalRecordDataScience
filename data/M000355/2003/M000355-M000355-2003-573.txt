 President, I thank the Senator from North Carolina and the Senator from Kentucky for their important contributions to the development of this legislation. I also want to make clear to our colleagues this is a bipartisan bill. Senator Edwards of North Carolina, Senator Hollings of South Carolina, Senator Miller of Georgia, and Senator Bayh of Indiana are also cosponsors. In fact, there are 13 cosponsors of this important legislation. This is critical to our section of the country. We are going to work as intensely as we can to achieve the result for which our farm families are hoping.  With that, how much time remains on this side?
