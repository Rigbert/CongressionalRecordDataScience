President. Also, let me also tell the Senate we are very pleased that the Senator from Vermont has joined the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. He is going to hear us talking an awful lot in the committee about the county payments legislation, but I just want to say tonight in the Senate I am very pleased the Senator from Vermont has come to the Senate, and we are glad to have him on the committee.  The last question I would pose to my colleague deals, again, with the urgency of all of this, so the Senate is clear on this. I think there is always a sense that sometimes you come to the floor and there is a little bit of an alarmist kind of approach.  My understanding is in our home State, from county officials, there are pink slips going out now. There are budgets that are being made now that are going to be very hard to alter. I appreciate my colleague's presentation over the last bit, and I enjoyed the earlier one as well, and I felt it was an important presentation.  What exactly is taking place? So the Senate is up on this in terms of county budgets, layoff notices, and the kind of pain--that is what this is really all about, the pain we are seeing working families and citizens going through--what exactly is taking place as these budget choices are being made?
