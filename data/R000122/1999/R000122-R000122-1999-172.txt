President, I rise today to recognize the achievement of Tiogue School of Coventry, Rhode Island, which was recently honored as a U.S. Department of Education Blue Ribbon School. This is the second time in 3 years that a school from Coventry has earned this honor.  It is a highly regarded distinction to be named a Blue Ribbon School. Through an intensive selection process beginning at the state level and continuing through a federal Review Panel of 100 top educators, 266 of the very best public and private schools in the Nation were identified as deserving of this special recognition. These schools are particularly effective in meeting local, state, and national goals. However, this honor signifies not just who is best, but what works in educating today's children.  Now, more than ever, it is important that we make every effort to reach out to students, that we truly engage and challenge them, and that we make their education come alive. That is what Tiogue School is doing. Tiogue is a kindergarten through sixth grade school, which proudly says that it is a school ``where everybody is somebody'' and where children come first. These are more than just catch-phrases for Tiogue, which seeks to reach out to every student in the community and engages teachers, parents, and business and community leaders in the important job of education.  Teams of teachers work to develop appropriate but rigorous standards for all students. The results are impressive. Tiogue students have exceeded the norms on state assessments in each of the past five years. But Tiogue's teachers also work to develop a curriculum that extends far beyond what the assessments measure. Each year, the school focuses on a particular issue, subject, or theme. As a preface to the Summer Olympics, students studied world cultures with a focus on the diverse background of the student population. During another year, students studied the arts and worked to develop their skills as artists, writers, musicians, and dancers. This year, Tiogue is taking their education to another level with an exploration of outer space.  Mr. President, Tiogue School is dedicated to the highest standards. It is a school committed to a process of continuous improvement with a focus on high student achievement. Most importantly, Tiogue recognizes the value of the larger community and seeks its support and involvement. This school and community are making a huge difference in the lives of its students.  Mr. President, the Blue Ribbon School initiative shows us the very best we can do for students and the techniques that can be replicated in other schools to help all students succeed. I am proud to say that in Rhode Island we can look to a school like Tiogue School. Under the leadership of its principal, Denise Richtarik, its capable faculty, and its involved parents, Tiogue School will continue to be a shining example for years to come.                          ____________________
