President, once again, on July 1, millions of college students will see the interest rate double on their student loans from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent unless Congress takes action. Borrowers will pay an estimated $1,000 more in interest on their loans each year of repayment if Congress fails to act.  Student loan debt is second only to mortgage debt for American families. Now is not the time to add to student loan debt by allowing the interest rate on need-based student loans to double. I am pleased to introduce the Student Loan Affordability Act with my colleagues Senator Al Franken, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Senator Debbie Stabenow, Senator Sherrod Brown, and Senator Bernie Sanders to maintain the current 3.4 percent interest rate for the next 2 years, as we work towards a long-term solution in the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act.  Last Congress, we narrowly averted a doubling of the interest rate on need-based student loans. It took thousands of calls, letters, and rallies from students and parents across the country and our concerted effort to negotiate a bipartisan solution. However, we were only able to get a temporary, 1-year fix.  The budget passed by the House Republicans assumes a doubling of the interest rate. In stark contrast, the budget resolution we passed last month accommodates legislation to keep rates low.  We need to come together to develop long-term solutions to the growing burden of student loan debt, the rising cost of college, and the need to improve higher education outcomes so that students complete their degrees and get the full benefit of their investment in education. Everyone agrees that college costs are too high and climbing higher. Families will be priced out of a college education, even with grants and loans, if we do not take real action on curbing cost increases.  What we can do right now is reassure students and families that we will not allow the interest rate to double this July at a time when interest rates are at historic lows.  Student loan debt affects millions of Americans. Two-thirds of the class of 2011 graduated owing student loans, with an average debt of $26,000. Student loan debt has passed the $1 trillion mark--exceeding credit card debt. Moreover, the students and families we are trying to help with the Student Loan Affordability Act have demonstrated economic need. Indeed, approximately 60 percent of the dependent students who qualify for subsidized loans come from families with incomes of less than $60,000.  The question before us is will we make the student loan debt burden worse by allowing interest rates to double or will we take action to protect low and moderate income students.  We need to act fast. July 1 is only 81 days away. I urge all our colleagues to join us in supporting the Student Loan Affordability Act.                                 ______                                       By
