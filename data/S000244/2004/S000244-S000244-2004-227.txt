Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3369 ) to provide immunity for nonprofit athletic organizations in lawsuits arising from claims of ordinary negligence relating to the passage or adoption of rules for athletic competitions and practices.  The Clerk read as follows:                               H.R. 3369       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Nonprofit Athletic      Organization Protection Act of 2003''.     SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.       In this Act:       (1) Economic loss.--The term ``economic loss'' means any      pecuniary loss resulting from harm (including the loss of      earnings or other benefits related to employment, medical      expense loss, replacement services loss, loss due to death,      burial costs, and loss of business or employment      opportunities) to the extent recovery for such loss is      allowed under applicable State law.       (2) Harm.--The term ``harm'' includes physical,      nonphysical, economic, and noneconomic losses.

(4) Nonprofit organization.--The term ``nonprofit      organization'' means--       (A) any organization which is described in section      501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and exempt      from tax under section 501(a) of such Code; or       (B) any not-for-profit organization which is organized and      conducted for public benefit and operated primarily for      charitable, civic, educational, religious, welfare, or health      purposes.       (5) Nonprofit athletic organization.--The term ``nonprofit      athletic organization'' means a nonprofit organization that      has as one of its primary functions the adoption of rules for      sanctioned or approved athletic competitions and practices.      The term includes the employees, agents, and volunteers of      such organization, provided such individuals are acting      within the scope of their duties with the nonprofit athletic      organization.       (6) State.--The term ``State'' includes the District of      Columbia, and any commonwealth, territory, or possession of      the United States.     SEC. 3. LIMITATION ON LIABILITY FOR NONPROFIT ATHLETIC                    ORGANIZATIONS.       (a) Liability Protection for Nonprofit Athletic      Organizations.--Except as provided in subsections (b) and      (c), a nonprofit athletic organization shall not be liable      for harm caused by an act or omission of the nonprofit      athletic organization in the adoption of rules for sanctioned      or approved athletic competitions or practices if--       (1) the nonprofit athletic organization was acting within      the scope of the organization's duties at the time of the      adoption of the rules at issue;       (2) the nonprofit athletic organization was, if required,      properly licensed, certified, or authorized by the      appropriate authorities for the competition or practice in      the State in which the harm occurred or where the competition      or practice was undertaken; and       (3) the harm was not caused by willful or criminal      misconduct, gross negligence, or reckless misconduct on the      part of the nonprofit athletic organization.       (b) Responsibility of Employees, Agents, and Volunteers to      Nonprofit Athletic Organizations.--Nothing in this section      shall be construed to affect any civil action brought by any      nonprofit athletic organization against any employee, agent,      or volunteer of such organization.       (c) Exceptions to Nonprofit Athletic Organization Liability      Protection.--If the laws of a State limit nonprofit athletic      organization liability subject to one or more of the      following conditions, such conditions shall not be construed      as inconsistent with this section:       (1) A State law that requires a nonprofit athletic      organization to adhere to risk management procedures,      including mandatory training of its employees, agents, or      volunteers.

(3) A State law that makes a limitation of liability      inapplicable if the civil action was brought by an officer of      a State or local government pursuant to State or local law.     SEC. 4. PREEMPTION.       This Act preempts the laws of any State to the extent that      such laws are inconsistent with this Act, except that this      Act shall not preempt any State law that provides additional      protection from liability relating to the rule-making      activities of nonprofit athletic organizations.     SEC. 5. EFFECTIVE DATE.       (a) In General.--This Act shall take effect on the date of      enactment of this Act.       (b) Application.--This Act applies to any claim for harm      caused by an act or omission of a nonprofit athletic      organization that is filed on or after the effective date of      this Act     but only if the harm that is the subject of the claim or the      conduct that caused the harm occurred on or after such      effective date.
