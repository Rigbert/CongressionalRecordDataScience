President, today I introduce legislation to prevent additional introductions of invasive pests. Last fall, the Northeastern states were startled by reports of an Asian longhorned beetle infestation in Brooklyn and Amityville, New York. This summer, we heard of additional infestations in Chicago and the beetle has been found in wood packing material in South Carolina, California, New Jersey and Texas. Although the beetle has been found primarily in port cities, the shipment of wood packing materials across state lines could lead to the spread of this insect into forested areas across the country.  This beetle is a serious pest of hardwood trees in its native environment in China, where it has few natural enemies. Here, it has none. If this pest becomes established in our forests, it could turn into the gypsy moth of the 21st century. And, as we learned from the spread of the gypsy month along the East Coast, repeated introductions of the Asian Long-Horned Beetle and its spread could have a staggering economic and ecological impact on our forests.  It also seems that the beetle has a sweet tooth--attacking mostly Norway and sugar maples. As Vermont and the Northeast begin the leaf peeping season this fall, the threat of an Asian longhorned beetle invasion has us all checking our trees for possible signs of the pest. Not only is the sugar maple the source of our world famous Vermont maple syrup, but it is also what turns our treasured Green Mountains brilliant yellow, orange and red each year. It is what attracts so many visitors to our state this time of year. The wood is also highly prized for furniture, paneling and wood flooring.  Without immediate attention, spread of this insect into forested areas of New York, Vermont and Massachusetts could threaten the important maple sugar and fall foliage industries of the Northeast. These things can chew trees into sawdust. The last thing I want to see in my backyard is one of these bark-eating, sap-sucking intruders from Asia.  What is even more alarming is that we do not yet have a way to treat this pest. The only way to get rid of it is by destroying all the infested trees. The best way to fight this pest, and similar non-native wood borers, is to make sure they do not get into our country in the first place. That is why I am introducing legislation today to prevent additional introductions of the beetle and other invasive pests into the United States.  The ``Invasive Pest Control Act'' will stiffen the requirements for treatment of imports that use solid wood products and wood packing material like pallets and crates. It will require that these imports either be debarked, kiln-dried or fumigated, depending on size, before they enter the United States. After five years, the use of these packing materials will be prohibited. This will give importers plenty of time to find alternative materials to ship their products. It will also give us a long-term insurance policy against future pest introductions.  I want to make clear that the Asian longhorned beetle is only one of many invasive pests that present a serious threat to our forests. Spruce bark beetle and Mediterranean pine engraver beetle are two other invasive pests that we should be concerned about. My legislation will help prevent all of these stowaways from sneaking into our ports and then into our forests.  This legislation is only a first step in preventing future introductions of these pests. We also need to increase funding for the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service to increase the number of inspectors at our ports and improve shipping information on imports to track the source of these pests. We also need to launch a public awareness campaign to help detect any infestations within our country. In Vermont, we have beetle-identification cards to help the public spot the beetle in their backyards or sugarbushes. We need to do this in all the high-risk areas.  All of these steps will help protect our forests and forest economies from the Asian longhorned beetle and other pests that could wreak havoc if they get their antennas in the door.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows;                                S. 2480       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Invasive Pest Control Act of      1998''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds that--       (1) the importation of unprocessed logs, lumber, and other      unmanufactured wood articles into the United States may      result in the introduction of nonindigenous pests and      pathogens to native North American forests;       (2) when environmental conditions are favorable,      nonindigenous pests and pathogens may prey on and devastate      native North American tree species, devastate habitat,      disrupt other native species and the environment, and disrupt      the economy of affected forest areas;       (3) the Comptroller General of the United States has      reported that the potential economic disruption to      communities affected by nonindigenous pests and pathogens      entering the United States, including forest pests, costs an      estimated $41,000,000,000 annually in lost production and      expenses for prevention and control;       (4) commercial forestry is estimated to lose forest      products valued at $4,000,000,000 each year due to      infestations of nonindigenous pests and pathogens;       (5) once introduced into the United States on unprocessed      logs, lumber, and other unmanufactured wood articles,      nonindigenous pests and pathogens are unintentionally or      unknowingly transported and introduced into inland forests      and habitats by truck transport and train shipment to mills,      consumers, and producers and by a variety of other means,      including wind, water, and wildlife;       (6) examples of nonindigenous pests and pathogens infesting      forests of the United States that have caused or have the      potential to cause adverse economic and ecological effects      include--       (A) Dutch Elm disease, which--       (i) was introduced into the United States in the 1920's      with a shipment of European logs delivered to the Port of New      York and then forwarded to the Midwest by train;       (ii) has spread throughout the United States, now to an      estimated 1,000,000 trees; and       (iii) has decimated the American and other native elm      species;       (B) the Gypsy Moth, which--       (i) has no natural predators in the United States;       (ii) spread rapidly and now infests Northeast forest in      approximately 200,000 square miles, with smaller infestations      occurring in several other areas from the Carolinas to      British Columbia; and       (iii) feeds on hundreds of different tree species and      during outbreaks can defoliate many hardwood and shrub      species in their path, seriously weakening trees and stunting      the growth of, and eventually killing, many of the trees;       (C) the Asian Long-Horned Beetle, which--       (i) is a new exotic pest that has been discovered at ports      across the United States;       (ii) has no natural enemies and has attacked mostly Norway      and sugar maples,     some of the most valuable trees in the Northeast; and       (iii) is considered a serious threat to the maple sugar      industry, lumber industry, homeowner property values, and      tourism in the Northeast; and       (D) more recent nonindigenous pests and pathogens that have      become established in the forests of the United States and      are causing economic and ecological degradation with respect      to the natural forest resources of the United States,      including the Port Orford Cedar Root Rot, the Pine Wilt      disease, the Eurasian poplar rust fungus (discovered on the      West Coast), and the pine shoot beetle (introduced in the      Great Lakes area); and       (7) if preventive management measures are not taken in a      timely manner throughout the United States to prevent      nonindigenous pests and pathogens from entering the United      States on unprocessed wood products or to control their      entry, further introductions and infestations of      nonindigenous plants and pathogens will occur.     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.       The purpose of this Act are--       (1) to prevent the unintentional introduction and      dispersion of nonindigenous pests and pathogens into forests      of the United States through the importation of unprocessed      logs, lumber, and other unmanufactured wood articles;       (2) to preserve and protect the health of the forests of      the United States, the forest-dependent economy of the United      States, native North American tree species, and irreplaceable      habitat from the potentially devastating effects of      nonindigenous pests and pathogens;       (3) to coordinate federally conducted, funded, or      authorized research, prevention, control, information      dissemination, and other activities regarding forest pests      and pathogens; and       (4) to understand and minimize the economic and ecological      impact of nonindigenous pests and pathogens.
