 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a valued educator in my State who is retiring in November after more than 30 years of service to the youth of Kentucky, Mr. Clatis Walker.  The education profession is one that people seem to take for granted from time to time in our society, but its importance cannot be overlooked. The impact educators have on future generations is paramount. This responsibility is made all the greater when the focus is on children with special needs. Mr. Walker has taken this responsibility and welcomed it throughout his career.  In 1972, Mr. Walker began his career as a special education teacher in Montgomery County, KY. Six years later, he became a field service consultant for the Bureau of Education for Exceptional Children for the Kentucky Department of Education.  Mr. Walker jumped back into the classroom in 1980 when he accepted the position as Special Education Work Study Program coordinator and Athletics Director at Bourbon County High School. In 1982, he returned to Montgomery County, where he began his teaching career. He spent the next 9 years serving in several capacities including, special education coordinator, early childhood coordinator, chairman of the Northeastern Bluegrass Education Cooperative Project, and Assistant Principal at J.B. McNabb Middle School.  A change in profession occurred in 1991 when he left the education field to become an assistant vice president at Montgomery Traders Bank, where he was a loan specialist. His absence in the Montgomery County school system was noticed and in 1993, Mr. Walker returned as the Director of Special Education and the Director of Public Relations.  In 1999, he was named the Executive Director of the Central Kentucky Special Education Cooperative. This cooperative aims to enhance the educational opportunities for its students by allowing the Kentucky Department of Education, school districts, and state universities to work together. The important work of this cooperative has taken place because of the leadership of Mr. Walker.  Mr. President, today I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring and recognizing the career of this outstanding Kentuckian, Mr. Clatis Walker.                          ____________________
