Speaker, this is a program that works. It takes those older vehicles off the road. As far as I know, industry supports this. It is better for our communities, which is why our committee, under both Republican and Democratic chairmen and administrations, has supported this, letting the appropriators decide the level of funding that it actually prescribes.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues, again on a bipartisan basis, to support this, and I yield back the balance of my time.
