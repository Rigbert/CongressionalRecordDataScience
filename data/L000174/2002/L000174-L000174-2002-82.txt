President, this week Republican critics, for whom we expedited hearings and committee votes on a number of judicial nominees in their home States, spoke on the floor about their frustration that not all the President's judicial nominees have yet been confirmed. They complain about a handful of judicial nominees. The fact is that the hearing I will chair next week will include the 100th judicial nominee to receive a hearing since the Democrats became the majority party in the Senate less than 15 months ago. Had the Senate been more productive in 1999 and 2000 and the first months of 2001, when a Republican majority was not holding hearings and votes on judicial nominees, we would be farther along. Since the shift in majority, we have been proceeding dramatically faster than the Republicans. It took Republicans 33 months, almost 3 full years, to hold hearings for 100 of President Clinton's judicial nominees when they were in the majority, we will exceed that mark next week, in less than 15 months.  Republican critics who now come to the floor of the Senate expressing outrage that a handful of judicial nominees have not had a hearing in the past year, were deafeningly silent when scores of President Clinton's judicial nominees never received hearings after many months and years. For example, Judge Helene White of Michigan, nominated to the Sixth Circuit, waited in vain for over 4 years, 1,454 days, for a hearing and never had a hearing or a vote. James Beaty of North Carolina, nominated to the Fourth Circuit, waited in vain for almost 3 years, 1,033 days, and never got a hearing. H. Alston Johnson of Louisiana, nominated to the Fifth Circuit, waited in vain for over 600 days and never got a hearing. Others, such as Allen Snyder and Bonnie Campbell who were nominated to the D.C. Circuit and Eighth Circuit, received hearings but no committee vote. Likewise, Clarence Sundram, nominated to the Northern District of New York, waited 19 months for a hearing and then languished in committee without the committee vote for 18 months before his nomination was returned, after pending before the Senate for 1,119 days. There were others, too many others, who waited in vain for a hearing or after a hearing for committee consideration.  In addition, it often took months and sometimes years for those who were ultimately confirmed to be acted upon by the Republican-controlled Senate. For example, Judge Richard Paez, nominated to the 9th Circuit, was finally confirmed after four years, 1,520 days; Judge William Fletcher, also nominated to the 9th Circuit, was finally confirmed after 1,264 days; Judge Hilda Tagle, nominated to the District Court in Texas, waited 943 days to be confirmed; Judge Susan Molloway, nominated to the District Court in Hawaii, waited 913 days to be confirmed, Judge Ann Aiken, nominated to the District Court in Oregon, waited 791 days to be confirmed; Judge Timothy Dyk, nominated to the Federal Circuit, waited 785 days to be confirmed; Judge Marsha Berzon, nominated to the 9th Circuit, waited 772 days to be confirmed; Ronald Gould, nominated to the 9th Circuit, waited 739 days to be confirmed; Margaret McKeown, nominated to the 9th Circuit, waited 728 days to be confirmed; and Margaret Morrow, nominated to the California District Court, waited almost 2 years to be confirmed. Many others took more than 1 year.  I understand how difficult the confirmation process can be. During the 6\1/2\ years Republicans controlled the Senate only 39 judicial nominees, including seven circuit court nominees, were confirmed per year on average. In contrast, in less than 15 months, the Democratic majority has already confirmed 80 judicial nominees.  The confirmation process can be frustrating at times, but it is also important work by which we implement our constitutionally-mandated advise and consent role for these lifetime appointments. It is a role that I do not take lightly and the other Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee do not take lightly. Accordingly, it is distressing to hear unintentionally inaccurate portrayals of the progress we have made in the less 15 months of Democratic control of the Senate. It is true that we have not been able to confirm every single judicial nominee proposed by this President, but we have worked at a historically fast pace to address the vacancy crisis by moving consensus nominees first and working our way through the more controversial and divisive nominees.  Since the summer of 2001, we have held more hearings for more judicial nominees and more hearings for circuit court nominees than in any comparable 15-month period of the 6\1/2\ years in which Republicans last controlled the committee. With our hearing last week, the Democratic-led Judiciary Committee has now held 25 hearings for 96 district and circuit court nominees. This is twice the pace at which the Republican majority considered President Clinton's judicial nominees. The Judiciary Committee has likewise voted on more judicial nominees, 83, and on more circuit court nominees, 17, than in any comparable 15-month period of prior Republicancontrol. In fact, Democrats have given votes to more judicial nominees than in 1996 and 1997 combined as well as in 1999 and 2000 combined.  During their 6\1/2\ years of control, Republicans allowed only 39 judicial nominees to be confirmed per year, on average, 39, and only seven circuit court nominees to be confirmed per year on average. In contrast, in little more than a year, Democrats have already confirmed 80 of this Republican President's judicial nominees, including 14 circuit court nominees. We have done twice as much as their average, and yet they still complain.  Rather than compare the improvements we are making over the way they treated the judicial nominees of the last President when they were recently in the Senate majority, they would pick other times when the Senate and executive branch were headed by those of the same party. This reveals how embarrassed they must be about their own record. That must be why they ignore their own record and refuse to acknowledge the improvements we have made, the hard work we have done, and all that we have accomplished.  This past week, Republicans reiterated their claim that other Presidents had 80 or 90 percent of their circuit court nominees confirmed. This ignores entirely the efforts of these same Republicans to block President Clinton's circuit court nominees. For example, in 1996, Republicans allowed none, zero percent and the absolute number of zero circuit court nominees to be confirmed. In 1997, Republicans allowed only 7 of President Clinton's 21 circuit court nominees to be confirmed, about one-third. Only 5 of President Clinton's first 11 circuit court nominees that year were confirmed that same year. In 1998, Republicans allowed 13 of the 23 pending circuit court nominees to be confirmed, which was 56 percent for the year, their best year for circuit court confirmations in their 6\1/2\ years of control of the Senate. In 1999, Republicans were back down to 28 percent, when they allowed only seven of the 25 circuit court nominations made to be confirmed, or about one of every four. Four of President Clinton's first 11 circuit court nominees that year were not confirmed. In 2000, Republicans allowed only 8 of the 26 circuit court nominees pending to be confirmed, or 31 percent. All but one of the circuit court candidates initially nominated that year, were returned to President Clinton without confirmation.  Republicans simply have no standing to complain that 100 percent of President George W. Bush's circuit court nominees have not been confirmed. Recent history makes their complaints on this point ring hollow. Democrats have been better by far to this President's judicial nominees than Republicans were to the last President's. For example, at the most recent judicial nominations hearing held last week, Democrats had already given hearings to 96 of the 105 eligible judicial nominees with complete files, the remaining two dozen nominees did not have completed files. Thus, 91 percent of judicial nominees who had completed files were given a hearing. This remarkable achievement is irrefutable evidence that we are not blocking this administration's judicial nominees.  I am certain that President Clinton would have been overcome with gratitude if the Republicans ever gave 91 percent of his judicial nominees hearings in the years Republicans controlled the confirmation process during his administration. They never did. Instead, almost half the time his judicial nominees never got hearings or votes. Indeed, only 49 percent of President Clinton's circuit court nominations were confirmed, 46 out of 93 nominations during the period of Republican control. How dare they complain that 100 percent or 90 percent of President Bush's circuit court or district court nominees have not been confirmed in our first 14\1/2\ months of control.  The real reason there are so many circuit vacancies is because Republicans blocked so many of President Clinton's judicial nominees. During the 6\1/2\ years of Republican control, the number of circuit vacancies more than doubled from 16 to 33, and the total number of vacancies increased from 65 to 110 by the time of the reorganization of the committee in the summer of 2001. If Republicans had not blocked the confirmation of almost two dozen, 22, circuit court nominees and many more district court nominees, Democrats on the Judiciary Committee would have begun with 11 circuit court vacancies, instead of the 33 we inherited. With the 10 new circuit court vacancies that arose over these past 14\1/2\ months, there would have been a total of 22 circuit court vacancies for this President to fill. At the Democratic pace of considering circuit court nominees, almost of all of them would have had hearings by now, and 14 of them would have already been confirmed, with our pace of confirmation. That would have left only 6 vacancies on the circuit courts today. That is what might have been, but for the determined, strategic blocking of so many circuit court nominees during the 6\1/2\ years of Republican control of the Senate.  Instead, even after 14 circuit confirmations, there are 27 circuit court vacancies. This number is still fewer than at the start of this Congress and fewer than the 33 vacancies we inherited. We have outstripped attrition and are making progress. We cannot undo the damage done between 1995 and 2001 overnight, but we have held hearings for 96 of this President's judicial nominees, which is more circuit and district court nominees in less than 15 months than they held when they first took over the Senate or in their subsequent years. It is more in raw numbers and in percentages. We have made real progress to fix the problems that we inherited from the period of Republican control of the process.  The Judiciary Committee has focused on consensus nominees. This prioritization will help end the crisis caused by Republican delay and obstruction by confirming as many of the President's judicial nominees as quickly as possible. Most Senators understand that the more controversial nominees require greater review. This process of careful review is part of our democratic process. It is a critical part of the checks and balances of our system of government that does not give the power to make lifetime appointments to one person alone to remake the courts along narrow ideological lines, to pack the courts with judges whose views are outside of the mainstream of legal thought, and whose decisions would further divide our nation. The Senate should not and will not rubber stamp nominees who would undermine the independence and fairness of our federal courts. It is our responsibility to preserve a fair, impartial and independent judiciary for all Americans, of all races, all religions, whether rich or poor, whether Democrat or Republican.  The committee continues to try to accommodate Senators from both sides of the aisle. Virtually all of the Court of Appeals nominees included at hearings so far this year have been at the request of Republican Senators, including Senator Grassley, Senator Lott, Senator Specter, Senator Enzi, Senator Smith, and Senator Thompson, Republican Senators who each sought a prompt hearing on a Court of Appeals nominee and who was accommodated.  However, the whipsawing by Republicans has been truly remarkable. When we proceed on nominees that they support and on whom they seek action, we are criticized for not acting on others. When we direct our effort to trying to solve problems in one Circuit, they complain that we are not acting in another. Since these multiple problems arose on their watch while they were in the majority, it is a bit like the arsonist who complains that the local fire department is not responding fast enough to all of his destructive antics.  This week the Senate confirmed its 79th and 80th judicial nominees since the change in Senate majority and reorganization of the Judiciary Committee less than 15 months ago. In so doing, we have confirmed more judicial nominees than were confirmed in the first 15 months of any of the past three Presidents and more judicial nominees than were confirmed in the last 30 months that a Republican majority controlled the Senate. Simply put, we have done more in half the time. We have achieved what we said we would by treating President Bush's nominees more fairly and more expeditiously than President Clinton's nominees were treated. Partisan critics of these accomplishments ignore the facts. The facts are that we are confirming President Bush's nominees at a faster pacethan the nominees of prior presidents, including those who worked closely with a Senate majority of the same political party.  At this important time in our Nation's history we can all appreciate the need for a sound judiciary. Under the Democratic majority, we will continue to review nominees' files expeditiously and grant hearings regularly to candidates with complete paperwork and home State consent. Our record breaking efforts in the past 14\1/2\ months have left us with few remaining nominees who are ready to appear before the Committee. Of the circuit court nominees who have not yet received a hearing, half of them, 6, are without home State consent. Only 3 remain from the initial 11 circuit court nominees who have not had a hearing and have home State Senator support. Of the 17 district court nominees who have not yet received a hearing, more than half of them 9 have incomplete paperwork, including six of them without home State consent. Moreover, 9 out of 17 district court nominees are without ABA ratings.  Despite the partisan din about blockades and obstructionism, Democrats are actually achieving almost twice as much as our Republican counterparts did to staff the Federal courts. The Democratic Senate has shown its resolve to work in a bipartisan way to fill judicial vacancies. That is what the confirmation of 80 judges in less than 15 months demonstrates.  But let me be clear. Our judiciary would be in even better shape if so many judicial nominees of the prior administration had not been purposely blocked and defeated, if we received more timely reviews from the ABA, and even a little cooperation from this administration by nominating more moderate, mainstream judicial nominees. I, again, invite the President and all Republicans to join with us and work with us to fill the remaining judicial vacancies as quickly as possible with qualified, consensus nominees chosen from the mainstream and not for their ideological orientation, nominees who will be fair and impartial judges and will ensure that an independent judiciary is the people's bulwark against a loss of their freedoms and rights.                          ____________________
