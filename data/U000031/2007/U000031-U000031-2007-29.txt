Working with the Parliamentarians to make sure that the amendment is germane, we were not able to use the words ``or equivalent'' when we said ``ENERGY STAR or equivalent.'' We would like to see that happen in the conference, but we know that that is legislating on an appropriation bill.  We would also like to have a provision for historical lighting. Again, that needs to happen in conference, it cannot happen on the House floor, and that's why we proceeded in that way. We look forward to working with all parties to make sure those concerns are addressed.
