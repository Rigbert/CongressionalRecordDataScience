 President, my colleague from Iowa has accurately stated what the Constitution says and what we can do. I don't have any dispute with that. The only dispute I would have is whether or not it would be wise for Congress to do that after we have had such a success of building confidence in the economy when there is an absence of congressional manipulation of monetary policy. I fear if there is a perception in the private sector of Congress from time to time making an impact upon monetary policy, that is going to build in protection for people who are investing and, consequently, drive interest rates up. We don't want that to happen.  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.
