 Chairman, I thank my friend for yielding, and I am not quite sure I understand the chairman's confusion on this issue.  The gentleman is correct. No money would go to maintain the SPR unless oil was released, and that certainly can be done, as the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Kucinich) indicated, through a swap. That is not a difficult process.  What we are saying very clearly is that millions of working people are paying through the nose in high gas prices; it is imperative that this Congress act. We have had Republican presidents, Democratic presidents, Republican Members of the House, Democratic, Independent Members of this House, who have shown sympathy to this idea. It is a simple idea. It could lower the price of gas, and we should go forward on it. It is a totally practical approach.
