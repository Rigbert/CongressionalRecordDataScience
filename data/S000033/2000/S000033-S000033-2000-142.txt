 Speaker, I insert for printing in the Record the following letter from Robert and Patricia Arnold of Newport, Vermont expressing their gratitude to the personnel of the Naval Nuclear Power Training Command for taking action to save their son, Nathaniel's, life.  I believe the views of Robert and Patricia Arnold will benefit my colleagues.                                                  Newport, Vt,                                                December 27, 1999.     Admiral [Frank L.] Bowman     Director, Dir. Div. of NAVREACT DOE, Washington, DC.       Dear Admiral Bowman, On November 23, 1999, our eighteen      year old son, Nathaniel Spencer Arnold, a Seaman in training      at Naval Nuclear Power Training Command, was admitted to the      hospital and near death as a result of a serious illness he      had encountered in the preceding six weeks. Nathaniel had      enlisted in the Navy on July 29th, 1999, competed boot camp,      and was three weeks into his training at Naval Nuclear Power      Training Command. He had graduated from boot camp with      academic honors for his division and, as of November 24th,      was maintaining a 3.2 average at Naval Nuclear Power Training      Command. The significance of his efforts and ability are      better understood with the knowledge that he maintained this      standing at Naval Nuclear Power Training Command while losing      45 of his normal 150 pounds in the course of battling the      illness he had encountered during the preceding six weeks. It      is also indicative of the value Nathaniel placed on      fulfilling his desire to enter the Navy and to excel at his      chosen career.       On November 26, we were contacted by Lt. Callahan, acting      in behalf of the Navy and the Naval Nuclear Power Training      Command, to notify us of the seriousness of our son's illness      and to arrange for and make the travel arrangements to get my      wife and I down to Charleston. We were informed that due to      the seriousness of his illness, the Navy had established a      watch for him pending either his recovery or his death. It      would be difficult to detail all the events which have      transpired since that eventful day but suffice it to say that      despite his prognosis at the time, Nathaniel survived his      illness and went on to impress the doctors with his      remarkably quick and continuing recovery process. Words can      never express the personal meaning to us of Nathaniel's      recovery.       Nonetheless, we can express our appreciation to the Navy      and the personnel acting in behalf of the Navy for the      efforts taken in behalf of Nathaniel and ourselves. This      letter is written to express for the record our deep      appreciation to the Navy and its representatives at the Naval      Nuclear Power Training Command in Charleston, South Carolina,      for those efforts. It is very plain to us that Nathaniel's      life would have been lost but for the efforts of the Navy in      securing the medical treatment he received. It is also very      plain to us that our presence with Nathaniel also played an      important role in his survival of that eventful night of      November 26th in which he turned the corner with respect to      battling his illness. . . . a presence he would have been      denied but for the help we obtained with our travel      arrangements through the efforts of the Navy personnel at      Naval Power Training Command.       I would like to specially recognize Captain Hicks, the      commanding officer of the NNPTC, for his role in ensuring      that the Naval Nuclear Power Training Command offered its      best to Nathaniel and ourselves during this process. And I      would be remiss not to mention the efforts of Commander      Crossley and Lt. Callahan for the quality of their efforts in      Nathaniel's and our behalf. I would like to commend Commander      Crossley for his direct interest and rapport with Nathaniel      which contributed in no small way to Nathaniel's recovery.      And I would like to commend Lt. Callahan for his personal      interest and the thoroughness with which he carried out the      directions of Captain Hicks and Commander Crossley in      ensuring that everything possible was done for Nathaniel and      ourselves while in Charleston. And the direct interest of not      only Petty Officer Baker but also his wife in Nathaniel's      well-being during his hospitalization should not be omitted.      All of these individuals contributed not only in Nathaniel's      recovery but also conveyed a very positive image of the Navy      to all involved in this process. . . . from the hospital      staff all the way down to the family and friends of the other      residents of the Intensive Care Unit at the Trident Medical      Center in Charleston and ourselves.       We would like to do all we can to recognize the Navy's      efforts in helping Nathaniel successfully recover from his      illness and to recognize the individual endeavors of the Navy      personnel in carrying out those efforts. We would also like      to recognize the excellent relationship which exists between      the Navy and the medical staff of the Trident Medical Center      which permitted Nathaniel to receive the care he required.      This letter is being written for that purpose and my wife and      I hope that it has, in some way, accomplished our desire to      recognize the Navy, its personnel, and those operating in      behalf of the Navy for their excellence in returning to us      the life of our son.           Very truly yours,                                       Robert and Patricia Arnold.                               ____________________
