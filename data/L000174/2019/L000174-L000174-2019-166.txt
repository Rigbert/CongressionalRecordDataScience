President, I want to talk about what is happening in Congress. We are in the 13th day of the Trump shutdown--13 days that 9 of 15 Federal Departments and dozens of Agencies have shut their doors; 13 days in which hundreds of thousands of Americans have been furloughed or are working without pay; 13 days that Americans have been denied government services on which they rely and for which they pay taxes.  The President is holding Federal Government funding hostage in an attempt to force American taxpayers to pay for an ineffective and expensive wall on the southern border that he promised over and over again Mexico would pay for. Everybody knows that is not true. Mexico will not pay for President Trump's wall. Unfortunately, the American people are paying the price of the Trump shutdown, and, frankly, he does not seem to care. Let me give some examples.  Since the shutdown began, our national parks--the treasure of this country--have been left largely unsupervised. The welcome centers are closed. Park Rangers have been furloughed. There are few emergency or law enforcement personnel left to police the parks or rescue injured guests. That affects visitor safety, it reduces public access, and it threatens national and cultural resources in national parks in every part of our country. We are already receiving reports of damage to sensitive lands and national treasures--campgrounds littered with trash, overflowing toilets, locked restrooms. Even where parks remain open, campgrounds and other sites are beginning to close because of the obvious health and safety reasons.  Aside from government, businesses and gateway communities surroundingour parks--taxpaying businesses--are also paying the price of lost sales, rentals, and empty storefronts, as families cancel their plans to visit because the shutdown drags on and on and on.  Because of the Trump shutdown, the U.S. Forest Service has curtailed forest thinning and fire-prevention projects. Just think of that. Within months of when the Nation was reeling from and dealing with a record-setting fire season, we cannot do the things that might prevent these devastating fires--we cannot get in there and work on them.  Just a few days ago, the Farm Service Agency shut their doors. That is the Agency that supports farmers and rural communities across the country. We came together--Republicans and Democrats--and passed a 5-year farm bill. I was proud to be one of the conferees of that farm bill. I saw both parties work together. We passed it. It is a complex and important bill, but farmers and ranchers need information from that bill right now.  Every farmer and rancher will tell you they are planning for the growing season: What can they plant? What should they buy? What should they do? They don't know how the laws will affect their operations heading into the planting season. Why? Because no one is in the office or staffing the phones, answering these questions or signing up producers for new programs. There is nobody there. Farmers will also not be able to apply for much needed loans that they count on to get started in the year and pay back as a result of their labor during the season.  Many farmers, like those in my home State of Vermont, face financial hardship due to the dramatic drop in commodity prices brought on by President Trump's tariffs. They need these loans to help pay their bills, stay afloat through the winter and prepare for the spring planting. With banks not willing to lend to them and not knowing what is going to happen, many rely on the U.S. Department of Agriculture as their lender of last resort. But the doors are closed, and there is nobody home.  While the President loudly proclaimed he would provide assistance through the Market Facilitation Program to help farmers mitigate the financial losses caused by his tariffs, as of December 28, there is no one there to process any new applications for these payments. The bottom line? The President put the tariffs in, but now they are told to fend for themselves because the President is holding the Department of Agriculture and its safety nets hostage to secure funding for his border wall. The Department of Agriculture has nothing to do with President Trump's border wall. It could not fund it if they wanted to. Yet virtually every farmer of every kind in this country is going to be affected by it.  In addition to government services that have ground to a halt, an estimated 450,000 employees are working, but they are working without pay. That includes 41,000 Federal law enforcement and correctional officers at the Department of Justice--ATF agents, FBI, U.S. marshals, and DEA agents. They are not getting paid, but their mortgages still come due. The tuition payments for their children's education comes due. If they have healthcare costs, that comes due. They are told: You show up for work. Maybe we will get around to paying you and maybe we will not.  Then, you have 380,000 Federal employees who also have children, families and bills who have been furloughed. They have no guarantee that they will receive back payment when they return to work. Let me give you an idea of who some of these people are. They are 96 percent of our employees at NASA. I suppose they can sit at home and watch China land their satellite on the back side of the Moon.  Who else does it include? It includes 80 percent of the National Park Service, 60 percent of the Department of Commerce, and 33 percent of the Forest Service. In addition, many Federal contractors have discontinued their services, which leaves thousands of employees without work and without a paycheck.  This doesn't affect the President, but many of our dedicated Federal employees work every day to serve our country, and they live paycheck to paycheck: custodial workers, cafeteria workers, telephone operators, contract specialists, customer service representatives. These are the people the taxpayers can call when they have a question, and now they get no answer. They are people who have mortgages to pay. They have families to take care of. This financial disruption comes on the heels of the holiday season, when so many families' budgets are tight, it is even harder to fathom. It is even harder to justify. In fact, I will say it cannot be justified.  Most of these Federal employees who are without a paycheck have absolutely nothing to do with border security. That is the worst part about it. They are not the ones involved with border security, but they are casualties of President Trump's single-minded obsession of walling off our southern border. The President has repeatedly said: This is all about are border security.  Really? Really? Come on. Give me a break. His actions caused the very Department in charge of securing our borders to be cut off from all the funding. Eighty-eight percent of the Department of Homeland Security employees are working without pay. They have to think about how they are going to pay their mortgage, their bills. They are working without pay. That includes 54,000 Customs and Border Patrol agents who protect our southern border and our northern borders. Many of them are veterans.  As of January 1, roughly 42,000 hard-working, dedicated members of our Nation's Coast Guard will be protecting our country without pay. TSA officers screened over 2 million passengers and their bags per day through the holidays, but they are not being paid. I talked to some when I flew back from Vermont. It is hurting. One has healthcare bills. Another has a mortgage. They don't know how they are going to pay it.  Last week, House Democrats put forward a commonsense path to end the Trump shutdown. They introduced a minibus comprised of six bipartisan appropriations bills and a continuing resolution for the Department of Homeland Security to keep it up and running through February 8.  The House is going to vote on both these bills this evening. I expect they will pass. After all, just a few weeks ago, the same bills passed this Republican-controlled Senate unanimously. We know the votes are there to pass.  I urge my friend, the majority leader, Senator McConnell, and Senate Republicans to take up these bills expeditiously. The six-bill minibus is not controversial. Senator Shelby is chairman of the Appropriations Committee, I am vice chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and we both voted for them, as have virtually all members of the Appropriations Committee. There is wide bipartisan support in this Chamber. In fact, four of the six bills passed the Senate 96 to 6. The other two reported out of the Appropriations Committee were nearly unanimous votes. Why? Because they are a product of bipartisan compromise. They provide billions of dollars in new resources to address critical needs of the American people and to protect the U.S. national security.  It is irresponsible for the President to hold these six bills hostage in order to compel taxpayers to pay for his wall, a wall he falsely promised Mexico would pay for. If he would stop holding them hostage, we could pass these bills and send them to the President for signature. That would get the vast majority of the Federal Government back open for the good of the American people. We ought to do that.  It also makes sense to pass a continuing resolution for the Department of Homeland Security through February 8. We should not shut down the very Agency responsible for securing our borders over a fight for what is the best way to secure our border.  I will tell you what is not the best way, to furlough everybody, stop paying them, close down the government. Does that make us secure? Of course, it does not. Everyone agrees--Republicans and Democrats alike--we need to keep our borders safe and secure. Let's have smart border security, border security that works--new technologies proven to work on the border and our ports of entry, new air and marine assets, and additional personnel where needed. We do not need a 30-foot medieval wall. I visited that border. I know from the professionals who are therewhat they need. They need a lot of resources, the very last of which would be a wall.  Let's recall, before the holidays, the President said he would sign a continuing resolution through February 8. We had a path forward. We all relied on the President's word. After 24 hours of FOX News and rightwing pundits criticizing him, the President's ego was so bruised he reversed course and broke his word. Here we are, 13 days into a Trump shutdown.  It has to end. We have a clear, sensible, responsible path forward. I strongly urge the Senate Republicans to support and pass this bipartisan compromise. After all, almost every Republican and every Democrat has voted for these bills. Let's vote for them again and tell the President we will work on what is needed for border security. We all agree on the need for border security. Let's work on what is the best way forward, but let's not close down the Department of Agriculture. Let's not close down all these other Departments that American taxpayers rely on.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator from Texas is recognized.                          ____________________
