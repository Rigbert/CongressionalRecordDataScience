 A lot of people wonder whether this makes much of a difference, what the Senator is attempting to do in the case of the Chinese Embassy. I can tell you it made a big difference. All you have to do is measure the opposition as we were considering the one I introduced several years ago. When the State Department fights hard not to embarrass the Russians, when the city of Washington, DC, fights very hard not to rename a street, then you know you are on the right track, when you have those sorts of people in opposition to you.
