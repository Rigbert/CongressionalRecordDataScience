Shap Smith who represents the towns of Elmore, Morristown, Woodbury, and Worcester, and who is now the current speaker of the Vermont House of Representatives.  Having recently assumed the role of speaker at the beginning of this legislative session in January, Mr. Smithhas already made his mark as a fair-minded and seasoned leader. He has driven the successful passage of several pieces of legislation, addressing Vermont's sexual abuse response system and legalizing same-sex marriage, among other important issues. Marcelle and I recently had dinner with Shap and his wife Dr. Melissa Volansky. We are both impressed with his commitment to Vermont.  I am looking forward to watching Shap Smith continue to lead the Vermont Legislature and build a record of fiscal and social responsibility. I wish him luck as he undertakes this challenging job during these difficult times.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of an April 20, 2009, Rutland Herald article about Mr. Smith be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Rutland Herald, Apr. 20, 2009]                    Smith Leads With Grinning Style                            (By Susan Allen)       Montpelier.--Each speaker of the Vermont House has his or      her own leadership style.       Ralph Wright growled.       Michael Obuchowski boomed.       Walt Freed ruled.       Gaye Symington analyzed.       And Shap Smith . . . well, he grins.       ``I'm a friendly guy,'' said House Speaker Smith, new to      the post this session, when asked last week about his style.      Smith, himself a Democrat, reaches across the political aisle      to work with Republicans, Progressives and Democrats alike.       But don't think he's a pushover.       ``People know I take the issues pretty seriously,'' added      Smith, a University of Vermont and Indiana University School      of Law graduate who handles intellectual property, insurance      coverage and civil litigation with the firm Dinse/Knapp/     McAndrew during the off-session. ``I can go toe-to-toe in      debating issues.''       Looking at the speaker, opponents might be tempted to      underestimate his political skills. With a wiry frame from      running, cross-country skiing and other athletic activities,      and his wire-rimmed glasses, Smith looks about 25. He is, in      fact, 43.       And anyone who thought he might be too young to lead need      look no further than the recent House vote to override the      governor's veto of the same-sex marriage bill. Smith needed      100 members to support the override, and going into the vote,      the outcome was far from certain.       As he announced the final tally to the House floor--to the      surprise of many, the needed 100 voted with the speaker and      same-sex marriage would become law in Vermont--Smith stepped      away from the podium briefly and appeared emotional.       ``I have friends and colleagues to whom and for whom this      bill meant a great deal,'' he said during a conversation last      week in his window-lined Statehouse office. ``I am very      pleased we were able to do it. It was a great achievement.''       Shap is actually Shapleigh Jr., a name that came from his      grandmother, who was adopted into the Shapleigh family from      the town of Shapleigh, Maine. His grandmother grew up in West      Lebanon, N.H., where ``there were all these Shapleighs,'' he      added.       ``I went to high school in Morrisville. I always wanted a      different name,'' Smith said. ``Dave or Tim would have been      just fine. Shapleigh is not a usual Vermont name.''       Smith had an eye on public service since serving in student      government in school. He followed politics closely in the      1990s while living in New York City and working for a law      firm there, and started becoming more serious about a run      after moving to Morrisville in 1999.       In 2002, with 2-month-old son Eli at home but an open      legislative seat calling, he took the plunge, becoming what      he described as the ``Stealth'' candidate knocking on doors,      re-acquainting himself with friends from childhood and their      families, and quietly winning the seat under the radar.       As all legislative leaders discover, juggling the pressing      Statehouse agenda and a home life is challenging (he has two      young children, and wife Melissa is a general practitioner).       ``I go home almost every night,'' he said, adding that he      tries to arrive in time to read to his children or at least      put them to bed. ``I'm the one that gets them up in the      morning, which is a real reality check.''       Things are less clear at the Statehouse, where Smith is      focusing on his legislative agenda:       (1) Repairing and maintaining Vermont's transportation      system--the roads and bridges;       (2) Expanding and improving telecommunications (computer      broadband) in rural areas;       (3) Strengthening Vermont's public education system; and       (4) Trying to close the gap in educational performance      between students on the lower economic scale and their      wealthier peers--a disparity consistently documented in      national and state school test scores.       Hanging over those priorities is the staggering challenge      of trying to balance the state budget in dire economic times,      with the state hemorrhaging red ink. It is, he said, a task      that ``keeps me up at night.''       ``How do you balance being fiscally responsible with      meeting the needs of the state?'' he asked rhetorically. And      while not completely unexpected, the economic challenge has      been ``worse than some of us thought it would be.''       Returning to the place he was raised, meeting and re-     meeting neighbors, old friends and classmates, and watching      his children grow up in the same area he did seems to drive      Smith's political vision.       ``I want to make sure we put in place policies that allow      the next generation to have the opportunities that I did,''      he said.                          ____________________
