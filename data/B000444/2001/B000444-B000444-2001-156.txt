  So I hope, I say to the new Senators on the floor, they do not make the same mistake this senior Senator did almost 20 years ago; that is, vote for something such as this. We will pay a dear price in this country for this vote.  I compliment the Senator on his comments tonight, as well as his vote in the 1980s. I wish I had the foresight he had to know what was going to happen.
