Speaker, it is a great pleasure for me to rise today to mark the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the City of Dowagiac, Michigan. On February 16, 1848, the city's founding fathers received official recognition, giving birth to a dynamic community that has been thriving ever since.  Over the past century and a half, Dowagiac has served as a focal point for southwest Michigan's progress and development. Many industries have found Dowagiac a great place to do business. They know that if you want the job done right, you get it done in Dowagiac. Home to the campus of Southwest Michigan College and a great school district, Dowagiac is helping the next generation chart a course to the future.  Dowagiac has seen a lot of change during the years. But in times of war and peace, prosperity and tough-times, there is one thing that remains constant. The people of Dowagiac have always cared for each other as neighbors and as a community. We realize that we cannot move forward until we move together. The city was founded in this spirit--it has allowed our town to thrive and will ensure its continued success for many years to come.  I urge my colleagues to join me in recognizing this great American town and wishing the entire community another one hundred and fifty years of success.                          ____________________
