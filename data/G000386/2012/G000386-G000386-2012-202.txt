 President, John M. Gerrard is nominated to be United States District Judge for the District of Nebraska. Judge Gerrard received his B.S. degree from Nebraska Wesleyan University in 1975 and his J.D. from Pacific McGeorge School of Law in 1981.  He began his legal career in private practice as an associate for the Nebraska law firm of Jewell, Otte, Gatz, Collins & Domina. A year later, Judge Gerrard joined in a new law firm where he conducted primarily a general litigation practice. In 1990, Judge Gerrard and two partners formed a new law office. For the next 5 years, before being appointed to the bench, he engaged in an active trial practice and administrative law/school law practice.  In 1995, then-Governor Nelson appointed Judge Gerrard to the Nebraska Supreme Court. He has been retained (by election) in 1998, 2004, and 2010. He has written roughly 480 opinions, 450 of which are published. The opinions cover a variety of legal issues, including homicide appeals, tort issues, and evidentiary disputes. While serving on the State's highest court, Judge Gerrard has served on a number of committees, including those focusing on issues pertaining to gender, race and the judicial system.  The American Bar Association Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary has rated Judge Gerrard with a unanimous ``Well Qualified'' rating.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
