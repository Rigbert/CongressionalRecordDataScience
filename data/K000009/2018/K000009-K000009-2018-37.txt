 Unfortunately, I must rise in strong opposition to this bill and its litany of hollow choices and some dangerous choices.  First, on election security, a day after President Trump told the whole world he believes Russian President Putin over our intelligence community, while claiming Russia didn't hack our 2016 election, this Republican bill provides zero election security grants to help our States prepare against likely cyber interference.  Congress, as the first branch of government, must live up to our constitutional obligation. Just months away from our 2018 elections, President Trump essentially green-lit Putin's ongoing attacks.  Does this body wish to be complicit as we head toward 2018 and 2020? This bill surely suggests so.  Further, this bill attacks clean water access by repealing the waters of the United States rule without any public input regarding a replacement. It puts America's waters and the health and well-being of the American people at even greater risk, and it is a disservice to our constituents.  I strongly oppose the rider that would block the Environmental Protection Agency from addressing waste from animal feeding operations under the Solid Waste Disposal Act. In my watershed, which drains the tristate, binational region of North America into the western end of Lake Erie, the equivalent of 42,500 boxcar loads of animal manure are locally generated every year. That is trainloads of feces over 400 miles long every year seeping into the tributaries to the lake system every year.  Additionally, the majority is far too eager to authorize massive corporate giveaways in this appropriations bill.
