 President, for the information of all of our colleagues, Senator Leahy and I have a couple of housekeeping measures to attend to, which we will do now. Then there will be a vote on the McConnell-Abraham second-degree amendment. If that amendment is successful, we will move to final passage. If that amendment is not successful, it is my understanding Senator Sarbanes wishes to address the Senate further on the underlying Brownback amendment.                Amendment No. 1159, As Further Modified  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I send to the desk a modification of amendment No. 1159.
