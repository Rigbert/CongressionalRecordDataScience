 We learned a great deal of information regarding the very real and ongoing threat from foreign governments to U.S. research.  Congress must continue its oversight to ensure that the Federal Government has the right mix of authorities as well as focus to protect our research and intellectual property. The government spends billions and billions of dollars a year on research. Congress and the executive branch have a responsibility to the taxpayers to get the job done.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
