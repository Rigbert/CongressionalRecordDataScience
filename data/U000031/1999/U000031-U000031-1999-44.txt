Speaker, I came here for one reason, eliminate the deficit and the decades of runaway spending, and now we have a surplus. We do not have a deficit. None of the provisions in this rule; we now trigger about half of the tax cut to make sure that the debt really does come down. Because of the years of runaway spending we have a debt, a national debt of about $5.5 trillion dollars.  Yes, the deficits are gone every year, but we still have a debt, and that debt has got to go down. The triggers that are in place ensure that before we see these tax cuts come into play, we see a real reduction in the national debt.  That is fair, that is reasonable, and that is where we ought to be, and we ought to be proud of this rule and proud of the tax bill we are going to take up tomorrow.
