 President, I oppose the Thune amendment and ask this body to vote against it.  Last year's Interior appropriations bill provided $5.6 billion for Native American programs. This year, the regular appropriations bill and the recently enacted Recovery Act will provide $6.9 billion for Indian health. That is an increase of 23 percent over the 2008 level. The Thune amendment would increase the funding an additional 6 percent, or $400 million, paid for by an across-the-board cut in every account in this omnibus bill. That would cause the Interior bill to exceed its allocation; consequently, a point of order would rest against the entire Interior bill and it would be dead.  I urge a ``no'' vote.
