 Chairman, I thank the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. Rahall) for yielding to me, and just concur with everything he said.  I simply make a point that I think it is important to hear this. Number one, there were no hearings on this idea, so we do not know what the long-term implications are. It is one thing to say, oh, all the States will jump on to this program, but that is not the case.  In fact, what we do know is that the National Association of State Energy Officials did a survey in response to a July 1, 1999 survey. Most States have indicated for a variety of reasons, given the short notice that they received, that they cannot meet this new 25 percent State match requirement. I have a list of those States that said that they cannot.  So I would say this, the major argument, whatever the long-term wisdomor lack of wisdom is, that to just suddenly go ahead without informing the States I think will be a disaster. I think the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. Rahall) is absolutely right.
