Speaker, I rise tonight to honor and remember former Representative Mike Oxley who we lost last month. Today would have been his 72nd birthday, so our presence here tonight is a wonderful way to commemorate his life of service. I remember Mike most for his big smile, which could be seen from across the Chamber, and his love for his wife Patricia and his son Chadd.  Mr. Oxley grew up understanding the importance of service to his country, which he carried out to the very end. He started his career working as a Federal Bureau of Investigations agent in Boston and New York City. He frequently noted this experience directed his Congressional decisions and that set him apart from other Members.  He returned to his hometown of Findlay--Flag City--in 1972 to begin his career in elected office when he won a seat in the Ohio House. For a decade he sharpened and honed his legislative expertise, serving him well for the next chapter of his life. In 1981, he won a special election to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives.  I remember Mike relished working with his fellow Ohio delegation, especially the late Representative Paul Gillmor. Mr. Oxley dedicated his years of federal service to reforming our banking and financial laws. As the Chairman of the Committee on Financial Services, from 2001 to 2006, Ox demonstrated his leadership of Congress' response during very troublesome financial times following the tech bubble struggles of the early 2000s, Wall Street turmoil that followed the 9/11 attacks and corporate scandals including Enron. While Mr. Oxley and I were often on opposite sides, I will always remember him as jovial, collegial, and someone who had a great passion for public service.  I was proud to work with him on the Base Realignment and Closure Commission as we stopped a Pentagon recommendation to reduce the size of the Joint Systems Manufacturing Center in Lima. This effort saved the jobs of 750 people who continue to manufacture tanks and sections of armored vehicles, including the best Army tank in the world, the Abrams.  I was saddened when I learned that Mr. Oxley had been diagnosed with lung cancer. In his fight against cancer, he demonstrated his true spirit, and his eternal dedication to service by joining the Lung Cancer Alliance in 2010. Always fighting for others even amidst his own battle, he became the Board Chairman in January of 2014.  It was an honor and privilege to serve with him and to pay tribute to his life. May his soul rest in peace and may his family be comforted by the memories they share of their times together and the joy he brought to living.                          ____________________
