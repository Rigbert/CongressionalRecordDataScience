Speaker, I am pleased to submit for the Record an essay written by Lia M. Jelinger of my district. Such a kind woman, she serves as an example for all of us and it is important to share her story. Her message is timeless, though it need be oft repeated:       It all started in WWII, whilst suffering under the German      Occupation. I was a teenager then, and experienced suffering,      hate and destruction. I made a vow, as young as I was not to      be part of all this evil, but to show love and compassion the      rest of my life toward my fellow men.       It was in 1957 when I immigrated to the United States with      5 kids in tow. My first job opportunity was to work as a      nurse in pediatrics in a local hospital. After that I      proceeded to become a foster mother and took care all      together of 25 foster babies. A few years later I worked for      Special Olympics, sewing banners, flags, and ribbons at home      so I could be there for my family. I received the ``Service      to Mankind Award'' and personal awards from Eunice Shriver.       In 1990 with so many blessings given to me I started      working for the VA here in Toledo 3 days a week under a      senior program. Lately I found myself with too much idle time      on my hands, which could be utilized and decided to volunteer      on my off days.       I am 73 years young now and still going strong. I reckon      that there are days of achy cracking bones, but that does not      stop me to spread love and compassion I have for my co-     workers and patients alike being cheerful and to make their      day.       I had always wished to some day meet a WWII veteran and one      day the opportunity presented itself. A frail old man entered      the office and asked for some help with his hearing aid and      made clear he was a WWII veteran. I proceeded to ask him      where he was in combat and he told me he was in the      Netherlands, fighting in the Battle of Arnhem and in Germany.      I was overwhelmed since I came from the Netherlands and asked      him permission to hug him and so I did thanking him for his      contribution towards our freedom. He then started to cry and      told me that nobody ever did that to him.       I want to honor those who lost their lives and those who      are still living. It was a horrible experience that we went      through as civilians also, but the good thing about it for me      is, that it formed character.       God bless this great country of ours and may God keep all      those courageous men and women then and now safe with his      protection and loving care.                               ____________________
