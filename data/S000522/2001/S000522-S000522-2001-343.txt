Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 160) calling on the Government of the People's Republic of China to immediately and unconditionally release Li Shaomin and all other American scholars of Chinese ancestry being held in detention, calling on the President of the United States to continue working on behalf of Li Shaomin and the other detained scholars for their release, and for other purposes, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                              H. Res. 160       Whereas in recent months the Government of the People's      Republic of China has arrested and detained several scholars      and intellectuals of Chinese ancestry with ties to the United      States, including at least 2 United States citizens and 3      permanent residents of the United States;       Whereas according to the Department of State's 2000 Country      Reports on Human Rights Practices in China, and international      human rights organizations, the Government of the People's      Republic of China ``has continued to commit widespread and      well-documented human rights abuses, in violation of      internationally accepted norms'';       Whereas the harassment, arbitrary arrest, detention, and      filing of criminal charges against scholars and intellectuals      has created a chilling effect on the freedom of expression,      in contravention of internationally accepted norms, including      the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,      which the People's Republic of China signed in October 1998;       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China      frequently uses torture and other human rights violations to      produce coerced ``confessions'' from detainees;       Whereas the Department of State's 2000 Country Reports on      Human Rights Practices in China has extensively documented      that human rights abuses in the People's Republic of China      ``included instances of extrajudicial killings, the use of      torture, forced confessions, arbitrary arrest and detention,      the mistreatment of prisoners, lengthy incommunicado      detention, and denial of due process'', and also found that      ``[p]olice and prosecutorial officials often ignore the due      process provisions of the law and of the Constitution . . .      [f]or example, police and prosecutors can subject prisoners      to severe psychological pressure to confess, and coerced      confessions frequently are introduced as evidence'';       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China      has reported that some of the scholar detainees have      ``confessed'' to their ``crimes'' of ``spying'', but it has      yet to produce any evidence of spying, and has refused to      permit the detainees to confer with their families or      lawyers;       Whereas the Department of State's 2000 Country Reports on      Human Rights Practices in China also found that ``police      continue to hold individuals without granting access to      family or a lawyer, and trials continue to be conducted in      secret'';       Whereas Dr. Li Shaomin is a United States citizen and      scholar who has been detained by the Government of the      People's Republic of China for more than 100 days, and was      formally charged with spying for Taiwan on May 15, 2001;       Whereas Dr. Li Shaomin has been deprived of his basic human      rights by arbitrary arrest and detention, and has not been      allowed to contact his wife and child (both United States      citizens), or his lawyer;       Whereas Dr. Gao Zhan is a permanent resident of the United      States and scholar who has been detained by the Government of      the People's Republic of China for more than 114 days, and      was formally charged with ``accepting money from a foreign      intelligence agency'' on April 4, 2001;       Whereas Dr. Gao Zhan has been deprived of her basic human      rights by arbitrary arrest and detention, and has not been      allowed to contact her husband and child (both United States      citizens), her lawyer, or Department of State consular      personnel in China;       Whereas Wu Jianmin is a United States citizen and author      who has been detained by the Government of the People's      Republic of China, has been deprived of his basic human      rights by arbitrary arrest and detention, has been denied      access to lawyers and family members, and has yet to be      formally charged with any crimes;       Whereas Qin Guangguang is a permanent resident of the      United States and researcher who has been detained by the      Government of the People's Republic of China on suspicions of      ``leaking state secrets'', has been deprived of his basic      human rights by arbitrary arrest and detention, has been      denied access to lawyers and family members, and has yet to      be formally charged with any crimes;       Whereas Teng Chunyan is a permanent resident of the United      States, Falun Gong practitioner, and researcher who has been      sentenced to three years in prison for spying by the      Government of the People's Republic of China, apparently for      conducting research which documented violations of the human      rights of Falun Gong adherents in China, has been deprived of      her basic human rights by being placed on trial in secret,      and her appeal to the Beijing Higher People's Court was      denied on May 11, 2001;       Whereas Liu Yaping is a permanent resident of the United      States and a businessman who was arrested and detained in      Inner Mongolia in March 2001 by the Government of the      People's Republic of China, has been deprived of his basic      human rights by being denied any access to family members, by      being denied regular access to lawyers, is reported to be      suffering from severe health problems, and has yet to be      formally charged with any crimes;       Whereas because there is documented evidence that the      Government of the People's Republic of China uses torture to      coerce confessions from suspects, and because the Government      has thus far presented no evidence to support its claims that      the detained scholars and intellectuals are spies, and      because spying is vaguely defined under Chinese law, there is      reason to believe that the ``confessions'' of Dr. Li Shaomin      and Dr. Gao Zhan may have been coerced; and       Whereas the arbitrary imprisonment of United States      citizens and residents by the Government of the People's      Republic of China, and the continuing violations of their      fundamental human rights, demands an immediate and forceful      response by Congress and the President of the United States:      Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That--       (1) the House of Representatives--       (A) condemns and deplores the continued detention of Li      Shaomin, Gao Zhan, Wu Jianmin, Qin Guangguang, Teng Chunyan,      and other scholars detained on false charges by the      Government of the People's Republic of China, and calls for      their immediate and unconditional release;       (B) condemns and deplores the lack of due process afforded      to these detainees, and the probable coercion of confessions      from some of them;       (C) condemns and deplores the ongoing and systematic      pattern of human rights violations by the Government of the      People's Republic of China, of which the unjust detentions of      Li Shaomin, Gao Zhan, Wu Jianmin, Qin Guangguang, and Teng      Chunyan, are only important examples;       (D) strongly urges the Government of the People's Republic      of China to consider carefully the implications to the      broader United States-Chinese relationship of detaining and      coercing confessions from United States citizens and      permanent residents on unsubstantiated spying charges or      suspicions;       (E) urges the Government of the People's Republic of China      to consider releasing Liu Yaping on medical parole, as      provided for under Chinese law; and       (F) believes that human rights violations inflicted on      United States citizens and residents by the Government of the      People's Republic of China will reduce opportunities for      United States-Chinese cooperation on a wide range of issues;      and       (2) it is the sense of the House of Representatives that      the President--       (A) should make the immediate release of Li Shaomin, Gao      Zhan, Wu Jianmin, Qin Guangguang, and Teng Chunyan a top      priority of United States foreign policy with the Government      of the People's Republic of China;       (B) should continue to make every effort to assist Li      Shaomin, Gao Zhan, Wu Jianmin, Qin Guangguang, and Teng      Chunyan, and their families, while discussions of their      release are ongoing;       (C) should make it clear to the Government of the People's      Republic of China, that the detention of United States      citizens and residents, and the infliction of human rights      violations upon United States citizens and residents, is not      in the interests of the Government of the People's Republic      of China because it will reduce opportunities for United      States-Chinese cooperation on other matters; and       (D) should immediately send a special, high ranking      representative to the Government of the People's Republic of      China to reiterate the deep concern of the United States      regarding the continued imprisonment of Li Shaomin, Gao Zhan,      Wu Jianmin, Qin Guangguang, Teng Chunyan, and Liu Yaping, and      to discuss their legal status and immediate humanitarian      needs.
