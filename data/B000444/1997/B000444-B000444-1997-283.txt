  Mr. President, I am holding up in my hand here a declaration form for those firms that face reporting requirements for production of discrete organic chemicals, which applies to about 1,800 firms. It is three pages long. I will at a later time read into the Record what it asks for to show you how non-onerous it is.  On one of the pages of instructions, on the bottom of the page, it says,       You do not have to declare unscheduled discrete organic      chemical plant sites that produce explosives exclusively,      produce hydrocarbons exclusively, refine sulfur-containing      crude oil, produce oligomers and polymers, whether or not      containing PSF, and produce unscheduled discrete organic      chemicals via a biological or bio-mediated process.  This eliminates thousands of firms, hundreds of firms at least. And so this is not nearly as onerous as it was made out to be in my humble opinion.  I now yield with the permission of my colleagues 12 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr Specter.
