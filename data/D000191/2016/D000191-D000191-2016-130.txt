Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  The gentleman just made an excellent point. It is absolutely unbelievably stupid and absurd that that ditch should have held up a needed project in an urban area, but that is because of the Bush rule, the rule that today we are saying should be in place indefinitely or perhaps forever.                              {time}  0945  That ditch is specifically exempt under the newly adopted rule, which has been suspended by litigation. If the gentleman wants to deal with the ditch problem, it has been dealt with. Unfortunately, the courts have put a stay on it. But now the gentleman wants to throw out the new rule, which would exempt ditches like that, and go back to the Bush era rule, which is what caused that problem--cause and effect.  I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Ellison).
