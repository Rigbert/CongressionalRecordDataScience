Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  The gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Watt) seemed to imply that because this bill does not contain the so-called Schumer language as compromised, people who protested abortion clinics will end up being able to stiff the owners and operators and the folks who work at that clinic of any judgment that might be obtained.  Now, the current law, Bankruptcy Code section 523(a)(6) makes nondischargeable debts incurred by willful or malicious injury by the debtor to another entity or to the property of another entity. That law is not changed in this bill. So if somebody trashes an abortion clinic for whatever reason and gets a civil judgment against them, that civil judgment is nondischargeable because the actions were willful and malicious.  Mr. Chairman, again, I looked at this roll call when the rule was voted down to bring up the legislation that did what the gentleman wanted to do, and that was the compromise Schumer-Hyde language in last Congress's bankruptcy bill. We did what my colleague asked, and he still voted ``no.''  So I think that the arguments that have been made are really a red herring to try to defeat an overall bankruptcy reform that the House has supported overwhelmingly on many occasions since this issue first came up at least 7 years ago.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Cannon).
