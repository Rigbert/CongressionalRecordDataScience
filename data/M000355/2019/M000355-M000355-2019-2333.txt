S.-Israel relationship--the Senator is saying he might well vote to proceed to something else but not vote to proceed to these important Israel bills and this important Syria bill.  I want to make sure everybody understands where we are. The Senator is refusing to answer the question as to whether or not this blockade against Senate business applies to everything or just to these pro-Israel bills. So I think the refusal to answer provides the answer for our colleagues, and I assume we can anticipate the Democrats will try to get votes on other matters during the government shutdown but just not the Israel issue and the Syria issue.
