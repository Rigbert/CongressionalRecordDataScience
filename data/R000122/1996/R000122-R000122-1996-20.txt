Speaker, I first want to commend the gentleman from Florida [Mr. Bilirakis], for his leadership in organizing this special order, and for his leadership on all of these vital issues of importance, not only to our country but to the country of Greece and to the country of Cyprus.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call attention to the 22nd anniversary of the Turkish invasion and occupation of the Republic of Cyprus. July 20, 1996, marks 22 long years of Turkish military presence in Cyprus. This anniversary serves as a reminder that continued efforts on the part of the United States are essential in trying to establish a lasting, peaceful solution to the Cyprus dispute.  On July 20, 1974, 6,000 Turkish troops launched the invasion of Cyprus, an invasion that would ultimately conclude with the occupation of 40 percent of the island and its 660,000 inhabitants. Moreover, the installation of Turkish troops on Cyprus wrote an end to centuries of peaceful cohabitation between the Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities.  Since then thousands of Cypriots have lost their lives over the years as a result of horrific acts imposed upon them by the Turkish military. Today Turkey maintains more than 35,000 troops in northern Cyprus, further straining the unstable and tumultuous environment of the region.  I commend President Clinton for designating 1996 as the year of Cyprus. Indeed, I wrote to the President earlier this year urging him to seek a permanent, peaceful settlement of the Cyprus dispute. I am encouraged by the recent developments as a result of the administration's efforts in Cyprus last week. The recent visit of U.S. presidential envoy Richard Beattie and Ambassador Albright was a positive one. Discussions aimed at reducing military tensions between the parties are expected to begin in the near future. It is extremely important that the administration continue to work with the parties to reduce tensions and move the peace process forward.  The 22nd anniversary of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus comes at a time when other formerly embattled nations are at last finding common ground upon which to reach a lasting peace. The U.S. has the ability to play a critical role in helping the people of Cyprus and stabilizing relations in the eastern Mediterranean.   Mr. Speaker, the settlement of the Cyprus dispute should be the highest priority for the United States. I urge the support of my colleagues in moving this important initiative forward, and once again commend the gentleman from Florida [Mr. Bilirakis], for his leadership, his endurance, and his great commitment to the cause of peace, both here and in Cyprus.   Mr. Speaker, I include for the Record a letter from President Clinton regarding U.S. efforts towards peace in Cyprus:  The letter referred to is as follows:                                              The White House,                                    Washington, DC, July 17, 1996.     Hon. Jack Reed,     House of Representatives,     Washington, DC.       Dear Jack: Thank you for your letter concerning our Cyprus      initiative. I value your expressions of support for our      efforts to end the division of that island.       We have long appreciated the adverse effect that the Cyprus      problem has on relations between Greece and Turkey. A      negotiated solution would remove a serious source of tensions      between the two countries. We made this point to Presidents      Demirel and Stephanopoulos, Prime Minister Simitis and      Foreign Minister Gonensay during their recent visits to      Washington. We solicited and received their support for our      planned efforts to work toward an eventual negotiated      settlement.       I completed my series of personal consultations with      regional leaders when I hosted President Clerides at the      White House on June 17. I reaffirmed to him my commitment to      assist in the search for a Cyprus solution. After meeting      President Clerides, I announced that I would send my Special      Emissary, Richard Beattie, to the region this month to begin      discussions on the key issues involved in a comprehensive      settlement, with special emphasis on security. I expect      cooperation from all the parties when Mr. Beattie and his      delegation arrive in Turkey, Greece and Cyprus.       As we undertake our efforts to advance a solution, you can      be assured of my commitment to continued U.S. leadership on      what I consider one of our highest priorities in Europe.           Sincerely,                                                        Bill Clinton.
