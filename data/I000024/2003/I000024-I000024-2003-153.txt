President, I think we have responded to everything the Senator from North Dakota has said. I would only say that there are a lot of forces out there against it. But every argument that is against it, that is a legitimate argument, is an economic argument.  I believe everyone in this Chamber has to understand that what was being age 60, 40 years ago, is not the same as being age 60 today. And everything else, every other schedule we have written into law, has changed more than this amount during that 40-year period.
