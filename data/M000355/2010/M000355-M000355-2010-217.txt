 Yesterday, they unveiled their latest proposal, which would add another $50 billion. And they are calling this an accomplishment--an accomplishment they reached not by making any tough choices but by shortening the length of time they would pay for programs they know they will end up extending anyway. Only in Washington would people boast about saving money they fully intend to spend down the road. And only in Washington would people raid a trust fund intended to pay for oilspill cleanup to cover completely unrelated spending in the middle of an oilspill. Let me say that again: Only in Washington would people raid a trust fund intended to pay for oilspill cleanup to cover completely unrelated spending in the middle of an oilspill.  So Democrats can continue to play these games or they can join Republicans in voting for the Thune amendment later today. The Thune amendment would actually do the thing Americans want us to do right now; that is, lower the deficit and create real opportunities for job growth.  Senators will have a simple choice today: They can either vote to reduce the deficit or they can lock arms with the Democratic leadership and dig an even deeper hole of debt, when most Americans think $13 trillion is far too much already. If you are even remotely attuned to what Americans are asking us, this would be an easy choice. Our colleagues across the aisle have come down to the Senate floor over and over to claim the mantle of fiscal responsibility. Well, today they can prove it. Americans want us to show we are serious about lowering the debt. Senators will have that opportunity later today.  So I ask my colleagues on both sides to join with me today and vote in favor of the Thune amendment.  Madam President, I yield the floor.                          ____________________
