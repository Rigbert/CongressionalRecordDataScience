 The Apollo missions should be remembered for generations to come as a triumph for innovation, for hard work, and for the American spirit. As we commemorate the mission to the moon that captured the world 50 years ago, we should look with anticipation to the next ``giant leap for mankind,'' and thus work to ensure that the United States remains at the forefront of innovation and technology.  Madam President, I yield the floor.                          ____________________
