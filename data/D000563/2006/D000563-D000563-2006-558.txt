President, I rise to offer an amendment to the fiscal year 2007 Homeland Security appropriations bill. This measure would direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to revise existing procedures and establish new methods for expeditiously clearing the names of individuals who have been mistakenly placed on a terrorist database list, including the Transportation Security Administration's, TSA, No-Fly and Selectee watch list, or who have names identical to or substantially similar to names on these database lists. The Secretary of Homeland Security would report the revised procedures to Congress no later than 6 months after enactment of this bill.  Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the TSA and other Government agencies have maintained terrorist database lists containing the names of individuals suspected of posing a risk of terrorism or other threat to airline or passenger safety. The TSA watch list contains the names of individuals who have been placed into two categories. One is the group of individuals in the ``No Fly'' category. Any individual whose name appears in this category will not be permitted to board a commercial flight, as the Department of Homeland Security and other Federal agencies have deemed that person is a known terrorist or someone who has solid ties to terrorist activity. The second category is known as ``Selectees,'' and they may be on this list for a variety of reasons, such as attempting to pass a weapon through a security checkpoint or otherwise exhibiting behavior that presents suspicion that the person may engage in future terrorist acts, even though information about the individual is not sufficient to place them in the ``No Fly'' category.  Unfortunately, thousands of innocent passengers have been placed on the TSA watch list mistakenly or, as is often the case, because they have the same name as others on the list. This prevents those passengers from using the internet or electronic kiosks located at the airport to check in when they fly. This causes these passengers to wait in long lines to be cleared by airline personnel at the check-in counter, sometimes even resulting in missed flights.  The TSA procedure for differentiating the innocent travelers from those who pose a threat is long and still results in the cleared passengers having to check in at the counter and present a clearance letter from the TSA. In other words, after going through the clearance and verification process, innocent passengers still cannot use the internet and kiosks that airlines rely on for passengers to obtain their boarding passes.  I truly hope that as a result of this amendment, the TSA will establish a better system to not only clear innocent passengers from any terrorist database lists, but also to work with the airlines to devise a safe and secure check-in procedure that differentiates between the criminals and the innocent.  I thank Senator Carper for joining as an original cosponsor of my amendment, and I urge all of my colleagues to support it.            Amendments Nos. 4669, 4670, 4671, 4672, and 4673
