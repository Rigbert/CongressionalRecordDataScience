 President, our Nation's farmers and independent livestock producers are becoming increasingly subjected to vertical integration in their industry. I recall years past when family farmers had complete control over their livestock, from farrowing until marketing. Today, however, more than 80 percent of the hogs are either marketed under contract or are owned by the packer.  In my home State of Iowa, vertical integration has led to a situation inwhich many farmers can't even get a bid on their livestock from packers. Instead, they are simply forced to accept a slot when they can deliver their livestock to packers at the packer's price. That kind of makes them a residual supplier of livestock, kind of puts them in the position of being last in line. It also puts them in a position economically, I believe, of getting a lower price.  When I was farming and raising pigs, it was as simple as calling up maybe an hour before you wanted to deliver your pigs, calling up the packing company in Waterloo, IA, and asking: What are you paying today for hogs? You might dicker a little bit, but you eventually reached agreement. When you wanted to sell a lot, you said: Well, I want to sell some. So you loaded up, backed up the pickup to the hog house, loaded a few pigs, and drove 15, 20 miles to deliver them. It was that simple. Today it is even worse for cattle in the sense that you might be able to have a half hour within a whole week of time to be able to sell something.  We have a terrible situation where the family farmer is kind of stuck in the sense of being a residual supplier. You can say that farmer has the option of contracting those sorts of things of which he can take advantage. There are some people who ought to have the same opportunity to get the same price other people get. We are in a position now where things are somewhat different.
