Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments. He mentioned a number of facts.  Economically, I think all of us can be happy that unemployment is down. The gentleman then mentioned that there are less unemployment requests being made.  Is the gentleman aware that, in 2016, we created 400,000 more jobs than we created in 2017? Is the gentleman aware of that fact? That is a fact.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me.  Mr. Speaker, does the gentleman realize that there are 2 million more people in the workforce in less than a year?  Mr. Speaker, does the gentleman understand that more than 5 million people got a bonus that, Mr. Speaker, some people on the other side thought was crumbs?  Mr. Speaker, does the gentleman understand that the 3.9 percent unemployment rate, many Americans have not seen that in almost two decades?  Mr. Speaker, does the gentleman understand that we just watched last night our President at Andrews Air Force Base bring back three Americans that were held in prison in North Korea, and for the first time since that conflict has gone on there is an opportunity to end that war?  So, yes, I think some of our best days are right now; but with the potential of what we have not only with our tax bill, but, if we get our farm bill moving where we help individuals to get into that workforce, because that unemployment is so low, I do believe the best days are in front of us.
