 President, as another school year starts, many college students are worrying not only about their class loads and their coursework, but about where the money to pay for their educations will come from. Today, the average cost of attending a public 4-year college has jumped to $9,000, up 7.7 percent from last year. This represents the highest rate of increase since 1993. For those families that choose to send their children to a private institution, that number rises. Up 4.7 percent from the year before, the average cost of a private 4-year institution is now close to $24,000 a year.  What do these rising tuition costs mean? Hard working American families are spending a larger percentage of their incomes than ever before to send their children to college. To attend the University of Delaware, where I went to school, it costs nearly 20 percent of a Delaware family's average annual income to cover costs. To attend a private college or university, that number, in some instances can jump to over 40 percent of annual income.  To help remedy this situation I come to the floor today to reintroduce legislation to help American families afford their children's tuition. This comprehensive package, ``The Tuition Assistance for Families Act,'' builds upon previous steps that others and I have taken to make it possible for more families to provide their children with a college education. I introduce this bill so that the decision to send one's child to college will not be overshadowed by the decision of how to pay for it.  The ``Tuition Assistance for Families Act'' will provide middle class American families with a $12,000 tuition tax deduction each year. Based on legislation that I introduced with Senator Schumer last year, at $12,000 this deduction provides real, meaningful tax relief. Tax relief that American families have been waiting for. Tax relief that can go a long way in helping them afford room, board and tuition.  The bill that I am introducing today also expands the two tuition tax credits enacted in 1997--the Hope Scholarship and the Lifetime Learning Tax Credit. Under current law, the Lifetime Learning Credit allows a 20 percent tax credit on the first $10,000 in higher education expenses in year 2003. Under my bill, the Lifetime Learning Tax Credit percentage would jump from 20 to 25 percent and raise the amount of education expenses subject to the credit to $12,000. In terms of real dollars, this would mean that a student who files in tax year 2003 under my plan could get up to $3,000 back in taxes. Under current law, the maximum allowable credit is only $2,000. That is a $1,000 difference. $1,000 that can go directly into a student's pocket to pay for books, a computer or tuition. The also raises the income limits for each credit to $130,000 per family, per year, so that more families are afforded the help that they need.  This bill reintroduces the idea of a $1,000 merit scholarship to be awarded to the top 5 percent of each high school's graduating class. These types of scholarships not only reward student achievement, they help to ensure that the best and brightest students have the ability to go on to college--thereby increasing the pool of well-qualified American workers for the information technology age.  This act also increases the maximum Pell Grant award from $4,000 to $4,500. During the 2001-2002 school year, the maximum Pell Grant award covered about 42 percent of the average tuition, room and board at a public 4-year university. During the 1975-76 it covered 84 percent of these same costs. Clearly, the purchasing power of these grants has dramatically declined. As such, the debt load of American families and American students has increased considerably over the years as students have looked to federal and private loans to finance their educations. A report released just this March by the State PIRG's Higher Education Project found that at the end of the 1999-2000 school year, 64 percent of college students graduated with student loan debt at an average of $16,928, nearly double the average debt load just eight years ago. Double the debt load in 1994.  It is the dream of every American to provide for their child a better life than they had themselves. Helping families afford the increasing cost of a college education will move us closer to making that dream a reality. For this reason, I have spent a great deal of time in the Senate fighting to provide tax relief for middle class American families struggling with the cost of college. And while I was pleased when some of the ideas I advocated were adopted in the 1997 tax cut bill, it is clear that as tuition costs rise dramatically, working Americans need additional assistance. The ``Tuition Assistance for Families Act'' will provide extra help so that more families can afford to give their children a brighter and better future. Let's not allow a college education to become a luxury when, in the information technology age, it is an absolute necessity.                          ____________________
