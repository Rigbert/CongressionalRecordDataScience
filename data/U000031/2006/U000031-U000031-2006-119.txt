Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Mr. Herbert ``Herb'' Teichman of Eau Claire, Michigan, who will be honored this morning by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association, NOAA, and the National Weather Service for his decades of service as a volunteer weather observer. Mr. Teichman is one of 25 individuals across the nation who will receive the John Campanius Holm Award. The award's namesake, John Campanius Holm, was the first known person known to have taken systematic weather observations in 1644 and 1645. Through an act of Congress in the 1890s, the first comprehensive networks of cooperative stations were created consequently establishing the U.S. Weather Bureau.  Weather observation has been a long tradition in the Teichman family. Herb's father, William, established the Eau Claire site in 1923 in order to benefit the family's fruit business. On August 1, 1968, Herb assumed his father's daily duties and continues to serve the NOAA and NWS to this day. Herb's distinguished 38 years of service not only demonstrate his unparalleled commitment, but the fact that he continues to volunteer demonstrates his great character. He has braved severe weather through the decades, from 30 inch snow days to oppressive heat and humidity. His records have been praised for their detail and organization and have been essential for scientists studying floods, droughts, and heat and cold waves. His observations have also played a vital role in supporting economic and national security by the prediction and exploration of weather and climate-related events.  Mr. Teichman is a caring and dedicated servant of Michigan. I would like to extend my thanks to him for all of his good work and wish him congratulations upon receiving this prestigious award. Today, Mr. Teichman joins the illustrious ranks of past Holm awardees, including his father, for his commitment and dedication to weather observation.                          ____________________
