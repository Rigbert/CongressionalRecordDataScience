 President, I rise this evening to share the very sad news that Sam Volpentest--a name many of us in Congress know well--passed away last night at the age of 101.  Here in our Nation's Capital, Sam was a near constant fixture--always searching for new ways to help his beloved community of the Tri-Cities to move forward.  To fully appreciate Sam's contributions, you have to understand something about the geography and history of my State. The Tri-Cities--which are Richland, Pasco, and Kennewick--are located on the Columbia River in the southeastern region of Washington State.  From the Hanford nuclear facility, to the pristine beauty of the last free-flowing stretch of the Columbia River, to the many varied agricultural and business challenges, the Tri-Cities are diverse and very unique.  Located across the Cascade Mountains from Seattle and other population centers, it could be pretty easy for these three communities to have their needs overlooked.  Well, Sam made sure that never happened.  Whenever something important was happening in the Tri-Cities, I could always count on Sam to show up in my Senate office to share it with me, even if I didn't know he was coming.  I vividly remember many years ago when the chair of the Energy Committee cut funding for the construction of HAMMER. HAMMER is a world-class training facility located in Richland, WA.  Well, I like to think I am always on top of the issues affecting my home State, but Sam kept me on my toes. I showed up at my office one morning at about 7:30 a.m. Guess who was already there, standing there, waiting for me outside my door. Sam Volpentest.  Although Sam may have only had about an inch or two on me, that man's passion could move mountains. And on that day, his passion was for building HAMMER.  Well, I didn't want to mess with Sam, so I marched right into that Energy Committee chairman's office, and I fought side by side with Sam to restore those cuts. And we won.  I was proud to stand with Sam at the HAMMER groundbreaking ceremony in July of 1995. Sam was 91 years young at that time. I still have that shovel on display in my office as a reminder ofwhat we can all do if we have passion and heart, and if we work together.  Just look at HAMMER today. It is a first-rate facility that keeps Hanford workers safe.  HAMMER has created jobs. It has created economic opportunities and development, and it has the potential now to be a Homeland Security training center for first responders across the country.  Our entire country owes Sam a debt of gratitude for all he has done for so many people.  During my years in the Senate, I have worked with a lot of people. But no one--no one--has come close to matching Sam's energy, his commitment, and his success.  Sam has been a role model to me and to all of us who want to spend our lives giving something back to the communities we care about most. I thank him for helping me be a better representative for all the people of my home State.  Sam was a one-person Chamber of Commerce. He was a visitor's center and he was a cheerleading squad all wrapped into one. Sam Volpentest was the heart and soul of the Tri-Cities. He was one of a kind. Sam will be dearly missed, but he will not be forgotten.                          ____________________
