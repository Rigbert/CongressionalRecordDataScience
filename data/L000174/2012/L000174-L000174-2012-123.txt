President, today I am proud to call to the Senate's attention the record of accomplishment of a military officer who has retired after 33 years of outstanding service to the Vermont Air and Army National Guard.  LTC Lloyd Goodrow served five Adjutant Generals. He distinguished himself in the position of State Public Affairs Officer. Through diligence, honesty, and integrity he forged a strong and straightforward relationship with the media and the Vermont Congressional Delegation.  In the years after the attacks of September 11, 2001, Lieutenant Colonel Goodrow provided strong, meaningful support to deployed troops and their families. He helped Vermonters to make a human connection to the Guard during this difficult time. His empathy and deep understanding of the tragedy and suffering of Gold Star families not only aided those families in the healing process but left a lasting impression on Lloyd.  Lloyd is an outstanding family man. Marcelle and I are fortunate to count as friends Lloyd, his wife Margo, and their son Daniel. Daniel has been recognized at the State and national level for his swimming in the Special Olympics. Like his parents, he has been a strong advocate for people with special needs.  In recognition of Lieutenant Colonel Goodrow's service to our country and to our State of Vermont, I ask that an article, ``Spokesman for Vt. National Guard retires,'' written by Matt Ryan in the November 1, 2012, edition of the Burlington Free Press, be entered into the Congressional Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [The Burlington Free Press, Nov. 1, 2012]                   Goodrow Reflects on 33-Year Career                             (By Matt Ryan)       Lt. Col. Lloyd Goodrow said during his tenure as spokesman      for the Vermont National Guard, he has considered reporters      and soldiers alike his colleagues.       ``It's easier if you have a relationship with the media,      and you understand where each other came from,'' Goodrow      said. ``Have we always agreed? No. Have we agreed to      disagree? Yes.''       Goodrow, 58, of Essex Junction retired at midnight      Wednesday, ending a 33-year career with the Vermont National      Guard. He said his next order of business is to find a new      job.       ``Today's bittersweet,'' he said earlier on Halloween. ``I      walk out of here tonight at midnight. The joke is I'm turning      into a pumpkin.''       The University of Vermont graduate worked much of his      career with the Guard in public affairs. He typed his first      news release in 1987, about a man who built a cheap device      that could detect infrared light for the U.S. military. The      story circulated nationally for two years, he said.       Goodrow has since spoken on behalf of soldiers who deployed      to Iraq and Afghanistan and returned home to rebuild Vermont      in the wake of Tropical Storm Irene.       ``The hardest thing was dealing with the deaths of      soldiers,'' he said. ``The first time I looked into the eyes      of a gold star mother, it changed my life forever.''       That was the mother of Vermont Army Guard Spec. Scott      McLaughlin, a 29-year-old husband and father of two from      Hardwick who was shot and killed by a sniper in Iraq in 2005.       Goodrow said he helped the family gather photos of      McLaughlin for the media and later convinced them to allow      reporters in the church for the funeral services.       ``The media is there to represent the community, and to      help the community as well,'' he said. ``I reminded them that      you help the community mourn.''       Goodrow said he leaves media relations in the good hands of      Capt. Chris Gookin. Gookin stood to lead the Guard's public      affairs office upon Goodrow's retirement.       ``It's important that the public knows who we are, what we      represent and what we can do for them,'' Goodrow said.      ``Because we belong to the people. We belong to the public.''       Goodrow's retirement party is scheduled for noon Thursday      at the American Legion in Colchester. His formal retirement      ceremony is slated for 2 p.m. Sunday at the Green Mountain      Armory at Camp Johnson.       ``I really have been blessed,'' he said. ``I've been part      of a group that's been second to none.''                          ____________________
