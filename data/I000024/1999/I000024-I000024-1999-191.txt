We expect that the Secretary of the Army will provide the requisite certifications at the appropriate time, which is just prior to the actual conduct of the live-fire tests. I know that in the case of Starstreak, the missile contractor must make certain modifications at its own expense in order to make the missile compatible for use at air speeds consistent with the normal operating limits of the Apache helicopter and consistent with the survivability of the aircraft. The missile contractor has briefed these fixes to the Army and informed the Army in writing that the fixes will be made at no expense to the United States. By the time the Army is ready to conduct actual live firings the Secretary will be able to make all the certifications required by law.
