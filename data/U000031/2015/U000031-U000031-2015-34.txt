Both are good. We adopted the Grayson amendment a little while ago. It was a good amendment.  This amendment directs the Secretary of Energy to study weaknesses in the security architecture of certain smart meters currently available and promulgate regulations to mitigate those weaknesses.  We want every home to be safe, absolutely. We need to take all those steps, whether it be people's individual billing, whatever it might be. It is a good amendment. As I told Mr. Grayson, it is brilliant, smart.  I appreciate the gentleman's amendment, and I urge my colleagues to support it.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
