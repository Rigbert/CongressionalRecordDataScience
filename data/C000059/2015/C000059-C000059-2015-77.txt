Chairman, climate change is winning the amendment contest tonight. We have had a number of amendments on that subject.  Earlier we debated whether or not to continue a bipartisan reporting requirement in the bill on climate change expenditures.  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle wanted to remove that requirement, which would have reduced transparency. Now my friend wants to ensure that funds are being expended on climate and efficiency executive orders issued by the President.  So I am left to wonder whether my colleagues would prefer to know if the funds are spent on these programs or not.  Regardless, this amendment is certainly unnecessary. The President did not consult Congress on these executive orders. If anything, we should defund these programs until Congress can have an appropriate policy debate. I see no reason to include this language, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''  I reserve the balance of my time.
