MENENDEZ. Absolutely nothing. The only way to ensure the U.S. taxpayer pays absolutely nothing, not just for the cleanup but in terms of consequences to communities that would exceed the liability cap that exists right now under the law and for which BP has made statements but no commitment, such as a consent agreement, which would be binding upon BP--the taxpayers should pay absolutely nothing--the way to do that is to raise it to an unlimited cap.  I yield the floor.  Mr. McCAIN. I have a parliamentary inquiry.
