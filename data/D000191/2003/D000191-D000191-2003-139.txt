  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, how can you spend $400 billion and not provide a decent Medicare prescription drug benefit? Well, it is an excellent question, but the Republicans have come up with a formula.  First, you underwrite the profits of the private insurance industry. Yes, there will be subsidies to the private insurance industry in this bill, trying to drive people out of Medicare; and you do that because they lost a bunch of money on crummy investments, and we have to help out their bottom line. Well, we can understand that; they are big campaign contributors.  Secondly, how else? Well, overall, number one, do nothing about the extortion it costs to prescription drugs in the United States. Do not allow the imports or the reimportation of American-manufactured drugs. Do not allow the people on Medicare to be organized into a group to drive down the price of these prescription drugs. No. Because actually, the pharmaceutical industry are bigger campaign contributors to the Republicans than the insurance industry. So we are going to spend $400 billion to provide a benefit nobody understands that is going to be pretty parsimonious.  We could do better. We could take on the pharmaceutical industry, and we can forget about giving a subsidy to the private insurance industry; and for $400 billion, we could provide a meaningful prescription drug benefit that seniors would enjoy and it would help with their health. But that is not where the majority is going in this House of Representatives.                          ____________________
