Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 18) expressing the grave concern of Congress regarding the continuing gross violations of human rights and civil liberties of the Syrian and Lebanese people by the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                            H. Con. Res. 18       Whereas the Syrian Arab Republic is governed by an      authoritarian regime which continues to commit serious human      rights abuses, including the use of torture and arbitrary      arrest and detention;       Whereas the Department of State's Country Reports on Human      Rights Practices for 2004 states that Syria's ``human rights      record remained poor, and the Government continued to commit      numerous, serious abuses'', the government ``significantly      restricts freedom of speech and of the press'', ``freedom of      assembly does not exist under the law'', and ``the Government      restricted freedom of association'';       Whereas Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human      Rights states that ``Everyone has the right to freedom of      opinion and expression. This right includes freedom to hold      opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart      information and ideas through any media and regardless of      frontiers.'';       Whereas Article 20 of the Universal Declaration of Human      Rights states that ``Everyone has the right to freedom of      peaceful assembly and association.'';       Whereas Syria's September 2001 press law permits the      government to arbitrarily deny or revoke publishing licenses      for vague reasons and compels media to submit all material to      government censors;       Whereas Syrian authorities have arrested, or, in the case      of foreigners, expelled journalists for writing critically      about Syria's policies;       Whereas Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have      reported that the security forces of Syria are targeting      emerging Syrian human rights organizations, as well as their      attorneys, in an apparent attempt to intimidate those      organizations;       Whereas, on March 8, 2004, Syrian security forces arrested      more than 30 human rights dissidents and civilians at a sit-     in in front of the parliament;       Whereas a United States diplomat who was watching the      peaceful demonstrations was also arrested and held for an      hour in what the United States called an unacceptable      violation of diplomatic practice and which the United States      protested ``in the strongest terms'';       Whereas Article 7 of the Universal Declaration of Human      Rights states that ``All are equal before the law and are      entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of      the law.'';       Whereas the criminal law of Syria provides for reduced      sentences in cases of ``honor'' killings, and spousal rape is      not illegal;       Whereas the infringement by Syria on human rights and civil      liberties extends into the Lebanese Republic, which it      continues to occupy in violation of United Nations Security      Council resolutions;       Whereas hundreds of Lebanese civilians are believed to have      been killed or ``disappeared'' by Syrian occupation forces or      its secret police;       Whereas hundreds of Kurdish civilians were injured or      killed in clashes with the Syrian authorities in March 2004      in Qamishli, a city in northeastern Syria, and Syrian      security forces arrested and tortured Syrian Kurdish      civilians from the town of Al-Malikiyah on January 9, 2005;       Whereas Syrian authorities continue their harassment of      Aktham Naisse, Syria's leading human rights activist,      President, and founding member of the Committees for the      Defense of Democratic Liberties and Human Rights in Syria,      and the 2005 winner of the Martin Ennals Award for Human      Rights Defenders, one of the most prestigious awards in the      global human rights community, by charging him with spreading      false information, forming an underground association with      links to international human rights groups, and opposing the      Baath Party;       Whereas, in November 2004, upon his release from prison,      Kamal Labwani, a 48-year-old physician in Syria, stated that      there are at least 400 political prisoners in Syria, 100 of      whom have been jailed for at least 20 years;       Whereas Mr. Labwani urged ``all defenders of freedom and      human rights, whether individuals, associations, or bodies,      or international, Arab, or local organizations to participate      with us in this campaign to call for the immediate release of      all political prisoners and detainees of opinion and      conscience'';       Whereas, in November 2004, Syrian journalist Louai Hussein      was banned from writing by the Syrian Interior Ministry's      political security office;       Whereas, in November 2004, the arrest in Germany of a      Syrian embassy official for espionage and issuing threats      against the Syrian opposition in Europe is evidence of a      campaign reportedly launched by Syrian dictator Bashar Assad,      aimed at intimidating the regime's opposition abroad;       Whereas thousands of Syrian citizens, along with their      families, children, and grandchildren, live outside their      country in forced exile, solely because of their political      views, or because of the views of members of their families;      and       Whereas human rights and democracy groups in Syria have      sponsored a petition urging greater freedoms and the release      of all political prisoners: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate      concurring), That Congress--       (1) condemns the consistent pattern of gross violations of      internationally recognized human rights by the Government of      the Syrian Arab Republic;       (2) calls on the international community to adopt a      resolution at the upcoming session of the United Nations      Commission on Human Rights which details the dismal human      rights record of Syria;       (3) expresses its support for the people of Syria in their      daily struggle for freedom, respect for human rights and      civil liberties, democratic self-governance, and the      establishment of the rule of law;       (4) encourages the President and the Secretary of State to      reach out to dissidents, human rights activists, and the      nonviolent democratic opposition in Syria, and to assist them      in their efforts; and       (5) urges the adoption and pursuit of these and other      policies to seek a democratic government in Syria that will--       (A) bring freedom and democracy to the people of Syria;       (B) cease the illegal occupation by Syria of the Lebanese      Republic;       (C) abandon support for terrorism;       (D) not pursue research, development, acquisition,      production, transfer, or deployment of biological, chemical,      or nuclear weapons, will provide credible assurances that      such behavior will not be undertaken in the future, and will      agree to allow United Nations and other international      observers to verify such assurances; and       (E) live in peace and security with the international      community.
