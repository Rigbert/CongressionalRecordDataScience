 We have worked on this now through two Congresses. It was very clear to me that he has a great deal of knowledge in this area. His advice, his support, his efforts have been very helpful. I think he has very clearly stated the facts of this legislation.  There are those who, for purposes I do not understand, want to make this legislation out to be much more than it is, some heavy requirement of Government. Really, all we are saying is, if you are going to trade online, energy and metals and broadband, those trades are subject to recordkeeping, to an audit trail, and to antifraud and antimanipulation oversight.  That is the same as any other finite commodity. Anywhere else does this same thing. But this loophole, at the request, as the Senator from Illinois said, of Enron--by the House, and then in a conference in 2000 they dropped the requirement for coverage from the Commodity Futures Modernization Act. Therefore, this loophole was created into which these companies jumped and began to set up these online trading exchanges.  I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw that one company announced that 80 percent of the trades they did in 2001 were round trip or wash trades.  Senator Fitzgerald just explained that very clearly, what a round trip or a wash trade is.
