President, today I, along with Senator Udall of Colorado, am introducing legislation that would amend the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 to expand on a research, development, and demonstration program, authorized in that bill, to include efforts to make biofuels more compatible with small non-road engines.  The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, directed the Secretary of the Department of Energy, DOE, in coordination with the Secretary of the Department of Transportation, DOT, and in consultation with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, to carry out a program of research and development regarding the impact that biofuels, like ethanol, may have on existing fuel storage and delivery infrastructure used for petroleum-based fuels. It is critical that these biofuels also are safe to use in operating small non-road engines. My bill requires these agencies to expand their research program to include small engines such as those in snowmobiles, boats, lawnmowers, and chainsaws.  Previous testing done through DOE shows that increased ethanol content in smaller engines creates a leaner burning mixture, which may increase idle speed on some small engines, creating unanticipated clutch engagement on equipment such as chainsaws and handheld trimmers. Also, ethanol is more corrosive and less efficient than traditional gasoline blends. During these difficult economic times, equipment damage due to ethanol-gasoline fuel blends only adds to the many challenges facing Maine's farmers, fishermen, independent woodsmen, and recreational industry.  As we pursue strategies to lessen our dependence on foreign oil, we must also take action to ensure that ethanol fuel blends are safe and efficient for small engines. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 737       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. BIOFUELS DISTRIBUTION AND ADVANCED BIOFUELS                    INFRASTRUCTURE.       Section 248 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of      2007 (42 U.S.C. 17054) is amended--       (1) in subsection (a), by striking ``and new alternative      distribution infrastructure'' and inserting ``, new      alternative distribution infrastructure, and effects on small      engines''; and       (2) in subsection (b)--       (A) in paragraph (8), by striking ``and'' after the      semicolon at the end;       (B) by redesignating paragraph (9) as paragraph (10); and       (C) by inserting after paragraph (8) the following:       ``(9) problems associated with the use of biofuels in small      nonroad engines; and''.                                 ______                                       By
