President, if the Senator will yield, I will soon propose--let me just outline what I propose--we agree to have a 2-hour time agreement evenly divided between the Senator from Nebraska and myself on a second-degree amendment, with a 20-minute time agreement evenly divided between the Senator from Nebraska and myself on the underlying Leahy, et al amendment, with the understanding, of course, that either or both sides could yield back time.  So with that understanding, I ask unanimous consent that there be a 2-hour time agreement on the Exon amendment evenly divided, at the expiration of which or the yielding back of time there be a vote on or in relation to the Exon amendment, and then, if the Exon amendment is not adopted, we go to the underlying Leahy amendment with a 20-minute time agreement evenly divided, with a vote following on or in relation to it.
