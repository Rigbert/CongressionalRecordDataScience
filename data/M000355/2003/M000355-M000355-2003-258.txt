 I further ask unanimous consent that there be 40 minutes equally divided in relation to the amendment and that at the expiration of time I or my designee be recognized in order to make a point of order against the amendment; further, that Senator Dorgan then be recognized in order to move to suspend rule XVI with respect to his amendment. I finally ask unanimous consent that the Senate then proceed immediately to a vote on the motion to suspend. I also ask consent that following that vote the Senate then proceed to consideration of H.R. 1904, the Healthy Forests legislation.
