 President, on October 13, the U.S. Navy celebrated its 244th birthday. The U.S. Navy was founded by the Continental Congress in 1775 to disrupt British shipping and naval power in the Revolutionary War. At the time, the Navy was just a simple, ragtag band of converted merchant ships. The U.S. Navy today is the most powerful naval force anywhere in the world. It provides the military with the ability to project power to every corner of the globe. America's Navy works tirelessly to protect the freedom of navigation, of commerce, and travel around the world.                          ____________________
