Mr. Chairman, I rise against this ill-conceived, ill-considered, and ill-timed tax proposal.  I have heard Speaker Gingrich refer to this tax proposal as the crown jewel of the Republican contract. I could not agree more. Like the crown jewels, this bill is for royalty, it is for the truly wealthy among us. If you are middle class, if you are poor, you can look but you better not touch.  Just look at who gets the jewels.
