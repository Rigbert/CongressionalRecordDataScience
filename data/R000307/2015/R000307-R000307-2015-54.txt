President, might I say to the distinguished Senator from Louisiana, he indicated this was his maiden speech on the floor of the Senate. If that is so, I urge him to make additional speeches. I don't think I ever heard a more concise summary with regard to the pipeline issue than he just gave. We can certainly see why the people of Louisiana sent him here. It was perfect, it was cogent, and it was short. It was interesting. He had a bill very similar to this and Senator Cassidy passed it in the House and he is now in the Senate. We hope that with enough debate we can have trulya bipartisan effort with comity. This is a new beginning. We are so happy to have the Senator here. I thank him for his remarks.
