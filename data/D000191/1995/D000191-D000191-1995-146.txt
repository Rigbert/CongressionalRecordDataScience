We get 100 percent out. We do secondary and we do tertiary treatment. Theoretically, if one wanted to, one could drink the outfall. I do not want to drink the outfall. I do not know that we have to drive everything to that standard. But to think of the ocean as an endless dump close in proximity, I realize you have a big problem with Mexico, basically you are saying Mexico can dump all their stuff in there, why cannot we not just dump in a small amount of our stuff. I do not think that is the solution. I think we should be forcing Mexico to clean up so the people in California can go to the beach every day in the future.
