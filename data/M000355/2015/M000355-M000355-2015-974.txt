 BOXER. They agree with those of us who have said that is a death by a thousand cuts. We just can't keep on doing these short-term extensions.  I would say this to the Republican leader. If you or I went to the bank to get a mortgage and the banker smiled and said that you get that mortgage, but it is only for 6 months or 5 months, you wouldn't buy the house.  No one is going to build a new project or fix a bridge that has multiyear costs if they know the money could run out in 5 months or in the short term.  Mr. McCONNELL. Would it also be correct, I ask the Senator from California, if we are fortunate enough to send a multiyear paid-for highway bill over to the House, that the same constituent groups that have had an interest in this and have indicated their enthusiasm to you would likely descend on the House and suggest that this might be something they ought to take a look at?
