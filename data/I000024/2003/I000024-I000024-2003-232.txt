President, I have to argue with my good friend from New Jersey. If he wants to use the Superfund Program as an example of a program that has been working, then we don't have any problems around here because it hasn't been working. We have been working on making major changes. We are going to make major changes.  I yield back the time and move to table the Lautenberg amendment. I ask for the yeas and nays.
