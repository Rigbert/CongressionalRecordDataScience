Chairman, I strongly support Mr. DeFazio's amendment to provide an additional 26 weeks of unemployment compensation to workers in the air transportation industry.  This industry and its workers have borne the brunt of the continuing war on terrorism and have been wracked by our sluggish economy.  In fact, the industry is expected to lose $6.7 billion this year.  In addition, approximately 200,000 airline workers have lost their jobs since September 11, 2001, and another 70,000 workers are expected to be laid off.  This week, the world's largest carrier, AMR corporation's American Airlines, averted Chapter 11 bankruptcy by negotiating $1.8 billion in labor concessions.  And U.S. Airways only recently emerged from bankruptcy after winning approval for a $900 billion Federal loan guarantee.  Last week, I had the opportunity to meet with representatives of the industry and just hours ago I met in my office with airline workers' representatives.  The industry and workers know that their fate is inextricably linked; that one cannot survive without the other.  Members on both sides of the aisle understand this and want to help.  The fact is, this amendment would incorporate into this supplemental appropriations bill bipartisan legislation that was introduced yesterday by Mr. English and Mr. Oberstar--H.R. 1553, the ``Air Transportation Employees Assistance Act''.  The Senate Appropriations Committee has already passed a similar plan to extend unemployment insurance benefits in its version of this legislation.  The members of this body should do the same thing to aid this struggling industry, and its workers and their families.  Let's help this vital industry and its workers navigate unprecedented turbulence.  That's precisely what this amendment extending unemployment insurance benefits would do.  I urge my colleagues to support it.                             Point of Order
