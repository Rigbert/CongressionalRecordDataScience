 I have not mentioned something, but I do want to mention, so the House knows and, frankly, the public knows as well. As you know, we have been working very hard on the Children's Health Insurance Program, trying to get as many children as possible covered by children's health. I want to thank the whip. I had the opportunity of meeting with Mr. Boehner. Their staffs have been engaged. Our staffs have been engaged. Senate Democratic and Republican staff and Members have been engaged. We're still working on that.                              {time}  1515  As you know, Senator Reid attempted to get a delay in the consideration of the bill on the Senate floor. That was objected to by Mr. McConnell, or actually Mr. Lott on behalf of Mr. McConnell, and they took it up today. Mr. Reid asked for another extension. That was objected to by Mr. McConnell this time. So they considered it today.  But I want the whip to know that we are intending to continue to pursue discussions. Obviously the Senate has to send the bill back here. But we want to continue to pursue these discussions to see whether or not we can come to agreement so that we can send a bill to the President that, hopefully, he would sign but, if he doesn't sign, that two-thirds of us on this side of the Capitol and two-thirds on the other side of the Capitol would be prepared to see it move forward.
