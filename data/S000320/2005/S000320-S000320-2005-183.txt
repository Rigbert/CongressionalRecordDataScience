 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a long time friend and lifelong Alabamian who recently passed away. Mr. L. D. ``Dick'' Owen, Jr. died at the age of 86 following a life dedicated to service, family, his community and his State.  Dick has led a remarkable life. As a war hero, he received six Bronze Stars and an Arrowhead. He served as a U.S. Paratrooper during World War II in North Africa and Europe, and in the Far East during the Korean Conflict. As a public official, he was devoted to the environment, agriculture and education. And as a member of the Bay Minette community, Dick was a dedicated public servant to his hometown and served in numerous volunteer positions throughout his life.  Born in Baldwin County on April 10, 1919, he attended Baldwin County Schools and graduated from the University of Alabama in 1941. Upon college graduation, he was commissioned as a 2nd Lieutenant in the U.S. Army Reserve and entered Active Duty on June 27, 1941.  In August 1942, Dick attended Airborne School, and after completion of training at Fort Benning, GA, he was assigned to the 504th Paratroop Infantry Regiment, 82nd Airborne Division at Ft. Bragg, NC.  He served overseas from May, 1943, until November, 1945, and it was during his service in Europe that he received six Bronze Stars and an Arrowhead for his participation in the invasions into Sicily, Naples, Rome (Anzio), Rhineland, the Aredenes (Battle of the Bulge) and Central Europe. He was awarded the highest Dutch military decoration, the Militaire Willems Order, and also the Belgium Citation Fourogere, while his unit, the 504th, received the Distinguished Unit Citation.  Upon his separation from Active Duty, Dick served in the Army Reserves and was recalled to Active Duty in November, 1950, serving at Ft. Jackson, SC, and deploying to Japan and Korea with the 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team. He retired as a Lt. Colonel from the U.S. Army Reserve in 1963.  Upon retirement from the Army, he settled back in Bay Minette serving on the School Board, as President of the Bay Minette Chamber of Commerce, and as an active participant in the United Fund, the American Red Cross and the American Cancer Society. In 1950, he was elected State Commander of the V.F.W.  He was appointed to the Alabama Battleship Commission in 1963, a position he held for the remainder of his life. He was also a member of the Bay Minette City Council, was Probate Judge in Baldwin County, and was one of two Alabama members on the Gulf Marine Fisheries Commission.  It was not until my time in the Alabama Legislature that I was really able to get to know Dick Owen. He was extremely committed to his positions in both the State House and State Senate, and his constituents were well served by his dedication to them and his devotion to the issues. He was elected to the House in 1965 and served two terms before being elected to the Senate in 1970 where he also served two terms.  In the Senate, he was Chairman of the Finance and Taxation Committee and Chairman of the Conservation Committee. He also served as a member of the Commerce, Transportation and Common Carriers Committee; the Insurance Committee; the Constitution and Elections Committee; the Agriculture Committee; and the Local Legislation No. 1 Committee. He also held positions on the Interim Insurance Study Committee and was Chairman of the Fishing Reef Committee.  During his career, Dick focused his energy on a number of issues. Whether it was agriculture, education, conservation or prison reform, he recognized the importance of these issues to his constituency and the entire State of Alabama.  As a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, he supported development, growth and protection of Alabama's agriculture and forestry industry. He led the fight to keep farm truck prices low, and he favored expansion of the Farmer's Market Authority. In addition, he sponsored a number of bills relating to conservation, forestry, agriculture and law enforcement. Among these were the $43 million State Parks Program and the Anti-water Pollution Act.  As a Representative and Senator, Dick Owen was a strong advocate for educational opportunities for all people, and he recognized the need to make improvements to the education system in Alabama. Before his election to the Alabama legislature, he was proud to help bring Faulkner State Community College to Bay Minette.  He sponsored many bills in both houses to conserve our natural resources and ensure continued growth of renewable resources. He received the ``Governor's Conservation Legislator off the Year'' award in 1971 from the Alabama Wildlife Federation.  Dick was also active in prison reform work and was recognized by law enforcement and prison officials for legislation he authored regarding this issue.  Year after year, he was a champion for his constituents.  Well after Dick left politics and public life, he continued to serve his community and State well. He owned Builders Hardware and Supply and was active in the Bay Minette Rotary Club. He was a devoted alumnus of the University of Alabama, contributing his time and energy to the growth of the Alumni Association. He was also a Mason, Shriner and active in the Baptist Church.  A devoted family man, he is survived by his beloved wife, the former Annie Ruth Heidelberg of Mobile; his son L.D. Owen III of Bay Minette; his brother James R. Owen of Bay Minette; and his sister, Nell Owen Davis of Gulf Breeze, Florida. He also has three grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.  I cannot say enough about the impact this man had on so many lives. As a war hero, a legislator, a community advocate, a husband and a father, Dick Owen spent his life making Alabama and this country a better place. He will be greatly missed by all who knew him.                          ____________________
