Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for introducing this amendment. I gladly accept the amendment. I am a little concerned, though, about having this bypass named after Amo Houghton. As such a gentleman and one so civil and always so friendly, I do not like to see a bypass get congested because they will start saying that Amo Houghton Bypass is all congested and does not work any more. So I hope it is big enough and new enough so that traffic will always flow through it.  It is an honor to name this after him, and I repeat all the words that all the Members have said about Amo.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).
