President, without losing his right to the floor, I thank my distinguished neighbor in New England and ask through the Chair if he is aware that the Senate Judiciary Committee pushed for years to close the glaring loopholes in the background check system to try to prevent criminals from buying guns.  Is the Senator aware that today you could have three murder warrants and a conviction for armed robbery and walk to a gun show and buy any kind of weapon you want without having to go through a background check or have a license?
