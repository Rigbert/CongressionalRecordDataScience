President, I would like to take a moment to pay tribute to retired BG Jonathan Farnham, who is retiring after having honorably served his community, State and country for 34 years in the Vermont National Guard.  Jon was commissioned in 1981 through the Reserve Officer Training Corps at the University of Vermont where he earned a Bachelor of Science in economics. Prior to receiving his commission, he served as an enlisted member of the 1st Battalion, 86th Field Artillery of the Vermont Army National Guard.  From his first assignment with the 86th Field Artillery, to his role as Director of the Afghan National Security Forces Development Assistance Bureau, to his nearly 3 years as a civilian employee serving as the Vice Director of the Guard's Joint Staff, Jon has served under 6 Governors and 4 Adjutant Generals. As each of them undoubtedly would agree, his wealth of experience and knowledge has been invaluable to the State and Nation as he has risen through the ranks, serving at nearly every level of command in the Army Guard.  He also served as a fellow in the office of Senator Jim Jeffords, and I have personally benefitted from Jon's legacy, having had the privilege of employing his daughter Lily in my Burlington office during the summer of 2010.  Jon will be remembered for his keen sense of humor, dedication to duty, and deep love and appreciation for the State of Vermont.  I am grateful that the Vermont National Guard was able to benefit from Jon's lifetime of service, and Marcelle and I send our best wishes to him in the retirement he has certainly earned.                          ____________________
