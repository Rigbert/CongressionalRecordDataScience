Speaker, I would like to introduce you to a true American family who has sacrificed and served our great Nation. Eight of Charles and Anna Haber's sons all proudly served in World War II between 1936-47.  The story of the Haber family is one of two people immigrating to the United States, meeting, and overcoming hardships, to live out the American dream. In the early 1900's, Charles and Anna each left Czechoslovakia to come tothe United States. However, they did not know each other at the time. They both happened to settle in a mining town in Pennsylvania which is where they met. They soon were married and had a large family of nine sons and three daughters.  However, the story does not end there. Tragically, in 1928, there was a terrible explosion in the coal mining town of Mather, PA, which killed 211 miners. Charles, aged 42, and his brother, George, aged 21, were among those casualties.  Determined to go on with her life, Anna took her children to the Pittsburgh area to live. However, before this move, two of her daughters had died from illnesses during childhood.  Once World War II began, eight of the Haber sons entered the military to fight to preserve democracy. Paul and Peter served in the U.S. Army, while John served in the U.S. Marine Corps. Andrew, Michael, Joseph, Steve, and Frank all served their country in the U.S. Navy.  Charles and Anna Haber's son, Frank, and his wife, Lillian, have resided in Indiana's First Congressional District for 44 years. They have three children, Charles, Maureen, and Colleen, and seven grandchildren. Frank and Lillian are proud that their oldest grandchild, Jennifer, is carrying on the family tradition as a student at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, MD.  Mr. Speaker, the Habers' service to our great country is a shining example of one family's dedication and valor. I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring this fine family for such patriotic heroism.                          ____________________
