 President, when the new majority resolved to get the Senate back to work, we knew we would have to get committees functioning first. We believed that would be critical to helping Members on both sides rediscover their voices and find common ground and then develop real stakes in the outcome. That certainly is what we have seen this appropriations season.  The Appropriations Committee has already held dozens of hearings. It has marked up funding bills at a steady clip. It is sending good legislation to the floor.  One of those bills is the energy security and water infrastructure appropriations measure which is before us now. This legislation is important for American energy, for American waterways and ports, and for American commerce and safety. It will also maintain our nuclear deterrence posture by ensuring nuclear stockpile readiness, which is important for national security.  I would like to recognize the bill managers for their diligent work to bring this legislation to the floor for consideration. I would also like to recognize the leadership of the Appropriations Committee for its work in getting this process moving. By returning to regular order, we have opened up the process and empowered Senators--both those who sit on the Appropriations Committee and those who do not--to have more of a say in the appropriations legislation. That is important because these funding bills can affect each of our States.  The progress we have seen already is encouraging. It shows what is possible when the Senate gets back to a productive legislative process.                          ____________________
