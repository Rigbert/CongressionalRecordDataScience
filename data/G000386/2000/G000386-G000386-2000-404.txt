 President, I wish to take this particular time to not speak on either one of the amendments before us but to speak about the necessity of passing this bill. Because we have votes on two or three amendments and then final passage, I will not take the time of the Senate at the time of final passage.  As we prepare for final passage on this bankruptcy bill, I remind all my colleagues what we are voting for and on.
