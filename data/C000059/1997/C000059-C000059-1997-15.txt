Chairman, I rise in support of the Goodling amendment.  The administration is attempting to avoid the current education policy by implementing an agenda that focuses on national testing. These tests only undermine the State and local curriculum. This proposal serves as an unfair comparison between schools and students.  In addition, the Department's of Education's budget did not include any type of national testing and further, the Department has not submitted a proposal to Congress requesting authorization for this type of testing.  It is critical that we concentrate on the real problems such as teacher training, improved academic performance, and increased parental involvement in our classrooms. Local solutions enhance a child's education, not another Federal standardize test.  My constituents back in Riverside County, CA, are tired of the Federal Government meddling with their children's education.  I encourage my colleagues to vote to stop the intrusion of Government and support the Goodling amendment.
