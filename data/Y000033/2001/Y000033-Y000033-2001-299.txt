Mr. Chairman, my amendment restores funding for the Small Community Air Service Development Pilot Program that was stricken by my point of order.  This program will help small communities that do not have adequate, affordable commercial air service attract new service. Without reliable air service, small communities cannot sustain its economic growth.  The Small Community Air Service Development Pilot program authorized by section 203 of the Aviation Investment Reform Act for the 21st Century, AIR-21, will assist underserved airports obtain jet air service. It will also allow communities to market that service to increase passenger service.  The money provided by this program could also assist a small or midsized community by making money available to subsidize air carriers' operations for up to 3 years if the Secretary of Transportation determines that the community is not receiving sufficient air carrier service.  Mr. Chairman, this program is important to many small communities through our Nation, and I urge the adoption of the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I also suggest, although I struck the money, I do support the program. This is an attempt to put the money back in without having tapped the sources that it originated.
