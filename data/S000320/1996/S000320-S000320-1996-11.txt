 President, I am pleased to announce our success in passing the Shelby-Mack regulatory relief bill which is included as part of the omnibus appropriations bill. This bill will allow banks to devote additional resources to productive activities, such as making loans and extending credit to small businesses and potential homeowners. This hard fought, thoroughly debated legislation streamlines disclosure requirements, eliminates duplicative regulation and removes unnecessary filing and record keeping requirements.  I have been working diligently on a regulatory relief package for many years. It is only with tireless effort, conviction in market principles, and the blessing of a Republican Congress have we been able to turn the tides of banking legislation and provide significant regulatory relief for America's financial sector. In doing so, we have strengthened America's banking system and produced an environment conducive to competing in the rapidly changing, global financial market.  While I am convinced this bill will encourage economic growth and opportunity, by no means do I believe our job in Congress is complete. Over the years, we have witnessed an accumulation of banking laws with complete disregard to the burden it has placed on financial institutions and with very little value-added in terms of safety and soundness. I continue to believe that a more thoughtful structure of banking laws accentuating free market principles and jettisoning the heavy hand of Government regulation is the only way to ensure American financial institutions have the ability to complete in the dynamic marketplace of the 21st century. The Shelby-Mack bill is just the first deregulation bill a Republican Congress will give the American people. Next year I intend to move forward with another bill to increase the access of credit to consumers as well as strengthen the safety and soundness of the U.S. financial system.  In particular, the Community Reinvestment Act [CRA] places an enormous regulatory burden on banks--especially small banks. The truth of the matter is that banking, financial and labor regulations drive up the cost of low and moderate income housing for the very people they are intended to help. Indeed, Federal Reserve Governor Lawrence Lindsey has stated that ``[a]n urban policy that increases the flexibility and creativity allowable under CRA and recognizes the wide variety of financial services and the enormous diversity of the markets involved could be a powerful tool to those in the business of community development.'' It is my intention to address these regulatory inequities in the 105th Congress.  Mr. President, as consumers and politicians realize the benefits of the efforts of the 104th Congress, it is my sincere hope that legislators will understand the value of independent thinking and the economic freedom we seek to bestow upon every American in the United States.asset conservation, lender liability, and deposit insurance protection                               act of 1996
