I think what is most discouraging is the average person is asking themselves: Why do we inflict this pain on ourselves in the midst of a recession? Why do we have the fear of defaulting on America's debt for the first time in our history? Why would we lose our credit rating, the best in the world--AAA--because of a manufactured political debate in Washington?  We will pay for this for a long time to come. For every 1 percent interest rates go up, our national debt goes up $130 billion a year--$1.3 trillion over 10 years. So as we talk about all the spending cuts we want, the fact is, we end up in a position where we can't keep up with increases in the interest rate.
