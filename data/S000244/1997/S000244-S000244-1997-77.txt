Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I thank the gentleman from Tennessee for his good words. I think it shows that, when we confine our arguments to genuine disputes over policy, which are fairly narrow on the Committee on Science, rather than arguing over procedure or perceived or real unfairness, we can get a lot accomplished in a very short period of time. The fact that this is the 6th of the 10 authorization bills to come up, all of which have been relatively noncontroversial, I think is proof of that.  The other four bills are of shared jurisdiction with other committees, and the Committee on Science will be working with the chairs and the leadership of the other committees in orderto eliminate the jurisdictional problems so that we can complete the job as expeditiously as possible.
