Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Ose) and the gentleman from California (Mr. Matsui) for bringing this resolution to the floor. I rise to support this resolution and to condemn the acts of hatred and intolerance which require it.  Mr. Speaker, we live in a country rich with diversity. It has been described as a melting pot, a mosaic, a tapestry. But what unites us as a Nation and as a people is our belief in our constitutional democracy and the right of all our citizens to live, work and worship in peace. We are black and white, red and yellow and brown. We are Christians, Muslims, Jewish, Hindu, Buddhists and much, much more. More importantly, we are Americans.  The attacks on three synagogues in Sacramento, California, last week may have been directed against those of the Jewish faith, but they are not, they are an attack against all of us. They are an attack against America and all that she stands for. They are an attack on our constitution, our liberty and our freedom.  Mr. Speaker, if this was an attack against Jews, then I am a Jew, for an act of violence against a synagogue is an attack on the church, an attack on the mosque, an attack on the temple. I, for one, will not sit idly by. I will not sit silent. The people who committed this crime will be caught, and they will be punished. Let the word go forth from this House, from this place, this day that there is no place in our great Nation for hatred, intolerance or discrimination. Let us say today through this resolution that we are one Nation, one House, one family, the American House, the American family.
