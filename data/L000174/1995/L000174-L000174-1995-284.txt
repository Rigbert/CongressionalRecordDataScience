President, I have agreed to accept this amendment, because it is narrowly written and deals only with the authority to provide spare parts for Peruvian aircraft used in the drug interdiction program. It does not authorize funds on equipment for the Peruvian Army. We prohibit military aid to Peru in this bill on account of longstanding human rights concerns. We do not want to undermine that policy in any way, by providing equipment to the army for any purpose.  However, this amendment would not do that. It only permits the delivery of spare parts to permit the Peruvian Air Force to operate its drug interdiction aircraft, which I am told by the sponsor of the amendment, Senator Kerry, are having an effect. I am willing to see that effort continue if it is helping interrupt the flow of cocaine, but I cannot agree to any assistance to the Peruvian Army.                           Amendment No. 2746(Purpose: To ensure that the current proportion of economic assistance  continues to be channeled through private and voluntary organizations                            and cooperatives)       On page 9, insert after the end of line 8 the following:      ``Provided further, That the President shall seek to ensure      that the percentage of funds made available under this      heading for the activities of private and voluntary      organizations and cooperatives is at least equal to the      percentage of funds made available pursuant to corresponding      authorities in law for the activities of private and      voluntary organizations and cooperatives in fiscal year      1995:''.
