 I do so every year because the lessons of the past must not be forgotten and the crimes of the past must not be repeated.  On April 24, 1915, the Ottoman Empire launched a brutal and unconscionable policy of mass murder. Over an 8-year period, 1.5 million Armenians were killed, and another 500,000 were driven from their homes, their property and land confiscated.  As Americans, as sons and daughters of liberty, justice and freedom, we must raise our voices and acknowledge this terrible crime to ensure that it does not happen again.  Those who would single out men, women, and children to be killed solely on the basis of their race, ethnicity, and religion must know that the United States and the international community will not allow their crimes to go unpunished.  We have seen the crimes of the Armenian Genocide repeated far too often in this century: in Germany, in Cambodia, in Rwanda, and in Bosnia. We have stood by and remained silent. Let us commemorate this occasion and state loud and clear: Never again.  Even as we remember the tragedy and honor the dead, we also honor the living. Half a million Armenian Americans reside in my home State of California and I am proud to be their representative in the U.S. Senate. They have overcome the horrors of the past to build a better future for themselves and their families in the United States. They are a testament to hard work, dedication, and perseverence and they have greatly enriched the culture and civic life of our State.  Let us remember the Armenian Genocide. Let us ensure that those who suffered did not die in vain. Let us rededicate ourselves to cause of human rights for all. Let us work together with Armenia and the Armenian American community to create a future filled with hope and possibility.
