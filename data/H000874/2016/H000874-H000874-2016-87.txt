Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation, which is the product of much negotiation--which is an understatement, I think--in an effort to find consensus.  Congress first enacted the Toxic Substances Control Act 40 years ago to protect Americans from the risks posed by chemicals in commerce. It has not been reauthorized since. Since its original enactment, the law has become outdated, and efforts to modernize it have been ongoing for several years with great difficulty. Under current law, it has become hard for the EPA to ban even substances that are known to cause cancer, such as asbestos.  The bill before us today is a breakthrough after a significant amount of work. It represents a compromise that, while not perfect, as everyone has noted, is a great improvement over current law. And it will help the EPA protect Americans from harmful, toxic substances and safeguard our environment.  This bill will require the EPA to evaluate both existing and new chemical substances against a new risk-based, scientific safety standard that includes specific considerations for populations more vulnerable to chemical exposure, such as children, seniors, and pregnant women. It also ensures that the EPA can order testing immediately for substances suspected of placing Americans at risk.  This bill improves public transparency of chemical information, provides for clear and enforceable deadlines to review prioritized chemicals, and takes action to mitigate any identified risk.  In short, this is a bill that reflects the kind of compromise across the aisle we ought to be seeing more of in this House. It is fittingly named after Senator Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, who spent his career working to make this law more functional.
