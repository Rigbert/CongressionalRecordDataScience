President, at the end of last year, Marcelle and I attended an event at Georgetown University where Cardinal Theodore McCarrick was awarded a honorary degree.  Everyone present at this ceremony was captured by the remarks that the archbishop gave in accepting the degree. He artfully wove us through three ``stories'' to demonstrate the importance of a Catholic university in the Jesuit tradition.  So that all of my colleagues have an opportunity to review the remarks of Cardinal McCarrick, and because of the admiration I have for him, I ask that his acceptance speech at the award of his honorary degree from Georgetown University be printed in the Record.  The material follows:  Remarks by Theodore Cardinal McCarrick, D.D., Ph.D., Archbishop of     Washington, on the Occasion of His Receiving a Honorary Degree,                 Georgetown University, December 1, 2004       As Father Brian [McDermott] was reading those wonderful      words and as the president repeated them, I thought of the      wonderful Jewish expression, ``From your mouth to God's      ears.'' I just hope the Lord doesn't get mad that you said      all those nice things about me. Dr. President, Dr. Villani,      Chairman of the Board, members of the board, Your Excellency,      The Apostolic Nuncio [Archbishop Gabriel Montalvo] and my      brother bishops, my--I guess I should say my Georgetown      family now--and I say that with great joy.       I want to begin by telling you sincerely how honored I am      in receiving this degree from Georgetown. I've long regarded      this institution as one of the finest educational      institutions in the United States. During my four years in      Washington, I've always felt part of it in a very special      way. To receive its degree now is a very special joy for me,      and I want you all to know how much I do appreciate it.       I have tremendous respect for your president, Dr. DeGioia.      I was privileged to be present at his inauguration, and to      prophesy at that time that he would lead this institution to      greater heights of excellence and to a continuing growth in      the realization of its mission as a Catholic university in      the Jesuit tradition. My prophecy is coming true every day.       My respect for the Society of Jesus goes back to my early      years of high school when I admired the Jesuits so much that      I found myself going to two of their high schools, not at the      same time, but one after the other until I finally got it      right and received my diploma. My own education in high      school and college has been much enhanced by the excellence      of the ratio studiorum and by its challenges. It has been an      education for which I am so very grateful, and through which      I have been so very blessed. As a matter of fact, since the      rector of Georgetown is my personal theologian, I'm still      learning from the Society and appreciating that wisdom and      insight so very much.       My relationship to Georgetown, as I began to intermit a      moment ago, is not of a visitor in a Catholic institution.      The local bishop is always part of any enterprise which is      related to the Church. A university such as ours is clearly      one of the great boasts and glories of our Catholic community      here in Washington. I have been here many times during the      last four years. I've enjoyed that privilege. I've been here      for academic celebrations, for lectures, for interfaith      moments of prayer, at times of national crisis, for meetings      with students, and often for Mass in your chapels. In the      beginning, I was happy to be welcomed by all of you at the      University. Now I no longer see myself just as a welcomed      visitor, but as part of the family. It is therefore always      a joy when I hear someone say instead of ``Welcome to the      University,'' ``It's nice to have you back.''       Georgetown University, in its stated mission, sees itself      truly and essentially as a Catholic institution in the Jesuit      tradition. That fact opens its life to many wonderful      challenges and many great opportunities. It is a place where      Catholic scholars may freely exercise a faithful witness to      what the Church teaches. It is a place where non-Catholic      scholars and professors, who add so much to the life of this      institution, can pursue their own fields of study with the      assurance that truth is the master here, and that its pursuit      is always welcome. Their understanding of the mission of this      institution adds so much to society's understanding of what      Georgetown is all about. I pray that those who are not      Catholic, both in the faculty and the student body, will      always find inspiration an example from the Catholics who      teach here, both cleric and lay, as well as a deeper      understanding of what we're all about, and what our mission      is--not just in the Church but in society and in the world at      large.       The preparation of Catholic leaders for the future of our      nation is a noble role. The preparation of those who are not      Catholic in their own burgeoning opportunity to play roles of      leadership in our country, has an equal importance because it      enables the leaders of tomorrow to learn about us, about the      Church, and to appreciate our own Catholic mission in this      complex society. This has always been one of the great roles      of the Society of Jesus, and I pray it will continue always      to be so here at Georgetown. May those of the immediate      family always be challenged to holiness, and those of the      wider family allowed to see what our life in the Lord and in      His church is all about. In the religious life of the      students and faculty at Georgetown, may there always be this      quest for holiness since this has to be the role within any      Catholic institution. The example of the Jesuits, according      to the rule of the great Ignatius, must always be a      challenge, not just to holiness of life, but to priests in      religious vocations both for the Society and for the Diocesan      in priesthood, and for religious life as well. I always      rejoice     in a special way to find graduates of Georgetown hearing the      Lord's call to service in priestly and religious ministry.      This, too, is a measure of our Catholic life and of our deep      Jesuit tradition.       I want to speak briefly tonight about the global importance      or the international aspect of a Catholic university in the      Jesuit tradition. Basically, there are three points I want to      make. First is that the mark of every great university is      caring. The mark of every great Catholic university is      wonder. The mark of every great Catholic university in the      Jesuit tradition is adventure.       The first, caring, demands that there be a background of      authentic humanism in the very nature and mission of every      university, a sense of caring. A great university such as      Georgetown is called to manifest this in a world that tends      so much to be mechanistic and ideological. Secondly, the role      of a Catholic university demands a sense of wonder, of      mystery, and appreciation that everything in this world is      not able to be subjected to positivistic criteria. We believe      that there is a reality beyond the mere material that calls      for recognition of the spiritual, the wonderful. And finally,      the Jesuit tradition of this institution calls for it to be      adventurous, innovative, inventive in the deepest sense. I      believe the young people of today would say with great      solemnity, the ability to think outside the box.       I would like briefly to develop these three points by three      stories. They are stories which have made a difference in my      life. They are perhaps three stories that have been my      instruction in where I am today. The first, the one which we      can call the humanistic, the caring, takes place in Africa,      and challenges us to understand the deep relationship which      each of us has with every other human being on the planet,      reminding us that we are all brothers and sisters in God's      one human family. The second which takes place in Asia, and      which is the only one that I relate second hand, is a story      that reminds us of the need for wonder in every Catholic      life. And finally, the story of an extraordinary Catholic      educator, who is a Jesuit, a story from Eastern Europe,      will bring us out of the box. Let me tell you these three      stories.       Years ago when I was a young bishop, I was sent on a      mission to the Sudan for Catholic Relief Services. I tell      this story because I think it is a big moment in my own life      and has made a change. I see in my growth what may affect the      university and its life. I was fascinated by the Sudan. I had      never been in that part of Africa. I met priests. I met      bishops. I met Muslim leaders. I met the poor. One day, one      of the priests said, ``If you have half a day, we'll go      across the Nile and go beyond Umderman.'' (Umderman, if you      used to go to the old movies is where Kitchener had that      great battle and Lord Gordon was killed.) So I said,      ``Sure.'' We went across the Nile, which itself is a great      experience, got to the other side and said, ``What are we      going to see?'' He said, ``No, we're not going to stop      here.'' We went about 25 more miles west into the desert.      There, after the city of Umderman had long since passed, we      saw a huge city of tents. We went in to see some of the      families, and translated, I heard several things.       We're all members of God's one human family, but I never      saw it more clearly than there. These were the people,      probably some from Dafur, but this is 20 years ago, who when      the drought came and there was no water, could not do any      farming, could not take care of their flock. So they gathered      up their families and went toward the river, the Nile, where      water will always be. Now they couldn't get to the Nile. They      had to stop 25 miles away because they were not allowed to go      there. They would have overwhelmed, so the government said,      the facilities. And so they stayed there, and every day they      paid some entrepreneurs who drove little trucks to the Nile,      filled them up with water, and then came back. Of course,      they didn't come back for free. And gradually, these people      paid all the money that they had with them until it was gone.      And after the money was gone, they began to sell their      furniture. And after their furniture was gone, they began to      sell their animals. And after their animals were gone, they      began to sell their children.       Listening to the families, for whom the sacrifice of an      older child had to be made so that younger children could      survive, it is a story that is engrained in my heart because      I think that it showed me that all life has to have caring in      it. All life has to have a sense of who we are as God's      people. A university has to have that, any university,      because if we are training people without understanding that      we are all related, that we're all one family, then we are      training them for a world that does not exist. That's the      first lesson. A university must be involved in caring and in      showing people how to care. I think Georgetown is.       The second story happened in East Timor. I had gone to East      Timor for some other reason, and it was maybe three months      after the elections, and two months or one month after the      whole country had been in a state of terrible turmoil, and      those who did not want East Timor to be free began to kill      all the leaders. Anyone who taught in school, anyone who had      a good job, anyone who had any kind of an education was a      target for these militias.       The Catholic Church had been very important to these      people. Eighty-five percent of the people had been Catholic,      surprisingly, in one of these small islands of Indonesia. A      great bishop, Bishop Belo, who won the Nobel Prize, was      guarding the flock and taking care of them all. One day I      went to visit him. I went to visit him in the charred ruins      of his house, and then they told me the story.       About a week before, there had been marauding bands, always      armed and always dangerous and violent. The people began to      become afraid. The bishop's house was a place with a large      lawn. The people came into the lawn trying to seek protection      from him who was a leader and from being together. Maybe      1,000 people were gathered there in the lawn, and the bishop      came out and began to talk to them. While they were there,      suddenly a band of militia came in with their guns, pushing      the people aside, pushing the bishop aside. We heard all      kinds of different things that may have been said, but      ultimately they lit a fire and threw it in the bishop's      house. The bishop went to try to save it, but he was held      back. The people were awed, and scared, and afraid to do      anything. While the bishop was watching the destruction of      his house, and while the people in desperate fear were      just standing around, a young man came out of the crowd.      It was dark except for the flames. He went to the bishop,      tried to move him away from the flames. A soldier came up,      pushed the young man away, and stuck his gun in the      bishop's back, and got ready to pull the trigger. There      was a hush, and almost a scream at the same time among the      people. The young man came back and gently pushed the      bishop forward and stood behind him, between the gun and      the bishop and did not move. The man with the gun didn't      know what to do, and there was silence. Where did this      fellow come from, this young man? Nobody knew him. But      somehow he found courage that nobody else had. Somehow he      found an ability to, in a world full of violence and      anger, he found a sense of wonder and mystery. The man      with the gun became embarrassed because he didn't know      what to do. So, he hit the young man, pulled his gun back,      and walked back to the soldiers. The moment was enough to      break the tension, so the militia left. The bishop turned      around to thank the young man. He wasn't there anymore. He      had disappeared into the crowd.       I thought, there is a sense of wonder and mystery in your      life when people find courage to do things that one would      never expect, when people find the ability to stand up for      something that they believe, even if it threatens their life      or everything they have. A Catholic university has to prepare      people for that. A Catholic university has to somehow enhance      in every human being that sense of wonder, that sense of      mystery, that sense that you can do what you never thought      you could do. You can rise above yourself, and your spirit      can be enflamed, and enhanced by the needs that you see in      your brothers. A university that is truly Catholic, has to      pass that lesson along. I think Georgetown does.       The third and last story is a different kind of story. It's      a story of a Jesuit; an extraordinary Jesuit. In Slovakia, at      the time of the communist persecution, only a certain number      of priests were allowed to be ordained. To ordain outside      that number, the bishop would be thrown into prison and the      priest as well. There was a young Jesuit who had commissioned      to be a priest called Jan Chryzostom Korec. Korec was      ordained at maybe 26 years-old, and began to serve as a      priest. The Jesuit provincial of Slovakia who was living in      disguise and living underground as so many were, came to see      him one day. He said, ``Father Korec, Bishop Hnilica--who was      an underground bishop--has permission to consecrate you a      bishop. And we feel that you should accept.'' Well, this is a      man now 27 years old, but unless somebody accepted this      burden, the Church could disappear. So ultimately he said,      ``Yes, I will do whatever you think is right.'' So, in the      kitchen of a friend the next night, he was consecrated a      bishop. Then he once again disappeared and continued to work      as a priest.       About six months later, the provincial came to him again      and said, ``Korec, we have a man now who is ready to be      ordained a priest, a man of the Society. Will you ordain      him?'' He said, ``Okay.'' and he ordained the young man in a      park at twilight. Unfortunately, the young man was not as      careful as he should have been, and the authorities found out      that he was a priest. They brought him in and they began to      put him under all kinds of tortures and difficulties.      Finally, he said, ``I was ordained a priest quietly,      secretly.'' And they said, ``Who did it?'' After more      torture, he said, ``Korec.'' So they went and called Korec      in, and they said, ``Are you a bishop?'' Without going into      any kind of Jesuitical subtleties, he said, ``Me, a bishop,      that's the silliest thing I've ever heard!'' He kept saying      that and they let him go. He didn't look like a bishop. Well,      six months later, the provincial came back and he said, ``We      have another man. Will you ordain him?'' Korec ordained him      in somebody's living room. And this man, too, unfortunately,      after some months was caught, brought in, tortured, revealed      Korec, and so then they had him. They sent him away to prison      in solitary confinement. He was there 18 years. And then      finally in the Prague spring, they allowed him to come out      and to work. They gave him a job working in a chemical      factory, unpacking chemical things and spillage: a very      dangerous job. He did it quietly. Now he no longer had the      right to be a priest, so they gave him these other jobs.      He's an interesting man, and gradually people looked for      him. Gradually, he began quietly to be a priest again.      They weren't     sure of him, so the lamp in his one-room bedroom apartment      was wired. They listened to all of his conversations.       He has wonderful stories to tell about playing the radio so      loud that the neighbors complained, but at least he could      have conversations then. Gradually, he began to do things      that no one else has been able to do. When the iron curtain      fell, he was acknowledged as a bishop. He went down to see      the Holy Father. The Holy Father told him that he was to be      given given the Diocese of Nitra, which is the diocese of St.      Methodius, of the great Sts. Cyril and Methodisum, one of      those great wonderful sees.       About two years after that I was in Slovakia and I was      talking to one of the vice-presidents of the Slovak      parliament who was a Catholic. We were talking about those      tough days of the communist regime. And I said, ``How did you      ever get your education?'' He said, ``I went to the      university.'' I said, ``Which one?'' He said, ``I went to      Korec University.'' I said, ``What do you mean?'' He said,      ``Every Saturday when we had off--because they had to work on      Sunday. Every Saturday which was our day off, we'd pack some      salami and some beer and go up into the hills and Father      Korec would come. All day long, we would sit, and he would      teach us about the Church, about Catholic Social Thought,      about philosophy, about theology.'' And this man said to me,      ``I know more about these things than if I had gone to the      university for four years because we never missed a Saturday.      Dozens of us would go. He would write on pieces of paper what      we had to know, and he would make 50 copies all in his own      handwriting.'' I've seen them.       To be adventurous. To be inventive. Not to let the world      make it impossible for you to grow, and live, and enjoy.      Always to listen to that other voice that says you can do it:      find a way. I think that's the mark of a Jesuit tradition,      and I think we find it here at Georgetown.       I've kept you too long with these stories of mine, but I      feel that a story, like a picture, is worth a thousand words.      These stories, as I said at the beginning, have moved me,      maybe hopefully a little further in my understanding of what      education is. Maybe it will give us all an understanding of      what I mean when I say a great Catholic university in the      Jesuit tradition has to be.       Every university should teach its students and its faculty      and administration that we live in a world of brothers and      sisters, not as strangers and enemies, but that we all share      a common dignity, and that all lives are precious, everyone's      life. Secondly, to be truly Catholic, we must be open to      wonder, to mystery, the mysteries of our faith, the mysteries      of love, the mysteries even of science which will always be      searching for greater clarity. As Catholics, we must never be      afraid of mystery, of that wonder that causes us to do things      we never thought we could do. Our faith is built on mystery,      and to be truly wise, and truly educated, we must be men and      women who accept wonder as an essential element of our      existence. And finally, in the story of Cardinal Korec (who      ultimately became a cardinal), we are challenged to see what      a university can also be when circumstances and the      challenges of the world around us call us all to find in      different ways the great things that are essential for our      lives and vital for our growth and wisdom. I find these      things here at Georgetown. I pray that they always will be      here. I pray, too, that these elements of deep human concern      of wonder and adventure, may be even more developed, more      understood and embraced, under great leadership with great      men and women in a brilliant future which will always be part      mystery and even always part out of the box. Thank you very      much.                          ____________________[Pages S1712-S1714]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                      CARDINAL THEODORE McCARRICK
