President, almost a year ago, this country's airlines made a grand announcement about a new, although albeit voluntary, commitment to the rights of airline passengers.  I tend to look with a very skeptical eye at any promise to consumers that contains the notion of both ``voluntary'' and ``rights'' together in the same sentence.  Now, 1 year later, my conversations with Federal investigators about the work they have done, at the Senate's request, leaves me to be even more skeptical of what the airlines have promised.  What I have learned from Federal investigators is that there are more questions than answers about the quality of airline customer service, flight delays, and the airline ticket distribution system.  Frankly, as I said a year ago, the evidence indicates that the airlines' so-called customer first package has proven to be worth little more than the paper it was written on.  In fact, just recently, in the last few months, the Washington Post Business Section had a headline that said: ``Airline Service Dips n 3 of 4 Categories.'' They went on to describe what can only be categorized as a pretty bumpy operation with respect to guaranteeing the rights of passengers in this country.  I will take just a few minutes to outline what I think the central problems are, and what I have learned from Federal investigators about their work. Then I hope the Senate will support my amendment on a bipartisan basis.  First, after a year of trying to get the airlines to be straight with the American consumer with respect to finding the lowest fare available on a particular flight, I can report that finding the lowest airfare remains one of the great mysteries of our time.  On any given flight, there may be as many different fares paid as there are passengers on the plane. Finding out if the flight you want to take is overbooked is sort of like playing hide and seek. First, you have to know what to ask for. Then you need to know the difference between a flight that is oversold and a flight that is overbooked. Suffice it to say, there seem to be a fair number of people in the industry who can hardly explain that difference.  When I first called for the passage of a real, enforceable passenger bill of rights for airline consumers, I made it very clear to the Senate that I was not talking about establishing a constitutional right to a fluffy pillow on your airplane flight. I was not talking about folks being entitled to a jumbo bag of peanuts. What I was talking about has the public's right to know, the public's right to know information about basic services, just as they do in every other area of our economy.  In every other area of the economy, such as when you have a reservation for a particular item or you want to find out about how it is priced, you can get that information. You can get it whether it is on the telephone, at the counter, online, or through a variety of intermediaries. And you are told, in straightforward kinds of terms, the real reasons behind these scheduling arrangements, and prices, and the kind of information that is so relevant to the consumer.  That is not what is happening today in the airline industry, despite the grandiose pledges from folks in the industry.  For example, the annual survey by leading scholars at Wichita State who have been doing these surveys for many years came out in April and found that consumer complaints on air travel in 1999 were up 130 percent over the previous year. That study showed that 7 out of 10 airlines posted lower quality ratings than they did in the previous year.  Earlier this year, the Department of Transportation consumer division reported that the number of complaints they had received was about double that of the previous year. The complaints were up and the ratings were down after the airlines had pledged to the Congress to do better.  Suffice it to say, these professors at Wichita State are not airline industry bashers. These are individuals who, by their own description, take a very conservative orientation to these issues. Yet they found that in virtually every important area of consumer service, there had actually been a deterioration in the quality of service to airline passengers during this period since the airlines' so-called customer first pledge went into effect.  When the industry's Air Transport Association reported recently that customer satisfaction was at an all-time high, many of us struggled to find out to whom exactly they were talking. They weren't talking to the folks I sit next to on an airplane or the people I meet in ticket lines at home in Oregon or around the Pacific Northwest.  I can understand the inclination of the Senate to give the airlines some time to try to make their voluntary program work. I got my head handed to me when we had the vote in the Commerce Committee and it was 19-1 with respect to airline passenger rights. I respected that. Given the results in the Commerce Committee, I decided we ought to try to do some followup and offered several amendments that were accepted as part of this appropriations bill in the last year. I believed it was important to continue to monitor the situation to see if we would get any improvements since the industry's pledges went into effect.  What we adopted in the last appropriations bill was part of the final law. It was binding, and it gave the Transportation Department inspector general a statutory mandate to look at whether airlines are giving customers access to the lowest fares no matter what technology they used to contact the airline. It is outrageous to know that even today airline passengers can be quoted one price over the telephone and yet a much lower fare is available to them on the Internet and they aren't given that kind of information. The Department of Transportation inspector general was directed in the last appropriations bill to investigate that issue and, in addition, to make sure we monitor this question of the lowest fare.  We directed the inspector general to tell us about overbookings of flights--again, a right-to-know context. I have no problem with an airline selling a ticket to a passenger on a flight that is overbooked, if the consumer is told that the flight is overbooked at the time they are going to make the purchase. It is fairly straightforward; it is informed consent. We have found that has not been done.  The Department of Transportation inspector general is also looking at a new scheme the airlines have cooked up known as T-2. It is our understanding this is a new online pool of airfares where nearly all of the major air carriers will offer their lowest fares but which will not be accessible to those who offer travel services.  In a few weeks, the inspector general of the Department of Transportation is going to issue an interim report on the airlines' customer service commitment plans. What I have heard about this report is that the airlines are coming up short, and seriously so, with respect to following up on the commitments they made to the Congress.  For example, recent weather delays at Chicago's O'Hare Airport resulted in numerous planes being stranded on the runways for periods of 3 hours or more and as long as 8 hours. The Presiding Officer must have heard from some of his constituents on that matter. I happen to have been on the flight that was going from Chicago to Portland where some of those folks had been on the flight that had been stranded in Chicago. They told me all they had received during this extended wait was granola bars and almost no information at all about the options they had.  A recent power failure at National Airport in the Nation's Capital stranded scores of passengers without any accommodations or emergency provisions. Again, we have the consumer complaints pouring into the Department of Transportation at record levelseach month of this year, after the airline industry's voluntary pledge went into effect. This notion from the airline industry that they just need more time, give them a little bit more opportunity to make this so-called voluntary program work, is contradicted by what we have seen each month since the so-called voluntary pledges went into effect.  The customer service commitments don't even address one of the most frustrating areas of air travel; that is, the fundamental underlying issue of delays and what the airlines and the FDA will do to combat them.  It is important that we get the Department of Transportation interim report. It is going to offer the American people an unbiased view of exactly how well airlines are treating passengers. It is going to give us an independent assessment of these so-called voluntary passenger commitments.  I believe what this report is going to show is that the pledges the airline industry made are in effect a kind of cosmetic program to try to keep the Senate from enacting real passenger rights that are enforceable and truly protect the American public. I suspect what we will hear from the inspector general will be a blueprint for enforceable concrete legislation that protects the rights of passengers.  What the Senate ought to be doing is keeping the airlines' feet to the fire. That is why I am offering an amendment to this year's Department of Transportation appropriations bill that would instruct the Department of Transportation IG to continue his fact finding and information gathering in key areas that are so important to the public. I am talking about whether these customer service practices amount to anything, getting the public straight information on the lowest available fare, information about overbooking.  Importantly, for the first time the Senate would direct the Department of Transportation IG to look at the question of whether mergers in the airline industry are causing customer service to deteriorate. We ought to be looking at that issue. We ought to be looking at whether legislation should be enacted to require that customer service be a factor in granting an airline merger in this country. We have all heard so much about these airline mergers. We are having a lot of problems with customer service today. We ought to be looking at the ramifications these mergers are having on the quality of airline service in this country.  I am particularly interested in knowing whether the Senate, on a bipartisan basis, should write a law that would stipulate whether or not customer service ought to be a factor in the merger review process. In addition, this amendment would review the reasons for increases in flight delay. We have had some folks say it is the FAA's fault. We have had other folks say that it is the airline industry's fault. I think the Department of Transportation IG ought to dig into that issue. My amendment also requires a review of the airline ticket distribution system that I mentioned earlier involving T-2. Suffice it to say that there are a number of questions there about whether that is contributing to problems that consumers are having.  The bottom line is, will the Senate keep the airlines' feet to the fire? Are we going to have the Department of Transportation continue in this investigative effort to try to at least put some kind of collective focus by the Senate on how important it is to improve passenger service? We have all heard from constituents, at a time when the airlines are, in many instances, making great profits, about why it is that some of that money can't be devoted to improving passenger service.  I am not going to go through all of the recent news stories but just a few of the headlines. The Washington Post headline is ``Airline Service Dips In 3 of 4 Categories.'' The Los Angeles Times headline is ``Air Passengers `Fed Up' With Poor Service, Survey Finds.'' They go on to cite the fact that ``Consumer complaints against airlines have more than doubled from last year.''  In conjunction with the recommendations we are getting from the Department of Transportation's IG and their leading official, who I think does a superlative job in this area, I would like to see the Senate working with the Transportation inspector general to keep the focus on trying to force these airlines to improve the quality of passenger service to the people of this country.  I have just been informed by the staff that Chairman McCain and Senator Hollings and Senator Rockefeller would be willing to join me today in committing to send a letter asking the Department of Transportation inspector general to investigate and report to the committee on the issues that are the subject of my amendment. So that the record is clear, Chairman McCain, Senator Hollings, and Senator Rockefeller--and they are all the leaders of the Senate Commerce Committee and spend many hours looking into these issues--have all asked that they join me in a letter to the Department of Transportation inspector general inquiring into the issues that are the subject of my amendment.  The fact that we are getting the bipartisan leadership of our committee behind this effort is very important. It is certainly important to me because all of them have great expertise regarding this issue. My inclination, frankly, is to have a vote on this amendment on the floor of the Senate to send the strongest possible message. But I note that Senator Rockefeller cannot be present today. He has done extremely good and important work on a whole host of aviation issues, including the air traffic control system. As a member of the Commerce Committee and the Aviation Subcommittee, which has jurisdiction over these issues, I am going to agree this afternoon, on the basis of the fact that we will now have a bipartisan letter sent to the inspector general by the bipartisan leadership of the Commerce Committee directing that the IG look into all of the issues outlined in my amendment, to withdraw my amendment.  But I want to make it clear to people in the airline industry and the passengers that are so frustrated by these delays that this fight is going to continue. It is not being dropped. In fact, we are expanding it. As I mentioned, we are going to look, for the first time in recent years, at the ramifications of mergers on customer service. I happen to believe very strongly that mergers and customer service are inextricably linked. I think we ought to change the law and stipulate that one of the criteria on whether or not an airline merger ought to go forward is customer service.                     Amendment No. 3433, Withdrawn  I note the absence of Senator Rockefeller, who believes strongly in this. Chairman McCain and the ranking Democrat, Senator Hollings, have both done very important work on aviation issues. They have pledged to join with me in directing the Department of Transportation inspector general to investigate these issues. In view of that announcement that is being made today, and in view of the bipartisan support for the Department of Transportation looking into these issues, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment this afternoon.
