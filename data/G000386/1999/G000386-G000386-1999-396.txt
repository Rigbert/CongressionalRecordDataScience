 President, we are about to vote on a very major and very dangerous revision of U.S. trade policy, and we are going to do it without the benefit of a hearing and, quite frankly, we are doing it under great political pressure. That is not a very good environment.  If we give in to pressure to enact quota legislation, we will do great harm. I believe the proponents are all acting, of course, with the best of intentions. Yet we must not allow our desire to help a troubled industry in the short term do long-term damage to our economy.  Sixty-nine years ago, Congress passed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, and they did it with the best of good intentions. Its aim was to help the American farmer, with a limited upward revision of tariffs on foreign produce. But it had the opposite effect. It strangled foreign trade. It deepened and widened the severity of the Great Depression.  Other countries faced with deficits and exports had to pay for their imports, and they responded by applying quotas and embargoes on American goods.  I think the history of the depth and the severity of the retaliation against U.S. agricultural products from that period is shocking, because our foreign buyers stopped buying our agricultural products in retaliation.  In 1930, the United States exported just over $1 billion worth of agricultural goods. By 1932 that amount had been cut in half. Almost every American export sector was hit by foreign retaliation but particularly agriculture.  As the United States agricultural exports fell in the face of foreign retaliation, farm prices fell sharply, weakening the solvency of our rural banks.
