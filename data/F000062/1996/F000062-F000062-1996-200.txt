 President, I rise today to introduce, along with Senators Grassley, Reid, and Kyl, the Methamphetamine Control Act of 1996. This is legislation that, first, increases the regulation of precursor chemicals necessary to produce methamphetamine, a dangerous narcotic also known as speed, crank or ice.  Second, it increases the penalties for possession of controlled chemicals or paraphernalia used to make methamphetamine.  This legislation has been drafted over the past 6 months with the input of the Drug Enforcement Agency, the California Attorney General's Bureau of Narcotics Enforcement, the California Narcotics Officers Association, and local, State, and Federal law enforcement and prosecutors. I have a particular interest in this issue because of the ravaging effects that methamphetamine has had in my own State and other States in the Southwest.  Let me, for just a moment, explain how serious this problem is today. Methamphetamine has been around for a long time. But what once was a small-scale drug operation run by motorcycle gangs has now been taken over by at least one Mexican drug cartel. According to DEA, it is a multibillion-dollar industry in America.  California has become the front line in this new and dangerous drug war. DEA has designated California as the ``source country,'' a source country for methamphetamine, much like Colombia is the source country for cocaine. It has identified that 93 percent of the methamphetamine seized nationwide has its point of origin in California.  The explosion of this drug is being documented in hospital emergency rooms around California, and the epidemic is spreading eastward. In Sacramento just 4 weeks ago, law enforcement made the largest seizure in county history--80 pounds; street value, $2.5 million.  Large-scale labs are now commonplace. Last year in the Central Valley, law enforcement convicted a man who manufactured in excess of 900 pounds with a street value of $5 million. Literally hundreds of illicit laboratories exist throughout the State. In two counties alone, Riverside and San Bernardino, there were 589 methamphetamine labs discovered in 1995.  Labs can be in apartments, in mobile homes, in moving vehicles, and in hotel rooms. They can be dismantled in a matter of hours. They are explosive, toxic, and they burn. Law enforcement has indicated that drug dealers come in, set up, produce their drugs in hotels, and leave.  The California Environmental Protection Agency expects that 1,150 sites will require cleanup by the end of this year in California. Most of the chemicals--iodine, refrigerants, hydrochloric gas, sodium hydroxide--are toxic and, in the case of red phosphorous, one of the precursor chemicals, highly flammable and explosive.  Two months ago, a mobile home in Riverside used as a methamphetamine lab exploded, killing three small children. Incredibly enough, the mother of these children pleaded with neighbors that they not call for help. Before firefighters could find the children's burnt bodies, the woman walked away from the scene.  Police in Phoenix say methamphetamine is mainly responsible for the 40-percent jump in homicides the city is experiencing.  In Contra-Costa County, law enforcement reports that methamphetamine isinvolved in 89 percent of domestic disputes.  Last year in San Diego, rival methamphetamine smuggling rings were responsible for 26 homicides.  In 1994, among all adults arrested in the San Diego area, 42 percent of men and 53 percent of women tested positive for amphetamines. Sutter Memorial Hospital in Sacramento says that methamphetamine-affected babies now outnumber crack-addicted babies 7-1.  The Methamphetamine Control Act which we are introducing today is carefully crafted. It is a targeted piece of legislation. It is drafted with the help of Federal, State, and local law enforcement, and it is aimed at the supply side of the problem.  This bill would increase criminal penalties that can be applied to large-scale methamphetamine manufacturers throughout our Nation. It restricts access to the precursor chemicals used in mass quantities to produce methamphetamine.  It would increase the penalties for possession of controlled chemicals or specialized equipment like the triple-neck flasks used to make methamphetamine.  It would add chemicals used to make methamphetamine--iodine, red phosphorous, and hydrochloric gas--to the Chemical Diversion and Trafficking Act.  It imposes a civil ``three strikes and you're out'' law, for companies that are found to be selling chemicals used to make methamphetamine.  There are in our State about seven rogue chemical companies. Anyone with $100 and a mail order catalog can put themselves into business in manufacturing methamphetamine. They can buy large-scale quantities of those chemicals that go into making methamphetamine.  This bill would double the maximum criminal penalty for possession of a chemical identified under the Chemical Diversion and Trafficking Act in methamphetamine production and would increase the maximum criminal penalty from 4 to 10 years for those who possess the specialized equipment used to manufacture methamphetamine.  It would remove the loophole on pseudoephedrine in the Controlled Substances Act. Pseudoephedrine, a common ingredient in many over-the-counter medicines, is now used as a substitute for ephedrine to make methamphetamine.  I have met with retailers and manufacturers of over-the-counter medicines and I understand the concerns about regulations which the DEA has proposed to control the illicit diversion of pseudoephedrine to make methamphetamine. I intend to work with these groups over the coming weeks to ensure that the 37 million Americans who rely on these products continue to have access to them.  We are creating an informal advisory group comprised of executives of chemical manufacturers and supply house companies, DEA officials, and other law enforcement agencies to devise strategies to see that this law is responsibly and sensibly enforced.  This bill includes a sense-of-the-Congress resolution supporting efforts for global chemical control.  The point is that many chemicals used to make methamphetamine, such as ephedrine, are tightly controlled in the United States but are literally smuggled into the United States through countries with little or no control, like Mexico. This legislation would express the sense of the Congress that ephedrine-producing countries should require approval from the Mexican Government for shipments of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine to Mexico, where they then come into this country.  I am very pleased, Mr. President, that this is a bipartisan effort. I am delighted to have the cosponsorship of Senators Grassley and Kyl. I note that this bill is also being introduced in the House today by Congressman Riggs and Congressman Vic Fazio.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1607       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Methamphetamine Control Act      of 1996''.     SEC. 2. REGULATION OF CHEMICAL SUPPLY HOUSES.       Section 310 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C.      830) is amended by adding at the end the following new      subsection:       ``(d)(1) Any chemical supply house that sells a listed      chemical, after having been provided a warning under      paragraph (2) within the previous 10 years, to a person who      uses, or intends or attempts to use, the listed chemical, or      causes the listed chemical to be used or attempted to be      used, to manufacture or produce methamphetamine shall--       ``(A) be subject to a civil penalty of not more than      $250,000; or       ``(B) for the second violation of this subsection, be      ordered to cease the production and sale of any chemicals.       ``(2) The Attorney General, acting through the      Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, shall      provide a written warning to each chemical supply house that      violates paragraph (1).       ``(3) For purposes of this subsection, the term `chemical      supply house' means any manufacturer, wholesaler, or      retailer, who owns, or who represents the owner of, any      operation or business enterprise engaging in regulated      transactions.       ``(4) All amounts received from enforcement of the civil      penalty under paragraph (1) shall be used by the      Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency for the      environmental cleanup of clandestine laboratories used, or      intended or attempted to be used, to manufacture      methamphetamine.''.     SEC. 3. INCREASED PENALTIES FOR POSSESSION AND DISTRIBUTION                    OF LISTED CHEMICALS.

Section 403(d) of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C.      843(d)) is amended--       (1) by striking ``(d) Any person'' and inserting ``(d)(1)      Except as provided in paragraph (2), any person''; and       (2) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:       ``(2) Any person who, with the intent to manufacture      methamphetamine, violates subsection (a) (6) or (7), shall be      sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not more than 10      years, a fine of not more than $30,000, or both.''.     SEC. 5. REGULATION OF PSEUDOEPHEDRINE.       Section 102(39)(A)(iv) of the Controlled Substances Act (21      U.S.C. 802(3(9)(A)(iv)) is amended by striking ``ephedrine''      each place it appears and inserting ``ephedrine or      pseudoephedrine,''.     SEC. 6. ADDITION OF SUBSTANCES TO DEFINITION OF LISTED                    CHEMICALS.

SEC. 7. SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS TO CONTROL DRUGS.       It is the sense of the Congress that--       (1) the rise in manufacture and usage of the illegal      narcotic methamphetamine is of major concern to the United      States;       (2) a substantial portion of the ephedrine used to make      methamphetamine is smuggled across the United States-Mexico      border;       (3) the countries of China, India, the Czech Republic,      Germany, and Slovenia are the largest manufacturers of      ephedrine and pseudoephedrine;       (4) one means of preventing the international diversion of      ephedrine and pseudoephedrine is the letter of nonobjection,      which requires that the government of a country receiving a      shipment of the chemical is aware of and approves the      shipment, the quantity involved, the company receiving the      shipment, and the ultimate use of the chemical;       (5) therefore, all ephedrine and pseudoephedrine producing      countries should require letters of nonobjection from the      Mexican government before exporting ephedrine or      pseudoephedrine to that country; and       (6) all ephedrine and pseudoephedrine producing countries      and Mexico should cooperate in any way possible to deter the      smuggling of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine into the United      States.
