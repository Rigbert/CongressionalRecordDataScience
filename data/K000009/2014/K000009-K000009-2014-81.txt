Chairman, I am pleased to offer this amendment regarding opportunities for small businesses on behalf of our able and dedicated colleague from Texas, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, who had to return to Texas on very important official business this evening, and she is airbound, I believe, at this point. I am honored to offer it on her behalf.  Essentially, the amendment increases funding for the Department of Energy's Office of Economic Impact and Diversity by a minimal amount of $500,000 offset by a reduction of like amount in funding for the Energy Information Administration. This amendment increases funding for the Department's Office of Minority Impact, which should be used to enhance the Department's engagement with minority programs and other related activities.  The Office of Economic Impact and Diversity is really a credit to Secretary of Energy Moniz's holistic view of diversity, which recognizes that participation via equal access is critical to our commitment to ensuring that the Department works for all Americans, particularly to improve the lives of low-income and minority communities, as well as our environment at large.  Twenty years ago, on February 11, 1994, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12898, directing Federal agencies to identify and address the disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects of their actions on minority and low-income populations.  We need to highlight the Office of Economic Impact and Diversity in theOffice of Economic Impact and Diversity because STEM education--science, technology, engineering, and math education--has become a real calling card.  The Department of Energy seeks to provide equal access in these opportunities for underrepresented groups in STEM, including minorities, Native Americans, and women.  Mr. Chairman, women and minorities make up 70 percent of college students but only 45 percent of undergraduates that are STEM degree holders. That is really quite a startling statistic. The women and minorities comprise 70 percent of college students. Only 45 percent of them that are undergraduates are STEM degree holders. That is almost a 2-to-1 ratio.  This large pool of untapped talent is a great potential source of STEM professionals. As the Nation's demographics are shifting and now most children under the age of 1 are minorities, it is critical that we take and close the gap in the number of minorities who seek STEM opportunities. I applaud the Secretary's commitment, which will increase the Nation's economic competitiveness and enable more of our people to realize their full potential and America's full potential.  Mr. Chairman, there are still a great many scientific riddles left to be solved, and perhaps one of these days a minority engineer or biologist will come up with the solutions. The larger point is that we need to make more STEM educators and more minorities to qualify for them and to make this country fully representative.  The funding provided by this amendment will help ensure that members of underrepresented communities are not placed at a disadvantage when it comes to environmental sustainability, preservation, and health. Through education about the importance of environmental sustainability, we can promote a broader understanding of science and how citizens can improve their surroundings. In community education efforts, working with teachers and students, they can also learn about radiation, radioactive waste management, and other related subjects. In fact, many of the communities that these individuals live in are places where environmental cleanup is so desperately needed based on the legacy costs of our nuclear programs, for example.  The Department of Energy places interns and volunteers from minority institutions into Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy programs. The Department of Energy also works to increase low-income and minority access to STEM fields and help students attain graduate degrees, as well as find employment.  The other offices within the Office of Economic Impact and Diversity are the Minority Business and Economic Development, the Minority Education and Community Development, Civil Rights Diversity and Inclusion, and the Council on Women and Girls and Minority Banks.                              {time}  1900  With the continuation of this kind of funding, we can increase diversity, provide clean energy options to our most underserved community, and help improve their environments, which will yield better health outcomes and greater public awareness. Most importantly, businesses will have more consumers with whom they may engage in related commercial activities.  We must help our low-income and minority communities and ensure equity for those who are the most vulnerable in our country.  I ask our colleagues to join me in support of the Kaptur amendment, by way of Sheila Jackson Lee's amendment, for the Office of Economic Impact and Diversity program.  I ask for the support of my colleagues, and I yield back the balance of my time.
