 President, CBO has told staff from both sides of the aisle, Republicans and Democrats, that the scoring of this amendment is the same as the scoring of the Ganske bill in the House, and they will be providing a written confirmation on this scoring to both of our staffs immediately. It could be imminent. We will present it and insert it into the Record as soon as we get it from CBO. It is going to be the same thing. CBO says to us that it is going to cost $85 million and it violates the Budget Act.
