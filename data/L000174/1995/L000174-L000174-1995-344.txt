President, if the Senator from Texas will yield just for a moment, I compliment the Senator from Vermont and the Senator from Massachusetts and others, the Senator from Wyoming, the distinguished chairman and others, who have worked closely, the Senator from Utah, the Senator from Rhode Island. I commend them very highly. It has been a very, very difficult time getting this far, and I hope we will see next year a chance to increase these funds once again. But I think it is absolutely essential we save these two endowments.
