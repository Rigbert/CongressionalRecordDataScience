I have an amendment with Senator Smith. I worked very closely with Senator Boxer to make some perfections on which she insisted. We are here to go with the queue so Senator Dodd's and Senator Schumer's interests are protected as well as others.  Perhaps we could be enlightened what it will take to get a queue so a bipartisan amendment such as ours can go forward.
