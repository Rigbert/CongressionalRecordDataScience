Mr. Speaker, since Roe v. Wade, there have been in excess of 42 million unborn children killed by the abortionists, through chemical poisoning, through dismemberment, and most of those are for socioeconomic reasons: Abortion on demand. The baby was unwanted therefore he or she was expendible.  What the abortion lobby is attempting to do is to expand the number of places where those children can be destroyed.  Our hope is that Members will vote for this rule. There will be a motion to recommit, there will be an up-or-down vote on a motion that is from the pro-abortion side. I would hope that Members would vote ``no'' on that motion to recommit and then vote ``yes'' on the Bilirakis bill.
