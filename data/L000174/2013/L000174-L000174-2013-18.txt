But I would think that if there are any two people in this body who could work out a program to get the votes set up and voted on it is the distinguished senior Senator from Michigan and the distinguished senior Senator from Oklahoma. I would hope and encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to listen to the Democratic and Republican leaders of this Committee, because I think they can probably work it out.  There has been a lot of discussion about the major rules change that occurred here today. In my capacity as President pro tempore, I was presiding during that time and did not get a chance to speak. I want to say a few things.  In the four decades I have served here, I have been here with both Democratic majorities and Republican majorities, through both Republican and Democratic administrations. We have had moments of crisis when I worried that our political differences outweighed the Senate's common responsibility. Yet we were always able to steer our way out of trouble. Majorities of both parties have come and gone, but I have never lost faith in our ability to see ourselves through the divisions and come together to do what is best for the Nation.  I have always believed in the Senate's unique protection of the minority party, even when Democrats held a majority in the Senate. When the minority has stood in the way of progress, I have defended their rights and held to my belief that the best traditions of the Senate would win out, that the 100 of us who stand in the shoes of over 310 million Americans would do the right thing. That is why I have always looked skeptically at efforts to change the Senate rules.  But in the past 5 years it has been discouraging. Ever since President Obama was elected, Senate Republicans have changed the tradition of the Senate, with escalating obstruction of nominations. They crossed the line from the use of the Senate rules to abuse of the Senate rules. In fact, the same abuse recently, and needlessly, shut down our government at a cost of billions of dollars to the taxpayers and billions of dollars to the private sector. I think it is a real threat to the independent, judicial branch of government.  As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I am worried that the Republican obstruction is damaging our ability to fulfill the Senate's unique constitutional responsibility of advice and consent to ensure that the judicial branch has the judges it needs to do its job.  Republicans have used these unprecedented filibusters--and they are unprecedented--more than at any time that I have served here. They have obstructed President Obama from appointing to the Federal bench even nominations that were supported by Republican Senators from the State from where the nominee came. They have forced cloture to end filibusters on 34 nominees, far more than we ever saw during President Bush's 8 years in office. Almost all of these nominees were, by any standard, noncontroversial and ultimately were confirmed overwhelmingly. In fact, Republicanobstruction has left the Federal judiciary with 90 or more vacancies during the past 5 years.  Take for example the Republican filibuster of a judicial nominee to the Tenth Circuit, Robert Bacharach last year, despite the support of the Republican Senators from Oklahoma. This marked a new and damaging milestone. Never before had the Senate filibustered and refused to vote on a judicial nominee with such strong bipartisan support, and who was voted out of the Judiciary Committee with virtually unanimous support. Republicans continued to block Senate action on the Bacharach nomination through the end of last Congress and forced his nomination to be returned without action to the President. There is no good reason--none--why Robert Bacharach was not confirmed to serve the people of Oklahoma and the Tenth Circuit as a Federal judge last year. He was finally confirmed this year unanimously.  Republicans last year also filibustered William Kayatta, another consensus circuit nominee who had the support of both Republican home State Senators. Like Judge Bacharach, Mr. Kayatta received the ABA Standing Committee on the Federal judiciary's highest possible rating and had strong bipartisan support and unimpeachable credentials. The same also applies to Richard Taranto, whose nomination was returned to the President at the end of last year after Republicans blocked action on his nomination to a vacancy on the Federal Circuit for more than eight months, despite no opposition in the Senate and despite the support of both Paul Clement and the late Robert Bork. Neither of these nominees faced any real opposition. Yet Republicans stalled both of them through the end of last Congress and forced their nomination to be returned without action to the President. They were both confirmed this year with overwhelming bipartisan support.  Senate Republicans used to insist that the filibustering of judicial nominations was unconstitutional. The Constitution has not changed, but as soon as President Obama took office Republicans reversed course. It struck me, because the very first--the very first--nominee to the Federal bench that President Obama sent here was filibustered. Judge Hamilton of Indiana was a widely-respected 15-year veteran of the Federal bench nominated to the Seventh Circuit. President Obama reached out to the longest-serving Republican in the Senate, Senator Dick Lugar, to select a nominee he supported. Yet, Senate Republicans filibustered his nomination, requiring a cloture vote before his nomination could be confirmed after a delay of seven months.  It is almost a case of saying: Okay, Mr. President, you think you got elected? We are going to show you who is boss. We are going to treat you differently than all of the Presidents before you.  This has never been done before, to filibuster the President's very first nominee. Somehow this President is going to be told he is different than other Presidents.  Senate Republicans have obstructed and delayed nearly every circuit court nominee of this President, filibustering 14 of them. They abused the Senate's practices and procedures to delay confirmation of Judge Albert Diaz of North Carolina to the Fourth Circuit for 11 months, before he was confirmed by voice vote. They delayed confirmation of Judge Jane Stranch of Tennessee to the Sixth Circuit for 10 months before she was confirmed 71 to 21. Senate Republicans used procedural tactics to delay for months the Senate confirmation of nominations with the strong support of Republican home State Senators--including Judge Scott Matheson of Utah to the Tenth Circuit; Judge James Wynn, Jr. of North Carolina to the Fourth Circuit; Judge Henry Floyd of South Carolina to the Fourth Circuit; Judge Adalberto Jordan of Florida to the Eleventh Circuit; Judge Beverly Martin of Georgia to the Eleventh Circuit; Judge Mary Murguia of Arizona to the Ninth Circuit; Judge Bernice Donald of Tennessee to the Sixth Circuit; Judge Thomas Vanaskie of Pennsylvania to the Third Circuit; Judge Andrew Hurwitz of Arizona to the Ninth Circuit; Judge Morgan Christen of Alaska to the Ninth Circuit; and Judge Stephen Higginson of Louisiana to the Fifth Circuit.  The results are clear and devastating. The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service has reported that the median time circuit nominees had to wait before a Senate vote has skyrocketed from 18 days for President Bush's nominees during his first term in office to 132 days for President Obama's nominees during his first term in office. This is the result of Republican obstruction and abuse of Senate rules. In most cases, Senate Republicans have delayed and stalled without explanation. How do you explain the filibuster of the nomination of Judge Barbara Keenan of Virginia to the Fourth Circuit who was ultimately confirmed 99 to 0? And how else do you explain the needless obstruction of Judge Denny Chin of New York to the Second Circuit, who was filibustered for four months before he was confirmed 98 to 0?  In 2012, Senate Republicans refused to consent to a vote on a single circuit court nominee until the majority leader filed cloture, even for nominees with home State Republican support like Adalberto Jordan of Florida--strongly supported by Senator Rubio--and Andrew Hurwitz of Arizona, strongly supported by Senator Kyl. They blocked the Senate from voting on a single circuit court nominee nominated by President Obama last year. Since 1980, the only other Presidential election year in which there were no circuit nominees confirmed who was nominated that same year was in 1996, when Senate Republicans shut down the process against President Clinton's circuit nominees.  In the 8 years George W. Bush served as President, only five of his district court nominees received any opposition on the floor. That was over 8 years. In just 5 years, 42 of President Obama's district court nominees have faced opposition. The majority leader had to file cloture on 20 of them. Federal district court judges are the trial court judges who hear cases from litigants across the country and preside over Federal criminal trials, applying the law to facts and helping settle legal disputes. They handle the vast majority of the caseload of the Federal courts and are critical to making sure our courts remain available to provide a fair hearing for all Americans. Nominations to fill these critical positions, whether made by a Democratic or Republican President, have always been considered with deference to the home State Senators who know the nominees and their States best, and have been confirmed quickly with that support. Never before in the Senate's history have we seen district court nominees blocked for months and opposed for no good reason. Many are needlessly stalled and then confirmed virtually unanimously with no explanation for the obstruction. Senate Republicans have politicized even these traditionally non-partisan positions.  As chairman of the Judiciary Committee I have always acted fairly and consistently whether the President has been a Democrat or a Republican. I have not filibustered nominees with bipartisan support. I have steadfastly protected the rights of the minority and I have done so despite criticism from Democrats. I have only proceeded with judicial nominations supported by both home State Senators. I will put my record of consistent fairness up against that of any chairman and never acted as some Republican chairmen have acted in blatantly disregarding evenhanded practices to ram through the ideological nominations of President George W. Bush.  Regrettably, the answer to my fairness and to my commitment to protecting the rights of the minority has been unprecedented and meritless obstruction. Even though President Obama has nominated qualified, mainstream lawyers, Republicans in the Senate have done away with regular order, imposing unnecessary and damaging delays. Until 2009, judicial nominees reported by the Judiciary Committee with bipartisan support were generally confirmed quickly. That has changed, with district nominations taking over four times longer and circuit court nominees over seven times longer than it took to confirm them during the Bush administration. Until 2009, we observed regular order and usually confirmed four to six nominees per week, and we cleared the Senate Executive Calendar before long recesses. Since then, Senate Republicans have refused to clear the calendar and slowed us down to a snail's pace. Until 2009, if a nominee was filibustered, itwas almost always because of a substantive issue with the nominee's record. We know what has happened since 2009--Republicans have required cloture to consider even those nominees later confirmed unanimously.  This obstruction was not merely a product of extreme partisanship in a Presidential election year--it has been a constant and across the board practice since President Obama took office. At the end of each calendar year, Senate Republicans have deliberately refused to vote on several judicial nominees just to take up more time the following year. At the end of 2009 Republicans denied 10 nominations pending on the Executive Calendar a vote. The following year, it took 9 months for the Senate to take action on 8 of them. At the end of 2010 and 2011, Senate Republicans left 19 nominations on the Senate Executive Calendar, taking up nearly half the following year for the Senate to confirm them. Last year they blocked 11 judicial nominees from votes, and refused to expedite consideration of others who already had hearings.  The effects of this obstruction have been clear. When the Senate adjourned last year, Senate Republicans had blocked more than 40 of President Obama's circuit and district nominees from being confirmed in his first term. That obstruction has led to a damagingly high level of judicial vacancies persisting for over four years.  This year, Senate Republicans reached a new depth of pure partisanship. They have decided to shut down the confirmation process altogether for an entire court--the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, even though there are three vacancies on that court. Senate Republicans attempt to justify their opposition to filling any of the three vacancies on the DC Circuit with an argument that the court's caseload does not warrant the appointments.  We all know that this ploy is a transparent attempt to prevent a Democratic President from appointing judges to this important court. We all know what has happened here in the DC Circuit. In 2003, the Senate unanimously confirmed John Roberts by voice vote as the 9th judge on the DC Circuit at a time when the caseload was lower than it is today. He was confirmed unanimously. No Democrat, no Republican opposed him. Not a single Senate Republican raised any concerns about whether the caseload warranted his confirmation and during the Bush administration they voted to confirm four judges to the DC Circuit--giving the court a total of 11 judges in active service.  Today there are only eight judges on the court; yet, when Patricia Millett was nominated to that exact same seat by President Obama, a woman with just as strong qualifications as John Roberts--they both had great qualifications--she was filibustered. Some say we should not call that a double standard. Well, I am not sure what else one might call it. We also should not be comparing the DC Circuit's caseload with that of other circuits, as Republicans have recently done. The DC Circuit is often understood to be the second most important court in the land because of the complex administrative law cases that it handles. The court reviews complicated decisions and rulemakings of many Federal agencies, and in recent years has handled some of the most important terrorism and enemy combatant and detention cases since the attacks of September 11, 2001. Comparing the DC Circuit's caseload to other circuits is a false comparison, and those who are attempting to make this comparison are not being fully forthcoming with the American public. Years ago, one of the senior most Republican Senators on the Judiciary Committee said this:       [C]omparing workloads in the DC Circuit to that of other      circuits is, to a large extent, a pointless exercise. There      is little dispute that the DC Circuit's docket is, by far,      the most complex and time consuming in the Nation.  Now, however, that same Senator has engaged in the precise pointless exercise he once railed against.  This is an unprecedented level of obstruction. I have seen substantive arguments mounted against judicial nominees, but I have never seen a full blockade against every single nominee to a particular court, regardless of the individual's qualifications. Republicans attempted to take this type of hardline stance with certain executive positions last year and earlier this year, when they refused to allow a vote for any nominee to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the National Labor Relations Board. Rather than representing substantive opposition to these individual nominees, this obstruction was a partisan attempt to sabotage and eviscerate these agencies which protect consumers and American workers. I have heard some call this tactic ``nullification.'' It is as if the Republicans have decided that the President did not actually win the election in 2008, and was not re-elected in 2012.  Senate Republicans backed off this radical and unprecedented hardline stance on executive nominees earlier this year, but they have shown no signs of doing the same with the DC Circuit. And it is not for lack of qualified nominees. This year, Senate Republicans filibustered the nominations of three exceptionally qualified women: Caitlin Halligan, Patricia Millett and Nina Pillard. Earlier this week Republicans filibustered another stellar nominee to this court, Judge Robert Wilkins.  I am a lawyer. I have tried cases in Federal courts. I have argued cases in Federal courts of appeal. I always went into those courts knowing I could look at that Federal judge and say: It doesn't make any difference whether I am a Democrat or a Republican, whether I represent the plaintiff or the defendant; this is an impartial court.  If we play political games with our Federal judiciary, how long are the American people going to trust the impartiality of our Federal courts? At what point do these games start making people think maybe this is not an independent judiciary? If that day comes, the United States will have given up one of its greatest strengths.  Let's go back to voting on judges based on their merit--and not on whether they were nominated by a Democratic President or a Republican President. Let's stop holding President Obama to a different standard than any President before him--certainly no President since I have been in the Senate, and I began with President Gerald Ford.  This obstruction is not just bad for the Senate, it is also a disaster for our Nation's overburdened courts. Persistent vacancies force fewer judges to take on growing caseloads, and make it harder for Americans to have access to justice. While they have delayed and obstructed, the number of judicial vacancies has remained historically high and it has become more difficult for our courts to provide speedy, quality justice for the American people. In short, as a result of Republican obstruction of nominees, the Senate has failed to do its job for the courts and for the American people, and failed to live up to its constitutional responsibilities. That is why the Senate today was faced with what to do to overcome this abuse and what action to take to restore this body's ability to fulfill its constitutional duties and do its work for the American people.                          ____________________
