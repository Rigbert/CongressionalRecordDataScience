President, it is my intention this evening to spend a few minutes to lay the amendment down and then I presume at the end of the evening, with unanimous consent, I will be given at least an hour of debate tomorrow which I will share with Senators McCain, Hagel, and others. That is my understanding. I ask the Senator from Virginia if that understanding is correct.
