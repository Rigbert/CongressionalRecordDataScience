 Yet the Democratic plan now being rushed through the Senate would do just the opposite. It would force millions of Americans off their health care plans and bury our Nation deeper and deeper in debt.  Democrats have repeatedly and incorrectly declared that under their plan Americans who like their current insurance will be able to keep it. This morning, I would like to explain why that is, unfortunately, not the case.  Just last week, the independent Congressional Budget Office said that the incomplete Democratic HELP Committee proposal would cause 10 million Americans who currently have employer-based insurance to lose that coverage. Let me repeat that. Before the Democratic bill is even complete, we know that it will cause 10 million Americans to lose their health care insurance they currently have. But 10 million would just be the beginning. One key section missing from the HELP bill is the government plan Democrats say they want, and according to one study, 119 million Americans could lose their private coverage if a government plan is enacted.  Here is why this so-called government option would lead to Americans losing their current plans and why it would soon become the only option.  First, a government-run plan would have unlimited access to taxpayer dollars and could operate at a loss indefinitely, which could force private insurers out of business. Private health plans simply wouldn't be able to compete, and millions of Americans could be forced off their health plans whether they like it or not. At that point, people would have to enroll in a government plan or any surviving private health care plan, if they could afford it. I say if they could afford it because another unintended consequence of creating a government plan is that it would cause rates for private health plans to skyrocket, leaving most Americans unable to afford them.
