President, a remarkable Vermonter has reached a remarkable milestone. Enid Wonnacott of Huntington, VT, deserves our thanks for and recognition of her more than 30 years of agricultural leadership in Vermont and the Nation.  Enid has led the Northeast Organic Farming Association of Vermont, NOFA-VT, since 1987. Her early leadership of NOFA coincided with my chairmanship of the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry. Enid was a constant source of counsel to me about the importance and unlimited potential of organic agriculture for Vermont and the Nation, and she was a strong advocate and adviser as I worked to make the National Organic Standards Act a part of the 1990 farm bill. This is the law that authorized the national organic standards and labeling program, ushering in the remarkable and still-burgeoning growth of America's thriving organic sector.  Since that time, Vermont continues to be a leader in our country's now $60 billion annual organic industry. To this day, I continue to look to Enid for advice on organic agriculture and nutrition issues. Enid Wonnacott's many accomplishments are presented in a profile published in ``Seven Days'' in Vermont on October 30, 2018. I ask unanimous consent for the profile to be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [Seven Days Vermont, October 30, 2018]          Longtime OrganicAg Leader Enid Wonnacott Steps Down                          (By Melissa Pasanen)        Enid Wonnacott has tallied many accomplishments over 30-     plus years as executive director of the Northeast Organic      Farming Association of Vermont. In 1987, her 10-hour-per-week      job came with one filing cabinet and a milk crate filled with      paperwork. Since then, Wonnacott has built the nonprofit into      a 20-person team supported by a $2.8 million budget. NOFA-VT      has had an impact not only on Vermont agriculture but      nationwide.        Wonnacott started at the association the same year that      Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) became chair of the Senate      agriculture committee. The two worked closely on developing      the National Organic Program, which eventually led to the      creation of the U.S. Department of Agriculture organic seal      in 2002.        ``Enid has been one of the most effective advocates for      organic agriculture in the entire country,'' Leahy told Seven      Days via email, acknowledging that the road was long and that      challenges continue. ``Through all of this, as a leader, Enid      has been patient but persistent and always a clear-eyed      problem solver. I have often looked for Enid's help on      difficult policy challenges,'' Leahy added, ``and she has      never been reluctant to let me know exactly what needs doing      to support and strengthen organic agriculture.''        ``This is recognition of her role as guardian and voice of      the organic movement,'' Ross said. ``It also recognizes the      evolution of organic as a significant and meaningful part of      our economy in Vermont and the economy nationally.''        Under Wonnacott's guidance, NOFA-VT has become the go-to      resource for organic farmers and gardeners, agricultural      advocates, and locavores for everything from technical      production assistance to comprehensive lists of farmers      markets and CSAs. There were fewer than 50 organic producers      in 1987; now NOFA-VT certifies more than 700. Its robust      farm-to-school partnership, subsidized farm shares and other      efforts work to broaden access to local and organic food.        The nonprofit's mobile pizza oven, though, is probably the      most vivid symbol of Wonnacott's unique contributions: She      embodies the warm heart of Vermont's organic agriculture      movement, pulling community together around organic food and      the farmers who produce it.        ``I love that whole program and initiative as much as      anything we do,'' Wonnacott said, after smoothly maneuvering      the oven into Burlington's Intervale on a September      afternoon. Later that day, she headed up a team of volunteers      and Intervale Center employees to bake pizzas for an event,      hands in the dough, laughing and hugging longtime friends who      stopped by.        Launched in 2006, the portable pizza oven fulfilled a      vision Wonnacott had for gathering people around food in a      way that fostered connection and conversation. ``I'm      passionate about community building,'' she explained. ``I      think people need and seek community.''        Particularly in the early days, freshly baked pizza helped      raise NOFA-VT's profile with consumers and farmers. The      copper-domed, wood-fired oven on a trailer has logged      thousands of miles and produced thousands of pizzas at events      such as farmers markets and young-farmer socials.        Since Wonnacott's cancer diagnosis in 2014, working the      oven has also provided a personal benefit. ``It's such a      physical, present thing to do, especially when you have chemo      brain,'' she said. ``To get out and see people is a really      healthy thing for me.''        People who have worked with Wonnacott say her positive      energy and balanced approach have been both anchor and beacon      through the hard work of building a movement.        Mara Hearst, now a sheep farmer in Dorset, was 19 when she      first met Wonnacott, who invited her to become a student      representative on the NOFA-VT board. Hearst said Wonnacott's      consistent message as a leader and mentor has been: ``We need      to make change, and there's a shitload to do, but let's take      time to be a community together.''        ``After hours, she's the first one to turn on the music      and get everyone dancing,'' said NOFA-NY board member      Elizabeth Henderson. When she was founding president of NOFA-     Mass., Henderson was on the committee that originally hired      Wonnacott for the Vermont chapter. ``It's one of the things      I'm proudest of,'' she said.        The agricultural landscape has changed dramatically since      Wonnacott became the nonprofit's third executive director at      age 26, fresh out of graduate school.        According to the Organic Trade Association, organic food      sales in the U.S. hit $45.2 billion in 2017 and accounted for      5.5 percent of all food sold. Twenty years ago, OTA's first      published sales figure was $3.4 billion.        The USDA National Organic Program helped propel growth.      However, its integrity has been questioned over the past      couple of years based on media coverage of probable standards      noncompliance by large organic dairy and egg operations.      Investigation also revealed that some organic imports were      receiving fraudulent certifications. Then the USDA withdrew      approved, strengthened organic animal-welfare standards,      though they had not yet been enforced.        After her initial diagnosis but before her cancer spread,      Wonnacott had planned to retire in 2021, when NOFA-VT will      turn 50. ``But it's also a good time now,'' she said. ``I      recognize there are a lot of changes to the organic industry,      challenges to organic integrity. I think there's a need for      really strong leadership, someone who has the energy I had      when I started.'' After a pause she added, ``I don't have the      fight anymore, just my love and appreciation for this      movement. I want it to be shepherded by somebody with a lot      of health and energy right now.''        Wonnacott's deep passion for agriculture was seeded while      growing up on her family's Weybridge homestead. Her mother      was dean of students at Middlebury College. Her father died      of cancer when Wonnacott, the youngest of three sisters, was      16. She spent a lot of time on a neighboring dairy farm,      showed livestock at the fair and worked with a large animal      veterinarian.        At St. Lawrence University in New York State, Wonnacott      studied biology and chemistry and first learned about organic      agriculture. She relief-milked for a nearby organic dairy and      read Wendell Berry's 1977 classic, The Unsettling of America:      Culture & Agriculture. ``You know when you read a book and      you're like, Oh, my God. This is what's in my head,'' she      recalled.        During a semester in Kenya, Wonnacott learned how to treat      cobra bites and hand-milk a 70-cow herd. Kenyan agriculture      was organic ``by default,'' she said. ``There was money to      supply inputs, but no one knew what to do with them. I saw      huge piles of imported chemical fertilizer next to broken-     down tractors.'' As graduation neared, Wonnacott applied to      veterinary school and, at her mother's suggestion, for a      yearlong Thomas J. Watson Fellowship to study alternative      agriculture. ``My mom was a really strong role model as far      as `women can do anything,' '' Wonnacott said. ``She      supported what was in my heart.''        She won the fellowship and worked on organic farms in New      Zealand, Nepal, Norway and England; the experience was      pivotal. ``It was an agricultural system that made common      sense to me, a culture of preventative management and health      for the soil, the plants and the animals,'' Wonnacott said.      ``I wanted to know, Why does the world not farm this way?''        Back in the U.S., she taught biology and environmental      education and became an organic certification inspector      before pursuing graduate studies at UVM.'' I had to figure      out why the world works the way it does,'' she said. ``How      does our agriculture policy influence other countries? How do      supply, demand and financial systems work?'' For her thesis,      Wonnacott interviewed organic farmers about the role of      policy in effecting     change. ``In the end, I felt like it's all about grassroots--     that was where change was going to come from,'' she said.        When Wonnacott landed the job at NOFA-VT shortly after      finishing school, she built on her thesis contacts to launch      that grassroots effort. In the mid-'80s, Wonnacott recalled,      ``organic was really the underground.'' Farmers told her they      didn't label produce organic because customers would assume      it had worms. ``People thought it was just hippies playing      around,'' she said. ``It wasn't respected.''        Her goal, Wonnacott said, was to raise the status of the      movement and provide support to farmers in the pre-internet      age. She also prioritized developing a farmer-driven organic      certification program with lengthy discussions to hash out      standards. ``For me, fascinated by movement building, by how      groups make decisions, these were really amazing meetings,''      Wonnacott said.        Jack Lazor of Butterworks Farm in Westfield met Wonnacott      when she was a graduate student and worked helping to deliver      the farm's yogurt to stores. He was part of the first      community forum she later led in her new NOFA-VT role. ``She      did it all at the beginning,'' Lazor said. ``She built this      thing up through goodwill and positive forces. She's a force,      but a gentle force.'' At the time, organic standards were not      consistent state to state, and Wonnacott soon found herself      at the center of a sea change.        Organic was growing rapidly, she recalled: ``Sen. Leahy      came to me. There was a lot of interest from California to      create a level playing field for interstate trade. He wanted      to know, `What does Vermont think of this?' '' Wonnacott and      other organic pioneers were both nervous and hopeful about      federal involvement. ``It's hard when you've been an underdog      not to be totally wowed by the attention and money for      research and organic support,'' she said. It soon became      clear, she said, that a national organic program ``was going      to move forward with or without us and we had to put our      energy into making it the best it could be.''        Pragmatism is a Wonnacott hallmark, according to Megan      Camp, vice president and program director at Shelburne Farms.      The two women served together on a statewide council      alongside diverse agriculture community representatives.      Tension would occasionally arise, Camp acknowledged: ``Some      people would pound the table, point fingers. Enid would make      the same argument firmly, but always listening, able to hear      multiple perspectives.''        Wonnacott believes strongly that it doesn't help to label      types of farming as ``good'' or ``bad.'' But she recognizes      that her approach has disappointed some. ``We're a really      inclusive organization, and that's been really important to      me,'' she said. ``We want to move all farmers along the      sustainability spectrum, never be organic elitist, never say      this is the only way you can farm. ``It's been a conflict for      some staff and some board members over the years,      absolutely,'' Wonnacott continued.        This was particularly evident when the local food movement      gathered momentum, sometimes at the expense of organic. ``Our      tagline has been, `Certified organic, locally grown'--you      don't have to choose,'' she said. But in practice, consumers      and farmers set their own priorities. For example, Wonnacott      explained, if one local farmer sells eggs from free-range      hens but also feeds them GMO grain and customers think that's      good enough, how can the local organic farmer charge the      premium price that's needed to cover expensive, non-GMO      grain?        Wonnacott is playing the long game. She believes that      collaboration and mutual support are critical to sustaining      agriculture in Vermont and nudging more farmers toward      organic practices. ``I believe we can be both a movement      builder and a bridge builder,'' she said. ``It's allowed us      to be at the table for a lot of really important      conversations, and I think it was pivotal in my hall of fame      award.''        Andy Jones, manager of Burlington's Intervale Community      Farm and former NOFA-VT board president, believes ``the big      tent'' has served the agricultural community well. Early on,      he noted, Wonnacott saw the benefit of offering technical      assistance to conventional dairies that were exploring a      transition to organic. She recognized that farm-to-school      programs could provide markets for local and organic farmers      and also teach new generations to appreciate the food. ``She      always wanted to build the answer ``to any problem, said      Jones. She sought ``ways to build the ag community, the rural      community. She knows Vermont is stronger when everyone is      successful.''        Wonnacott understands that her successor will face      challenges. NOFA-VT membership is stagnant at about 1,200      members, and this year's winter conference attendance was      down across NOFA state chapters. The USDA organic integrity      issues have provoked fractures within the organic community,      along with public confusion and distrust.'' I fear for the      future of organic, the splintering that's taking place,'' she      admitted.        Wonnacott is also concerned that new farmers don't see a      need to be certified, noting that Vermont is about to see a      huge land shift and transition between generations. ``I      really want beginning farmers to feel there's value in this      movement,'' she said. ``We need a really strong beginning-     farmer wave to replace the pioneering farmers.''        It's fitting in some ways that Wonnacott is navigating a      transition while also helping many of the farmers with whom      she started her career navigate their own. She has co-     facilitated two meetings with the old guard. ``It's like deep      therapy for all of us,'' she said with a chuckle. ``These are      the farmers who really inspired me. I wanted to do everything      I could to make their farms and their lives successful. That      drive has carried me through, and I could have done it for      another 30 years.''        After she steps down in the spring, Wonnacott will stay      involved in other ways. She's training to become an organic      inspector and will do that part time. She will also help out      during the pizza-oven season. But mostly, Wonnacott will      focus on her health, her family--husband Harry Frank and      their two grown children--and their Huntington homestead.        It's no surprise, though, that Wonnacott has not stopped      dreaming up new, creative ways to support her passions. ``One      of my favorite things to do is long-distance walking,'' she      said, explaining that she has solo-walked trails around the      world, most recently Ireland's Dingle Way. Wonnacott      envisions a statewide farm-to-farm walk to raise awareness of      organic agriculture and community. The Vermont walk would not      be a solo endeavor, however. With her signature warm smile      Wonnacott said, ``I have a great vision of hundreds of people      joining me to walk for the cause.''                          ____________________
