And yet I hear, and I understand, that despite the protestations of this administration and the tens and hundreds of billions of dollars at their disposal, that they may not have the proper equipment, that they may not have the flak vests that will stop an AK047 bullet. They may not have the armored HUM-V's that they may need. They may not even have the desert camouflage.  So I suggest that maybe those members of this administration who are waxing so eloquent about how things are going, maybe they should go over there and wear forest green camouflage instead of desert camouflage, wear a Vietnam-era flak vest and ride in a HUM-V with canvas windows and plexiglas around the country, not in their super-armored Suburbans, air conditioned, state-of-the-art, surrounded by helicopters and everything else and then come back and say how great things are.  Go over there and experience what our young men and women are experiencing over there, and maybe they will come back a little bit humbled, and maybe they will want to do a little bit more to resolve this, to safeguard our men and women and to resolve this situation, honestly, as opposed to spinning and spinning and spinning.  These people are never wrong, never wrong, no matter what. You can go back and find 15 misstatements. They can be off by $100 billion and a couple of hundred American lives, but they were not wrong. They are never wrong.
