 President, I rise today to honor the memory of the heroic men and women of California law enforcement who have given their lives in the line of duty protecting the people of the Golden State.  This week, as part of National Police Week, the names of 35 peace officers from California are being added to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial here in Washington D.C. Seventeen of those officers lost their lives this past year.  We all know of the dangers faced on a daily basis by police officers, sheriff's deputies, and members of the highway patrol. Unfortunately, too many officers make the ultimate sacrifice in the course of doing their job: ensuring the safety and security of our homes, roads, and neighborhoods.  It is with the utmost respect for these fallen heroes and the loss suffered by their loved ones that I ask that their names be printed in the Congressional Record, along with the community they served. We owe these men and women a great deal. Please join me in honoring them.  The list follows.       Oscar A. Beaver--(8/6/1892) Tulare County Sheriff's Office.
