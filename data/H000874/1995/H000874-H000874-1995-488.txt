Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the tragic events leading to the deaths of over 1.5 million Armenians. I join millions around the world in vowing, once again, to ensure that our generation and future generations never again have to bear witness to such inhuman behavior and feel the pain and suffering of an entire people.  We had hoped that the crime of genocide would never again be allowed to mar the history of humankind.  Yet today as we stand with our Armenian brothers and sisters to remember and share in their grief for those who died from 1915 to 1923, we are all reminded of the ongoing genocide in Bosnia today in 1995, where we too, share in the people of Bosnia's anguish.  Let us also today be reminded, as Americans, of the freedoms we enjoy but so often take for granted.  [[Page H4502]] We must remember that only too often has this disrespect for the most basic of our human rights--the right to speak, to worship, and to believe as one pleases--led to the deaths of millions in the Holocausts of this century. We must continue to hold vigil for those who have perished so that the rights of all humanity will be protected in the future.  Finally, I am pleased to stand here today to pay tribute to the Armenian people. Armenia is a land composed largely of rock and stone, hewn out of the earth by 1 million years of evolution and left to its people as the basis of construction of one of the world's oldest and richest civilizations.  The people of Armenia, like the stone out of which they have built their history, are a strong and lasting people, a people who have withstood the onslaught of tragedy. Because of the resilience of the Armenian people, they will continue to enrich our world with their creativity and tradition.
