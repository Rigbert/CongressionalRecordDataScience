President, absent Senate action, at midnight tonight, this Senate will make one of the biggest mistakes in surveillance policy in years and years. Without a single congressional hearing, without a shred of meaningful public input, without any opportunity for Senators to ask theirquestions in a public forum, one judge with one warrant would be able to authorize the hacking of thousands--possibly millions--of devices, cell phones, and tablets. This would come about through the adoption of an obscure rule of criminal procedure called rule 41. Rule 41 isn't something folks are talking about in coffee shops in Alaska, in Oregon, and in other parts of the country, but I am convinced Americans are sure going to come to Members of Congress if one of their hospitals--one of their crucial medical programs--is hacked by the government. It is a fact that one of the highest profile victims of cyber attacks are medical facilities, our hospitals.  The Justice Department has said this is no big deal. You basically ought to trust us. We are just going to take care of this. I will tell you, generally, changes to the Federal rules of procedure are designed for modest, almost housekeeping kinds of procedural changes, not major shifts in policies. When you are talking about these kinds of rules, they talk about who might receive a copy of a document in a bankruptcy proceeding. That is what the Rules Enabling Act was for. It wasn't for something that was sweeping, that was unprecedented, that could have calamitous ramifications for Americans the way government hacking would. As I have indicated, this would go forward without a chance for any Member of the Senate to formally weigh in.  The government says it can go forward with this rule 41 and conduct these massive hacks--large-scale hacks--without causing any collateral damage whatsoever and ensuring that Americans' rights are protected. Oddly enough--again, breaking with the way these matters are usually handled--the government will not tell the Congress or the American people how it would protect those rights or how it would prevent collateral damage or even how it would carry out these hacks. In effect, the policy is ``trust us.''  I think that right at the heart of our obligations is to do vigorous oversight. I always thought Ronald Reagan had a valid point when he said: You can trust but you ought to verify. That is especially important under this policy, where innocent Americans could be victimized twice--once by their hackers and a second time by their government.  We are going to have the opportunity to do something about it before this goes into effect in just over 12 hours. I want to emphasize that those of us who would like the chance for Members of Congress to weigh in and be heard--our concern has been bipartisan. Senator Coons. Senator Daines. We have worked in a bipartisan fashion on this for months.  This morning we are going to offer three unanimous consent requests to block or delay this particular change in order to make sure our colleagues have an opportunity to do what I think is Senate 101: to have a hearing and have a review that is bipartisan, where Senators get to ask questions, to be able to get public input in a meaningful kind of fashion.  I urge every Senator to think, and think carefully, before they prevent this body from performing the vigorous oversight Americans demand of Congress. That is right at the heart of what Senator Coons, Senator Daines, and I will be talking about. This rule change will give the government unprecedented authority to hack into Americans' personal phones, computers, and other devices. Frankly, I was concerned about this before the election, but we now know that the administration--it is a new administration--will be led by the individual who said he wanted the power to hack his political opponents the same way Russia does. These mass hacks could affect cell phones, desktop computers, traffic lights, not to mention a whole host of different areas. During these hacks and searches, there is a considerable chance that the hacked devices will be damaged or broken, and that would obviously be a significant matter. Don't take my word for it.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have an article that I wrote with renowned security experts Matt Blaze and Susan Landau printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                    [From Wired.com, Sept. 14, 2016]        The Feds Will Soon Be Able To Legally Hack Almost Anyone          (By Senator Ron Wyden, Matt Blaze and Susan Landau)       Digital devices and software programs are complicated.      Behind the pointing and clicking on screen are thousands of      processes and routines that make everything work. So when      malicious software--malware--invades a system, even seemingly      small changes to the system can have unpredictable impacts.       That's why it's so concerning that the Justice Department      is planning a vast expansion of government hacking. Under a      new set of rules, the FBI would have the authority to      secretly use malware to hack into thousands or hundreds of      thousands of computers that belong to innocent third parties      and even crime victims. The unintended consequences could be      staggering.       The new plan to drastically expand the government's hacking      and surveillance authorities is known formally as amendments      to Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, and      the proposal would allow the government to hack a million      computers or more with a single warrant. If Congress doesn't      pass legislation blocking this proposal, the new rules go      into effect on December 1. With just six work weeks remaining      on the Senate schedule and a long Congressional to-do list,      time is running out.       The government says it needs this power to investigate a      network of devices infected with malware and controlled by a      criminal--what's known as a ``botnet.'' But the Justice      Department has given the public far too little information      about its hacking tools and how it plans to use them. And the      amendments to Rule 41 are woefully short on protections for      the security of hospitals, life-saving computer systems, or      the phones and electronic devices of innocent Americans.       Without rigorous and periodic evaluation of hacking      software by independent experts, it would be nothing short of      reckless to allow this massive expansion of government      hacking.       If malware crashes your personal computer or phone, it can      mean a loss of photos, documents and records--a major      inconvenience. But if a hospital's computer system or other      critical infrastructure crashes, it puts lives at risk.      Surgical directives are lost. Medical histories are      inaccessible. Patients can wait hours for care. If critical      information isn't available to doctors, people could die.      Without new safeguards on the government's hacking authority,      the FBI could very well be responsible for this kind of      tragedy in the future.       No one believes the government is setting out to damage      victims' computers. But history shows just how hard it is to      get hacking tools right. Indeed, recent experience shows that      tools developed by law enforcement have actually been co-     opted and used by criminals and miscreants. For example, the      FBI digital wiretapping tool Carnivore, later renamed DCS      3000, had weaknesses (which were eventually publicly      identified) that made it vulnerable to spoofing by      unauthorized parties, allowing criminals to hijack legitimate      government searches. Cisco's Law Enforcement access      standards, the guidelines for allowing government wiretaps      through Cisco's routers, had similar weaknesses that security      researchers discovered.       The government will likely argue that its tools for going      after large botnets have yet to cause the kind of unintended      damage we describe. But it is impossible to verify that claim      without more transparency from the agencies about their      operations. Even if the claim is true, today's botnets are      simple, and their commands can easily be found online. So      even if the FBI's investigative techniques are effective      today, in the future that might not be the case. Damage to      devices or files can happen when a software program searches      and finds pieces of the botnet hidden on a victim's computer.      Indeed, damage happens even when changes are straightforward:      recently an anti-virus scan shut down a device in the middle      of heart surgery.       Compounding the problem is that the FBI keeps its hacking      techniques shrouded in secrecy. The FBI's statements to date      do not inspire confidence that it will take the necessary      precautions to test malware before deploying them in the      field. One FBI special agent recently testified that a tool      was safe because he tested it on his home computer, and it      ``did not make any changes to the security settings on my      computer.'' This obviously falls far short of the testing      needed to vet a complicated hacking tool that could be      unleashed on millions of devices.       Why would Congress approve such a short-sighted proposal?      It didn't. Congress had no role in writing or approving these      changes, which were developed by the US court system through      an obscure procedural process. This process was intended for      updating minor procedural rules, not for making major policy      decisions.       This kind of vast expansion of government mass hacking and      surveillance is clearly a policy decision. This is a job for      Congress, not a little-known court process.       If Congress had to pass a bill to enact these changes, it      almost surely would not pass as written. The Justice      Department may need new authorities to identify and search      anonymous computers linked to digital crimes. But this      package of changes is far too broad, with far too little      oversight or protections against collateral damage.       Congress should block these rule changes from going into      effect by passing the bipartisan, bicameral Stopping Mass      Hacking Act.     Americans deserve a real debate about the best way to update      our laws to address online threats.
