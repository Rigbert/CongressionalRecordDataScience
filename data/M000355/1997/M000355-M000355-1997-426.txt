 President, I wish to speak about S. 307, the Federal Surplus Property Donations Act introduced earlier in the week by Senators Lugar, Harkin, Leahy, and myself.  This legislation will enable food banks and other charities, which primarily serve low-income persons, to receive surplus Federal property such as computers, office furniture, copiers, warehouse equipment, and trucks. Items like these are often not available because of their expense. Such equipment can contribute to efficient and effective food bank operations.  I want to thank Second Harvest, Habitat for Humanity, and other major charities which serve needy families and children every day for their support of this legislation and their commitment in responding to hunger in our communities.  Mr. President, Second Harvest and Habitat for Humanity work with food banks serving all 50 States and Puerto Rico. In my home State of Kentucky, this legislation will assist Dare to Care Food Bank in Louisville, God's Pantry Food Bank in Lexington, and Kentucky Food Bank in Elizabethtown in accessing Federal surplus property.  This is a modest but important bill. It can make a real difference in the lives of those who are served by these valuable programs.  I urge my colleagues to support both this legislation and the food banks across the country that serve needy families and children.                          ____________________
