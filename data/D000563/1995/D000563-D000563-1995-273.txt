Certainly there are people on welfare as there are people in business and in other walks of life who are going to try to take advantage of the system and game the system and stay on as long as they can. But I am impressed by how many people we meet who want to get off this welfare tangle. They really want to do something with their lives, and we have to decide whether as a nation we will invest in them and their future. And that investment is training, it is education, it is transportation, it is day care, it is some health care assistance for them during this period of time.  But think about it, if we do not do it, if we just leave that person in the depths of despair, stuck on welfare, hopeless, they are not only a drain on society, they have lost their own self-worth, and they really do not have a chance to succeed. So what we tried to do on the Democratic side was say all right, we will draw the line. You cannot be on welfare forever, but for goodness' sakes let us have a goal for each person. Let us move from welfare to work. Let us make people productive citizens in America today. That is an investment that will pay off for a long time to come. It is one we made after World War II.
