Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Bart Forsyth, who recently left Capitol Hill after serving in many capacities over the past 13 years.  After graduating from Hofstra University and receiving his law degree from Washington and Lee School of Law, Bart began his career on Capitol Hill as a staff member on the Foreign Affairs Committee. He then went on to serve on the House Science Committee as investigative counsel, as my chief of staff on the Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming, a staff member of the House Judiciary Committee, and as my chief of staff in my personal office. In the more than 10 years I have known Bart, he has never lost sight of what brought him here--to solve problems and make a positive difference in peoples' lives.  Bart's extensive knowledge, foresight, and drive made him a force on Capitol Hill. He has championed a number of causes related to government surveillance, law enforcement, privacy and civil liberties, and European relations. In June, 2013 when it was revealed that the National Security Agency (NSA) had overstepped its authorities, he immediately began work on a legislative response that would eventually be known as USA Freedom Act. He also spearheaded work on the Judicial Redress Act of 2016, which ensures data is protected in the strongest possible way with our privacy laws. His achievements have not gone unnoticed. Twice, Bart has been recognized by European leaders as one of the Hill's top policy influencers. Additionally, he was admitted into the prestigious U.S. Supreme Court bar in 2014.  Too often, working long hours can take its toll on one's personal life. Not so with Bart. Whether it was running marathons, competing in an Ironman competition, including qualifying for the world championship in Kona, Hawaii, or more importantly taking on the role of devoted husband and father, Bart continuously sought out new challenges and did so with strength and determination.  Bart has been a true asset as a trusted advisor, effective facilitator, and respected leader. I'm thankful for his distinguished service and wish him, his wife Mindy, and daughter Triana, all the best as Bart begins this new chapter.                          ____________________
