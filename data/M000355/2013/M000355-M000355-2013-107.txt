 President, 226 years ago today about three dozen patriots helped form a more perfect union when they signed their names to a document that guides us still. The U.S. Constitution and the timeless principles that inform it have endured, ensuring liberty and freedom for the people of this country through war and peace, turmoil and prosperity.  So on this September 17, like every Constitution Day, we take a moment to reflect on just how fortunate we are to live in a nation that, unlike any other before or since, was founded on an idea. A big part of that idea is the fact that our rights come not from men but from the Creator, and that for this reason they cannot be taken away.  That is the context in which our Constitution was written, and it is the context of the Bill of Rights that was added to it, and it is just one of the things that makes America exceptional.  The first thing that every Senator, Congressman, or President does upon assuming office is take an oath to uphold the U.S. Constitution. On this Constitution Day I join my fellow lawmakers in recommitting myself to that solemn oath, to doing everything I can to ensure that the principles of constitutional self-government are adhered to and defended in Washington. This glorious document that binds us is the guarantor of our freedom and the light that continues to guide our people.  Today we remember that with pride--and with optimism about the future of this great country.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
