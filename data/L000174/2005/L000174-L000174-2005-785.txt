President, I rise today to express my strong support for Senator Cantwell's amendment to the budget resolution protecting the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Senator Cantwell's amendment aims to strike a controversial provision that effectively paves the way to allowing oil and gas exploration in one of our Nation's most pristine and unique wild places. This is a common-sense amendment, which upholds the will of the American people in preserving this remote area. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it.
