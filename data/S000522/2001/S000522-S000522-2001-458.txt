Mr. Speaker, as Chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, I am introducing the ``Department of Defense-Department of Veterans Affairs Health Resources Access Improvement Act of 2001'' on behalf of myself and Mr. Brown of South Carolina, Mr. Everett of Alabama, Mr. Simmons of Connecticut, Mr. Gibbons of Nevada, Mr. Wamp of Tennessee, Mr. Kirk of Illinois, Mr. Buyer of Indiana, and Mr. Bilirakis of Florida.  America's servicemen and women, their families, and our veterans who have served in uniform deserve the best health care we can offer them as a Nation. My bill addresses the urgent need for the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs to improve their programs of health resource sharing as originally authorized by Public Law 97-174, the ``Veterans' Administration and Department of Defense Health Resources Sharing and Emergency Operations Act of 1982.'' This authority was originally intended to provide opportunities to make it easier for the two Departments--whose combined health care budgets this year total over $35 billion--to increase the variety and amount of their health resource sharing for the benefit of their veteran and military beneficiaries, while helping hold down costs in Federal health care for the benefit of taxpayers.  Currently, the Secretaries of each Department have at their discretion the option not to share. With this bill, we take a new approach: it would make sharing the order of the day. Sharing must be an important priority of both Departments, and we should create strong incentives for the Secretaries to work together to achieve common ends. The bill's proposed findings are indicative of our disappointment with the current state of VA-DoD sharing. We believe that neither department has taken full advantage of sharing opportunities and that the intended results of the 1982 sharing authority have not been achieved. We know VA-DoD sharing could be greatly increased, and with this bill we want to get sharing moving again.  Mr. Speaker, this bill seeks to establish a health care facilities sharing demonstration project in keeping with the intent of the original legislation for VA-DoD sharing. Under the bill, five qualifying sites across the country would be selected for participation in a demonstration project. The purpose of the demonstration project is to identify and measure the advantages of sharing, and work through the challenges of the two systems becoming true partners in health care  This legislation would require a unified management system to be adopted in the five demonstration sites to the extent feasible. A unified system would incorporate budget and financial management, health care provider assignments, and medical information systems compatibility. At the present time, the two Departments' information systems are incompatible, but this legislation would also create a framework for greater software compatibility. By making such systems communicate better, we can better ensure continuity of care, equality of access, uniform quality of service and seamless transmission of data. This is a third important goal of our bill.  In addition, the demonstration project would provide for enhancement of graduate medical educational programs at the five sites for physicians in training and other health care providers. This will create a unique opportunity forhealth professions students by giving them a combined exposure that has not been available to them before. It would also bring a greater awareness and understanding of differences in the two beneficiary populations for new and experienced health care professionals alike.  Congress has made efforts in the past to promote specific sharing. At best, the results have been modest. For example, we authorized the Mike O'Callaghan Federal Hospital at Nellis Air Force Base outside Las Vegas. It is a 96-bed Air Force managed hospital with 52 VA-dedicated beds. This facility still has significant potential to serve as a model for sharing, but the VA and the Air Force made the decision to maintain separate budgets, financial, human resources, patient care records and data management systems. This facility, spending combined appropriations of over $46 million, is really operating as two independent federal facilities within the same walls, with needless duplications of systems and services and inefficient use of resources.  Another example is the VA Medical center and Kirkland AFB Hospital in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Albuquerque is a VA-Air Force partnership that provides admitting privileges to Air Force physicians. The relationship between the VA and Air Force at these facilities is an example of a good beginning to sharing. What was once a 40-bed Air Force hospital occupying VA space has evolved to a contractual relationship today. Now the Air Force purchases inpatient care services from the VA, rather than operating less efficiently as a separate hospital within the confines of the Albuquerque facility.  While many of the lost opportunities to share observed in Las Vegas do not pertain to the situation in Albuquerque, some do. For example, the Air Force and VA needlessly maintain separate dental clinics, central dental laboratory functions and separate supply chains. Also, the Air Force continues to maintain a management presence as though it were still operating as an independent facility, even though most of its activities duplicate those of VA.  The Committee has also examined sharing in VA and DoD health care facilities in San Diego, CA; Fayetteville, NC; Charleston, SC; and San Antonio and El Paso, TX. It appears that substantial benefits could be achieved on both sides of the sharing equation if sharing became more of a standard operating policy between VA and DoD. Obviously, sharing is more likely to occur if one potential partner has something perceived to be valuable or useful to offer the other and if the right incentives are in place to encourage follow-through on sharing arrangements. VA Medical Centers have been successful in fields such as rehabilitation, prosthetics, treatment of spinal cord injuries and geriatrics, but DoD medical facilities treat a broader base of patients, which provides opportunities for the medical staff to broaden its experience.  Some of these facilities that could share or share more are close neighbors, and close proximity clearly makes sharing much easier to achieve. For some of these essentially co-located facilities, a joint facility would almost certainly reduce administrative costs as well as staffing needs. With such savings, additional resources would be made available for patient treatment and technological improvements. For instance, at the San Diego VA Medical Center, the fiscal year 2001 budget is $202 million, and at the Balboa Naval Medical Center, the fiscal year 2001 budget is over $338 million. Although these facilities are only a few miles apart, no sharing occurs between them. The most recent clinical sharing between VA and the Navy in the San Diego area appears to have ended in 1989. It appears that Congress must be more vigorous or this deplorable situation will continue.  For too many neighboring VA and DoD health facilities, separate management and operations have become the only way they can conceive of doing business, even when another federal medical facility, also supported by tax dollars, may be little more than a stone's throw away. This separateness is mostly about ingrained habits, organizational cultures and protecting turf, and is not about promoting the best quality medical treatment for veterans and military patients, extending specialty care to more federal beneficiaries, or conserving scarce resources and funding.  Our bill would require, among other things, no later than two years after its enactment, the Secretaries of both Departments must submit to Congress a prospectus for the construction of a new joint federal medical facility. The two Secretaries would jointly select the location with two options to consider. They could select a location  Importantly, Mr. Speaker, this bill would make VA-DoD health sharing mandatory. This change in the law would require jointly located facilities, beginning with those participating in the demonstration project, to actively engage in developing and implementing meaningful and sustainable plans for sharing. We understand that DoD and VA health facilities do not always operate in the same fashion, and that even a small change in policy or procedure can have large consequences. That is why in order to fully test the principles of this sharing legislation, the Secretaries of DoD and VA would be granted the authority to waive certain administrative regulations and policies otherwise applicable within their respective Departments. This bill includes provisions for close monitoring of any administrative regulations and policies that the Secretaries would deem appropriate for waiver, and would require them to report to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs and the Committee on Armed Services on their use of such waiver authority.  In summary, this bill reflects the Committee's belief that veterans and military beneficiaries deserve the best health care a grateful Nation can offer. Through the creation of this demonstration project and other provisions of this bill, we hope to improve health resource sharing by providing stronger incentives for both departments to join forces and make VA-DoD sharing a reality.  When I assumed the Chairmanship of this Committee I promised to do what is right for veterans. I am convinced that the Department of Defense--Department of Veterans Affairs Health Resources Improvement Act of 2001 would be good for veterans and the military community alike. I urge my colleagues to come on board and support this bill.                          ____________________
