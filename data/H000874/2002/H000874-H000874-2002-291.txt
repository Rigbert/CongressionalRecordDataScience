Chairman, I yield myself 15 seconds. First of all, let me say that the information we currently have is that military personnel can, in fact, contribute. They cannot solicit, but they can contribute.  Second, I would say that when we say that I left my lamp beside the golden door, it means that you are welcome. And when we say to somebody, you are a legal permanent resident and you can pay taxes and serve in the service, it means not only are you welcome, but you can participate. Let us not shut that golden door tonight.  Mr. Chairman, I retain the balance of my time.
