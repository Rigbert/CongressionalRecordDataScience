Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, first of all, I would like to thank Jeff Fortenberry and his lead cosponsor, Anna Eshoo, for their extremely important resolution, H. Con. Res. 75, as amended, calling on the Obama administration to declare the annihilation of Christians, Yazidis, and other minorities, for what it is, a genocide.  On December 4 of last year, a coalition of prominent religious leaders wrote President Obama and stated, ``Christian and Yazidi minorities in Iraq and Syria are being targeted for eradication in their ancient homelands solely because of their religious beliefs.''  They had been prompted by reports of an ``imminent'' State Department finding that ISIS was committing genocide against the Yazidis, a finding they ``wholeheartedly'' endorsed, but were ``deeply troubled,'' like we all were, that the genocide of Christians was going to be bypassed or excluded.  Apparently press reports had claimed that the rationale for excluding Christians was that, unlike the Yazidis, Christians had a choice to convert to Islam and pay an Islamic tax, or be killed, tortured, enslaved, or held hostage.  In direct rebuttal of that argument at a hearing that I held on December 9, Carl Anderson, the Supreme Knight of the Knights of Columbus, stated:       Many times the payment of the tax is not presented as an      option for these Christians. In instances where the Yazidi      tax has been enacted or extracted, it has failed to ensure      that the Christians could live as Christians, that they were      protected from rival jihadists, or even other members of      ISIS, or that the amendment of payment was not raised over      time until it became impossible for some of them to pay,      causing the family's home, and even their children, to be      confiscated, and the adults to be killed or forced to become      Muslims.  It is a very, very poor argument that has been made by the State Department, so we believe they have made this. Hopefully, they will rectify it.  Let me also point out to my colleagues that the Genocide Convention defines genocide as ``the killing and certain other acts committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial, or religious group.''  The religious leaders who signed the December 4 letter compiled extensive files supporting a finding that ISIS' treatment of Iraqi and Syrian Christians absolutely meets this definition. They include:       Evidence of ISIS assassinations of church leaders; mass      murders; torture, kidnapping for ransom in the Christian      communities of Iraq and Syria; sexual enslavement and      systematic rape of Christian girls and women; its practices      of forcible conversions to Islam; its destruction of      churches, monasteries, cemeteries, and Christian artifacts;      and its theft of lands and wealth from Christian clergy and      laity alike.  They went on to cite ``ISIS' own public statements taking credit for mass murder of Christians, and expressing its intent eliminate Christian communities from the Islamic State.''  The letter recounted how ``ISIS jihadis have stamped Christian homes in Mosul with the red letter N for Nazarene in the summer of 2014,'' pointing out how the ``elimination of Christians in other towns and cities in Iraq and Syria began long beforehand.''  Mr. Speaker, I held a hearing 3 years ago extolling and urging the administration to recognize the genocide against Christians, and our witnesses, the private witnesses who spoke, gave instance after instance of crimes against Christians that were done simply because they were Christians.  At a December 9 hearing, we heard from four witnesses. I mentioned one a moment ago, Carl Anderson, from the Knights of Columbus. We also heard from Dr. Stanton, of Genocide Watch, who said, ``Failure to call ISIS' mass murder of Christians, Shiia, Muslims, and other groups in addition to the Yazidis by its proper name, genocide, would be an act of denial as grave as the U.S. refusal to recognize the Rwanda genocide back in 1994.''                              {time}  1615  Bishop Kalabat, a Chaldean bishop, was extremely pointed in his remarks when he said that ``the Obama administration, including President Obama himself, have neglected to mention that the ISIS atrocities were committed against Christians. They rightly mention atrocities committed in Iraq against the Yazidis, and they are horrific.'' The bishop went on, ``But there are also atrocities of rape, killings, crucifixions, beheadings, hangings that the Syrian and Iraqi Christians have endured, and they are intentionally omitted.'' He compellingly stated that ``the U.S. Government should not turn a blind eye to the genocidal atrocities faced by Iraq's ethnic and religious minorities, including the Christians, the Yazidis, and others.''  Finally, in very, very powerful testimony, the head of Yezidi Human Rights Organization-International, Mr. Ismail, stated that though his people, the Yazidis, were on the verge of annihilation, he called upon the administration not to neglect the others who are also on the verge of annihilation, and said, ``the Yazidis and the Chaldo-Assyrian Christians face this genocide together.''  Now is the time to act. We cannot let the cries of the victims go unheeded as we once did when we confronted the genocide in Rwanda and other genocides that have occurred around the world. Mr. Speaker, I therefore urge my colleagues to vote for H. Con. Res. 75.  I reserve the balance of my time.
