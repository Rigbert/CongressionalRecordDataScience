 REID. I will be happy to yield to my friend from Kentucky for a question.  Mr. McCONNELL. I believe I heard my good friend say what we needed to do was get a list of amendments and a starting place. I remind my good friend from Nevada, the majority leader, we were prepared to do that yesterday. We are prepared to do that now, if we could enter into an agreement to have a finite list of amendments, which I offered to do yesterday. That would at least define the universe, and at whatever point we get back to beginning to make progress on the bill, it would be a good starting place.  I was pleased to hear the majority leader indicate that is what we need to do and I say to him I am happy to do that.
