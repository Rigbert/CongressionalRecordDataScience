President, I know the Senator and I spoke earlier, and I heard his conversation on the floor earlier.  I would say, through the Chair, if the Republican minority came forward, in the morning, with a list of germane amendments to this bill, it is my understanding the majority leader has said we will entertain and consider those amendments. This is open for an amendment process, for deliberation, and for votes on this important aviation safety bill. Is that correct?
