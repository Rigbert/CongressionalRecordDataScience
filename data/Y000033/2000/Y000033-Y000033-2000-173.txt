Mr. Speaker, there has been a lot said about George Frampton supporting it. That is probably the biggest reason to vote against the rule.  The second thing is that every governor in the country now has blasted this agreement. Every governor. The mayors, the legislative bodies have blasted this so-called Interior appropriations.  So do not give everybody how much they support it. In reality, the governors know right now we are back to square one. We have got to go back to the appropriators and grovel, hold our hand out and beg at the end of the session.  By the way, Mr. Speaker, this has happened to us now for 6 years, 8 years, 10 years. Wait until the last moment, the Senate does not do anything, they hold it; and then the appropriators get together in the back room, and the cardinals decide what legislation is going to pass and not pass. The natives are getting restless, buddy. I am going to suggest respectfully, that is not the way this Congress was set up. It is not good legislation; it is wrong and against the House rules, but we are ready to go home, so everybody wants to vote for this thing.  I am voting no and I am going to ask for a vote on the rule.
