President, I rise today to discuss the important issue of a visa entry-exit control system with the Senator from Michigan, Mr. Abraham, the Chairman of the Immigration Subcommittee, and Senator Gregg, the Chairman of the Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations Subcommittee.  Senator Abraham, you and I and other Members who represent the Northern regions of our country have been working for over 3 years now to repeal Section 110 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-208). Section 110 of this 1996 Immigration law would require a recording and identification system to be implemented to document the arrival and departure of all non-U.S. citizens at all ports of entry in the U.S., including those entry points along the U.S. border with Canada.
