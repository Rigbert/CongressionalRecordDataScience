Speaker, it is an honor to stand before the Members of the House tonight in a special order devoted to honoring our colleague, the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Hamilton) who will be retiring from this institution after serving for 34 years.  The gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Hamilton) has had a distinguished career, and I would note that literally, depending on the day the 106th Congress is sworn in next year, Mr. Hamilton may also hold the historical record of having served in this House longer than anyone else in the history of the State of Indiana.  I am here tonight, and I know my colleagues are here tonight, not because of the quantity of the service of the gentleman from Indiana but the quality of the man and the quality of his service; the quality of his mind, which is exceptional; the quality of his service. He has been selfless every day of those 34 years as far as his commitment to the American people and to those who he has served internationally; and the quality of his person, his ethical conduct, his commitment to his God, to his family and, again, to the people that he has represented in the Ninth District of Indiana.  Seventeen years ago, as a young man, I decided to run for the United States Congress, and at that time the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Hamilton) gave me a gift. He gave me the gift of his intelligence and he gave me the gift of his support.  Following my election, 14 years ago, as a Member, the gentleman from Indiana gave me additional gifts: The gift of his patronage in the House of Representatives and the gift of his counsel.                              {time}  1945  To all of us, he has given the gift of his time, whether as chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, where he attempted to ensure that every American had the fairest chance for the best job in the world's strongest economy, whether it was chairing the House Intelligence Committee to ensure that our Nation was secure above all others, or whether it was his distinguished service on the Committee on International Relations as chair and ranking member, where he ensured that the voice of those least fortunate or those most in danger was always heard.  But on a personal note, I must emphasize that what I will miss most about Lee Hamilton is our extended conversations about the Indiana University football team. I say that simply because Lee was the athlete I never was and never will be and would point out to those who might not know thatwhile at Central High School, Lee was best known for his skill on the basketball court. And as a senior he led his team to the final game of the State basketball tournament in Indiana before being sidelined with an injury. Though Central lost the championship, Lee was honored with the Trester award given to the senior in the final four who best exemplifies excellence in both athletics and scholarship.  In recognition of his athletic accomplishments, Lee was inducted into the Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame in 1982, certainly a very rarefied group. I would simply, in my remarks, wish Lee, his wife, Nancy, and their children Debbie, Tracy and Doug, every joy and every happiness that life has to offer.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a colleague and mentor, Lee Hamilton.  Lee will retire this year after thirty-four years of distinguished service in the House of Representatives. The leadership Lee demonstrates in his roles as the senior member of our delegation and the Chairman of the International Relations Committee are only the most recent examples of greatness in a career that spans decades.  When I first ran for Congress in 1984, Lee was a confidant and a valuable resource. When I won the Democratic primary, Lee became my patron. And, after I became a Member of Congress, Lee's opinions on policy and the issues of the day were among the first I sought. Needless to say, this House will be a different place for me, without Lee Hamilton.  The one thing that each of us has a finite amount of, is time. One thing Lee has always been ready to share with me, and each member, is his time. On both the professional and personal levels, Lee never hesitates to lend an ear and impart sage counsel.  I would point out that it is not just his friends and colleagues for whom Lee makes time. Lee has always striven to make sure the voices of those less fortunate, in our nation, and throughout the world, are heard. As Chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, he also worked to make sure that we have the strongest of economies in this country, and that every American has the chance to get a good job.  When you think of Lee, you think of someone who is judicious, deliberate, and serious about his work, without being serious about himself.  Aside from his interest in international affairs, Lee is deeply committed to the people of Indiana's ninth congressional district, the state of Indiana, and this nation. Now, Lee will take his commitment to public service to Indiana University, where he can keep a closer eye on the I.U. football program.  Congressman Hamilton will be dearly missed in the counsels of government everywhere. He is a gentleman in the truest sense of the word. I wish Lee, Nancy, and their family continued success and happiness in the future.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Gilman), chairman of the Committee on International Relations.
