President, I know my friend from Kentucky played the key role III conference negotiations on H.R. 4818, the FY 2005 foreign operations appropriations bill, which were completed last year, and I ask if he is aware of language that was contained in the House report regarding World Compassion's activities in Afghanistan.  Mr. McCONNELL. My staff informs me that the House report encouraged the State Department to review a proposal from this organization.
