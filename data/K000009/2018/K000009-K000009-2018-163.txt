Speaker, I rise today to recognize an achievement few American companies have attained: the 200th anniversary celebration of Libbey, a glass manufacturer in Toledo, Ohio. In fact, the company's legacy gave rise to Toledo's designation as ``the glass capital of the world.''  In 1818, the New England Glass Company was started in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Through successive generations including his father before him, Edward Drummond Libbey became the company's president in 1880. In 1888, the company's 70th year of operation, after studying a location for a move and noting the fine silica sand and natural gas qualities of the region, Mr. Libbey moved the entire plant--along with many of its skilled tradesmen and workers--to Toledo. In 1892, the company was renamed the Libbey Glass Company. The Libbey Glass Company produced bottles, containers, window glass and was best known for its cut glass .  Always a visionary, Edward Drummond Libbey obtained the exclusive right to build and operate a glass factory at the 1893 world's fair in Chicago. Michael J. Owens, a skilled blower and inventive wonder who came to the plant as it arrived in Toledo, managed the World's Fair factory. Guests could tour the factory, watching the tradesmen and production of blown, cut and etched glass pieces, and purchase such pieces in a gift shop. The exhibition put the Libbey Glass Company on the world stage so that the company and its products were widely known and valued.  The success of the Libbey Glass Company was due in significant part to the inventions of Michael J. Owens. In 1903, he invented an automatic bottling machine, revolutionizing the industry and lauded as the ``most important invention since the blowpipe 2,000 years earlier.'' In 1904, a machine was developed to automatically produce light bulbs. That same year, Libbey Glass Company was featured at the 1904 World's Fair where an amazing 25 inch cut glass punch bowl was showcased. In 1907, machine blown glass was made possible. These inventions enabled Libbey and Owens to go on to found the Owens Bottle Machine Company (later Owens-Illinois) and the Libbey-Owens Sheet Glass Company (later Libbey-Owens-Ford) as the company produced windshields for automobiles. In 1935, Owens-Illinois purchased Libbey Glass. As the 1940 World's Fair in New York approached, Libbey Glass again dazzled the crowds. Michael J. Owens' genius for invention partnered with Edward Drummond Libbey's incredible business acumen made the pair among ``the greatest developers in the 20th century.''  The Libbey Glass Company has been one of the largest glass manufacturers in the United States throughout its 200 years. Even as the original founders passed into history, the company continued remarkable progress. In 1970, a machine was developed to blow and press stemware in one piece, in 1989 the company invented the marbelique glassware process and in 1995, a computer controlled stemware blowing machine. Revolutionary techniques continue to the present day.  Through the centuries Libbey has been a strong community partner. The company was responsive as a community leader and foundational investor in the revitalization of the farmers market complex in downtown Toledo, building a signature showroom as an anchor store. Libbey has even been a key partner in our annual Ninth Congressional District Art Competition.  Intertwined and indelibly Toledo, Libbey will toast its 200 years with a reception and a performance by the Toledo Symphony Orchestra on Friday, May 4, 2018. The company will share its journey with our community even as it looks toward a bright future. As the oldest brand name and American table and decorative glassware in continued existence, Libbey--and Toledo--have a lasting legacy proudly shared.                          ____________________
