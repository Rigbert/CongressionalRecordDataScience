President, I would like to respond to the Senator from Kentucky by again making it clear that it is my interest to work very closely with colleagues on the other side of the aisle on these health care issues, and that is why we took the proposal Senator Hatch had for repeal and replace on Medicare as the base bill. It is why I spent a lot of time working with colleagues on the other side of the aisle on Medicare Part D and trying to make sure it could be implemented well.  What was striking was that a lot of the stories about Medicare Part D in the first couple of months resembled the stories we are now seeing about the Affordable Care Act. The Congressional Budget Office has made the comment that Part D has come in more than 25 percent less in terms of projected costs than what CBO saw years ago.  We are going to work in a constructive way. I hope we will not see a push, for example, to repeal the Affordable Care Act because if you do that, you will go back to the days when health care in America was for the healthy and the wealthy because you would again allow discrimination against those with a preexisting condition. The Affordable Care Act has air-tight protection for those who have a preexisting condition, and if you repeal the Affordable Care Act, you would simply go back to those days.  Working with colleagues in a bipartisan way on strengthening the health care system and our economy--absolutely. But turning back the clock on vital consumer protections, such as protecting our people from discrimination against preexisting conditions, is something that I think would be a huge mistake.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article that appeared in the Wall Street Journal last weekend. It is entitled ``Health Insurers Make Late Push to Enroll Young People'' with respect to the Affordable Care Act. The signups topped the Congressional Budget Office's target ahead of the March 31 deadline.  I was particularly pleased by the comments from insurance executives in Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Florida. They all talked about how more younger people are signing up, which, of course, is key to what we all want to do in terms of bipartisan approaches that strengthen the role of private health care in America.  I would like to have this article printed in the Record so my colleagues can read the remarks of Highmark, Inc., a major health plan based in Pittsburgh. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island said their fastest rising segment in March was people ages 22 to 40. Florida Blue senior vice president Jon Urbanek said, ``Younger people are signing up.''  I think all of this indicates--as far as private sector health care is concerned, which we all sought to promote in connection with this--that more younger people are signing up for these plans.  Also, in response to my friend from Kentucky who asked about the jobs agenda, Senator Hatch and I have been working very constructively together on efforts to go forward in the Finance Committee--which could even begin this week--to deal with the tax extenders. Tax extenders are particularly important for the jobs Senator McConnell seeks--as he mentioned in his remarks--to get some traction. We will be talking about an extension for the research and development tax credit, which is key for innovation. We will be talking about jobs and renewable energy and jobs for veterans. This is the kind of jobs agenda we are pursuing in the Finance Committee.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                     [From the Wall Street Journal]         Health Insurers Make Late Push To Enroll Young People             (By Anna Wilde Mathews and Christopher Weaver)       Insurers are pressing ahead with a final marketing push to      bring as many young, healthy customers as possible onto their      rolls and buttress a recent surge in health-law enrollments.       The flood of late sign-ups that helped boost the      marketplace total to six million enrollees, a key milestone      for the Obama administration, has also brought some insurers      an uptick among younger people. But it isn't clear if the      trend is broad enough to balance out an earlier skew toward      older enrollees, who are more likely to have costly ailments.       ``We are seeing our average age come down every week, so      it's clear that younger people are starting to come into the      pool,'' said Wayne DeVeydt, the chief financial officer of      WellPoint Inc. ``What isn't clear yet, though, is, did it      come down enough.'' WellPoint has said the demographics of      its sign-ups have generally matched its projections.       Highmark Inc., a major health plan based in Pittsburgh,      said in recent weeks that it had seen a ``marked increased''      in enrollees younger than 34. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of      Rhode Island said its fastest-rising segment in March has      been people ages 22 to 40.       Florida Blue Senior Vice President Jon Urbanek said      ``younger people are signing up,'' but the insurer doesn't      know if that will move the dial in a customer pool that had      been ``skewing older than we anticipated.''       Medical Mutual of Ohio said its enrollment through the      health-care marketplace has gotten younger each week, and the      average age is now a decade below where it was when      enrollment kicked off in October. But, the company said, the      average is still eight years older than the company projected      when it set prices for 2014.       Insurance officials also caution that age doesn't always      indicate health status-younger people may have serious,      expensive conditions, while some older people rarely need      medical services. Age is a ``pretty good predictor,'' said      Tom Snook, an actuary with Milliman Inc. who works with      insurers offering plans on public exchanges, but ``it's not      even close to a perfect measure.''       So far, insurance carriers have limited insight into the      health needs of their new enrollees. Under the law, insurers      can't deny coverage or charge higher prices based on health      status, and enrollees need to provide only limited      information, including age, when they sign up through the      marketplaces. Enrollees must start the process of choosing a      plan by March 31 to avoid penalties. The Obama administration      has extended a grace period to complete enrollment even after      the deadline.       As the deadline looms, it isn't clear just how broad the      uptick in youth sign-ups has been. HealthMarkets Inc., a      health-insurance agency, said its age balance for enrollees      hasn't changed in recent weeks. EHealth Inc., which tracks      the average age of individual purchasers of nonmarketplace      plans through its site, shows it flat in recent weeks.      GoHealth LLC, another major health-insurance site, said it      had seen an increase in young customers.       To prod a big final wave, insurers, exchanges, health-care      providers and others are amping up their enrollment push with      a blitz of countdown ads and events. Blue Shield of      California is sponsoring events across the state, including      sign-ups this weekend at all 42 stores of a Southern      California grocery chain with many Hispanic customers. Land      of Lincoln Mutual Health Insurance Co. in Illinois parked a      tractor-trailer emblazoned with its orange logo outside a      hospital sign-up event on Friday.       Health plans are particularly hoping to reach ``young      invincibles'' like Trevor Dawes, a 23-year-old apprentice      plumber from the Queens borough of New York City who said he      is planning to shop for a plan through New York's insurance      marketplace this weekend, ahead of the deadline. He learned      recently from a video on Facebook that he could face      penalties for going without insurance, which he hasn't had      for about a year. ``I'm healthy, and I didn't even know it      was important,'' he said.       Arches Health Plan in Utah plans to keep up its push past      March 31 to capture late finishers. ``We're going right up to      the bell,'' said Shaun Greene, the company's chief operating      officer.       Independence Blue Cross, which sponsored a contest to      create short digital films about health insurance, is turning      the lobby of its downtown Philadelphia headquarters into an      enrollment site this weekend and Monday. The insurer said the      average age of its enrollees has dropped by 1.5 years since      January.       Arches will sport sign-up tables at three Utah Jazz      basketball games in the first     weeks of April. Mr. Greene has enlisted his 17-year-old son      and some of his son's football teammates to blanket cars in      Wal-Mart parking lots Friday with fliers bearing slogans such      as ``Peace of Mind Is Priceless.''  With that, I yield the floor.
