 President, I have an announcement on behalf of the leader. Following my statement, the Senate will resume consideration of the Department of Defense authorization bill. Under the order, Senator Dodd will be recognized to offer his amendment regarding the Cuba commission, with up to 2 hours of debate. At approximately 11:30 a.m., Senator Murray will be recognized to begin debate on her amendment regarding abortion.  As usual, the Senate will recess for the weekly party conferences from 12:30 p.m. to 2:15 p.m. today. At 3:15 p.m., there will be up to four stacked votes, beginning with the Murray amendment, to be followed by the Hatch and Kennedy hate crimes amendment and the Dodd amendment.  I thank my colleagues for their attention.                          ____________________
