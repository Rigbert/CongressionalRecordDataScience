 This is a bill that saves taxpayers' money but more importantly protects a lot of people who are being preyed upon by people wanting to defraud them out of their homes, out of their retirement, out of the money they have saved for their children to go to college. So I think, with what is happening--and it has been proven--all of these frauds that have taken place all over the country, the last thing in the world the American people want to see is us delay it.  I thank the distinguished leader for bringing up this bill this week. It is my intention--my hope, anyway--to have it finished by noon tomorrow.
