 The EPA rule was finalized in September 2009. It would require entities emitting only more than 25,000 metric tons of greenhouse gases per year--the equivalent of emissions from 58,000 barrels of oil--to report on annual emissions. According to the EPA, the rule will impact approximately 100 manure management systems across the country, five of which operate in the state of Oregon. Small farmers--those emitting less than 25,000 metric tons of greenhouse gases per year--would be completely exempt from the rule.  I applaud the EPA's rule and President Obama's leadership in taking serious action on climate change. After losing eight years under the Bush administration in addressing the most serious environmental challenge of our time, it's time for bold U.S. leadership. Compiling accurate and complete data on greenhouse gas emissions is a critical piece to crafting a smart and effective climate policy.  For these reasons, I intend to oppose the motion to instruct conferees before the House today. Congress should not place funding restraints on the EPA that would prevent the agency from executing its Supreme Court-confirmed authorities to regulate greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S.  The material previously referred to by Mr. Dreier is as follows:                        Amendment to H. Res. 876                  Offered by Mr. Dreier of California       At the end of the resolution, insert the following new      section:       Sec. 2. On the third legislative day after the adoption of      this resolution, immediately after the third daily order of      business under clause 1 of rule XIV and without intervention      of any point of order, the House shall proceed to the      consideration of the resolution (H. Res. 554) amending the      Rules of the House of Representatives to require that      legislation and conference reports be available on the      Internet for 72 hours before consideration by the House, and      for other purposes. The resolution shall be considered as      read. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on      the resolution and any amendment thereto to final adoption      without intervening motion or demand for division of the      question except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and      controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the      Committee on Rules; (2) an amendment, if offered by the      Minority Leader or his designee and if printed in that      portion of the Congressional Record designated for that      purpose in clause 8 of rule XVIII at least one legislative      day prior to its consideration, which shall be in order      without intervention of any point of order or demand for      division of the question, shall be considered as read and      shall be separately debatable for twenty minutes equally      divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent; and      (3) one motion to recommit which shall not contain      instructions. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the      consideration of House Resolution 554.                                  ____       (The information contained herein was provided by      Democratic Minority on multiple occasions throughout the      109th Congress.)        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous      question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.      A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote      against the Democratic majority agenda and a vote to allow      the opposition, at least for the moment, to offer an      alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be      debating.       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of      Representatives, (VI, 308-311) describes the vote on the      previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or      control the consideration of the subject before the House      being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous      question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the      subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling      of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the      House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes      the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to      offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the      majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated      the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to      a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to      recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:      ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman      from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to      yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first      recognition.''       Because the vote today may look bad for the Democratic      majority they will say ``the vote on the previous question is      simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on      adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no substantive      legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' But that is      not what they have always said. Listen to the definition of      the previous question used in the Floor Procedures Manual      published by the Rules Committee in the 109th Congress, (page      56). Here's how the Rules Committee described the rule using      information from Congressional Quarterly's ``American      Congressional Dictionary'': ``If the previous question is      defeated, control of debate shifts to the leading opposition      member (usually the minority Floor Manager) who then manages      an hour of debate and may offer a germane amendment to the      pending business.''       Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives,      the subchapter titled ``Amending Special Rules'' states: ``a      refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a      special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the      resolution to amendment and further debate.'' (Chapter 21,      section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ``Upon rejection of the      motion for the previous question on a resolution reported      from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member      leading the opposition to the previous question, who may      offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time      for debate thereon.''       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does      have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only      available tools for those who oppose the Democratic      majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the      opportunity to offer an alternative plan.
