I especially appreciate the recognition of the Air and Marine Operations Center, also known as AMOC, which is located in my congressional district. AMOC has become the foremost aviation-oriented law enforcement operations and coordination center in the U.S. It plays an integral role in protecting us from attack and from human, drug and gun smuggling across our borders.  However, I was disappointed that the extension of E-Verify was reduced from the Senate language which would have provided for a permanent reauthorization of E-Verify. The House overwhelmingly passed a 5-year reauthorization last year and I think the American people would support a permanent reauthorization of E-Verify.  I would also like to commend Ranking Member Rogers for his work on language pertaining to the closing of Guantanamo Bay.  While the bill prohibits the release of detainees into the U.S., the report does not go far enough to prevent prisoners from being transferred to or detained on U.S. soil. I maintain that the President must provide a disposition plan which includes a risk assessment for each of the detainees and the danger they pose to the American people as well as to the national security of the United States. The requirement to have the administration report to Congress on these matters is similar to that of my bill, H.R. 1069, which I introduced on February 13 in response to the administration's January announcement that it would close the detention facility in Guantanamo Bay.  In closing, I would like to reiterate my support for the conference report but with strong reservations about the majority's actions that has severely restricted amendments and has shut down a once open appropriations process.
