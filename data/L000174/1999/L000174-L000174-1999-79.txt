 Mr. President, yesterday we made some progress on the bill and were able to clear 22 amendments to improve it. Those were amendments offered by both Democrats and Republicans. Senator Torricelli, the ranking member of the appropriate subcommittee, and I have been working in good faith with Senator Grassley, the chairman of the appropriate subcommittee, and Senator Hatch, the chairman of the full committee, to clear amendments. We will try to make some more progress on amendments today.  I thank the Senator from Iowa and the Senator from Utah for their willingness to accept my amendment to provide that the expenses needed to protect debtors and their families from domestic violence is properly considered in bankruptcy proceedings. Domestic violence remains a serious problem in our society. We need to do all we can to protect victims and potential victims of domestic violence.  Some of the other amendments we accepted are also quite important. For example, we improved the bill by accepting an amendment offered by Senators Grassley, Torricelli, Specter, Feingold, and Biden, giving bankruptcy judges the discretion to waive the $175 filing fee for chapter 7 cases for debtors whose annual income is less than 125 percent of the poverty level. Bankruptcy is the only civil proceeding that in forma pauperis filing status is not permitted. This amendment corrects that anomaly.  We also accepted a Feingold-Specter amendment which improves the bill by striking the requirement that a debtor's attorney must pay a trustee's attorney's fees if the debtor is not ``substantially justified'' in filing for chapter 7. The bill's current requirement that a debtor's attorney must pay a trustee's attorneys' fees could chill eligible debtors from filing chapter 7 because they could fear they would have to pay future attorney's fees. This is something we had tried to correct when the committee considered the bill. I am glad we have finally done so.  I commend Senators who came to the floor on Friday and Monday and yesterday to offer their amendments. Despite only 4 hours of debate on Friday, and 4 hours on Monday, and, of course, yesterday we had our party caucuses, and we had extended debate on two nongermane, nonrelevant amendments on other matters, Senators from both sides of the aisle have offered 49 amendments to improve the bill. And we disposed of 27 of those so far in this debate.  I hope all Senators with amendments will continue to come to the floor today to offer their relevant amendments.  But unfortunately, while we continue to make progress on the underlying bill in some regards, the Senate's two votes rejecting important amendments offered by Senators Durbin and Dodd were missed opportunities to improve the bill.  Senator Durbin's amendment would have allowed us to confront predatory lending practices. Senator Dodd's would have provided some restraint on the virtually unrestrained solicitation of young people by the credit card industry.  I spoke earlier about the Austin Powers credit card campaign. Kids going into the movie theater to see ``Austin Powers'' were given a chance to get a credit card with a long credit line and get a free Coke, too, if they wanted, but they could also end up with 10-, 25- and almost 30-percent interest payments. I think many who got that suddenly found it was the most expensive soft drink they ever got at a movie.  These are the practices on which we ought to put some limits. It does not help when the credit card companies come here crying crocodile tears that these children they have given credit cards to suddenly actually used them and have run up huge debts, or the people who have been given unrestrained credit cards actually use them and have run up huge debts. So I commend Senators Durbin and Dodd for their amendments. We actually should have accepted both of them.  Most importantly, yesterday the Senate took several actions that will make it much harder to enact bankruptcy reform legislation. The Senate rejected the Kennedy amendment to provide a real minimum-wage increase and, on a virtually party-line vote, chose to adopt an amendment that includes special interest tax breaks that are not paid for, under the guise of being a real increase in the minimum wage, when in fact it is not.  The President has now promised to veto the bill if it reaches his desk in this form. He noted that the Republican majority used its amendment ``as a cynical tool to advance special interest tax breaks,'' which it was.  The Senate's actions yesterday in these regards were both unfortunate and unwise.  I ask unanimous consent that this morning's editorial from the Washington Post about the bankruptcy bill and the Senate's action yesterday be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Washington Post, November 10, 1999]                         What Bankruptcy Bill?       The Senate spent much of yesterday debating and coming to      wrong conclusions on the minimum wage and tax cuts. It      intended then to debate propositions having to do with school      aid, agribusiness, drug policy and the future of East Timor.      Under an agreement between the parties, the results of these      deliberations were to be attached as amendments or political      ornaments, take your pick, to an underlying bill that would      significantly tighten bankruptcy law. But very little debate      seemed likely on the bill itself, and that is wrong. Aside      perhaps from the minimum wage, the underlying bill is more      important than the ornamentation. In several respects it is      defective and has the potential to do serious harm.       The question in bankruptcy law is always the same: how to      achieve a balance between society's interests in seeing that      people pay their debts and the need to prevent debtors from      being permanently ruined by them. The strong economy in      recent years, together with competition in the credit card      industry, has produced a sharp increase in consumer use of      credit. There has been a related spike, now perhaps      subsiding, in bankruptcies. The bill seeks to make sure that      people don't take undue advantage of the bankruptcy laws--     that those who can reasonably be expected to pay at least a      part of their debts aren't excused entirely. That's plainly      fair, and there seems to be broad agreement that the law need      some toughening. But critics, including the administration      and a number of civil rights groups, believe the legislation      tilts too far.       There are multiple issues, but basically the administration      would make it easier for people at or below the median income      to qualify for the kind of bankruptcy in which most debts are      excused, and harder for creditors to dislodge them. The      administration would also like to impose additional      disclosure and other requirements on credit card companies,      whose blandishments it believes are partly responsible for      the current problem.       But the House already has passed by a veto-proof 313 to 108      an even tougher bankruptcy bill, and the complexity of the      issues together with the impatience of the Senate leaves the      administration in a weak position. The Senate yesterday voted      along party lines for a slower minimum wage increase than the      president wants, together with a costly and regressive tax      cut. He says he'll veto a bankruptcy bill to which those are      attached, as, at least in the case of the tax cut, he should.      What he'll do if eventually the bankruptcy bill is sent to      him separately is unclear.       What Congress should do, before it sends him the bill, is      make sure that in the name of financial responsibility it      doesn't unduly squeeze people who, because of job loss,      family breakup, medical bills, etc. can't help themselves. It      isn't clear that in the episodic legislative process thus far      that balance has been achieved.
