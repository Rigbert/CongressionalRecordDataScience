President, I rise today to express the deep sadness and anger that I and many of my Vermont constituents feel about the senseless, cold-blooded murder of one of Mexico's most respected and courageous human rights lawyers, Digna Ochoa y Placido.  On October 20, 2001, Ms. Ochoa was shot at near point blank range in her office. At her side was a note that threatened other human rights activists who have defended environmentalists, labor leaders, or other unjustly imprisoned or tortured by the Mexican army and police. A former nun, Ms. Ochoa was a role model for all human rights defenders, because of her extraordinary courage, dedication, and commitment to some of the most disadvantaged members of Mexican society.  Ms. Ochoa frequently put the people she represented ahead of her own personal safety, and was an easy target for those who represent the worst of society, who would threaten or kill the downtrodden to protect their own crimes. She had received many death threats, and in 1999 she was kidnapped twice. During one of those abductions, her kidnappers tied her to a chair, opened a gas canister, and left her to die as the fumes slowly filled the room--from which she narrowly escaped.  Digna Ochoa's death is a tragedy for all Mexicans. But it is particularly outrageous because it could have been avoided. Although it was widely known that threats and acts of violence were being carried out against her and other members of Prodh--the human rights organization where she worked--Mexican officials failed to investigate or prosecute those crimes.  It would be hard to overstate the optimism I felt when Vicente Fox was elected Mexico's President after 70 years of misrule by the PRI. This election meant that Mexico could begin to overcome years of official corruption, police brutality, injustice and poverty suffered by the fast majority of Mexico's population.  When President Fox took office, he promised to end the long history of abuses by the Mexican army and police. No one expected miracles. No one expected him to transform those secretive, corrupt and brutal institutions overnight. But it is the Government's first duty to protect its citizens, and people did expect him to make justice a priority, get rid of the old guard, and demand accountability.  That has not happened, at least not yet, and Digna Ochoa's death has, tragically, focused attention again on this festering problem. There are undoubtedly many others who have suffered similar fates--faceless Mexican who are not widely known, who have been threatened or murdered, or who languish in prison without access to justice.  To his credit, on November 9 President Fox ordered the release from prison of two ecologists, represented by Ms. Ochoa in the past, who never should have been imprisoned in the first place. For possessing the courage to try to stop the destruction of forests where they lived, they were arrested and allegedly tortured.  The destruction of tropical forests is an urgent problem from Indonesia to Latin America, as logging companies compete for profits until the forests are completely destroyed. Often, the militaries in these countries are directly involved in these destructive, yet lucrative, schemes, and do not hesitate to kill or frame those who get in their way because they have known only impunity.  However, besides releasing these two men, the Mexican Government has done little to respond to Ms. Ochoa's death. A truth commission to examine past human rights abuses has not been established. That is presumably because it requires challenging some of the most entrenched, powerful, and dangerous forces within Mexican society. Nevertheless, President Fox made this promise, and that is what is urgently needed.  Another troubling case is the imprisonment of Brigadier General Jose Francisco Gallardo, who was convicted of corruption based on evidence that is, at best, inconclusive. Many observers feel that the main reason he is in prison and the Mexican Government continues to oppose his release is because he spoke out about abuses in the military. President Fox must deal with this case immediately.  I am convinced that President Fox is the right leader for Mexico at this critical time, and I have confidence in him and his advisors. I do not minimize the herculean tasks they face--political, economic and social reform on a national scale. But there is no way democracy can succeed in Mexico without the rule of law. And there is no better place to start than by tracking down Digna Ochoa's killers, and bringing them to justice for all to see.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a piece written by Digna Ochoa, about her life, which was included in Kerry Kennedy Cuomo's extraordinary book ``Speak Truth To Power,'' be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                              Digna Ochoa       I am a nun, who started life as a lawyer, I sought a      religious community with a social commitment, and the      protection of human rights is one of the things that my      particular community focuses on. They have permitted me to      work with an organization that fights for human rights,      called Centro Pro, supporting me economically, morally, and      spiritually. This has been a process of building a life      project, from a social commitment to a spiritual one with a      mystical aspect.       My father was a union leader in Veracruz, Mexico. In the      sugar factory where he worked, he was involved in the      struggles for potable water, roads, and securing land      certificates. I studied law because I was always hearing that      my father and his friends needed more lawyers. And all the      lawyers charged so much. My father was unjustly jailed for      one year and fifteen days. He was then disappeared and      tortured--the charges against him were fabricated. This led      to my determination to do something for those suffering      injustice, because I saw it in the flesh with my father.       When I first studied law, I intended to begin practicing in      the attorney general's office, then become a judge, then a      magistrate. I thought someone from those positions could help      people. After I got my degree, I became a prosecutor. I      remember a very clear issue of injustice. My boss, who was      responsible for all of the prosecutions within the attorney      general's office, wanted me to charge someone whom I knew to      be innocent. There was no evidence, but my boss tried to make      me prosecute him. I refused, and he prosecuted the case      himself.       Up until that time, I was doing well. The job was      considered a good one, because it was in a coffee-producing      area and the people there had lots of money. But I realized      that I was doing the same thing that everyone did, serving a      system that I myself criticized and against which I had      wanted to fight. I decided to quit and with several other      lawyers opened an office. I had no litigation experience      whatsoever. But I was energized by leaving the attorney      general's office and being on the other side, the side of the      defense.       The first case I worked on was against judicial police      officers who had been involved in the illegal detention and      torture of several peasants. We wanted to feel like lawyers,      so we threw ourselves into it. Our mistake was to take on the      case without any institutional support. I had managed to      obtain substantial evidence against the police, so they      started to harass me increasingly, until I was detained.      First, they sent telephone messages telling me to drop the      case. Then by mail came threats that if I didn't drop it I      would die, or members of my family would be killed. I kept      working and we even publicly reported what has happening. The      intimidation made me so angry that I was motivated to work      even harder. I was frightened, too, but felt I couldn't show      it. I always had to appear--at least publicly--like I was      sure of myself, fearless. If I showed fear they would know      how to dominate me. It was a defense mechanism.       Then, I was disappeared and held incommunicado for eight      days by the police. They wanted me to give them all the      evidence against them. I had hidden the case file well, not      in my office, not in my house, and not where the victims      lived, because I was afraid that the police would steal it.      Now, I felt in the flesh what my father had felt, what other      people had suffered. The police told me that they were      holding members of my family, and named them. The worst was      when they said they were holding my father. I knew what my      father had suffered, and I didn't want him to relive that.      The strongest torture is psychological. Though they also      gave me electric shocks and put mineral water up my nose,      nothing compared to the psychological torture.       There was a month of torture. I managed to escape from      where they were holding me. I hid for a month after that,      unable to communicate with my family. It was a month of      anguish and torture, of not knowing what to do. I was afraid      of everything.       I eventually got in touch with my family. Students at the      University, with whom I had always gotten along very well,      had mobilized on my behalf. After I ``appeared'' with the      help of my family and human rights groups in Jalapa,      Veracruz, I was supported by lawyers, most of whom were      women. The fact that I was in Veracruz caused my family      anguish. At first I wanted to stay, because I knew we could      find the police who detained me. We filed a criminal      complaint. We asked for the police registries. I could      clearly identify some of the officers. But there was a lot of      pressure about what I should do: continue or not with the      case? My life was at risk, and so were the lives of members      of my family. After a month of anguish, my family,      principally my sisters, asked me to leave Jalapa for a while.      For me, but also for my parents.       I came to Mexico City. The idea was to take a three-month      human rights course for which I had received a scholarship. I      met someone at the human rights course who worked at Centro      Pro, one of the human rights groups involved on my behalf.      One day he said, ``Look, we're just setting up the center and      we need a lawyer. Work with us.'' I had never dreamed of      living in Mexico City, and I didn't want to. But I accepted,      because the conditions in Jalapa were such that I couldn't go      back. Two really good women lawyers in Jalapa with a lot of      organizational support took up the defense case I had been      working on. This comforted me, because I knew the case would      not be dropped--I had learned the importance of having      organizational backup. So I started to work with Centro Pro      in December 1988. Since I began working with the      organization, I've handled a lot of cases of people like my      father and people like me. That generates anger, and that      anger becomes the strength to try to do something about the      problem. At work, even though I give the appearance of      seriousness and resolve, I'm trembling inside. Sometimes I      want to cry, but I know that I can't, because that makes me      vulnerable, disarms me.       At this time, because of what happened to me, I needed the      help of a psychoanalyst, but I wasn't ready to accept it. The      director of Centro Pro prepared me to accept that support. He      was a Jesuit and psychologist. For six months, I didn't know      he was a therapist. When I found out, I asked him why he      hadn't told me. ``You never asked,'' he said. We became very      close. He was my friend, my confessor, my boss, and my      psychologist, too, although I also had my psychoanalyst.       The idea of a confessor came slowly to me. In Jalapa, I had      been supported by some priests. When I first ``appeared,''      the first place I was taken was a church. I felt secure      there, though as a kid, I had never had much to do with      priests, besides attending church. To me they were people who      accepted donations, delivered sacraments, and were power      brokers. It made an impression on me to see priests      committed to social organizations, supporting people.       Since I've been at Centro Pro, we've gone through some      tough times, like the two years of threats we received      beginning in 1995. Once again it was me who was being      threatened. My first reaction was to feel cold shivers. I      went to the kitchen with a faxed copy of the threat and said      to one of the sisters in the congregation, ``Luz, we've      received a threat, and they're directed at me.'' And Luz      responded, ``Digna, this is not a death threat. This is a      threat of resurrection.'' That gave me great sustenance.      Later that day another of my lawyer colleagues, Pilar, called      me to ask what security measures I was taking. She was--     rightfully--worried. I told her what Luz had said and Pilar      responded, ``Digna, the difference is that you're a religious      person.'' And I realized that being a person of faith and      having a community, that having a base in faith, is a source      of support that others don't have.       Now, some people said to me that my reaction was      courageous. But I've always felt anger at the suffering of      others. For me, anger is energy, it's a force. You channel      energy positively or negatively. Being sensitive to      situations of injustice and the necessity of confronting      difficult situations like those we see every day, we have to      get angry to provoke energy and react. If an act of injustice      doesn't provoke anger in me, it could be seen as      indifference, passivity. It's injustice that motivates us to      do something, to take risks, knowing that if we don't, things      will remain the same. Anger has made us confront police and      soldiers. Something that I discovered is that the police and      soldiers are used to their superiors shouting at them, and      they're used to being mistreated. So when they run into a      woman, otherwise insignificant to them, who demands things of      them and shouts at them in an authoritarian way, they are      paralyzed. And we get results. I consider myself an      aggressive person, and it has been difficult for me to manage      that within the context of my religious education. But it      does disarm authorities. I normally dress this way, in a way      that my friends call monklike. That's fine. It keeps people      off guard. I give a certain mild image, but then I can, more      efficiently, demand things, shout.       For example, one time there was a guy who had been      disappeared for twenty days. We knew he was in the military      hospital, and we filed habeas corpus petitions on his behalf.      But the authorities simply denied having him in custody. One      night we were informed that he was being held at a particular      state hospital. We went the next day. They denied us access.      I spent the whole morning studying the comings and goings at      the hospital to see how I could get in. During a change in      shifts, I slipped by the guards. When I got to the room where      this person was, the nurse at the door told me I could not go      in. ``We are not even allowed in,'' she said. I told her that      I would take care of myself; all I asked of her was that she      take note of what I was going to do and that if they did      something to me, she should call a certain number. I gave her      my card. I took a deep breath, opened the door violently and      yelled at the federal judicial police officers inside. I told      them they had to leave, immediately, because I was the      person's lawyer and needed to speak with him. They didn't      know how to react, so they left. I had two minutes, but it      was enough to explain who I was, that I had been in touch      with his wife, and to get him to sign a paper proving he was      in the hospital. He signed. By then the police came back,      with the fierceness that usually characterizes their      behavior. Their first reaction was to try to grab me. They      didn't expect me to assume an attack position--the only      karate position I know, from movies, I suppose. Of course, I      don't really know karate, but they definitely thought I was      going to attack. Trembling inside, I said sternly that if      they laid a hand on me they'd see what would happen. And they      drew back, saying, ``You're threatening us.'' And I replied,      ``Take it any way you want.''       After some discussion, I left, surrounded by fifteen police      officers. Meanwhile I had managed to record some interesting      conversations. They referred to ``the guy who was      incommunicado,'' a term that was very important. I took the      tape out and hid the cassette where I could. The police      called for hospital security to come, using the argument that      it wasn't permitted to have tape recorders inside the      hospital. I handed over the recorder. Then they let me go. I      was afraid that they would kidnap me outside the hospital, I      was alone. I took several taxis, getting out, changing,      taking another, because I didn't know if they were following      me. When I arrived at Centro Pro, I could finally breathe. I      could share all of my fear. If the police knew that I was      terrified when they were surrounding me, they would have been      able to do anything to me.       Sometimes, without planning and without being conscious of      it, there is a kind of group therapy among the colleagues at      Centro Pro. We show what we really feel, our fear. We cry.      There's a group of us who have suffered physically. On the      other hand, my religious community has helped me manage my      fear. At times of great danger, group prayer and study of the      Bible and religious texts helps me. Praying is very      important. Faith in God. That has been a great source of      strength. And I'm not alone anymore. As a Christian, as a      religious person, I call myself a follower of Christ who died      on the cross for denouncing the injustices of his time. And      if He had to suffer what he suffered, what then can we      expect?       For years after my father was tortured, I wanted revenge.      Then, when I was the torture victim, the truth is that the      last thing I wanted was revenge, because I feared that it      would be an unending revenge. I saw it as a chain. Three      years after coming to Mexico City I remember that a person      came to tell me that they had found two of the judicial      police officers who tortured me.       The person asked if I wanted him to get them and give them      their due. At first, I did have a moment when I thought yes.      But I thought about it and realized that I would simply be      doing what they did. I would have no right to speak about      them as I am talking about them now. I would have been one of      them.       I rarely share my own experience of torture. But I remember      talking to a torture victim who was very, very angry, for      whom the desire for revenge was becoming destructive. I      shared my own experience, and that made an impression on him.      But if we don't forgive and get over the desire for revenge,      we become one of them. You can't forget torture, but you have      to learn to assimilate it. To assimilate it you need to find      forgiveness. It's a long-term, difficult, and very necessary      undertaking.       If you don't step up to those challenges, what are you      doing? What meaning does your life have? It is survival. When      I began to work, when I took that case in which they made me      leave Jalapa, I was committed to doing something against      injustice. But there was something else that motivated me,      and I have to recognize it, even though it causes me shame.      What motivated me as well as the commitment was the desire to      win prestige as a lawyer. Thanks to the very difficult      situation that I lived through, I realized what was wrong.      What a shame that I had to go through that in order to      discover my real commitment, the meaning of my life, the      reason I'm here. In this sense, I've found something positive      in what was a very painful experience. If I hadn't suffered,      I wouldn't have been able to discover injustice in such      depth. Maybe I wouldn't be working in Centro Pro. Maybe I      wouldn't have entered the congregation. Maybe I wouldn't have      learned that the world is a lot bigger than the very small      world that I had constructed. Thanks to a very difficult,      painful experience for me and my family and my friends, my      horizons were broadened. Sometimes I say to myself, ``What a      way for God to make you see things.'' But sometimes without      that we aren't capable of seeing.                          ____________________
