 President, I rise today to honor a fallen soldier from my home State, the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Nearly 64 years after being killed in the Korean war, Army CPL William F. Day's remains were finally returned home last week.  Corporal Day was 25 years old when he was deployed to the Chosin Reservoir in North Korea. On November 29, 1950, his company was overwhelmed by enemy forces and began a fighting withdrawal from their position. Three days later, Corporal Day was reported missing in action.  Gloria Shonrock, Day's daughter, was only 4 at the time and has lived her life not knowing the location of her father's final resting place. Unbeknownst to her at the time, Day's remains were contained in one of 208 boxes given to the United States by North Korea between 1991 and 1994. Two years ago, Shonrock provided her DNA to the Department of Defense POW/Missing Personnel Office, which they were able to use to identify her father's remains.  Now, over 60 years after being reported missing in action, Corporal Day is back in his old Kentucky home. Day was laid to rest yesterday in La Center, KY, next to his mother, Mattie Day, in a funeral with full military honors.  Corporal Day made the ultimate sacrifice in giving his life for our country. That his remains were returned home after so many years is a remarkable testament to our Nation's commitment to leaving no man behind. I ask that my Senate colleagues join me in honoring this fallen hero.  The Paducah Sun recently published an article chronicling the incredible story of the discovery and return of Corporal Day's remains. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.                  [From The Paducah Sun, Apr. 3, 2014]                La Center Korean War Veteran Comes Home                           (By Leanne Fuller)       Army Corporal William F. Day, of La Center, was reported      missing in North Korea on Dec. 2, 1950. After a long and      winding search of nearly 64 years, his remains were brought      home Wednesday.       Day's daughter, Gloria Shonrock--along with her husband,      Ernie Shonrock; other relatives, and two military liaisons--     brought the veteran's remains from Nashville, Tenn., to      Morrow Funeral Chapel in La Center Wednesday. They were      escorted from Nashville by Patriot Guard Riders, Shonrock      said, and welcomed into Ballard County with an escort of      firetrucks, ambulances and police vehicles.       Shonrock was four when her father was reported missing.      While Shonrock's mother didn't talk about Day often while she      was growing up, the absence was still felt.       ``I'd sit at the recess and cry because I wanted my daddy      and--you know--you grow out of that, but you still want your      dad,'' she said.       Shonrock said she has been searching for information about      her father since 1992, a search that took her from her home      in Erie, Colo., to Washington, D.C., and La Center.       Day's remains were found among 208 boxes of remains North      Korea gave the United States between 1991 and 1994. In a      recent announcement of the identification of Day's remains,      the Department of Defense POW/Missing Personnel Office (DPMO)      said the boxes were believed to contain remains of 350 to 400      U.S. servicemen.       However, the remains were heavily commingled, which made      identification difficult. Two years ago, Shonrock provided      DNA to help identify her father's remains. Five years ago,      she said, her uncle, Herman Day, and her father's niece,      Mattie Terrell, also provided DNA.       In the search for her father, Shonrock attended yearly DPMO      conferences in Washington and various cities across the      country. At last year's conference, she said, X-ray records      had been found that could possibly be used to identify the      remains.       ``And between the DNA and those X-rays, they found my      dad,'' Shonrock said.       Scientists from the Joint POW/MIS Accounting Command and      the Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory used the DNA      and X-rays to identify Day's remains, which were located in      Hawaii before they were flown to Nashville. Shonrock said Day      was the 100th person identified from the remains contained in      the 208 boxes.       ``It's been hell sometimes, and good other times,''      Shonrock said of the long process. ``And then it's been hell      again because you have to deal with the government, and you      sit there and hurry up and wait.''       Among the good that came out of her search is that a      military office in Colorado helped connect Shonrock with      relatives on her dad's side of the family.       ``I had an aunt in Washington, and I had this aunt and      uncle here in Kentucky,'' Shonrock said. ``And I've been here      many times to see them.''       On Monday, Day will be buried in La Center--with full      military honors--next to his mother, Mattie Day. Day's name      is among those listed on the veterans monument at Ballard      Memorial High School, and before the funeral a memorial      service will be held in his honor at the school.       According to the DPMO, Day was assigned to Company C, 32nd      Infantry Regiment, 31st Regimental Combat Team in November      1950, deployed east of North Korea's Chosin Reservoir. The      31st RCT, known as Task Force Faith, was engaged by      ``overwhelming numbers of Chinese forces.'' On Nov. 29, 1950,      what was left of the task force began fighting a withdrawal      to positions near Hagaru-ri, south of the reservoir.       ``Personally it's a closure that I don't have to worry      about where he's at anymore,'' Shonrock said, ``or whether      he's in a ditch in Korea in the frozen area where he passed      away, or . . . where he's at: because he's been in Hawaii      since 1992-94.''                          ____________________
