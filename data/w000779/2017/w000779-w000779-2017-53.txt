Of course, people always wonder, well, is this kind of a Democratic position or a Republican position? I want to make it clear that I believe that Tom Barthold, the head of the Joint Committee on Taxation, which is our independent tax umpire, essentially agreed with you. In committee, I believe we asked him whether he thought this huge reduction in the corporate tax rate would translate into $4,000 in the pockets of working families in Michigan and Oregon. Is that my colleague's understanding?
