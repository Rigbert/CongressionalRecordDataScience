 Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding, and before answering the question, I want to thank the gentleman for all the good work that he has been doing over the last 2 or 3 days under very difficult circumstances. The distinguished whip has worked very long hours, and we greatly appreciate his cooperation and his consultation.  I really do thank you for that, Mr. Whip.  To answer your question, our intentions are to come in at 9 o'clock. We hope to vote at midnight, and, therefore, we will have a 3-hour debate.
