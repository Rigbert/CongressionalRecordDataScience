 Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished whip from Maryland for yielding to me.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to make all the Members aware that the House has completed voting for the day and the week.  Regarding next week's schedule, the House will convene on Tuesday at 12:30 p.m. for morning hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business. We will consider several measures under suspension of the rules. A final list of those bills will be sent to the Members' offices by the end of the week. Any votes called on these measures will be rolled until 6:30 p.m. on Tuesday.  On Wednesday and Thursday the House will convene at 10 a.m. We plan to consider H.R. 4227, the Middle Class Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act, which would increase the amount of income exempt from the individual AMT, thereby ensuring that hundreds of thousands of middle class taxpayers are not hit with a hidden tax increase next year.  Finally, I would like to remind all Members that we do not plan to have any votes next Friday, May 7.  I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I will be happy to answer any questions he may have.
