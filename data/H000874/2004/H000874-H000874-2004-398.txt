As a matter of fact, we are as pleased about that as we were last year when the gentleman from Texas urged everybody to support our motion to instruct, that we follow the House Democratic substitute as opposed to the one that we actually passed. So we are encouraged by the gentleman's encouragement.  Last, if I can, the FSC bill. We talked about this last week. Obviously, the Europeans have started to impose some penalties. Can the gentleman tell us the status of legislation to deal with the FSC issue?  Mr. DeLAY. As the gentleman knows, the Committee on Ways and Means has reported a bill out, H.R. 2896, the American Jobs Creation Act. This was reported last year. But we continue to work with the committee and the other body and the administration to bring that bill to the floor in a form that not only meets our obligations to the WTO but also ensures thecontinued competitive position of all U.S. companies. I anticipate that we will bring such a bill to the floor in the very near future.
