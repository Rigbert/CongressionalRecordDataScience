 What began in 1933 with Jacob and Anna Hildebrand serving soup and sandwiches at tent meetings has evolved into the largest mission for the homeless in southwest Michigan. In 2007, the mission served over 180,000 meals to those who were hungry, and provided a warm bed to over 90,000 more in need of shelter, all while imparting that true healing comes through the power of Christ.  I stand here today honored that such a caring and compassionate organization serves the needs of the less fortunate in southwest Michigan, and continues to selflessly struggle to make a difference in the lives of ``the least, the last, and the lost.'' Believing all people to be brothers and sisters in Christ, the love and respect that the mission provides both to the homeless and to the community is truly remarkable.  I would like to sincerely thank the staff and volunteers whose spiritual strength, commitment, and dedication have made the work of the Kalamazoo Gospel Mission possible for the past 75 years.                          ____________________
