I have known Edward Gottschling for many years, and he is one of the most active and involved citizens I have ever known, especially when it comes to his service to the community. For many years, Ed has been a constant fixture in the Portage, Indiana Democratic Party and in northwest Indiana. Today, Ed is celebrating a milestone, his 80th birthday. In his honor, a celebration will be taking place on Saturday, January 20, 2007, at the Portage Yacht Club in Portage, Indiana.  Edward Gottschling was born on January 18, 1927, at his home in Gary, Indiana. As a young boy, Ed attended grammar school at Saint John's Lutheran School in the Tolleston neighborhood of Gary. Following his graduation from Tolleston High School in 1944, where he had been a standout pitcher and 4-year letter winner on the school's baseball team, Ed decided to pursue a career with the railroad. Ed began his career as a machinist helper at Elgin, Joliet, and Eastern (EJ) Railroad. However, in 1945, on his 18th birthday, Ed felt the need to serve his country and enlisted in the United States Coast Guard. Undoubtedly, this life-changing decision to serve became the first step in a lifetime of dedicated service to his community. Following training in New York and Miami, Ed was stationed in the San Francisco area, where he served as a seaman aboard the Grand Fork and the Key West. Ed's service ended in May 1946 when the Navy decided to make a reduction in the number of servicemen in the Coast Guard.  Upon his discharge from the service, Ed returned to work at EJ as an electrical apprentice. In 1954, having decided to further his education, Ed completed his courses and received his degree in electrical technology from Purdue University-Calumet in Hammond, Indiana. Prior to doing so, Ed made a decision to leave EJ for a new position with Illinois Bell Telephone, the company for which he would work for the next 32 years. For several years, Ed held various positions, both indoor and outdoor, with Illinois Bell. Then, in 1959, Ed was transferred to their office in downtown Chicago, where he took on supervisory responsibilities for the company. Though Ed has many fond memories from his years at Illinois Bell, he is particularly fond of being called on to assist with the communication needs for three presidential visits to Chicago, which included visits from former Presidents Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, and Lyndon Johnson. As if his career were not already impressive enough, Ed was eventually promoted to several other positions, including the Great Lakes Regional Communication Coordinator for the Federal Aviation Administration.  Though Ed retired from Illinois Bell in 1985, it is his lifetime of service to his community that is so astonishing. Since moving his family from Gary to Portage in 1967, Ed has always been an integral part of the Portage community. Ed has served as Portage Police Commissioner and a member of the Planning and Zoning Commission, and he has also served as the Portage area campaign coordinator for a United States Congressional race. Ed's interest in politics and government did not end there, as he has served as a precinct committeeman for the past 14 years and city councilman for the past 12 years, the last 8 of which he has served as council president.  In addition to city government, Ed has also been a very active member of many service clubs and organizations, as well as an active member of his church. He is an active member and past president of the Portage AARP chapter and a member and past commander of the Tolleston VFW post. A member of the VFW for many years, Ed has even held the distinguished post of district commander. Ed is also a lifetime member of the Portage American Legion and Gary Sportsmen's Club and an active member of the Portage Democratic Club. Since the age of 16, Ed has also been a member of the Saxon Lodge, where he has held numerous posts, including club president. As if his commitment to these organizations were not enough, Ed has always dedicated himself to fighting for the needs of the elderly and disabled, as evidenced by his membership with the Porter County Aging and Community Service Corporation and his service on the State Legislative Committee for the AARP and the Governor's Commission on Aging.  Though Ed has a special place in his heart for his community, his greatest love has always been his family. Ed and his wife, Nina, who passed away in 1994 after nearly 43 years of marriage, were the truest example of a loving and committed marriage. The couple raised two very successful children. Dan resides in Seattle, Washington with his wife, Barb, and Laura resides in Crystal Lake, Illinois with her husband, Robert, and children, Mitchell and Stuart. Though he has committed himself to serving his community, Ed's devotion to his family is equally impressive.  Madam Speaker, Edward Gottschling has given his time and efforts selflessly to the people of Portage, Indiana throughout his many years of service. At this time, I ask that you and all of my distinguished colleagues join me in commending him for his lifetime of service and dedication to his community. Also, I ask that you join me in wishing him a very happy 80th birthday.                          ____________________
