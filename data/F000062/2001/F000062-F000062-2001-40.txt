 President, I thank the Senator from Texas for her comments.  Today I am very pleased to bring before the Senate the conference agreement on the fiscal year 2002 military construction appropriations bill.  Given the circumstances, this is a particularly timely and time-sensitive conference report. I am very pleased that the Senate has demonstrated a willingness to move quickly on it.
