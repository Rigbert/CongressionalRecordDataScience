DOMENICI. I am finished. I will yield the floor.  It is strength, meaning you can defeat the next person President Bush sends up to be a Supreme Court judge. What is that about? Nobody knows who he is going send, what his philosophy is going to be. Pure speculation. Pure speculation. And they are asking Senators to vote so they can have that kind of message to those who are worried about candidates who are conservative like this man? I don't really think it matters too much if it is 39, 38, 40, or 41; he is going to be Attorney General.  I tell you, I really predict he will be a good one, a very good one.  I yield the floor.
