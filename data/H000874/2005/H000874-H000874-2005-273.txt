Speaker, I thank the chief deputy whip for that information.  If I could call the gentleman's attention to October. Clearly, the first two weeks in October, as we all know, have a number of holidays, including Columbus Day holiday, which have impacted the schedule. It has been announced that we will not have votes the second week of October; but we still do not have, as I understand it, a clear picture of the first week of October.  We have a number of Members from the west coast who indicate that they will not be able to travel on Wednesday. There has been some discussion about possibly meeting Thursday and Friday. Could the gentleman give me his thoughts or the thoughts of the majority with reference to that particular week, particularly as it relates to Wednesday which, as the gentleman probably knows as well as any of us, is a problem for some of our Members. I yield to my friend.
