President, when I talk to employers in my State about what Washington could do to get people back to work, they inevitably point to the flood of excessive regulation as a major barrier. Many of us have offered proposals to reform the regulatory process. Even the President's own Jobs Council has put forth ideas such as strengthening cost-benefit analysis. This just makes common sense. But, regrettably, the Senate has failed to act. Meanwhile, the burden of Federal regulation grows ever larger. Right now, Federal agencies are at work on 2,700 new rules.
