Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I congratulate and recognize the Northwest Indiana Alliance Basketball Team on winning the national title for the 9th grade category at the United States Specialty Sports Association Nationals in Fort Wayne, Indiana on August 3, 2003. The tournament began on July 30, 2003 and ended with the Alliance's outstanding victory against the Illinois Wildcats on August 3rd.  The Northwest Indiana Alliance is made up of seven high school sophomores and two freshmen from across Northwest Indiana, along with their coach Mr. Jim Van Weelden. With their collaborated efforts, they achieved victories over other teams from Illinois, Michigan, Ohio. and other states across the nation. With an outstanding record throughout multiple tournaments, the Alliance completed their highly successful season with 34 victories and 17 losses, 16 of those by ten points or less.  Mr. Aric Van Weelden, a sophomore at Munster High School, has been a member of the Junior Varsity team for Munster since his freshman year. Two other Alliance members, Mr. Scott Rutkowski and Mr. Jeff Marinier, were also members of the Munster High School Junior Varsity Basketball Team as freshmen. Mr. Andrew Helmer, from Highland High School, plays three different sports for his high school including football, basketball, and baseball. All four of these great athletes from Northwest Indiana became leaders for the Alliance team by averaging 12 to 15 points each per game.  Mr. Nate Triezenberg, a resident of Highland, is a freshman at Illiana Christian High School, and is recognized by his teammates for his positive attitude and strong will. Mr. Nick Ullman just completed his freshman year at Andrean High School in Merrillville last spring, and is now a sophomore at Crown Point High School. Another Alliance member that plays many different sports at his high school is Mr. Derek Moser, who plays football, basketball, and baseball for Highland High School.  The remaining two members of the Northwest Indiana Alliance are Mr. Mike Bizoukas and Mr. Nick Stolarz from Munster High School. Mike recently completed his 8th grade year at Wilbur Wright Middle School, and is now a freshman at Munster High School. Nick, as a freshman, played on the Junior Varsity team, and is now a sophomore at Munster High School.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating the Northwest Indiana Alliance Basketball Team for their outstanding championship victory at the United States Specialty Sports Association Nationals. Their hard work and dedication is worthy of the highest commendation.                          ____________________
