 Finally, tonight the other side gave us language on their alternative to Senator Crapo's motion.  Senator Crapo's motion would ensure that the bill does not raise taxes on the middle class. I understand that their alternative is sense-of-the-Senate language on that subject. This consent request now has us voting on two drug reimportation amendments from the other side--not one but two on the Democratic side--one of which we just received less than an hour ago and is 100 pages long.  We are prepared to return to the health care bill and proceed to the two tax-related votes tonight. After those votes, I would suggest we continue to work on the bill and other amendments. I assume there could be votes on the drug reimportation issue and a whole host of other amendments we have all been anxious to offer at a later time. But at this stage, regretfully, I object and propound the following alternative.  Is my objection registered?
