Speaker, I take this time for the purpose of asking the majority leader about the schedule for the week to come.  I yield to my friend, the majority leader, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay).  Mr. DeLAY. Mr Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman from Maryland for yielding to me.  Mr. Speaker, the House will convene on Tuesday at 12:30 p.m. for morning hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business. We will consider several measures under suspension of the rules. A final list of those bills will be sent to Members' offices by the end of this week. Any votes called on these measures will be rolled until 6:30 p.m.  On Wednesday and the balance of the week, we plan to consider several bills that respond to the urgent demand for national action on energy policy: The Arctic Coastal Plain Domestic Security and Abandoned Mine Lands Reclamation Reform Act, The Renewable Energy Project Siting Improvement Act, The Energy Policy Act, The Energy Science Act and The U.S. Refinery Revitalization Act.  I thank the gentleman for yielding and would be happy to answer any questions.
