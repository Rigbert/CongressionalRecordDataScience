Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent, in order to carry out the Speaker's expressed intent, to bring up H.R. 3440, the DREAM Act, to protect DREAMers like Jean, who studies at the University of Maryland and is a credit to that institution, a credit to our State, and a credit to our country.
