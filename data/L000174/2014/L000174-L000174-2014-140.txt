President, Father O'Donovan is one of the dearest friends I have from my association with Georgetown past or present. Marcelle and I were privileged to help him celebrate his 80th birthday and join him for church the next day. His homily is truly reflective of the wonderful human he is and I wanted to share it with my fellow Senators. I ask unanimous consent that Father O'Donovan's April 27, 2014 homily be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                           A Jesuit's Journey                       Homily in Dahlgren Chapel                     On the Second Sunday of Easter                             27 April 2014       Dear Friends: I beg your indulgence this morning to speak      more personally than the Second Sunday of Easter would      ordinarily suggest. You may permit me to do so, however,      since you have come to the Hilltop not     only to help me celebrate a very ``round'' birthday but also      to give your support to the education of young Jesuits. And      so the story of this one Jesuit's journey will be linked to      that of my fellow Jesuits as well as to you, my very dear      friends.       When yesterday, it seems--I entered the Society of Jesus, I      was setting forth on a journey for which there were indeed      words--the love of God, the service of our fellow human      beings, a vowed life in the Church--but only a fairly shallow      grasp of what they might mean. Yesterday, with other newly      entered Jesuits, we were young, vigorous, some had great      dreams, others cherished a blessed sense of duty, all sensed      that somehow the life they gave to the esteemed Society of      Jesus would also be found, truly, in that least Society.       And now, suddenly, I find myself . . . 80 years old. When I      entered the Novitiate during the presidency of Dwight D.      Eisenhower, under the papacy of Pius XII, and with John      Baptist Janssens as General Superior of the Society of Jesus,      order was a relative constant in our experience. Soon the      constant became change. In our formative years our nation was      shaken, for good and ill, by the civil rights movement, the      Vietnam War, Watergate. The Second Vatican Council, with      roots, we learned, in the liturgical, patristic, theological      and ethical scholarship of many Jesuits among others,      convened in a miraculous rush of time between 1962 and 1965.      New hope dawned for the Church in the world, most of us      thought, just when the world seemed most to need such a      beacon. Within a decade, the journey on which we had embarked      seemed to have mysteriously changed--to have become, in fact,      far more an adventure. We were invited to change, too, if we      were really to live in the time we were being given. Many      other friends had experiences somewhat similar, not least      because children change everything.                            The God of Time       The time we were being given: through it all there was this      constant: the patience and fidelity of God. In the Society of      Jesus we wanted liturgical participation, social renewal, a      newly intimate community life. Indeed, as the Society began      remarkably to appropriate the aggiornamento of the Council in      its General Congregations from the 31st onward, under the new      and (I deeply believe) sainted leadership of Pedro Arrupe, we      were called officially and authoritatively to recognize that      a community of loved sinners can only be faithful if it seeks      the unloved, stands with those who have been shunned, lives      but also learns in solidarity with the poor.       How clumsily, how unrealistically, with what a rush we      often sought our new goals and discovered that God, the Holy      Mystery who is our Absolute future, was patient with our      straining time, was even taking it into God's own life. (Some      of us became aware of what can only be called God's sense of      humor before the human spectacle.) The love of neighbor which      had seemed like the love of God, a moral imperative and      recommended pattern of behavior, proved to be far more: the      discovery of and entry into God's own life. God was not just      pleased if we could be healing, or encouraging, or messengers      of justice. God was there, in the care and hope and justice,      taking our time into God's own.       For if God is eternal but also offers divine life and grace      to a freely created world, then that world's time and      history, our time and history, becomes God's time and history      truly, too.       We had set off on a journey to a goal--and discovered that      we were already, however and even desperately unworthily,      already living in it. Through the patience of the Great Tutor      we were learning that incarnation was specific to a certain      time and place--but also calls all time and space to union      with it.                          The God of Suffering       Incarnation, however, means becoming fully human, and      sooner or later, one learns the cost of the endeavor. There      were ghastly events in political society such as the Balkans      war or the Rwanda genocide. There were what many of us      considered retreats from the ``aggressive fidelity'' of the      Council. Our own nation's struggles with racism, sexism, and      the serious poverty of many Americans seemed to fail as often      as they succeeded.       But there were more personal losses as well. We lost      parents and friends. We struggled with alcoholism and other      addictions. Cherished projects all too often failed. The      social legislation we favored did not pass. The promotion we      hoped for went to someone else. Anxiety became a nearer      neighbor. Many fellow Jesuits, a Provincial and not a few      best friends among them, left our company. The symphony's      scherzo proved to be a threnody.       But God was patient, was indeed perhaps most patient with      our suffering. The cross of Christ before which we had been      encouraged to ask: ``What have I done for Christ? What am I      doing for Christ? What shall I do for Christ?'' became      something not imagined but rather our immediate experience.      His suffering was ours, and ours his, because he had given      himself for and to us, and had claimed us to and for him.       And so, even more miraculous than life itself, there Christ      is--in the illiterate village, the anguished schizophrenic,      the solitary death row, all the battlegrounds of the world--     the whole Christ to whom all belong and they to him, the      crucified and risen one who is never a stranger but the      patient one who waits for us always--and from whose love      nothing, nothing, nothing can separate us.                           The God of Beauty       If the cross of Christ seals our time and shares our      suffering, revealing the patience of God, it awakens us also,      in ways I scarcely could have imagined all those years ago on      this Hilltop--yesterday--to the beauty of God. Darwin wrote      toward the end of his life and without apparent regret that      his scientific studies had led him no longer to be able to      enjoy Shakespeare. Dostoevsky, on the other hand, let Prince      Myshkin speak his hope: Beauty will save the world.       For many young people, ``the beautiful'' is a preoccupation      for an elite few. But with fellow Jesuits and so many of you      here today, I have learned how wonderfully various and      compelling God's world is. My Jesuit classmates included a      poet, historians, literary critics, high school and college      administrators, journalists and prolific authors, theologians      and philosophers, spiritual directors and retreat masters,      ethicists. We have served in North America, South America,      Europe, Africa and Asia. And if beauty is what arrests and      compels human attention, whether in the splendor of a sunset      or the sorrow of a scar, a Frederick Edwin Church landscape      or a character such as August Wilson's King Hedley II, we      have seen too much marvelous variety not to have become more      alert to the beauty of the artisan of it all.       It was easy enough to appreciate the harmonious, the      splendid, the musical moments of our experience. Harder to      recognize what distortion, darkness, dissonance reveal. But      the same Spirit that establishes order can comfort tears; the      Spirit that illumines can guide through the night; the Spirit      that teaches song can interpret discord. The beauty of God      can come in the mode of fulfillment, in achieved form and      luminous color and delicate balance, but also in the mode of      hope, in protest against violence, in fury at injustice, in      conscientious objection.       To say that the Spirit of God teaches us to see again and      to hope to see wholly is not to claim completion. I find      myself at 80 each year happier and more blessed to be a      Jesuit priest--but journeying still. This too: beauty is      always fresh, new, surprising. And if a patient God has made      our time God's own, and our suffering God's own, then how can      we not hope that in today's liturgy indeed but one day      finally and forever, God's Spirit will teach each of us the      most beautiful words of all:           Take me. I am yours.     Leo J. O'Donovan, S.J.                          ____________________
