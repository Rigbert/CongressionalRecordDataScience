 President, before Senator Boxer speaks, I want to thank all of my staff who have been involved in this. I will insert their names in the Record. Bill, Crystal, Alex, in my press shop, Mike, Pete, previous staff members have put in countless hours on this. Without them we would never do this. I certainly know that working with Senator Isakson's staff and the staff from EPW and Senator Boxer's staff. It takes a lot of people to get something done. A tremendous amount of people have worked on this. I thank them. Because of their work, we are going to ban asbestos, we are going to dramatically expand research and treatment, and we are going to launch a public education campaign so all Americans understand how they can protect themselves from the deadly asbestos products that may be in their home.  With that, I thank our chairwoman.
