 President, had I been present for the vote on the Dorgan amendment, I would have voted in favor of it.  We're coming up on the sixth anniversary of 9/11, and the bloodthirsty terrorist who plotted this slaughter of nearly 3,000 Americans is still a free man. Back then, could any of us ever have imagined such a failure on the part of this administration? Could any of us have believed that--more than half a decade later--Osama bin Laden would still be enjoying safe haven? Two wars and three elections later--and Osama remains unscathed.  What would our reaction have been nearly 6 years ago, had President Bush gone on national television and predicted this? What would we have said if he'd told us that the capture of the man who'd unleashed such horror simply wasn't a top priority of his administration? Would any American have believed him?
