President, I was about to congratulate the junior Senator from Tennessee on the same thing.  I am sorry that my good friend from Tennessee--whom I admire greatly; we worked together when he was in the President's Cabinet; we worked on many different things--I am sorry it happens to be a speech where he and I are on different sides. It was done with his usual care and cogency. He spoke to his experience, both as a former Governor with a distinguished record, a former Cabinet member with a distinguished record, one who served in business with a distinguished record. I appreciate having him here.  Sometimes debate can get rancorous and personal. To hear someone who takes a position, albeit different from mine, who does it with care, reflecting his past experience--I compliment the Senator from Tennessee.
