He has talked to Senator McConnell. They cannot assure us that they will be able to either pass anything tonight or send us anything tomorrow. They don't have an agreement.  In light of that, it is my judgment that the only alternative available to us is to pass, obviously, this short-term CR, which will keep the government open through Wednesday. We will leave after the last vote in this series, returning Tuesday at 10, with the first votes expected at 11.  Senator Reid believes that by Monday they will be able to pass some continuing resolution or some appropriation process for some period of time. We don't know what that is. I just talked to Senator Reid 10 minutes ago. There is not an agreement on that.  I know that this is not a happy circumstance during the holiday period, to have to return here; but it would be less happy if we waited here this evening, tomorrow, Sunday and Monday with the Senate not sending us anything. I don't think that is fair to you.  As a result, it is my intent that we will leave here after the last votes on this CR and send it to the Senate. The Senate will take it and will pass it. Senator McConnell and Senator Reid have agreed that they will pass this.  It is a simple CR, as Chairman Obey and Mr. Lewis will explain, and I think that will accommodate us, to the extent it is possible to accommodate us at this time.  I know everybody would like to finish today and go home for the holidays until we return January 5. I am in that rank myself. But we are where we are. That seems to me the best way to accommodate all of you, while at the same time accommodating our responsibility to take the action that is necessary to keep the government operating.                          ____________________
