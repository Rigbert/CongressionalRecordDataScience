  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, we have made a little progress here today. We can balance the budget of the Federal Government in 7 years; we can bring fiscal responsibility to Washington, DC. I myself have drawn up a detailed budget. It is going to require some tough choices.  But, Mr. Speaker, we are going to have to abandon goodies like huge tax cuts. We are going to have to go after corporate welfare and subsidies. We are going to have to reduce agriculture subsidies. We are going to have to go after the sacrosanct Pentagon and eliminate useless weapons like the B-2 bomber and star wars.  There are a number of other places where tough choices are going to have to be made. But in order to get there, we do not need to punish Federal employees and their families. We should stop doing that.  Mr. Speaker, we have made some progress on that today with a temporary resolution to put people back to work. There is a question of whether or not those employees, when they go back to their places of work, are going to have the resources they need to do their jobs. That may be resolved later this evening.  So, perhaps in addition to stopping the punishment of employees, we can stop the punishment of taxpayers. Put the Government back to work and Congress and the White House can get down to its job of balancing the budget.                          ____________________
