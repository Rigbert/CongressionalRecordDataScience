Speaker, I would like to honor former Congresswoman Jeannette Rankin, who deserves a special place in American History.  When I first came to the House of Representatives, I was one of just 24 women serving in Congress. Although a small cohort, this was made possible by Ms. Rankin, who was the first woman elected to Congress, 100 years ago.  Congresswoman Rankin was a part of the suffragist movement, even opening congressional debate on a Constitutional amendment to grant universal suffrage. She brought this same passion to her work in social welfare, advocating on behalf of women and children.  Today we have seen our ranks swell to 104 members of Congress. Research has shown that when women participate in government, it is more collaborative and more functional.  Congresswoman Jeannette Rankin was a trailblazer who shattered glass ceilings and proved to the American people that women's contributions are valuable and they are deserving of positions of power. For her tireless efforts, I worked to have a portrait commissioned in 2010, to fortify our institution's rich art history, paving a new way of democracy.  I know she would be proud to see the progress we have made, and prouder still of the indomitable spirit of American women, who continue to make their voices heard.                          ____________________
