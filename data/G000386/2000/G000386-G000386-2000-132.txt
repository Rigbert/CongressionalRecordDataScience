 President, I rise today to express my support for a provision included in the House-passed Department of Defense (DOD) Authorization bill which provides a permanent chiropractic benefit to all active military personnel. Iowans have a long history of support for the chiropractic profession. In fact, the nation's oldest institution of higher chiropractic learning--Palmer College--is located in Davenport, Iowa.  I am pleased that both the House and Senate have included provisions in their respective DOD authorization bills which expand access to chiropractic services for members of the military. These provisions follow on the heels of a multi-year pilot program enacted in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995. The pilot program demonstrated that military personnel who received chiropractic care had higher levels of satisfaction with the care they received as compared to personnel who only received traditional medical care. Furthermore, the pilot project demonstrated that chiropractic care would reduce hospitalization, return injured patients to work more quickly, and would result in a net savings to the Department of Defense in excess of $25 million annually.  The Defense Authorization Act passed by the House of Representatives begins the process of fully integrating chiropractic care into the military health care system on a direct access basis. The Senate-passed bill, however, limits chiropractic care through a medical gatekeeper. Direct access to chiropractic care would expedite the delivery of chiropractic care to those patients most in need of services and would free up existing health care providers to concentrate their time and efforts in other areas requiring attention. Therefore, I join the chiropractic profession in asking the conferees of the DOD Authorization legislation to accept the House-passed provision and provide direct access to chiropractic services to all active military personnel.                          ____________________
