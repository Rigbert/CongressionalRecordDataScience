Mr. Speaker, Republicans and Democrats agree on the need for health insurance to cover those who cannot afford it. But this legislation is the wrong way.  The health care bill is built on the shifting sands of higher premiums, increased taxes and reduced benefits. Such a foundation cannot last and will be washed away by the American people in the November election.  A majority of the American people want to choose their own health care plan, not have the government do it for them. Under this bill, many health care decisions will be made by federal employees, not patients and their doctors. The result will be less care at higher cost.
