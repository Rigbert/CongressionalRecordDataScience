 President, I just want to thank the chairman very much, and I concur with everything hehas said. For 40 years, federally qualified health centers have provided high quality primary health care for millions of Americans, regardless of their income, and as the chairman just indicated, they do that in a very cost-effective way. If the Appropriations Committee provides this funding, at least 4 million more Americans would gain access to the high-quality, affordable primary care available in our Nation's health centers in a very short period of time, with millions more getting access as the new centers get up and running. I thank the chairman again, and I look forward to working with him and my colleagues to make this a reality.
