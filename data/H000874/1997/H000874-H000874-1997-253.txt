 Senator Stevens is well-motivated and believes in this amendment, but I fear, my friends, that there are many on this House floor who believe this is the best they can get politically, freezing at last year's level with no RIF protection for Federal employees. That is what I fear, and that it will give them the opportunity and excuse not to pass appropriation bills and not have to pay the price of following their policy of shutting down government for which we paid such a dear price in November and January of 1995 and 1996.  That, my friends, is my fear on behalf of Federal employees, on behalf of the operations of this government, on behalf of doing our job in a responsible fashion.  Neither party comes with clean hands to this. I agree with my colleague from Florida, neither party comes with clean hands. All have been willing to play chicken in the appropriations process and put at risk Federal employees and those who receive services from the Federal Government.
