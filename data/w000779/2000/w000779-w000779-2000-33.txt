President, twenty-two days ago I was here on the Senate floor helping to secure the support of 100 Senators in passing the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000. It was a good day for rural Americans when the Senate adopted S. 1608 unanimously.  Today is even better for rural Americans. A few minutes ago, the Senate passed legislation that now reflects an agreement among all stakeholders--the schools, the counties, the House and Senate and the Administration--that assures House and Senate passage and the President's signature. This bill is the winning formula for everyone concerned about rural communities.  The bill the Senate has passed is fundamentally unchanged from S. 1608. The basics are the same: the purposes, the funding formula, and the flexibility for counties to choose how to spend a portion of the payment. The bill will provide stable payments for education and roads in more than 750 timber-dependent counties across this country and real opportunities for environmental restoration on our national forests.  The bill will make sure our rural communities do not become economic sacrifice zones. It will help people in forest communities adapt to changing national forest management policies by creating a funding formula alternative to timber receipts.  Policy changes in Washington, D.C. affecting logging on national forests across this country have caused timber receipts to fall an average of 70 percent over the last 15 years, and by as much as 90 percent in some areas. As timber receipts disappeared, roads fell deeper into disrepair, school programs were cut to the bone, and some schools even had to close their doors at least one day a week.  This legislation will give rural communities a more predictable payment formula than the current roller coaster system based on timber receipts. The amount going toward schools and roads would represent 80-85 percent of the three-year average of the highest payment years from fiscal years 1986 to 1999. The amount would be calculated on a state-by-state, three-high-year basis, but would be distributed among the counties on a county-by-county,three-high-year calculation. Unlike today's system, a county will receive its payment from the General Treasury, regardless of whether a single tree is cut on the national forests.  The bill before us today retains and improves upon a key element of S. 1608: that counties decide for themselves, in conjunction with other stakeholders, how they want to invest the remaining 15-to-20 percent of the average payment. This bill clarifies and underscores county flexibility to use the funds other than those designated for schools and roads in any combination a county chooses for: fire prevention and fighting wildfires; forest-related education; easement purchases; emergency services reimbursement; stewardship projects; maintenance of existing forest infrastructure; ecosystem restoration; and improvement of land and water quality on national forest lands.  There is no doubt about it. This legislation will change the traditional dynamic between logging and Federal payments to schools and counties. But altering the link between timber harvest and county payments does not mean we seek to sever the ties between people and land. This bill will strengthen the bond between communities and neighboring Federal forests. The authorized projects are a way for the Federal government to recognize--without relaxing or compromising our environmental commitments--that timber towns grow not just trees, but people, too.  S. 1608 is supported by thousands of groups, hundreds of counties, labor organizations and school groups including the National Education Association, National Association of Counties, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, as well as the AFL-CIO.  I particularly want to thank Senator Craig, Chairman of the Forests and Public Lands Subcommittee, for helping to bring us to where we are today. He has been tireless in his efforts. I also want to recognize the outstanding commitment of Senator Bingaman, the ranking member on the Energy Committee, and the incredible work of Senator Baucus, who brought additional attention to non-federal land county projects, including wildfire prevention.  I would also like to acknowledge the work of the staff on this legislation. In particular, Josh Kardon, my Chief of Staff, and Sarah Bittleman, my Natural Resources Counsel, have done yeoman's work on this legislation. Carole Grunberg, my Legislative Director, was always there with support and encouragement. And Jeff Gagne, my Education advisor, also contributed to the effort by figuring out the maze of Oregon education spending. Special thanks also goes to David Dye, Counsel to the Senate Energy Committee and to Mark Rey of the Energy Committee staff, whose steady hand and creativity helped resolve so many problems successfully; to Bob Simon and Kira Finkler, of the Energy Committee Democratic staff; and to Brian Kuehl with Senator Baucus, Sara Barth with Senator Boxer, and Peter Hanson with Senator Daschle.                          ____________________
