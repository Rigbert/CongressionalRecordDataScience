Speaker, I am pleased to recognize the 50th anniversary of the Jude Thaddeus Catholic War Veterans Post 1675 in Toledo, Ohio. The post celebrates its anniversary this month. On June 12, 1950, a charter was granted to the Jude Thaddeus Post by the National Department of the Catholic War Veterans. Those first meetings were conducted in the loft of the St. Francis de Sales Parish near downtown Toledo. After traveling from parish to parish for a time, the Post sought a permanent home. Those original members got to work in rehabilitating a small building on Stickney Avenue in North Toledo, which became the organization's first headquarters. As the membership expanded the Post moved again, establishing a hall and canteen on North Toledo's vibrant Lagrange Street. Tragedy struck, however, when a fire destroyed the building in 1965. Nonetheless with the help of the Ladies Auxiliary and every single other veterans organization in the neighborhood as well as many in the greater Toledo area, the Jude Thaddeus Post was able to regroup, raise funds, and rebuild at its present location.  The Post strives to maintain its mission to serve veterans. Residents of the Ohio Veterans Home are regularly brought to the post home for meals and games. The Auxiliary helps out every month at the Toledo VA Outpatient Clinic. The Post makes all kinds of donations to veterans hospitals in Ohio, and it lends equipment such as wheelchairs, canes and walkers to area veterans in need.  Saint Jude Thaddeus is the patron saint of impossible tasks. Through all the Post's trials and hardships, its namesake stood as a beacon and reminder that anything could be accomplished with prayer, cooperation, and effort. All members of the Jude Thaddeus Post of the Catholic War Veterans are proud to say, ``I belong'' and put that strength of belonging into practice to achieve their loftiest goals.  As the members of the Post and Auxiliary take time to celebrate and reflect on fifty years of growth and change, remembering friends and families who may no longer be with them, reliving old glories and hardships, yet still looking forward to the future and its possibilities. I am pleased to represent our community as a part of the celebration. May I offer my own, our community's, and our nation's everlasting thanks to the members of the Jude Thaddeus Post and Auxiliary for their sacrifice in battle, and equally important, for their accomplishments in peace.                          ____________________
