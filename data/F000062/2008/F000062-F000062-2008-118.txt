 President, I rise today, on the 1-year anniversary of the Supreme Court's landmark Massachusetts v. EPA decision on global warming pollution, to introduce the Greenhouse Gas Endangerment Finding Deadline and California Waiver Reconsideration Act. The bill would force the EPA and this administration to act--at long last--against global warming.  This legislation will impose two significant deadlines on the Environmental Protection Agency.  First, the legislation gives EPA 60 days to respond to the Massachusetts v. EPA ruling.  Second, this bill requires EPA to reconsider its unprecedented decision to deny the State of California a Federal waiver that would have allowed the State to limit tailpipe greenhouse gas pollution from cars and trucks.  Unfortunately, deadlines for EPA action are necessary in both cases.  In its landmark Massachusetts v. EPA ruling, issued 1 year ago today, the Supreme Court gave EPA a specific task: Determine whether the emissions of greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare, and then comply with the Clean Air Act requirements that result from this determination.  Yet 1 year later, EPA has done nothing. EPA Administrator Johnson pledged to act by December, but that day came and went.  I wrote to Administrator Johnson in January asking for a timeline for action.  He wrote back to tell me he could not give me one.  Last month, when I asked Mr. Johnson how many people were working on this endangerment finding, he could not tell me if anyone was working on it.  In a March 27, 2008, letter to me and many of my colleagues, EPA indicated that it intends to begin soliciting comments from the public as the Agency ``considers'' regulations of greenhouse gas emissions.  EPA's letter indicates that it does not intend to determine whether greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare, as the court instructed it to do, anytime in the near future.  Instead EPA's Administrator stated that ``implementing the Supreme Court's decision could affect many sources beyond just the cars and trucks considered by the Court,'' suggesting that the U.S. Supreme Court would have come to a different conclusion had it better understood the Clean Air Act.  The process will not begin until ``later this spring.''  EPA has no further timeline for action, nor has it set a deadline for completion.  The plaintiffs in the Massachusetts v. EPA case today returned to court to compel the EPA to act. This bill is intended to work in tandem with their suit, compelling EPA to take an action, which both the courts and the law indicate should not be unreasonably delayed. No one should interpret this bill as a substitute for the courts taking action to compel EPA to act without delay under existing law. Both the new lawsuit and this bill are prompted by the clear failure of EPA to act on a reasonable timeline.  Bottom Line: Responding to the Supreme Court's remand cannot and should not be delayed for an undefined period of time.  EPA has had a full year to collect public comment and consider the implications of its response, and it has done so. EPA staff told Congress that they spent thousands of hours writing an endangerment finding and proposed regulations this past autumn. A draft has already been submitted to the White House Office of Management and Budget.  This legislation puts EPA on the clock to finish the job it was assigned by the highest court in the land.  The second deadline in this legislation requires the EPA Administrator to reconsider, and either confirm or reject, EPA Administrator Johnson's December decision to deny California a Clean Air Act waiver.  Without the waiver, California and 15 other States are unable to control greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles.  EPA Administrator Johnson denied this waiver even though EPA's legal and technical staff unanimously recommended that the waiver be issued.  EPA's attorneys had told Mr. Johnson that a waiver denial in this case would ``in effect, amend the Clean Air Act by Administrative Action.''  They told him that EPA would be sued and ``was likely to lose suit.''  The decision was made before the legal justification had been written. EPA staff had been cut out of the process entirely.  His official legal document, issued more than 2 months after Mr. Johnson issued the decision, asserts that the waiver was denied based almost entirely on the legislative history of the 1967 Clean Air Act. His legal document made no mention of the fact that Congress rewrote the operative section in 1977.  In hearing after hearing, Mr. Johnson has asserted that he made this decision himself. Apparently he read the law differently than every one of his agency's experts and attorneys--a different reading he has never explained. But even he has acknowledged that the process under which this decision was made was unusual.  I believe that an unusual process led to an unusual result.  This bill would give EPA the opportunity to reconsider this decision. And with this reconsideration we will see whether a normal process will produce a different result.  This legislation sets firm deadlines by which EPA must complete its work. It instructs the administration to act in the face of climate change. It brings an end to the delay and obfuscation that impede progress.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2806       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Greenhouse Gas Endangerment      Finding Deadline and California Waiver Reconsideration Act''.     SEC. 2. REQUIREMENTS OF ADMINISTRATOR OF ENVIRONMENTAL                    PROTECTION AGENCY.       (a) Reconsideration of Denial.--Not later than June 30,      2009, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection      Agency (referred to in this section as the ``Administrator'')      shall reconsider, and confirm or reverse, the decision of the      Administrator to deny the request of the State of California      to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles.       (b) Issuance of Finding.--Not later than 60 days after the      date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall issue      a finding in accordance with--       (1) section 202(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C.      7521(a)(1)) with respect to whether the emission of      greenhouse gases from any 1 or more classes of new motor      vehicles or new motor vehicle engines, in the judgment of the      Administrator, causes or contributes to air pollution that      may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or      welfare; and       (2) the decision of the Supreme Court in Massachusetts v.      Environmental Protection Agency, 127 S. Ct. 1438 (2007).                          ____________________
