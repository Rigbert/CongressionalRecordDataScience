  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, the President has finally discovered that there is a threat of an avian bird flu pandemic despite the fact that it was discovered about 8 years ago. Experts have been talking about the threat of the pandemic for a number of years. Last year the President in his budget spent $182 million on chastity education and $100 million on preparation for a pandemic. That is for all investment in flus, vaccines, and antivirals and research.  I am glad that he has had a change of heart now. Now he is going to begin to adequately fund the threat, but it is getting pretty late. The U.S. does not make the vaccines. In fact, there is not a very good vaccine available. And we do not make the antivirals. And we are going to have to get in line behind every other country in the world that had better foresight than this administration.                          ____________________[Page H9448]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                               AVIAN FLU  (Mr. DeFAZIO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)
