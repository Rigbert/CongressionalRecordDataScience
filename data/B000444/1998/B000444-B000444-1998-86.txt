 President, on the Bumpers amendment, I voted against the position of Senator Bumpers, not because I disagree with the substance of it. For the last 25 years and for the years I was chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, I have adhered to the notion that the Judicial Conference, a system that we set up in the Congress years ago, is the appropriate vehicle to make recommendations for changes in the Federal rules. The reason I voted against the Bumpers amendment is not because I don't think prosecutors are out of hand, not because I don't think there is abuse of the grand jury system, which, by the way, for hundreds of years has relied upon the proposition that good judgment, sound judgment would be exercised by prosecutors and not be abused. Obviously, it is being abused.  My hope is, regardless of what the outcome of this is legislatively, I am going to propose at a future time that the Senate ask the Judicial Conference to consider changes in the Federal rules relative to the conduct of grand juries and make recommendations to the Senate. That is the way we have done it since the Judicial Conference has been set up. That is the more appropriate way to deal with the Federal rules.  I conclude by complimenting Senator Bumpers for pointing out an abuse of the system and the need for change. I think the appropriate way to do it is through the Federal rules.
