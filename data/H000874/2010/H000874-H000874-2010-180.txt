 I want to thank Chairman Conyers for his extraordinary leadership on behalf of the rights of all peoples. His role in the civil rights movement has been extraordinary, and it continues to this date.  Madam Speaker, I rise on behalf of this resolution and in memory of an extraordinary woman.  I had the privilege of knowing Dorothy Height for some four decades. That does not mean that I saw her regularly during those four decades, but I saw her frequently during those four decades. She also exuded the positive, constructive approach that she took to solving problems, to bringing people together. The historian Taylor Branch rightly called Dr. Height's brothers and sisters in the civil rights movement the ``modern founders of democracy.''  Today, we honor the legacy that she leaves behind. What a wonderful, long, productive, constructive, important life we honor in Dorothy Height.  Dorothy Height was an extraordinarily gracious human being. When meeting with her, I never failed to leave her side and not feel better. I would feel better about the relationship that I had with her and that she had with others as I saw her interface with others in the room, in the crowd, in the meeting. Dorothy Height was and is a giant. The Washington Post had on its front page today a very large picture of Dorothy Height. It was appropriate that, in the Nation's capital, Dorothy Height would be given such prominence, not for her death but for the life that she lived, for the contributions she made.  We are all better for Dorothy Height's life. We are all freer for Dorothy Height's life. We were lifted as a society by Dorothy Height and by those with whom she worked from a segregated society where the perception was that some Americans were not equal to other Americans. That was contrary to the premise articulated by Thomas Jefferson but not lived out by Thomas Jefferson and our Founding Fathers. Their premise was accurate, but their practice was not. Martin Luther King, Jr.; Dorothy Height; John Conyers; John Lewis, who serves with us; Jim Clyburn, our whip; and so many others called America's attention to the fact that it was not living out the reality of its promise, not just to African Americans but to all Americans.  Dorothy Height showed extraordinary courage and conviction in the face of bigotry and discrimination. Like so many in this body who faced bigotry and discrimination, they did not allow that to poison their souls. They did not allow that to diminish their relationships even with those whom they saw as oppressors. To that extent, they rose above the conduct directed at them in order to change that conduct through love and positive engagement. Dorothy Height is a perfect example to all of us, young and old, who are participating in this society which, unfortunately, too often we see today falls into anger and confrontation rather than civility and discussion.                              {time}  1315  I am worried about the anger that I see in the society today. In some respects I think not justified at the level that we find it. Yes, there is room for disagreement, but Dorothy Height shows us that notwithstanding the fact that there may be disagreement, notwithstanding the fact that there may be people who do not treat us as we would want to be treated, that the way to solve that is to do so constructively and civilly with debate that states the facts and the truth but does not devolve into hate and division.  So I am pleased to join my friend John Conyers. I came to Congress some 30 years ago, and we were talking about making Martin Luther King, Jr.'s birthday a national holiday, not a holiday to play but a holiday to recognize the contribution that was made then and the work that still remains to be done. John Conyers had me out in front of the Capitol on January 15 or close to that time every year, and I was so proud to stand with him and say to America let us recognize those who, as Taylor Branch has said, are the modern founders of democracy.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your leadership. Thank you for bringing this resolution to the floor to recognize an extraordinary, wonderful, lovely person whose spirit enriched us all and enriched our country.
