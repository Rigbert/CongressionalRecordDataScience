 President, in a minute and 20 seconds I will give five reasons why the Senator is wrong, in my view. One, he makes conclusory statements. Two, major physical assets is defined in the amendment, and it is amazing how inventive he is about redefining what is in the amendment. He accurately read everything the GAO said, but that is not what we say in amendment. Four, we want competition to be skewed between long-term investment so we do not have our children paying the same price they are paying for the accumulated debt we have here. And five, nobody else does it the way my friend from Utah wants it done. I think it is time we ask ourselves, ``I wonder why.''  I urge those of us in this body who agree with the need for a capital budget to vote against tabling.
