 President, we are trying to clear, with both sides, a number of matters. We have worked out a number of committee amendments, and we have several that we are trying to clear with the other side of the aisle at the moment. I want to take a minute to thank Senator Kerrey for his leadership on the committee. We have had a number of hearings throughout the year. Some of them have been tough hearings. He has made a real contribution to the tax system changes that we envision in the future.  We have set up a task force that he is involved in. As a matter of fact, he suggested this to me a year or so ago, as he was not satisfied--and he worked on this committee before I had --with the modernization program of the Internal Revenue Service and thought that, of all the agencies in Government, Internal Revenue Service should be on the cutting edge of technology and should not be behind in any way. Some of us are concerned that maybe the IRS is getting behind. Getting behind what? The marketplace.  There has been a tremendous revolution in the software industry, and Senator Kerrey and I both have talked and met with various people that are dealing in financial electronic software of various kinds. The market, it seems to me, is farther ahead in various areas than the IRS. This is not a good sign for the future of the IRS or the future of Government, because most people in America always thought--and I came to believe it--that the IRS had the best of everything and was on the cutting edge. But I will submit to you that they are not. I believe the Senator from Nebraska believes that. He is also interested in--and so am I--the task force to study the IRS and our tax laws and everything that goes with it. I believe we are going to get some good results out of that, some great recommendations. He may want to take a minute to talk about that.
