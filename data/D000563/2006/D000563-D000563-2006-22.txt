LCpl Keeling was killed on June 9, 2005, in an explosion in Iraq. He was assigned to the Marine Reserve's 3rd Battalion, 25th Regiment, 4th Marine Division based out of Akron, OH. He was 29 years old.  LCpl Keeling leaves his mother and step-father, Sharon and Robert Berry, his father Tom Keeling; his sister Erin Keeling, and his twin sister Kristen Keeling.  Thomas--Tom to his family and friends--graduated from Strongsville High School in 2000 and then attended Kent State University, graduating in 2004 with a Criminal Justice degree. Matthew Kichinka from Strongsville knew Tom as ``Tommy Boy.'' He reminisced about his high school friend:       I still remember the first time we met in home room 10th      grade year. You were my best friend in high school. I will      never forget the great times we've shared, the mischief we      caused in gym class, and the nights we closed at the kitchen      at Giant Eagle. Thank you friend, for being there for me      during those difficult times in high school and being the      best friend a person could have.  Dave Murphy of Middleburg Heights, OH, moved to Strongsville not knowing a soul--that is until he met Tom. As Dave put it:       I moved to Strongsville when I was young. I was concerned I      wouldn't find any friends, I was blessed enough to move in      across the street from the Keelings. Before the moving trucks      even drove away, Tom was in my yard inviting me into his.      This is a perfect example of the person Tom was. He was truly      compassionate for others and a great friend.  Mary Jo Webster from Berea, OH, was Tom's 6th grade teacher. She remembers him as ``a lively, happy child.'' Friends knew him as always having fun and doing things he enjoyed. Whether he was playing hockey in Parma Heights, in his softball league, or shooting hoops with friends in his neighborhood, he was always active. Teammates took pride in their skillful forward. He had outstanding agility and tremendous speed. But his interests were not just in the sports that he was playing, he was interested in the people and the relationships it takes to build a team.  When Tom was at Kent State, he worked in housekeeping to earn extra money. Paula Hill described her custodial co-worker by saying that ``he was one of the nicest young gentlemen I've ever met. I called him my number three son because he was as close to me as my own children.''  When Tom graduated from college, he was considering a career in the FBI. His mother Sharon said that ``Tom's dream was to become an FBI agent, and he chose going to the Marine Corps because he thought he would get some experience that would help him along his career.''  Tom had been a Reservist for 4 years, and his stepfather and grandfather were both marines. He looked up to his grandfather, who was a World War II veteran and had been awarded two Purple Hearts. When Tom died, he was buried next to him.  Tom once told his stepfather that he was proud of the job that the U.S. troops were doing in Iraq and that he could see things improving. Tom had been in Iraq since February 2005, and was assigned to a mobile strike force seeking insurgents in the Anbar province near the Syrian border. ``Sometimes they go out seven days at a time. They'd patrol cities during the day and go out in the desert at night,'' his step-father said.  But Tom's work in Iraq didn't stop on the field of battle. In weekly care packages, his family made sure to send him candy and Beanie Babies to hand out to Iraqi children. Tom's ability to connect with the children of the country he was trying to protect was a testament to the kind, gentle soul that Tom Keeling was.  Nate Ickes from Akron, OH, honored his brother-in-arms by saying:       I was honored to have served with Tom. He brought joy and      laughter to everyone in our unit. There was never a day that      went by that he did not have a smile on his face.  Close friends, like Emily Laurie of Charleston, SC, understand the impact Tom had on the people he touched. She wrote words of comfort in a posting on an Internet tribute website. This is what she wrote:       Remember Tom with a smile. Remember the good things, the      good times, and the laughter. He is a hero, endowed with      great courage and strength and has sacrificed his life for      the freedom of others. He will be missed, but not forgotten.  Close family friend Mark Nutter from Brunswick, OH, also paid tribute to Tom's memory in an online website by saying the following:       I just wanted to say thank you for letting me be a part of      your family for a few years. I got the chance to know the man      that later became the closest thing I have ever had to a      little brother. Tom not only quickly became my friend. He      became my family. He became my brother. Tom was one of the      greatest people that I will ever know and have ever known in      my whole life. I will miss him dearly.  Mark went on to write:       I am posting this because I came through on a small promise      I made to Tom when he passed away. Tom played softball with      my friends and me for a few years. The friends Tommy made on      the team, including me, made a promise to win our league      championship for him.       Well Tom, we did it, and we did it for you. I had your old      jersey hanging proudly in our dugout all year for you and as      long as we play, we always will. I had a picture of Tom and a      simple quote below him before our championship games. It      read, `Win 2 for Tommy.' Tom, we won two for you that night      and our first league title.       I will miss Tom dearly and hope his family knows what he      meant to me. Thanks for the good times. They will always be      in my heart. Thank you, again, Tom. It was a pleasure to have      known you.  Marine LCpl Thomas Keeling had a zest for life, a love of family and friends, and a deep understanding of what it means to serve. My wife Fran and I continue to keep his family and friends in our thoughts and prayers.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 20 minutes.
