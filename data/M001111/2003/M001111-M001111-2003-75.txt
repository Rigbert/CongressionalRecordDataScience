 President, my amendment helps States implement the No Child Left Behind Act by providing $80 million for high quality data systems. I was proud to create this program as part of our reauthorization of the Institute of Education Sciences last year because I saw a real need to help States do this right. Requiring lots of testing only has a benefit to our students if the results of those tests are used to help teachers focus their teaching on weak spots and to help superintendents, principals and policymakers direct resources where they are needed most.  Funding these data systems with this amendment will make sure that the testing and attendance data required by No Child Left Behind are put to good use. Frankly, when I come down here to the Senate floor I usually prefer to talk about students, teachers and parents--not data systems. But it is clear to me that funding these data systems will do a lot more than buy computers and pay programmers. When I wrote this program I worked closely with the Harvard Civil Rights Project. They also see the danger to students--mostly poor and minority students--if no one is keeping track of what's happening to them.  All the new testing and accountability required in No Child Left Behind creates a real risk that kids who are having trouble passing those tests will drop out or be pushed out of school. The newspapers have been filled in recent months with stories of these so-called ``pushouts''--students who are discouraged from completing school because their test scores are low and threaten the school's ``adequate yearly progress.''  The focus on this new phenomenon has raised serious questions about the ``Texas Miracle'' by pointing out the large numbers of students who are simply disappearing from our school systems. In July, the Houston Chronicle ran an article celebrating a new system--funded through a Federal grant--that is helping educators in Houston keep kids in school. They are using a data system to help lower their dropout rate, and they are definitely not the only ones who need help to do that. The high quality, longitudinal, statewide data systems that this amendment would help build are one of the best tools we have to keep kids in school.  Information is a powerful tool, and only by knowing which students are not showing up can our schools make an effort to find those students and help them. There are a lot of challenges today to keeping our teenagers in school, and I am not saying that data systems are the only answer. In fact, I have introduced a whole bill focused on literacy and counseling and school reform to address many of the issues contributing to high dropout rates. But I know that funding these data systems can make a difference.  Over the last few years I have secured funds to help Washington State develop a data system that will truly support the mission of leaving no child behind by ensuring that every child is counted. The work they have done to develop a high-quality, statewide system is really impressive, and I know that they and other States across our country need this funding to make that possible.  I'd like to thank the Senators from New Hampshire and Nevada for working with me to fund this program. You can see that this is not a partisan issue. We need to pass this amendment and provide this funding to give States a critical tool to implement the No Child Left Behind Act. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting funding for this program.  I ask unanimous consent to have two articles printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:              [From the Houston Chronicle, July 30, 2003] Tool Tracks Potential Dropouts; Profiler Software Lets HISD Keep Tabs                           on At-Risk Students                           (By Zanto Peabody)       The Houston school district has a high-tech new way to keep      high school dropouts--by catching them before they leave.       With a new computer database available at every campus this      fall, teachers can keep a virtual eye on every student and      identify those at risk of leaving. For the first time,      educators can look up a student's attendance and discipline      records, immigration status, grades, and test scores at one      source and use that information to predict dropouts.       ``All students will know someone is watching them, tracking      them, and is interested in their success,'' school board      member Laurie Bricker said at a news conference Wednesday.       Houston Independent School District has been developing the      PASS software--the Profiler for Academic Success of      Students--for more than three years, Chief Academic Officer      Robert Stockwell said, but recent events have underscored the      need for it       Starting with an investigation of possible dropout-     reporting fraud at Sharpstown High School and culminating      with a state audit that may lower the district's      accountability rating, HISD has come to know how badly it      handles some student data.       ``The dropout issue is a key battleground for our future,''      Stockwell said. ``We must keep these students in school and      learning. Failure is not an option.''       The Sharpstown investigation showed that employee can and      have changed student records to reflect lower dropout rates.      The state investigation and one by a district task force      exposed computer records managed so badly that the district      has no way of knowing where students have gone.       In an attempt to escape Texas Education Agency sanctions,      HISD has promised to monitor students at risk of quitting.      District officials also are considering a plan to assign an      adult to each at-risk student.       Lee High School Principal Steve Amstutz said the newest      version of the PASS program will make that task easier.      During a demonstration of the program, Amstutz was able to      determine which fictional students were likely dropout      candidates--students who missed too many days recently or      whose grades dropped suddenly.       ``In the past, that would have taken a small army of people      looking through obscure records,'' Amstutz said.       HISD Chief Business Officer Cathy Mincberg said the      district developed its own program, using a $1.1 million      federal grant, because no other school in the nation has such      a comprehensive way of tracking students.                                  ____      The ``Zero Dropout'' Miracle: Alas! Alack! A Texas Tall Tale                          (By Michael Winerip)       Houston, Aug. 13.--Robert Kimball, an assistant principal      at Sharpstown High School, sat smack in the middle of the      ``Texas miracle.'' His poor, mostly minority high school of      1,650 students had a freshman class of 1,000 that dwindled to      fewer than 300 students by senior year. And yet--and this is      the miracle--not one dropout to report!       Nor was zero an unusual dropout rate in this school      district that both President Bush and Secretary of Education      Rod Paige have held up as the national showcase for      accountability and the model for the federal No Child Left      Behind law. Westside High here had 2,308 students and no      reported dropouts; Wheatley High 731 students, no dropouts. A      dozen of the city's poorest schools reported dropout rates      under 1 percent.       Now, Dr. Kimball has witnessed many amazing things in his      58 years. Before he was an educator, he spent 24 years in the      Army, fighting in Vietnam, rising to the rank of lieutenant      colonel and touring the world. But never had he seen an urban      high school with no dropouts. ``Impossible,'' he said.      ``Someone will get pregnant, go to jail, get killed.''      Elsewhere in the nation, urban high schools report dropout      rates of 20 percent to 40 percent.       A miracle? ``A fantasy land,'' said Dr. Kimball. ``They      want the data to look wonderful and exciting. They don't tell      you how to do it; they just say, `Do it.' '' In February,      with the help of Dr. Kimball, the local television station      KHOU broke the news that Sharpstown High had falsified its      dropout data. That led to a state audit of 16 Houston      schools, which found that of 5,500 teenagers surveyed who had      left school, 3,000 should have been counted as dropouts but      were not. Last week, the state appointed a monitor to oversee      the district's data collection and downgraded 14 audited      schools to the state's lowest rating.       Not very miraculous sounding, but here is the intriguing      question: How did it get to the point that veteran principals      felt they could actually claim zero dropouts? ``You need to      understand the atmosphere in Houston,'' Dr. Kimball said.      ``People are afraid. The superintendent has frequent meetings      with principals. Before they go in, the principals are      really, really scared. Panicky. They have to make their      numbers.''       Pressure? Some compare it to working under the old Soviet      system of five-year plans. In January, just before the      scandal broke, Abelardo Saavedra, deputy superintendent,      unveiled Houston's latest mandates for the new year. ``The      districtwide student attendance rate will increase from 94.6      percent to 95 percent,'' he wrote. ``The districtwide annual      dropout rate will decrease from 1.5 percent to 1.3 percent.''       Dropuots are notoriously difficult to track, particularly      at a heavily Latino school like Sharpstown, with immigrants      going back and forth to Mexico. Dr. Kimball said that     Sharpstown shared one truant officer with several schools.      Even so, Houston officials would not allow principals to      write that the whereabouts of a departed student were      ``unknown.'' Last fall, Margaret Stroud, deputy      superintendent, sent a memorandum warning principals to      ``make sure that you do not have any students coded `99,'      whereabouts unknown.'' Too many ``unknowns,'' she wrote,      could prompt a state audit--the last thing Houston leaders      wanted.       A shortage of resources to track departing students? No      ``unknowns'' allowed? What to do? ``Make it up,'' Dr. Kimball      said. ``The principals who survive are the yes men.''       As for those who fail to make their numbers, it is      termination time, one of many innovations championed by Dr.      Paige as superintendent here from 1994 to 2001. He got rid of      tenure for principals and mandated that they sign one-year      contracts that allowed dismissal ``without cause'' and      without a hearing.       On the other hand, for principals who make their numbers,      it is bonus time. Principals can earn a $5,000 bonus,      district administrators up to $20,000. At Sharpstown High      alone, Dr. Kimball said, $75,000 in bonus money was issued      last year, before the fictitious numbers were exposed.       Dr. Paige's spokesman, Dan Langan, referred dropout      questions to Houston officials, but said that the secretary      was proud of the accountability system he established here,      that it got results and that principals freely signed those      contracts.       Terry Abbott, a Houston district spokesman, agreed that      both Dr. Paige and the current superintendent, Kaye      Stripling, pressured principals to make district goals.      ``Secretary Paige said, and rightfully so, the public has a      right to expect us to get this job done,'' Mr. Abbott said.      The principals were not cowed, he said, declaring, ``They      thrive on it.'' Every administrator under Dr. Paige and Dr.      Stripling, Mr. Abbott said, has understood ``failure is not      an option'' and ``that failure to do our jobs can mean that      we could lose those jobs--and that's exactly the way it      should be.''       As for adequate resources for truant officers to verify      dropouts, he said individual schools decided how to use their      resources, but added, ``money is not the problem, and money      by itself won't solve the issues we deal with every day.''       To skeptics like Dr. Kimball, the parallels to No Child      Left Behind are depressing. The federal law mandates that      every child in America pass reading and math proficiency      tests by 2004--a goal many educators believe is as impossible      as zero dropouts. And like Houston's dropout program,      President Bush's education budget has been criticized as an      underfinanced mandate, proposing $12 billion this year for      Title 1, $6 billion below what the No Child Left Behind law      permits. ``This isn't about educating children,'' Dr. Kimball      said. ``It's about public relations.''       If Houston officials were interested in accountability, he      said, they would assign him to a high school to monitor the      dropout data that he has come to understand so well. Instead,      after he blew the whistle on Sharpstown High, he was      reassigned, for four months, to sit in a windowless room with      no work to do. More recently, he has been serving as the      second assistant principal at a primary school, where, he      said, he is not really needed. ``I expect when my contract is      up next January, I'll be fired,'' he said. ``That's how it      works here.''
