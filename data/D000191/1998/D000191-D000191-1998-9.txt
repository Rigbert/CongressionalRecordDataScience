  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, the Republican majority says there are two reasons we cannot approve the President's program for local education, for teachers, for smaller class size and school improvements.  One, they say there is no time. Well, the President made the proposal in January. Since then, this Congress has worked 110 days here in Washington, D.C. Not bad for a $137,000-a-year salary. But the average American, at a $30,000-a-year salary, has worked 201 days, while these clowns have only worked 110. And they say there is no time to do the people's business.  Then they say there is no money. There is no money for kids, for education, for schools. Yet on the front page of the Washington Post, they document more than $50 million stuffed in the DOD bill with no consideration, including a quarter of a million dollars for pharmacokinetics research. That is the study of the use of stay-alert chewing gum, which is manufactured in the hometown of one member of that committee. One quarter of one million dollars will be spent, but there is no money for teachers, no money for kids, no money for school.  Shame on the Republicans.                          ____________________
