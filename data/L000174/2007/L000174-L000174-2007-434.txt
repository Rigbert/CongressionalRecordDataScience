President, earlier today, we had a meeting of the Senate Appropriations Committee. Defense Secretary Gates and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Pace were there. I was at that meeting. I had questions that I asked. I have been bothered since the meeting, not so much by what they said, but by what has happened in the last few days.  Every one of us, when we turn on our television set, sees the devastation in Kansas by a tornado--something we would not see in my State of Vermont. But even in a State where these are not unusual things, the devastation of this tornado was unique. I thought yesterday about how the President of the United States, through his spokesperson, blatantly dismissed the all too real concerns of the Governor of Kansas, Governor Sebelius, about the equipment levels available to our National Guard for dealing with such emergencies at home as this horrible disaster I spoke of that befell Greensburg, KS.
