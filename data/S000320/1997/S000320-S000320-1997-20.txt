 President, I am pleased to rise today to introduce legislation to honor John McKinley. John McKinley was a statesman, an influential State legislator, one of the founding trustees of the University of Alabama, U.S. Senator, and the first U.S. Supreme Court Justice from the State of Alabama.  Born on May 1, 1780, in Culpepper County, VA, John McKinley began his career in Kentucky after learning the law on his own. In 1818, he moved to Alabama and shortly after his arrival, McKinley, along with Andrew Jackson and John Coffee, became a member of the Cypress Land Co. This company was the largest single purchaser of land in north Alabama in the land boom of 1818. In addition to pursuing his fortune, John McKinley almost immediately entered Alabama politics. In 1820, he was elected to the State legislature.  In 1826, McKinley was elected by the State legislature to the U.S. Senate where he served until 1831. In the Old Senate Chamber, just down the hall, he espoused a political theory that to many in Washington may seem quaint. He believed that the national government's sovereignty was limited solely to the powers granted by the Constitution unless expressly relinquished by the States. As chairman of the Committee on Public Lands, he promoted transferring Federal lands to the States for economic development. Defeated for a second term in the Senate, McKinley returned to the Alabama legislature.  In the legislature, McKinley gained considerable influence by denouncing the national bank and endorsing President Jackson s efforts to dismantle it. He also supported Martin Van Buren, Jackson's candidate for President in 1836. When the Jacksonian Democrats regained control of the State legislature, the new majority re-elected McKinley to the Senate. Shortly thereafter, as a reward for his loyalty to Jackson and endorsement of Van Buren, the newly elected President nominated McKinley for a seat on the Supreme Court. The Senate confirmed his nomination 1 week later on September 25, 1837, by voice vote.  Justice John McKinley was assigned to the ninth circuit, which encompassed Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi. While riding circuit in Mobile, AL, Justice McKinley heard the first of three cases collectively known as Bank of Augusta versus Earle. In this controversial decision, McKinley upheld an Alabama statute prohibiting out-of-State banks from making loans in Alabama. The case which was appealed to the Supreme Court was heard in 1839.  The Court overturned the McKinley decision, and only McKinley dissented. Chief Justice Roger Taney wrote the majority opinion which declared that there was a law of comity that applied among the States. Therefore, a bank had as much a legal right to offer interstate loans as they do in the charter State. In the lone dissent, however, McKinley made the interesting point that the Court's majority had applied the State sovereignty doctrine in the extreme and that the States ceased to be nations when they ratified the Constitution.  His most significant contribution to the Court was writing the majority opinion in Pollard's Lesse versus Hagan (1845). This opinion declared that the Federal Government held public lands in trust until a territory became a State. At the time a territory entered the Union, the public land was rightfully State property. This decision provided a legal basis for opening public lands and for furthering economic development.  In addition to Pollard, Justice McKinley wrote nine other opinions in 1845, his most prolific year on the Court. After 1845, his work became sporadic due to general poor health. He attended, however, the Court's sessions as regularly as possible and contributed as best he could. John McKinley remained a member of the Court until his death in the spring of 1852.  There is no Federal building to honor Justice McKinley, and the legislation that I am introducing will correct this oversight. The bill designates the Federal courthouse and U.S. Post Office complex in Florence, AL as the ``Justice John McKinley Federal Building.'' The legislation has received the endorsement of the following: Mayor Frost and the Florence City Council, the Lauderdale County Commission, Tennessee Valley Historical Society, Florence Historical Board, Heritage Preservation, Inc., the Alabama State Bar Association, the Lauderdale County Bar Association, and the McKinley Young Lawyers of the Shoals.  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and pay tribute to this Alabama statesman.                          ____________________
