Speaker, one hundred years ago the Ironworkers Local #55 joined together in union in Toledo, Ohio. lam pleased to recognize this milestone anniversary and pay tribute to the union's courageous founders and all of the men and women who followed them over the course of a century.  In 1903 the idea of unionization was viewed as radical, and often dangerous for those who pursued it. Yet, men working to build our cities, the bridges, skyscrapers, schools and factories which were changing the American landscape worked under dangerous conditions themselves. They found themselves not only at the mercy of difficult working conditions, but subject to forces who did not respect them and the jobs they did. They worked long hours for low pay, no compensation for injury or sickness, and little if any thought was given to their general welfare. The Ironworkers Union itself was only seven years old when Toledo's Local #55 was chartered on February 16, 1903, 104 members strong. Toledo's ironworkers have been an integral part of the growth and development of the Ironworkers Union since the beginning.  The first recorded ironworker union jobs came that same year, with the Illinois Steel Company's construction of a cantilever bridge and two turntables for the Toledo Furnace Company. Just two years after its founding, Ironworkers Local #55 struck one of Toledo's largest and prominent contractors, A. Bentley and Sons. Though the strike was ultimately unsuccessful, the action showed clearly that the infant union was willing to battle even the largest, most anti-union companies. At the close of the century's first decade, Ironworkers Local #55 was firmly established and under the capable and visionary leadership of William R. ``Big Bill'' Walters, the union's first business agent, who went on to serve the union in various offices until 1935. Since him, many noble leaders have guided the union through both hard times and prosperity.  The union gave its members good jobs with good wages, health care and pension benefits, injury compensation, and sickness and death benefits. Just as importantly, it offered its members and their families the spirit of workers united in the common goal of bettering the lives of everyone. Out of this spirit came a sense of camaraderie, of loyalty, of protection and pride in what they were all trying to build together. I have been privileged to be welcomed into this spirit, and it is uniquely union.  A look around our region reveals the accomplishments of Ironworkers Local #55 union members. Their skill and hard work gave us signature bridges, downtown skyline, the schools which educate our children, monuments paying tribute to our efforts as community and Nation. We owe Toledo's City Hall, Ohio Building, Spitzer Building, Swayne Field, Toledo Museum of Art additions, Bell Building, Toledo Public Library, Acme Power Plant, Standard Oil, Pure Oil, Sun Oil and Gulf Oil refineries, Federal Building, Owens-Illinois Fiberglass Tower, Medical College of Ohio, Davis-Besse Power Plant, Islamic Center of Greater Toledo, Summit Center and the Valentine Theatre to Local 55 members, just to name a few of our region's significant buildings whose frameworks were formed by ironworkers. Now, as its second century dawns, Ironworkers Local #55 members are undertaking the construction of our region's largest single project to date: the new 8,800 foot long, 120 foot high Maumee River Crossing.  I join with members and friends of Ironworkers local #55 past and present in celebrating one hundred years of history. It is these ``cowboys of the sky'', along with fellow members of the building trades, who built America. We stand along side them and look to the future as together we continue to build our Nation.                          ____________________
