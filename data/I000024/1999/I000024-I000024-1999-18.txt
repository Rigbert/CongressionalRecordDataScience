President, with all of the tributes to Senator John Chafee over the last few weeks I think it is important that we do not forget his talented and dedicated staff. In particular I would like to thank his staff on the Environment and Public Works Committee. He assembled a very professional team, well respected not only on both sides of the aisle but also within the larger environmental professional community.  I call special attention to Senator Chafee's staff director, Jimmie Powell. Jimmie has served Congress over the last 20 years in various positions, and has worked on every major environmental statute over the last 20 years. Earlier this year, the National Journal called him a ``low key aide whose political insights and institutional memory are sought out by industry lobbyists.'' This is an understatement. There is no Senate staffer, or House staffer, with more environmental experience and political know-how than Jimmie Powell.  I believe that Jimmie served his boss, Chairman Chafee well. I did not always agree with the positions that Senator Chafee took, but Jimmie always did an excellent job in representing his boss's interests. I am not sure what position Jimmie Powell will take next, but I am confident that he will approach any new challenge with the same integrity and honor he exhibited as a Senate staffer.                          ____________________
