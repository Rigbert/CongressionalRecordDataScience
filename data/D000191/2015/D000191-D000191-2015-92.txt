SHUSTER. I yield to the gentleman from Oregon.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Madam Chair, I would suggest that I would like to continuethe discussion. I think there are different conditions.  Certainly if a developer buys a large tract of land next to an existing interstate and then expects the taxpayers to pay for sound protection, that is not right. But I think there are cases where you have found that a lot of interstates were built in areas where there wasn't a lot of traffic. The houses have been there for quite some time, and now the traffic has grown phenomenally, particularly truck traffic and things that create more noise. I think there may be a way to do it in certain circumstances where it is merited, where it isn't due to new development but due to growth and traffic and noise and that.  I don't know if the chairman has considered that.
