President, I rise today to bring to light an important issue which threatens our national security and begs the attention of Congress. The legislation I propose today seeks to end the Iranian government's acquisition of sensitive military equipment by blocking the Pentagon's sale of F-14 fighter jet parts.  It is the sensitive job of the Department of Defense to demilitarize and auction off surplus military equipment. However, recent investigations and reports have uncovered a frightening trend regarding the sale of F-14 ``Tomcat'' aircraft parts. U.S. customs agents have discovered F-14 parts being illegally shipped to Iran by brokers who bought F-14 surplus equipment from Department of Defense auctions.  Other than the United States, Iran is the only Nation to fly the F-14. The U.S. allowed Iran to buy 79 F-14s before its revolution in 1979. Fortunately, most of Iran's F-14s are currently grounded for lack of parts.  We know that Iran is pursuing a nuclear weapons capability. We know that the Department of State has identified Iran as the most active state sponsor of terrorism. We know that the sale of spare parts for F-14s could make it more difficult to confront the nuclear weapons capability of Iran. And yet F-14 parts are still being sold by the DoD.  Iran's F-14s, especially with the parts to get more of them airborne, greatly strengthen its ground war potential, harming our national and global security. Our country should be doing everything possible to deny the brutal regime in Tehran access to spare parts for their F-14 fleet.  The Department of Defense will tell you that it is already taking action to control the sale of F-14 parts. A few times a year they change the restriction on the sale of F-14 parts. But history has shown us that these rules are not enough. The Department has been caught still selling F-14 parts, even when its rules forbid it. It has sold F-14 parts to companies that have turned out to be fronts for the Iranians. More recently, the DoD sold sensitive technology, including classified F-14 parts to undercover GAO investigators.  My intention with this bill is to make it crystal clear to the Department of Defense that it may not sell any F-14 parts to anyone for any reason. There should be no chance for the parts to make their way to the Iranians.  Additionally, my bill would prohibit the export of any F-14 parts that have already been sold. This prevents the parts from ending up in Iran through even the most roundabout route.  I am not trying to reform the entire military surplus sales process. I am confident that the Armed Services Committee will continue its investigations and propose some much needed changes. My bill would simply fix a very specific, but very important, problem: the sale of F-14 components that end up in the hands of Iran.  I urge the members of the Senate to support this bill.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 387       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Stop Arming Iran Act''.     SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON SALE BY DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE OF PARTS                    FOR F-14 FIGHTER AIRCRAFT.       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:       (1) The Department of Defense is responsible for      demilitarizing and auctioning off sensitive surplus United      States military equipment.       (2) F-14 ``Tomcat'' fighter aircraft have recently been      retired, and their parts are being made available by auction      in large quantities.       (3) Iran is the only country, besides the United States,      flying F-14 fighter aircraft and is purchasing surplus parts      for such aircraft from brokers.       (4) The Government Accountability Office has, as a result      of undercover investigative work, declared the acquisition of      the surplus United States military equipment, including parts      for F-14 fighter aircraft, to be disturbingly effortless.       (5) Upon the seizure of such sensitive surplus military      equipment being sold to Iran, United States customs agents      have discovered these same items, having been resold by the      Department of Defense, being brokered illegally to Iran      again.       (6) Iran is pursuing a nuclear weapons capability, and the      Department of State has identified Iran as the most active      state sponsor of terrorism.       (7) Iran continues to provide funding, safe haven,      training, and weapons to known terrorist groups, including      Hizballah, HAMAS, the Palestine Islamic Jihad, and the      Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.       (8) The sale of spare parts for F-14 fighter aircraft could      make it more difficult to confront the nuclear weapons      capability of Iran and would strengthen the ground war      capability of Iran. To prevent these threats to regional and      global security, the sale of spare parts for F-14 fighter      aircraft should be prohibited.       (b) Prohibition on Sale by Department of Defense.--       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law      and except as provided in paragraph (2), the Department of      Defense may not sell (whether directly or indirectly) any      parts for F-14 fighter aircraft, whether through the Defense      Reutilization and Marketing Service or through another agency      or element of the Department.       (2) Exception.--Paragraph (1) shall not apply with respect      to the sale of parts for F-14 fighter aircraft to a museum or      similar organization located in the United States that is      involved in the preservation of F-14 fighter aircraft for      historical purposes.       (c) Prohibition on Export License.--No license for the      export of parts for F-14 fighter aircraft to a non-United      States person or entity may be issued by the United States      Government.                                 ______                                       By
