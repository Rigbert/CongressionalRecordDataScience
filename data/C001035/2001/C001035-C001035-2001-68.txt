President, I am pleased to be joining my distinguished colleague, Senator Snowe, today in introducing this legislation, the Naval Security Group Activity at Winter Harbor Conveyance Act. This conveyance legislation will authorize the transfer of land, which has been under the control of the Naval Security Group for some seventy plus years back to the Department of the Interior, and to the State, ultimately to be put to good use by our local communities.  Over the past seven decades, the Navy has performed a key national security mission called Classic Wizard at Winter Harbor. The Navy has played a significant role in the economic development of the local communities as Maine residents and Navy personnel have supported this mission. As the requirement for the Classic Wizard mission at Winter Harbor is coming to an end, and as technology advances, this naval activity will be ending its ties to the base in the summer of 2002.  While the Navy will be missed, it has worked hand-in-hand with me and the other members of the Maine delegation, the Department of Interior, National Park Service, and our local communities in creating a viable economic development and reuse plan for the naval base and its associated property.  As part of its reuse plan for the site, the National Park Service has proposed developing a research and education center at the Schoodic Point. The center would accommodate and promote a variety of research activities including wildlife genetics and serve as a base for permanent and visiting scientists to conduct interdisciplinary research.  I worked with the National Park Service in the development of its proposal, and I have offered to help make the concept a reality. Maine Governor Angus King shares my support for the proposed research and learning center and has expressed the State's willingness to work as a partner in the effort to establish a wildlife genetics laboratory at the center. We believe that such a laboratory would generate good jobs and promote the region's economy. The work done at Schoodic Point also would compliment the world class research underway at other area facilities in the area such as The Jackson Laboratory, the Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory, and the University of Maine's Cooperative Aquaculture Research Center.  The National Park Service's proposed reuse of the peninsula also includes an educational component that would promote the public's understanding of the important natural and cultural resources that are a part of our national park system. Moreover, those who have visited Schoodic would agree that the remarkably beautiful 100 acres are worthy of being a part of Acadia National Park, one of our Nation's greatest natural treasures.  It is important for the Federal Government to lend a hand to communities that are struggling to cope with the adverse effects of a base closure. Our legislation, which was developed in consultation with the local communities, the State, the Department of the Interior and the Navy, provides the options and opportunities that the region needs to move beyond the loss of the Naval Security Group Activity at Winter Harbor. I will work to secure approval of this bill by the Senate Armed Services committee and the full Senate.                                 ______                                       By
