Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to our country have been exceptional. After working for many years in the residential and commercial real estate industries, Jerry Giovaniello is retiring from the National Association of REALTORS.  After earning a graduate degree in history from New York University, Mr. Giovaniello fulfilled an ROTC commitment to the U.S. Army, serving as an officer in Vietnam and Washington, D.C. from 1968 through 1970. After his military service, Mr. Giovaniello worked as a policy analyst and writer for National Journal, a weekly magazine covering the federal government and public policy issues. Later, Mr. Giovaniello began working on Capitol Hill where he served as chief of staff for two members of Congress from California--Rep. Jerry Pettis, R-Calif., 1972 to 1976, and Rep. Jim Lloyd, D-Calif., 1976 to 1981.  From 2001 until his retirement this year, Mr. Giovaniello served as the senior vice president of government affairs and chief lobbyist of the National Association of REALTORS, the nation's largest professional association, representing more than one million members involved in all aspects of the residential and commercial real estate industries. Mr. Giovaniello managed the association's government affairs staff of approximately 40 people in Washington, D.C. He also served as NAR's advocate for members of Congress from California, Washington, Nevada, Hawaii and Oregon.  Jerry and I have worked closely together on a number of issues. Perhaps the most consequential was our successful effort to stop large national banks from entering the real estate business. Had the banks prevailed, it would have left home buyers and sellers with fewer choices and higher loan fees. More crucially, it would have made the economic crisis of 2008 even more severe. We all owe Jerry a debt of gratitude for taking on that fight and winning it.  Mr. Giovaniello has contributed immensely to the betterment of our nation and I am proud to call him a fellow American and my friend. He played a major role advancing policies that helped Americans realize their dream of owning a home. To conclude, Mr. Speaker I want to thank Mr. Giovaniello for his service to the residential and commercial real estate industries--his dedication, insight and passion will be greatly missed.                          ____________________
