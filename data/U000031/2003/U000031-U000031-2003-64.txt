Speaker, I include for the Record three statements in support of this legislation: the first by the administration in their statement of administration policy; second, a strong letter of support by the Chamber of Commerce; and, third, a letter of strong support by the CTIA.                   Statement of Administration Policy       (ThIs statement has been coordinated by OMB with the      concerned agencies.)       The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R.      1320, which would create a spectrum relocation fund. The      Administration believes that the fund will serve as     an important spectrum management tool to streamline the      process for reimbursing government users, facilitate their      relocation to comparable spectrum, and provide greater      certainty to auction bidders and incumbents. This legislation      will also expedite the opening of spectrum to commercial use      for new services and technologies for consumers.       The Administration is pleased that H.R. 1320 closely tracks      the Administration's proposal to create a spectrum relocation      fund. The Administration urges quick action by the Congress      to establish a spectrum relocation fund to make the spectrum      management process more effective and efficient.                         pay-as-you-go scoring       H.R. 1320 would affect direct spending. The Budget      Enforcement Act's pay-as-you-go requirements and      discretionary spending caps expired on September 30, 2002.      The Administration supports the extension of these budget      enforcement mechanisms in a manner that ensures fiscal      discipline and is consistent with the President's budget.                                  ____                                               Chamber of Commerce                              of the United States of America,                                    Washington, DC, June 10, 2003.     To All Members of the U.S. House of Representatives:       The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the world's largest business      federation, representing more than three million businesses      and organizations of every size, sector and region, urges you      to support H.R. 1320, the Commercial Spectrum Enhancement      Act. It is expected that the U.S. House of Representatives      will consider H.R. 1320 on June 11 or 12, 2003, under      suspension of the rules. Furthermore, we urge you to oppose      any amendments that would weaken this legislation or divert      substantial funds away from the primary purpose of freeing up      essential spectrum for commercial usage.       This legislation would clear a major hurdle in the ongoing      effort to make available more spectrum for advanced wireless      services and applications. The act would establish a      mechanism for reimbursing incumbent federal spectrum users      for their relocation costs when their spectrum is reallocated      for commercial use. The trust fund would ensure the safe and      efficient transition of governmental operations from one      spectrum location to another, while creating new      opportunities for innovation in the wireless sector.       The creation of a spectrum relocation trust fund represents      an important step in the difficult process of reforming our      nation's spectrum allocation and management policies. We must      continue to support these efforts in order to create the      necessary incentives for investment and advancement in the      technology industry, which will continue to be a key driver      of the American economy.           Sincerely,                                                  R. Bruce Josten,     Executive Vice President.                                  ____                                       Cellular Telecommunications                                     and Internet Association,                                    Washington, DC, June 11, 2003.     Hon. Billy Tauzin,     Chairman, House Energy and Commerce Committee, RHOB, House of          Representatives, Washington, DC.     Hon. John D. Dingell,     Ranking Member, House Energy and Commerce Committee, RHOB,          House of Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member: The Cellular      Telecommunications & Internet Association (herein, CTIA)      offers its unqualified support for the Commercial Spectrum      Enhancement Act (H.R 1320). We salute your hard work on this      legislation and urge its passage by the House of      Representatives. CTIA represents all categories of commercial      wireless telecommunications carriers, including cellular and      personal communications services, manufacturers and wireless      Internet providers.       CTIA and the wireless industry appreciates the efforts of      the many members who are co-sponsors of H.R. 1320, in      particular Telecommunications Subcommittee Chairman Upton and      Congressman Towns, the lead sponsors.       Passage of H.R. 1320 would significantly improve spectrum      management for both government spectrum users and for the      commercial wireless industry. The current process is a      ``black hole'' for both government agencies and the private      sector--filled with uncertainty, punctuated by unknown costs,      and bereft of predictability. The current process works for      no one.       President Bush identified that fact in both the Fiscal Year      2003 and 2004 Budgets and called for the legislative changes      that are embodied in H.R. 1320. The relocation fund      legislation balances three key policy objectives: First, H.R.      1320 fully funds government relocation, providing certainty      essential to the Defense Department and all other government      incumbents. Second, H.R. 1320 will result in workable      timelines for both wireless industry and government      incumbents. Third, H.R. 1320 provides certainty and      accountability in developing--and adhering to--relocation      cost estimates and relocation timetables.       During his March 25 testimony, Deputy Assistant Secretary      of Defense for Spectrum, Space, Sensors and C3 Steven Price      called for a ``trustworthy Trust Fund.'' We concur, H.R. 1320      provides exactly this solution.       This bi-partisan legislation is a ``win-win-win'' solution,      benefiting our national security, our nation's economy and      American consumers. CTIA looks forward to continuing to work      with you and all members of the Committee to assure that this      legislation is soon law.           Sincerely,                                                  Steven K. Berry,                        Senior Vice President, Government Affairs.  Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Tauzin), the chairman of the powerful Committee on Energy and Commerce.
