President, I rise to offer an amendment to the fiscal year 2007 Homeland Security appropriations bill. This measure would direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to revise existing procedures and establish new methods for expeditiously clearing the names of individuals who have been mistakenly placed on a terrorist database list, including the Transportation Security Administration's, TSA, No-Fly and Selectee watch list, or who have names identical to or substantially similar to names on these database lists.
