President, I will not object because I am aware that the Senator could speak for up to an hour under the cloture rules, although I remind the Senator that she could not speak on the subject about which she appears to be ready to speak. But in the interest of moving forward, and since there have been others today who have also spoken as in morning business, I will not object. I do think it is unfortunate, however.  (The remarks of Mrs. Stabenow are printed in today's Record under ``Morning Business.'')
