Mr. Speaker, I would like to provide additional explanatory information regarding the provisions in H.R. 3090.  At the time of passage of H.R. 3090 by the Committee on Resources, the Committee Members on both sides of the aisle agreed that there were likely to be additional changes to this bill prior to its being taken to the floor of the House. Such changes were ones that the Committee anticipated would be developed between the Department of Interior and Elim as well as with the concurrence of the majority and the minority of the Committee. Those changes were worked out. A number of improvements were made to the bill in addition to some reorganization of the sections to assist in providing clarity to the bill. What follows is a brief explanation and a section-by-section analysis of the bill as it is brought before the House.  As I had indicated in my earlier remarks, this legislation is long overdue. It is a matter of equity and fairness that, in furtherance of the underlying goals of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA), replacement lands should be conveyed to the Elim Native Corporation under Section 19 of ANCSA. The Committee's intent is that such conveyances authorized in this legislation be treated as other conveyances to Elim were treated in the past with respect to other applicable sections of ANCSA, except that the conveyances under the bill will additionally have certain covenants, reservations, terms, and conditions that are applicable.  It is recognized that the watersheds that are likely to be selected under this provision (Clear Creek, Tubutulik River, and the Qwik River) are ones which provide a vital source of food in the form of fish as well as sustenance for wildlife and plants on which the people of Elim are, in part, dependent.  The Committee considered utilizing the lands on the eastern edge of the original Norton Bay Reservation as replacement lands to Elim for the 50,000 acres which were deleted in 1929. However, because--(1) there have been a number of acres of those lands (in particular along the coastline) which had been conveyed to the Village of Koyuk or which were subject to allotments; (2) of the sensitivity of that area to Koyuk; (3) with the knowledge today that, the rivers to the north of the original Norton Bay Reservation are of substantial significance to the long-term viability of the Elim Native Corporation in to the future, the Committee concluded that the area to the north of the current of boundary of Elim land holdings was a more appropriate place from which Elim should select replacement lands than the original area deleted in 1929.  In addition, provisions were negotiated with Elim which represent a good faith effort by all sides to remedy the injustice to Elim from many years past as well as to protect the resources of this area with several unique natural features. As a result of those negotiations, Elim will have full access to the use of the timber on the lands to be conveyed for building of homes, cabins, lodges, firewood, and other domestic uses on Elim lands, but agreed not to cut or remove Merchantable Timber for sale. This will permit Elim to make beneficial, developmental, and economic use of lands while conserving most of the forested lands for their wildlife habitat benefits.  As a part of the balancing of interests, the Committee agreed to language that would provide a 300 foot buffer area around Clear Creek and the Tubutulik River should they be selected by and conveyed to Elim. In that area, there would be no support structures or development or activities permitted unless they would not or are not likely to cause erosion or siltation that would significantly adversely impact the water quality or fish habitat of these two water courses.  The Committee believes that the bill as reported along with the amendments as brought before the House represents a reasonable and responsible approach to dealing with and resolving this issue. It will remedy an injustice to Elim of many years and do so in a way that is appropriate given the circumstances as they are in 1999.  Provisions of the legislature are further explained in the section-by-section analysis that follows:                      Section-by-Section Analysis     Section 1. Elim Native Corporation Land Restoration.       This section amends the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act      by amending Section 19 by adding a new subsection (c).       Subsection (c)(1) sets out findings regarding the      background and need for the legislation.       Subsection (c)(2) describes the lands to be withdrawn      (``Withdrawal Area'') by reference to a map dated October 19,      1999, and withdraws the lands from all forms of appropriation      or disposition under the public land laws for a two-year      period.       Subsection (c)(3) authorizes Elim to select and ultimately      receive title to 50,000 acres of lands from the lands inside      the Withdrawal Area. The Secretary of the Interior is      authorized and directed to convey to Elim the fee to the      surface and subsurface estate in 50,000 acres of valid      selections, subject to the convenants, reservations, terms      and conditions in subsection (c).       Subsection (c)(3)(A) provides two years after the date of      enactment for Elim to make its selections. To ensure that it      receives the 50,000 acres, under this subparagraph Elim may      select up to 60,000 acres and must prioritize its selections      at the time it makes the selections. Elim may not revoke or      change its priorities. Elim must select a single tract of      land adjacent to U.S. Survey No. 2548, Alaska, that is      reasonably compact, contiguous, and in whole sections except      for two situations. The withdrawn lands remain withdrawn      until the Department has conveyed all the lands that Elim      Native Corporation is entitled to under subsection (c).       Subsection (c)(3)(B) provides that, in addition to being      subject to valid existing rights, Elim's selections may not      supercede prior selections by the State of Alaska or other      Native corporations, or valid entries by private individuals      unless the State, Native Corporation, or individual      relinquishes the selection entry prior to conveyance to Elim.       Subsection (c)(3)(C) provides that, on receipt of the      Conveyance Lands, Elim will have all the legal rights and      benefits as landowner of land conveyed under this Act subject      to the covenants, reservations, terms and conditions in      subsection (c). All other provisions of this Act that were      applicable to conveyances under subsection (b) are applicable      to conveyances under subsection (c).       Subsection (c)(3)(D) makes clear that selection by and      conveyance to Elim Native Corporation of these lands is in      full satisfaction of any claim by Elim Native Corporation of      entitlement to lands under section 19 of this Act.       Subsection (c)(4) provides that the covenants, terms and      conditions in this paragraph and in paragraphs (5) and (6)      will run with the land and be incorporated into any interim      conveyance or patent conveying the lands to Elim.       Subsection (c)(4)(A) provides that Elim has all the rights      of landowner to, and to utilize, the timber resources of the      Conveyance Lands including construction of homes, cabins, for      firewood and other domestic uses on any Elim lands, except      for cutting and removing Merchantable Timber for sale and      constructing roads and related infrastructure for the support      of such cutting and removing timber for sale.       Subsection (c)(4)(B) modifies P.L.O. 5563 to permit      selection by Elim of lands encompassing prior withdrawals of      hot or medicinal springs subject to the applicable covenants,      reservations, terms and conditions in paragraphs (5) and (6).       Subsection (c)(4)(C) provides that if Elim receives      conveyance to lands encompassing the Tubutulik River of Clear      Creek, or both, Elim will not allow activities in the bed or      within 300 feet of these water courses which would cause or      would likely cause erosion or siltation so as to      significantly adversely impact water quality or fish habitat.       Subsection (c)(5)(A) sets forth the first of a series of      rights to be retained by the United States in the conveyances      in paragraph (3). Subparagraph (A) is a retained right to      enter the conveyance lands for purposes outlined after      providing notice to Elim and an opportunity to have a      representative present.       Subsection (c)(5)(B) provides for retaining rights and      remedies against persons who cut or remove Merchantable      Timber.       Subsection (c)(5)(C) provides for the retention of the      right to reforest if Merchantable Timber is destroyed by      fire, insects, disease or other man-made or natural      occurrence, except for such occurrences that occur from      Elim's exercise of its rights to use the conveyance lands as      landowner.       Subsection (c)(5)(D) provides for the retention of the      right of ingress and egress to the public under section 17(b)      of ANCSA to allow the public to visit, for non-commercial      purposes, the hot springs located on the conveyance lands and      to use any part of the hot springs that is not commercially      developed.       Subsection (c)(5)(E) provides for retaining the right to      the United States to enter the     conveyance lands containing hot springs in order to conduct      scientific research. It also ensures that such research can      be conducted and that the results of such research can be      used without any compensation to Elim. This subparagraph also      provides an equal right to Elim to conduct such research on      the hot springs and to use the results of the research      without compensation to the United States.       Subsection (c)(5)(F) provides for the retention of a      covenant that restricts commercial development of the hot      springs by Elim to a maximum of 15% of the hot springs and      15% of the land within \1/4\ mile of the hot springs. This      subparagraph also provides that any commercial development of      those hot springs will not alter the natural hydrologic or      thermal system associated with the hot springs. The provision      makes clear that at least 85% of the lands within \1/4\ mile      of the hot springs should be left in their natural state.       Subsection (c)(5)(G) provides that retaining the right to      exercise prosecutorial discretion in the enforcement of any      covenant, reservation, term or condition does not waive the      right to enforce such covenant, reservation, term or      condition.       Subsection (c)(6)(A) provides for the Secretary and Elim,      acting in good faith, to enter into a Memorandum of      Understanding (MOU) to implement Subsection (c). The      subparagraph requires that the MOU include reasonable      measures to protect plants and animals in the hot springs and      within \1/4\ mile of the hot springs. This subparagraph      requires that the parties agree to meet periodically to      review the MOU and to amend/replace are extended.       Subsection (c)(6)(B) provides for Elim to incorporate the      covenants, reservations, terms and conditions set forth in      subsection (c) in any deed or other instrument by which Elim      divests itself of any interest in all or portion of the      Conveyance Lands.       Subsection (c)(6)(C) requires that the BLM, in consultation      with Elim, will reserve easements under subsection 17(b) of      this Act.       Subsection (c)(6)(D) provides for the retention of other      easements by the BLM, in consultation with Elim, including      the right of the public to enter upon and travel along the      Tubutulik River and Clear Creek within the Conveyance Lands.      This subparagraph provides that the easements shall include      trails confined to foot travel along each bank of the      Tubutulik River and Clear Creek. This subparagraph requires      also that trails be twenty-five feet wide and upland of the      ordinary high water mark. It also provides for including one-     acre sites along the two water courses referenced, that the      sites be selected in consultation with Elim and that they be      utilized for launching and taking out water craft as well as      for short term (twenty-four hours) camping, unless Elim      consents to a longer period.       Subsection (c)(6)(E) provides that the inholders within the      boundaries of the Conveyance Lands have rights of ingress and      egress. It provides also that the inholder may not exercise      these rights in a manner that might result in substantial      damage to the surface of the lands and may not make any      permanent improvements to the conveyance lands without the      consent of Elim.       Subsection (c)(6)(F) provides that the Bureau of Land      Management may reserve an easement for the Iditarod National      Historic Trail in the land conveyance to Elim.       Subsection (c)(7) authorizes appropriations as may be      necessary to implement subsection (c).       Section two. Common Stock to Adopted-Out Descendants.       Section 7(h) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act      sets forth the general rules pertaining to the issuance and      transfer of common stock in an Alaska Native Corporation,      which stock is referred to as Settlement Common Stock.      Generally, the holder of Settlement Common Stock is not      permitted to sell, pledge or otherwise alienate this stock.      However, Section 7(h)(1)(C) of ANCSA provides certain      exceptions to the general prohibition on the alienation of      Settlement Common Stock. Under Section 7(h)(1)(C)(iii), the      holder of Settlement Common Stock may transfer some or all of      the Settlement Common Stock to a close family member by inter      vivos gift. Gifts of Settlement Common Stock are permitted      to, among others, a child, grandchild or great-grandchild.       Alaska state law has been interpreted to sever, for all      purposes, the relationship between a family and a child who      has been adopted out, or for whom parental rights have been      relinquished or terminated. Thus, under existing law, a      holder of Settlement Common Stock may not inter vivos gift      transfer Settlement Common Stock to a child who has been      adopted by another family. The proposed amendment in Section      2 will permit the biological family of an Alaska Native child      to make an inter vivos gift to that child of Settlement      Common Stock, regardless of the child's adoption into a non-     Native family, or the relinquishment or termination of      parental rights. The enactment of the provisions of Section 2      will resolve the problem currently faced by some Alaska      Native children who are unable to receive shares in an Alaska      Native Corporation because the relationship with their      biological family has been legally severed under Alaska State      law.       Section three. Definition of Settlement Trust.       Congress enacted the settlement trust option in ANCSA to      allow Alaska Native Corporations to establish trusts to hold      assets for the benefit of Alaska Native Shareholders. As the      law currently stands, these trusts may only benefit holders      of Settlement Common Stock. The amendments contained in      Section three will permit Native Corporation shareholders, by      the vote of a majority of shares, to extend this benefit of      ANCSA to all of the Native people in their community,      including the children and grandchildren of the original      stockholders, regardless of whether they yet own stock in the      Native Corporation. This amendment redefines ``settlement      trust'' to permit Native Corporations to establish settlement      trusts in which potential beneficiaries include shareholders,      Natives and descendants of Natives. Because ANCSA was enacted      to benefit all Natives, this amendment is in keeping with the      original intent of that legislation. At the same time, the      interests of Alaska Native Corporation shareholders are      protected because this option is available only to those      Corporations whose shareholders vote, by a majority of all      outstanding voting shares, to benefit non-shareholders                               ____________________
