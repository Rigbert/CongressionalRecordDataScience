. Secretary of State Colin Powell spoke to a business forum in Detroit. His topic, the Middle East. His message, the nations of the Middle East need to transform themselves.  The Bush administration, having failed to find weapons of mass destruction, failed to find Saddam Hussein, failed to capture Osama bin Laden, failed to eradicate the Taliban, failed to implement the road map to peace between the Israelis and Palestinians, and of course failed to secure the peace in Iraq, is trying to salvage something out of its disastrous policy so they are talking about this policy of transformation.  The Bush administration is trying to get the American people to believe that throwing $87 billion more at Iraq will begin the process of transformation by building the garden spot of the Middle East and that other nations will magically follow the lead.  It will not work. Their policy is doomed to fail, throwing more money is not the answer in Iraq.  As the Detroit Free Press reported, although Secretary Powell had plenty of advice for Middle Eastern nations about how to conduct their affairs, he offered no plan for the road to peace. That is not surprising because the Bush administration has no plan for peace in the Middle East, no plan for postwar Iraq, no plan for getting the United States out of Iraq, and fundamentally, no long-term plan for energy independence for America which would give us the leverage we need to play the role of honest broker instead of dependent addict.  Secretary Powell said in Detroit that the Arab nations are plagued by poverty, alienation and despair. He said the Arab world needs to embrace free trade and democratize in order to break out of the cycle. But free trade cannot bring democracy. If that weretrue, the Arab world would be a democratic paradise and have already broken the cycle of poverty, alienation and despair.  Instead, the oil oligarchies of the Middle East have already been trading for decades and decades. We trade extensively with the Bush administration's close friends in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. In fact, we have an oil trade deficit with them of over $8 billion a year. We trade extensively with the Bush family's close friends in Kuwait. We have an oil trade deficit with them of over $1 billion a year. And what about Iraq, home to the second largest set of oil reserves in the world? We had over a $3.5 billion trade deficit with them, even when sanctions were being imposed. The problem with the oil oligarchies is hardly a lack of trade.  The Detroit Free Press also ran a story ``Oil, Gas Tighten U.S. Connection to Mideast,'' and ``Alternative Fuels Dismissed at Forum.''  As reporter John Gallagher wrote, ``The U.S.-Arab Economic Forum gave a glimpse Monday at the future of American energy policy. It sure looked a lot like the past.'' And therein lies the problem. The past is filled with war and conflicts, much of it tied to the politics that come from the oil field across the Middle East. That is what the future will look like unless the United States achieves energy independence here at home.  Indeed, oppression and oil seem to go hand in hand, and it is a world that previous U.S. administrations, doing the bidding of Exxon, Chevron, Royal Dutch Shell, BP and other big oil companies have had a big hand in creating for over half a century. The United States at the dawn of this century is utterly dependent on Middle East oil. Our biggest trading partner, the Saudis, are increasingly brazen about the nature of our relationship, and their oil minister said in Detroit on Monday, ``Detroit makes a lot of cars, we produce a lot of oil; you can see the connection.'' You send us the oil, and we send them our dollars.  It is easy to see that the Saudis have George W. Bush exactly where they want him. They have Dick Cheney exactly where they want him. They have Colin Powell exactly where they want him. And they have the American people exactly where they want us. They have us addicted to their oil and begging for our next fix. To me, that is unacceptable.  Here is what David O'Reilly, CEO of Chevron Texaco said in Detroit, ``We are in for a long period of dependence on fossil fuels.'' Well, that is no problem as long as we do not mind American dollars going to the Middle East for oil only to end up in the hands of terrorists who then kill us. The Bush administration might be comfortable with our relationship with those oil states, but I am not. That is why I have introduced the Biofuels Energy Independence Act of 2003, H.R. 130, and ask my colleagues to cosponsor it.              Oil, Gas Tighten U.S. Connection to Mideast                          (By John Gallagher)       The U.S.-Arab Economic Forum being held in Detroit gave a      glimpse Monday at the future of American energy policy. It      sure looked a lot like the past.       Speakers on a panel devoted to energy needs agreed that a      reliance on Middle East oil and natural gas is the      cornerstone of any future American policy.       Far from fostering a U.S. policy of independence from      Middle Eastern producers, the panel suggested that ever-     closer ties with the region and its vast oil and natural gas      reserves will be needed to meet U.S. consumption.       Ali bin Ibrahim Al Naimi, minister of petroleum and mineral      resources in Saudi Arabia, captured the almost cozy nature of      the discussion when he quipped to the audience: ``Detroit      makes a lot of cars. We produce a lot of oil. You can see the      connection.''       Indeed, any stresses and strains in the energy relationship      between the United States and Middle Eastern nations were      simply not mentioned Monday. Panelists used the words      ``partner'' and ``partnership'' multiple times. Alternative      fuels such as solar and hydrogen were brought up just long      enough to be dismissed.       ``It's hard for people to visualize how massive the oil and      gas industry is,'' panelist Lee Raymond, chairman and CEO of      ExxonMobil Corp., said at one point.       Even if alternative fuels were to grow at a rate of 20      percent a year, they would still supply just 1 percent of      U.S. needs while the vast, vast majority of capital in the      energy industry is going into oil and gas,'' he said.       Clarence Cazalot, president and CEO of Marathon Oil Corp.,      underscored the point by declaring that Marathon has no      projects in the works dealing with alternative sources of      energy.       The panel was convened to talk about Middle Eastern oil      policy, so it was not surprising that it did not take up      broader energy problems.       And the business-as-usual approach probably was assured by      the make-up of the panel. Two Middle Eastern oil ministers,      four U.S. oil company chief executives, and former Michigan      Sen. Spencer Abraham, now U.S. Secretary of Energy in      President George W. Bush's cabinet.       Even so, it was surprising how little mention was made of      broader energy problems. There was no discussion of this      summer's surge in gas prices, except when Al Naimi declared      that the war in Iraq had produced no significant increase in      prices this year. Nor was there any discussion of the recent      blackout that left metro Detroit, much of the Northeast and      parts of Canada in the dark.       Instead, oil producers and oil company executives agreed      that there was no getting around the realities of the United      States being the world's biggest energy consumer and the      Middle East holding the world's biggest reserves of oil and      natural gas.       ``We're in for a long period of dependence on fossil      fuels,'' said David O'Reilly, chairman and CEO, of Chevron      Texaco Corp., told the audience at the Detroit Marriott      Renaissance Center.       U.S. energy consumption is expected to grow 50 percent by      2025; Al Naimi estimated, a figure that no one disputed.       Yet around the edges of the discussion Monday, a few      glimpses of potential problems crept into the discussion.       If the United States is worried about a stable supply of      oil and natural gas, it turns out that producing nations like      Saudi Arabia and Qatar are worried at least as much about a      stable demand.       Russia, Mexico and other non-Arab oil-producing nations are      clamoring for more access to the U.S. markets. The panelists      noted that Middle Eastern nations can't afford to make      massive new investments in their facilities without      assurances that the U.S. market will still be open to them.       And there was just the barest mention of civil unrest in      some Middle Eastern nations, where forces of modern secular      capitalism vie with religious fundamentalism. O'Reilly noted      that a solid relationship with the United States is needed to      help young Arab men and women meet their potential.       As if to mirror the mostly up-beat discussion Monday,      gasoline prices in Michigan continued their recent slide.       The statewide average price for a gallon of self-serve,      regular gasoline is down more than 10-cents from a week ago,      AAA said. It marked the second straight 10-cent drop in as      many weeks.                                  ____             [From the Detroit Free Press, Sept. 30, 2003]   Middle East Must End Its Cycle of Terrorism, Despair, Powell Says                           (By Niraj Warikoo)       The Arab world is trapped in a cycle of despair and fury      that will continue to breed terrorism unless nations      radically change their policies, said U.S. Secretary of State      Colin Powell in a toughly worded speech to business leaders      in Detroit Monday night.       Powell gave few specifics on how the Middle East can bridge      the gap but cautioned that if it is to survive, the region      urgently needs solid jobs, along with respect for rule of the      law, the individual and religious tolerance.       ``It is no exaggeration to say that without a      transformation of the Middle East, the region will remain a      source of violence and terrorism,'' Powell said. ``We must      not let that happen. We will not let that happen.''       Powell spoke at the first U.S.-Arab Economic Forum, an      event designed to bring the two worlds together with the      local Arab-American community acting as a conduit. Hundreds      of U.S. and Arab business leaders gathered in Detroit's Cobo      Center to hear him speak.       He urged the crowd to join him in transforming the Middle      East into a region full of hope and where ``all people      worship God in a spirit of tolerance and understanding.''       Some Arab Americans in the audience were unimpressed with      Powell's speech, saying he should have announced a plan to      relieve the suffering of the Palestinians.       ``He brought no new ideas,'' said Ron Amen, executive      assistant to Wayne County Executive Robert Ficano. ``He      brought no new hope.''       Powell spoke at length about Iraq during his speech and      during an earlier interview with the Free Press. He said he      believes a weapons of mass destruction program will be found      in Iraq.       ``There is no doubt in my mind'' the United States will      find evidence of Saddam Hussein's weapons program, Powell      said. ``It wasn't a figment of anyone's imagination.''       Powell criticized those who questioned whether Hussein had      deadly weapons before the war.       Some people thought that ``sweet Saddam Hussein, who was      willing to gas 5,000 people on a spring day in 1988, was      suddenly a different Saddam Hussein,'' Powell said during the      Free Press interview.       ``Other nations might have been willing to make that      judgment, but not President Bush. He wasn't going to walk      away from the challenge.''       Powell said former UN weapons inspector David Kay is going      through documents and interviews in a search for a weapons      program. And Powell recounted his visit earlier     this month to Iraq, saying he was touched by the northern      city of Halabja.       Powell said he spoke with Iraqis whose family members were      killed in that town in March 1988, when Hussein's regime used      chemicals to kill an estimated 5,000 people.       He urged the American public to be patient with Iraq,      reminding reporters that it took the United States more than      12 years--from 1776 to 1789--to draft a constitution.       ``It isn't easy'' to draft a governing document, he said.       Besides Iraq, Powell addressed the conflict between the      Israelis and Palestinians. He said Palestinian Authority      President Yasser Arafat ``is not a partner for peace.''       Powell said he has made it clear to Arafat that he must      change his leadership approach.       Powell also questioned Israeli settlements and the way      Israel is constructing a new security fence near its border.       Powell tried to quell concerns about how Arabs traveling to      the United States will be treated at airports and by the      government. He conceded there has to be balance between      liberty and security in admitting new visitors and      immigrants.       Said Powell: ``We want to be a welcoming society.''                          ____________________
