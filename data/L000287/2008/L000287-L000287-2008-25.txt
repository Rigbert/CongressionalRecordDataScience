Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Madam Speaker, this bill passed the House on July 23, 2008, with bipartisan support by a vote of 387 yeas to 37 nays. The Department of Transportation has asked that this legislation be effective immediately. The Senate amended the House-passed bill to change the effective date and respond to the administration's request.  The trust fund is broke, out of money. Our State and local governments, drivers, construction workers and many others will suffer when highway projects are delayed. We took $8 billion out of the trust fund in 1998, and now is the time to put that $8 billion back.  I urge all of my colleagues again to support this important bill.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
