Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Filner) for his kind remarks and also point out that he has been indefatigable in fighting for the Filipino veterans, and thank the gentleman for his hard work, which has been incorporated in this bill.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ginny Brown-Waite).
