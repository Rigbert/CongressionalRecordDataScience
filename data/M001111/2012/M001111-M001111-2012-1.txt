 This is an important piece of legislation and I have always supported making sure that our military has the equipment, resources and effective policies it needs to perform its missions.  Mr. President, during floor consideration of the defense authorization bill, the Senate took two important votes regarding alternative fuels, signifying that we stood with our military leaders. We eliminated two provisions that would have severely limited the Department of Defense's ability to invest in alternative fuels.  Both votes were bipartisan, and my friend and colleague Senator Hagan sponsored one of those amendments. I commend Senator Hagan's leadership and her hard work on this issue.
