Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, identity theft and identity fraud are terms used to refer to all types of crime in which someone wrongfully obtains and uses another person's personal data in some way that involves fraud or deception, typically for economic or other gain including immigration benefits.  The Federal Trade Commission received 161,819 complaints of someone using another's information in 2002. In 2003 the FTC performed a random sampling of households. The results from the survey suggest that almost 10 million Americans were the victim of some form of ID theft within the last year, which means that despite all of the attention to this type of crime since September 11, 2001, the incidence of this crime is increasing.  As border security and international cooperation increases to combat terrorism, al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations increasingly turn to stolen identities to hide themselves from law enforcement. For example, according to testimony from the Inspector General of the Social Security Administration, five Social Security numbers associated with some of the September 11 terrorists appeared to be counterfeit. One was assigned to a child and four of the terrorists were associated with multiple Social Security numbers.                              {time}  1615  Since September 11, 2001, Federal and State officials have taken notice of this crime because of the potential threat to security. But the cost to the consumer and corporations is equally alarming. The FTC estimates that loss to business and financial institutions from identity theft to be $47.6 billion per year. The costs to individual consumers is estimated to be approximately $5 billion a year.  As this crime increases, we must find new ways to combat it. Web sites developed by the FTC and consumer groups encourage consumers to protect themselves by shredding mail and keeping a close watch over their credit report. Yet the FTC statistics suggest that identity thieves are obtaining an individual's personal information for misuse not only through ``dumpster diving'' but also through accessing information that was originally collected for an authorized purpose, a so-called ``insider threat.''  In one such case, U.S. attorneys charged a 33-year-old customer service representative from Long Island, New York with identity theft and fraud. This individual was using his position at a company that provided computer services to banks and lending companies to access personal consumer credit information from three credit reporting agencies. The scheme allowed him to access personal information of over 30,000 victims.  The insider threat from identity theft and identity fraud is a threat to personal security as well as national security. The U.S. Attorney in Atlanta charged 28 people as a part of a fraud ring to supply over 1,900 individuals with fraudulent Social Security cards. The cards were supplied by a Social Security Administration clerk in exchange for $70,000 in payoffs.  Under current law, many identity thieves are receiving short terms of imprisonment or probation; however, many of these thieves will use false identities to commit much more serious crimes. Thus H.R. 1731 provides enhanced penalties for persons who steal identities to commit terrorist acts, immigration violations, firearms offenses, and other serious crimes. The bill would amend current law to impose a higher maximum penalty for identity theft used to facilitate acts of terrorism.  This legislation will allow prosecutors to identify identity thieves who steal an identity, sometimes hundreds or even thousands of identities, for purposes of committing one or more crimes. Importantly, it will facilitate the prosecution of terrorists who steal identities with the intent of subsequently committing terrorists acts. It also directs the Sentencing Commission to apply the guidelines for abuse of trust to an insider who uses his position to steal identities.  I support this common sense legislation and urge my colleagues to join me in its passage.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
