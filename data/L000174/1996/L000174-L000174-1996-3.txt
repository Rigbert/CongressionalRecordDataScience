President, there are a few matters contained within the omnibus appropriations bill that I would like to highlight. In the overall context of a multibillion dollar bill, these may not be significant to some, but they are to me and to the people of Vermont.  First, I note that we have been able to include an amendment to the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act that doubles the amount that Vermont and other small States will receive annually. This change completes the increase that we have been trying to accomplish since enactment of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 to provide small States with $400,000 a year in Federal funding for family violence prevention programs. It is appropriate that in October, which is National Domestic Violence Awareness Month, we finally conclude this amendment.  Domestic violence remains the leading cause of violent death in Vermont. Over 50 percent of homicides in the State last year reportedly arose from domestic violence situations--and this is down from the percentages in prior years. Also contained in the omnibus appropriations bill is legislation making conviction of a crime of domestic violence a disqualification from gun ownership. Too many women and children are threatened by domestic violence and too many become victims of that violence.  I commend the Vermont Network Against Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault, the Vermont Center for Crime Victims Services, and all of the local community organizations that work so hard and provide such essential services to those at risk of domestic and family violence. I note that Vermont established its own statewide domestic violence hotline and sexual abuse hotline almost a year before the national hotline was finally created this spring. I expect that Vermont will also lead the country in terms of developing services and programs to confront the problems of rural domestic violence.  We were also able to increase funding for the Violence Against Women Act programming to $197.5 million this year. Because of Vermont's outstanding advocates and programs, ours was the first State to receive a VAWA grant 2 years ago and I am confident that Vermont will remain on the leading edge in these important programs. This year Vermont received over $700,000 for VAWA programming.  We have also been able to protect the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act programs that sends important funding to Vermont and other States to assist in efforts to prevent crime and delinquency. I want to thank, in particular, Ken Schatz and the Vermont Children and Family Council for Prevention Programs and Shirley Martin, Vermont's JJDP Specialist, for their help in working to protect and preserve the Juvenile Justice Program and avoid the loss of as much as $187,500 from the nearly $800,000 that Vermont receives annually. Vermont could not afford the loss of such Federal assistance. In the omnibus appropriations bill, we were able to include $170 million for national juvenile justice programming this year, which is a significant increase from last year.  Finally, we were able to include in the appropriations bill is a much needed adjustment to the Victims of Crime Act to extend for an additional year the time in which the State and victim assistance grantees may retain and usegrants from the Federal Crime Victims Fund. This is important in years in which collections of fines and penalties at the Federal level are exceptionally large, as they were this past year. Through this amendment we are trying to ensure that State grants from the crime victims fund can be used wisely over a more extended period of time. This amendment will augment the increase in the minimum victim assistance grant to small States from $200,000 to $500,000 per year that I was able to include in the Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act, which passed earlier this year.                          ____________________
