President, I would like to take this opportunity to honor a dear friend and native Vermonter, Dana Singiser. Dana has accepted the position of Vice President for Public Policy and Government Affairs for Planned Parenthood, and while I am sorry to see her leave President Obama's administration, I am proud to recognize Dana's hard work and wish her continued success in her career.  Dana was raised in the small rural town of Mendon, VT, where her mother--the Mendon town clerk--instilled in her the values of democracy and the importance of staying engaged in her community. Dana carried this spirit with her in her career on Capitol Hill and on several presidential campaigns. Dana came to my office as an intern in the summer of 1991 while attending Brown University. I was immediately impressed with her intelligence, work ethic, and gregarious personality. I knew she would go on to accomplish great things, and indeed she has. After graduating from Brown, she attended law school at Georgetown University and spent 7 years at a law firm before her return to public service, where she has remained.  Dana served as the Director of Women's Outreach for Hillary Clinton's presidential bid--an opportunity that allowed her to grow her career in politics. She later also quickly proved herself a valuable asset to President Obama's campaign, and following his election she was appointed Special Assistant to the President for Legislative Affairs, where she has served for the last 3 years.  While she has enjoyed her time at the White House, Dana has also gained immeasurable experience that will certainly add to her already successful career. In Dana's new role with Planned Parenthood, she can continue her long fight to protect women's rights, and I am glad to see her continue to follow her passion. Vermonters are proud to recognize Dana Singiser's hard work, and we wish her continued success in her career.  I ask unanimous consent that an article about her achievements, from TheNational Journal, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                  Out of the Frying Pan, Into the Fire               [From the National Journal, Nov. 7, 2011]                           (By Naureen Khan)       Dana Singiser remembers the glamour of her first job out of      college: running a tiny field office in Vermont for Bill      Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign for $300 a month.      Luckily, Singiser was a local and her mother was on hand to      bring her laboring daughter dinner every night.       Public service was always a natural inclination for      Singiser, she said. She was, after all, raised by parents who      were actively involved in the small rural community of      Mendon, Vt., population 1,056. Mom was the town clerk and a      small-business owner while Dad kept busy with church      activities.       An internship with Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., while she was      still an undergraduate at Brown University gave Singiser her      first taste of D.C. and there was no turning back. After      working on Clinton's 1992 race, she landed a job in the White      House with presidential personnel and packed her bags for      Washington--``The last meritocracy,'' according to Singiser,      ``where you can work hard and get recognized.''       Twenty years later, after jobs on several presidential      campaigns, on Capitol Hill, and most recently with the Obama      administration as special assistant to the president for      legislative affairs, Singiser is headed to Planned Parenthood      as vice president of public policy and government affairs.       ``It's been great, and you can never leave a White House      job without feeling incredibly bittersweet about it,''      Singiser said. ``I feel like a mere mortal, and I can't keep      up these hours and this intensity forever.''       Not that Singiser is expecting an easy road ahead at      Planned Parenthood. She becomes the organization's chief      advocate and liaison to both state and national policymakers      as the group continues to come under attack as one of the      largest legal providers of abortion. The issue has become a      lightning rod over the past several months as Republican      lawmakers, GOP presidential candidates, and conservative      activists have called for federal defunding of Planned      Parenthood. Singiser said she hopes to help reframe the      conversation in her new role.       ``Those attacks are just misplaced,'' she said, pointing to      the range of primary-care services that Planned Parenthood      provides for men, women, and children. ``The result of those      sorts of efforts would be to erode women's health.''       Singiser has been well-prepared for the role, working in      both policy and politics for the past decade. After her stint      with the Clinton administration, Singiser got her law degree      from Georgetown University in December 1998 and practiced at      the Washington firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld for five      years, doing regulatory and lobbying work.       When the political bug bit her again, she went to work on      Howard Dean's short-lived presidential campaign before a      Senate job vacancy caught her eye. For three years, she was      staff director for the Senate Democratic Steering and      Outreach Committee under then-Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, D-     N.Y.       From there, Singiser went to work for Clinton's 2008      presidential campaign, focusing on women's outreach. When      Clinton bowed out of the race and endorsed Barack Obama, her      former rival, Singiser got on a plane almost immediately for      Chicago to lend a hand to Obama's general-election effort.       She has been with the Obama administration since Day One,      becoming an expert on everything from financial reform to      health care as the president tackled an ambitious legislative      agenda in his first two years in office.       ``I'm really proud and honored to have served President      Obama for three years, but I'm really excited to go on to      this next chapter,'' she added.                          ____________________
