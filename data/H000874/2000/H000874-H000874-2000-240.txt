 Mr. Chairman, I asked the point of order. I offered an amendment. The amendment under consideration by the Chair now as to whether or not it is in order is an amendment to add $1.883 billion to the bill for the purposes of including 2.4 million children within the ambit of the bill. This bill deals at its base with individuals who are getting child care services, getting Head Start services, getting educational services generally, getting before- and after-care at school. This would expand that.  Mr. Chairman, this is extraordinarily relevant to the provisions of this bill.
