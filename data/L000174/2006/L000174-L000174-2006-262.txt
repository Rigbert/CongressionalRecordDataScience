President, earlier this afternoon when I was not on the Senate floor, a few Republican Senators gave statements that reflected their individual views of what the legislation we are considering today will do to address the Supreme Court's interpretation of legislative intent in the Georgia v. Ashcroft and Reno v. Bossier Parish cases. While I am not fully informed of their positions, I certainly disagree with what I heard.  In the Senate Judiciary Committee we received extensive testimony about these two provisions over the course of several hearings that informed our Committee vote yesterday. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a full explanation of the testimony we received that informed our vote yesterday and my understanding of the purpose and scope of these two provisions as an original and lead sponsor.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                        Georgia v. Ashcroft Fix       The first of these provisions is commonly referred to as      the ``Georgia vs. Ashcroft fix.''       In the Judiciary Committee we received evidence that the      Voting Rights Act had been significantly weakened by the      Supreme Court's decision in Georgia v. Ashcroft because it      narrowed the protections afforded by Section 5. Prior to the      Ashcroft decision, an objection would be raised by the      Department of Justice if the voting change made the position      of minority voters worse off in terms of their ability to      elect candidates of their choice. In Ashcroft, the Supreme      Court replaced the clear and administrable ``ability to      elect'' standard with an unworkable ``totality of the      circumstances'' standard that appears to permit the trading      away of districts in which minority voters have the      opportunity to elect candidates of their choice for districts      in which minority voters may (or may not) have an      ``influence'' over who is elected.       It is my understanding that the bill we are considering      here today clarifies congressional intent after the Georgia      v. Ashcroft     decision by re-establishing that Section 5 requires that      there be no retrogression of minority voters' ability to      elect the candidate of their choice--the standard described      in Beer v. United States that governed Section 5 preclearance      decisions prior to the Supreme Court's decision in Ashcroft.       The drafters of this legislation concluded that ``ability      to elect'' was the proper standard because it preserves the      gains made in minority voting power and provides a more      manageable standard to guide covered jurisdictions, the      Department of Justice, and the federal courts as they review      voting changes pursuant to Section 5.       The bill we are considering today re-establishes the      ``ability to elect'' standard because the ``totality of the      circumstances'' test articulated in the Ashcroft decision      undermines Section 5's ability to protect against      discrimination and maintain the progress made in minority      political participation, and it creates an amorphous standard      that will be difficult for covered jurisdictions to follow      and for the Justice Department to administer.       We in Congress who are supporting this bill determined that      we must address this standard for the same reasons as the      dissent in Ashcroft noted, that is because the ``totality of      the circumstances'' test adopted by the Supreme Court      majority ``unmoors Sec. 5 from any practical and      administrable conception of minority influence'' by      abandoning the ``anchoring reference to electing a candidate      of choice'' that had previously guided Section 5      preclearance.       In the Judiciary Committee we received extensive testimony      about the harm that the Ashcroft decision has had on the      power of Section 5 to protect minority voters. Political      science professor Theodore Arrington, who has served as an      expert witness in over 30 voting rights cases, testified at      the Committee's hearings that the Ashcroft case created an      ``unworkable standard'' because there is ``no way to know how      to comply with the Court's mandate.'' The legislation we are      considering today would add needed clarity.       The difficulty of measuring minority ``influence'' was      well-illustrated by the results in Georgia v. Ashcroft      itself, as was pointed out in the Committee by Professor      Pamela Karlan. The Supreme Court noted that most of the      districts in which African-Americans make up more than 20% of      the electorate are majority-Democrat, which the Court      concluded ``make it more likely as a matter of fact that      African-American voters will constitute an effective voting      bloc, even if they cannot always elect the candidate of their      choice.'' However, in the three districts where African-     American voters supposedly retained an ``influence'' on their      elected representatives, the elected white representatives      switched from the Democratic to the Republican party in the      two-week period between their election and the inauguration,      which resulted in the Democrats losing control of the Georgia      State Senate. This result undermined the Supreme Court's view      that representatives elected in a minority ``influence      district'' would listen and respond to their sizable minority      constituents despite not being these voters' preferred      candidates.       The aftermath of Georgia's elections supports the      dissenting justices' views that it is impossible for a court      to measure minority influence, and thus a state should not be      granted preclearance for redistricting plans that trade away      districts in which minority voters have the ability to elect      their preferred candidates for ones in which they might have      the ability to influence candidates elected by others. As      Ashcroft itself demonstrated, the appearance of influence      might far exceed the reality.       The impact of ``influence districts'' is particularly      ephemeral where the existence of racially polarized voting      means that elected officials do not need minority voters to      retain their seats. As Laughlin McDonald, Director of ACLU's      Voting Rights Project, testified, racially polarized voting      means that African-Americans may have little or no influence      in majority white districts. In the 1970s and 1980s, only      about 1% of majority white districts in the South elected an      African-American to a state legislature. As late as 1988, no      African-American had been elected from a majority white      district in Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, or      South Carolina. The ACLU's Voting Rights Project Report      described the pervasiveness of racial bloc voting in covered      jurisdictions. For example, in Smith v. Beasley, decided in      1992, a three-judge court found that ``[i]n South Carolina,      voting has been, and still is, polarized by race. This voting      pattern is general throughout the state.'' Ten years later,      in 2002, another three-judge court made a similar finding:      ``Voting in South Carolina continues to be racially polarized      to a very high degree in all regions of the state and in both      primary and general elections.'' As recently as 2004, the      Fourth Circuit affirmed the findings of a South Carolina      district court that ``voting in Charleston County Council      elections is severely and characteristically polarized along      racial lines.''       After Ashcroft, states can redistrict in ways that diminish      minority voters' political power. As Professor Nathaniel      Persily testified, the ``danger that Ashcroft seemed to      invite and that this legislation intends to fix is the      possibility that under the cloak of `influence districts' a      jurisdiction might dilute the minority vote by splitting      large minority communities among several districts in which      they really have no influence at all.'' Professor Persily      explained that under the Ashcroft precedent, the Department      of Justice could preclear a state redistricting plan that      split a 60% minority district into two 30% minority      influence districts, even though such a plan would      severely diminish minority voters' ability to elect their      preferred candidates. Moreover, combined with the Supreme      Court's holding in Bossier II, a state legislature could      enact these kinds of voting changes for the express      purpose of discriminating against minority voters, and yet      they nonetheless might be precleared under Section 5.       The VRARA restores Section 5 to its original intended      meaning so that it prohibits voting changes that undermine      racial minorities' ability to elect candidates of their      choice. The VRARA provides that ``[t]he purpose of subsection      (b) of this section is to protect the ability of such      [minority] citizens to elect their preferred candidates of      choice.'' This change to Section 5 makes clear that Congress      rejects the Supreme Court's Ashcroft decision and      reestablishes that a covered state's redistricting plan      cannot eliminate ``ability to elect'' districts and replace      them with ``influence districts.''       The amendment to Section 5 does not, however, freeze into      place the current minority voter percentages in any given      district. As stated by the dissenters in Georgia v. Ashcroft,      as well as by Professor Arrington and Professor Persily at      the Committee hearings, reducing the number of minorities in      a district is perfectly consistent with the pre-Ashcroft      understanding of Section 5 as long as other factors      demonstrate that minorities retain their ability to elect      their preferred candidates. The amendment is intended to make      clear that the addition of districts in which minorities      might have an influence on the political process cannot      compensate for the elimination of districts in which      minorities have the ability to elect a preferred candidate.      But there is no ``magic number'' that every district must      maintain to satisfy the ``ability to elect'' standard; the      percentages will vary depending on such variables as the      extent of racially polarized voting and white crossover      voting, registration rates, citizenship variables, and the      degree of voter turnout. As both Professor Arrington and      Professor Persily stated in their testimony, all of these      considerations should come into play, making the ``ability to      elect'' standard one that turns on the context of the      districts at issue, as was the case under the Beer standard.       The ``ability to elect'' standard does not lock in      districts that meet any particular threshold. Determinations      about whether a district provides the minority community the      ability to elect must be made on a case-by-case basis.      Indeed, prior to Georgia v. Ashcroft, the Department of      Justice utilized case-by-case analysis to determine whether a      voting change impacted the minority community's ``ability to      elect.'' Specifically, DOJ performed an intensely      jurisdiction-specific review of election results, demographic      data, maps and other information in order to compare the      minority community's ability to elect under benchmark and      proposed plans. Other information considered by DOJ, outlined      in the Procedures for the Administration of Section 5 of the      Voting Rights Act,'' 28 C.F.R., Part 51, include the extent      to which a reasonable and legitimate justification for the      change exists, the extent to which the jurisdiction followed      objective guidelines and fair and conventional procedures in      adopting the change, the extent to which the jurisdiction      afforded members of racial and language minority groups an      opportunity to participate in the decision to make the      change, and the extent to which the jurisdiction took the      concerns of members of racial and language minority groups      into account in making the change. This analysis allows      jurisdictions a degree of flexibility in the adoption of      their voting changes.       In sum, to avoid violating Section 5's non-retrogression      standard, a covered state's redistricting must ensure that it      has not diminished minority voters' ability to elect their      candidates of choice. The ``ability to elect'' standard that      is being reestablished through the VRARA prevents all types      of retrogressive changes, whether they come from the      dispersion of a minority community among too many districts      (cracking) or the overconcentration of minorities among too      few (packing).                              Bossier Fix       The second of these provisions is usually referred to as      the ``Bossier Fix.''       We have acted in this reauthorization to restore the VRA's      original standing and effectiveness. After hearing extensive      testimony and carefully reviewing the record created in the      Senate and in the House of Representatives, we concluded that      the Supreme Court's holding in a case called Reno v. Bossier      Parish (``Bossier II''), went against both the original      intent of Congress and established Department of Justice and      judicial precedent. Section 5 of the VRA requires that all      changes in covered jurisdictions ``not have the purpose and .      . . not have the effect of denying or abridging the right to      vote on account of race or color.'' Accordingly, the process      for preclearing changes consists of two prongs. First, it      consists of an inquiry as to the purpose of the change in      question. Then, it requires a separate examination into the      effect of the change. A plan may not receive preclearance      without satisfying requirements under both prongs.      Traditionally, the purpose prong has been a common basis for      Department of Justice objections to plans submitted by      covered jurisdictions. However, since ``Bossier II'' the      scope     and effectiveness of the purpose prong has been dramatically      limited.       That is why we are amending the VRA to make clear that a      covered jurisdiction does not have to disprove the existence      of any Section 2 violation to obtain Section 5 preclearance.      Rather, contrary to the suggestions of a handful of my      colleagues who wish to undermine what we accomplish today,      this bill amends the VRA to make clear that it prohibits all      voting changes enacted with a discriminatory purpose.                       The Holding in Bossier II       The controversy in Bossier II arose when the school board      (``the Board'') of Bossier Parish, Louisiana sought to redraw      the districts that elected its members. At the time of the      1990s redistricting, African-Americans made up approximately      20% of the parish's population. They did not, however,      comprise a majority in any of the twelve school board      districts in the parish. In 1992, the Board adopted a new      redistricting plan that did not create any new majority-     African-American districts, rejecting an alternate plan that      would have created two majority-African-American districts.       In January of the following year, the Board submitted its      redistricting plan for preclearance to the Department of      Justice; upon objection by the Attorney General, the Board      filed suit for a declaratory judgment in the federal district      court to obtain preclearance. At trial, the Attorney General      argued that the plan should not be approved under Section 5      for two reasons. First, the plan diluted the voting strength      of African-American voters, in violation of a separate      provision of the VRA, Section 2. Second, the plan was enacted      with a discriminatory purpose.       At trial, DOJ presented extensive evidence that the plan      was, in fact, enacted with a discriminatory motive. The      Board's refusal to draw a single African-American majority      district stood in stark contrast to its own admission that      creation of a majority-African-American district was clearly      feasible, and in contrast to expert testimony that African-     Americans would only be able to elect their chosen candidate      in such a district. Moreover, the manner in which the      districts were drawn suggested--in the Board cartographer's      own opinion--that traditionally African-American populations      were purposefully divided into adjoining white districts, a      process known as ``fracturing.'' Most alarming, however, was      testimony suggesting that certain Board members were openly      hostile to African-American representation or African-     American-majority districts.       In spite of this evidence, the trial court precleared the      plan. The case twice reached the Supreme Court on separate      appeals. The first time, the Court agreed with the trial      court that a voting change cannot be denied preclearance      under Section 5 solely because the change violated Section 2.      The second time--Bossier II--the Court addressed a more      contentious question: whether Section 5 prohibited all voting      changes enacted with a discriminatory purpose. The Court      answered this question in the negative, holding that Section      5 does not bar electoral changes enacted with a      discriminatory purpose if those changes were designed only to      maintain, and not worsen, the current electoral strength of a      protected minority group.       Bossier II was premised on the holding in an earlier      Section 5 case, Beer v. United States. In Beer, the Supreme      Court interpreted the effects prong to prohibit only those      changes that had a ``retrogressive'' impact on the voting      strength of minorities in a covered jurisdiction. The      question of retrogression--whether or not a proposed plan      decreased voting strength as compared to the previous plan--     thus became the critical measure of success or failure under      the effects prong. In Bossier II, Justice Scalia argued that      since ``purpose'' and ``effect'' both modify the same object      in the text of the statute--``denying or abridging the right      to vote on account of race or color''--they must prohibit the      same activity. If Beer held that the effects prong only      prohibited ``retrogression,'' the Court's majority reasoned      that Section 5 would only prohibit retrogressive intent. The      end result of this argument was aptly summarized by Debo      Adegbile, who testified: ``Since [Bossier II], non-     retrogressive voting changes motivated by racial animus, no      matter how clearly demonstrated . . . are insulated from      Section 5 objection under the purpose prong.'' Justice      Souter, dissenting from the majority opinion, came to the      same conclusion: ``Now executive and judicial officers of the      United States will be forced to preclear illegal and      unconstitutional voting schemes patently intended to      perpetuate discrimination.''            Problems With the Purpose Prong Under Bossier II       The holding in Bossier II is at odds with congressional      intent and established judicial and Department of Justice      precedent. It effectively eviscerates the purpose prong of      Section 5 and compromises the overall ability of Section 5 to      combat innovative discriminatory practices, which it was      originally designed to prohibit. Committee reports from the      89th Congress uniformly suggest that the Senate and House of      Representatives designed Section 5 as a broad protection      against increasingly innovative discriminatory practices.      This is reflected in the fact that the language of the      provision closely parallels that of the 15th Amendment, which      prohibits intentional discrimination. This is not a      coincidence; members of both the Senate Judiciary Committee      and the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee      explicitly cited the VRA as a bill primarily intended to      enforce the 15th Amendment.       In 1966, when the Supreme Court heard the first      constitutional challenge to the VRA, it reaffirmed the broad      scope envisioned by Congress. In South Carolina v.      Katzenbach, the Court explained that the VRA was designed      ``to rid the country of racial discrimination in voting,''      and described Section 5 as ``the heart of the Act.'' Six      years later, in Perkins v. Matthews, the Court stated that      there was ``little question'' that Congress intended Section      5 to ensure that covered jurisdictions ``not institute new      laws with respect to voting that might have a racially      discriminatory purpose or effect.'' In 1975, far from      repudiating earlier Committee reports or the statements in      Katzenbach and Perkins, this Committee further emphasized a      broad role for Section 5, one that went beyond the mere      preservation of minority voting strength.       The purpose prong established by Bossier II is far narrower      than Congress intended. While the retrogression standard      defines prohibited effects, the same standard limits the      purpose prong to the point of insignificance. After Bossier      II, the only occasion in which the purpose prong would be the      sole basis for a Department of Justice objection would be      when the covered jurisdiction intended to decrease minority      voting strength, but somehow failed in this effort.       More incongruously, however, as conceived by Bossier II,      the purpose prong would actually reward those covered      jurisdictions with the most extensive histories of minority      vote dilution; this is what Professor Anita Earls described      in hearings before the Judiciary Committee as the      ``discrimination dividend.'' Where a jurisdiction has      traditionally structured its election methods and voting      practices so that minority voters have no voting strength,      and no ability to elect candidates of their choice to begin      with, it is impossible for new voting practices to be      retrogressive. When no retrogression is possible, it is also      impossible to prove retrogressive intent. The Bossier II      interpretation of the purpose prong would freeze voter      discrimination at existing levels, to the benefit of the most      discriminatory of jurisdictions.       I find no evidence to suggest that the 94th Congress      enacted Section 5 with such a limited--and indeed,      paradoxical--scope in mind. To the contrary, Section 5 was      designed to target precisely those areas with the most      entrenched histories of discrimination. The Supreme Court      long recognized this. I agree with the findings of the      House Committee on the Judiciary, which concluded that the      purpose prong was designed to prevent all voting changes      with a discriminatory intent. We reported VRARA and will      pass it today to restore the original understanding of      that provision.       In addition to contravening congressional intent, Bossier      II is also in conflict with more than three decades of      judicial and Department of Justice precedent. Prior to      Bossier II, the Department of Justice interpreted the purpose      prong of Section 5 to block all changes enacted with a      discriminatory intent, regardless of retrogressive effect.      This was not a limited practice. Prior to Bossier II, a large      percentage of all Department objections were based on      discriminatory purpose alone.       The Supreme Court reached the same conclusion, consistently      construing Section 5 as barring implementation of electoral      changes if and when they were adopted with a discriminatory      purpose. In City of Richmond v. United States, for example,      the Court held that a proposed annexation had no      discriminatory effect under Section 5. However, the Court      nevertheless remanded the case to the District Court to      determine if the change was adopted for a discriminatory      purpose. As the Court stated in City of Richmond: ``An      official action, whether an annexation or otherwise, taken      for the purpose of discriminating against Negroes on account      of their race has no legitimacy at all under our Constitution      or under the statute.'' Likewise, in City of Pleasant Grove      v. United States, a covered jurisdiction was denied      preclearance for a proposed annexation, even though      retrogressive effect was impossible, because of clear      evidence that the annexation was enacted with a racially      discriminatory purpose. The Court explained that ``[t]o hold      otherwise would make appellant's extraordinary success in      resisting integration thus far a shield for further      resistance.'' Even in Beer, the purported foundation for      Bossier II, the Court provided that changes that actually      improved the voting strength of minorities could still be      denied preclearance if they were intentionally      discriminatory. The District Court for the District of      Columbia--the body charged with exclusive jurisdiction over      Section 5 suits--also consistently held (before Bossier II)      that Section 5 prohibits changes enacted with a      discriminatory intent.       For thirty-five years, Congress reviewed and renewed the      Voting Rights Act and amended Section 2 in response to      another Supreme Court precedent, Mobile v. Bolden, but      Congress did not change or raise any objection to the      judicial or Justice Department interpretations of the Section      5 purpose prong. Instead, Congress reauthorized Section 5      unamended on three separate occasions. Until Bossier II, all      three branches of government--the courts, the executive, and      the legislature--appeared to be in agreement that the purpose      prong prohibited all     changes enacted with a discriminatory intent.          Bossier II Undermines the Effectiveness of Section 5       Bossier II has had a striking impact on the Section 5      purpose prong, minimizing the number of purpose-based      objections and undermining the overall ability of Section 5      to block discriminatory electoral practices in covered      jurisdictions. The record of preclearance objections after      Bossier II suggests that the purpose prong under Bossier      II has become inconsequential and has no meaning apart      from retrogressive effect. After Bossier II, there was a      steep drop in the number of Department of Justice      objections based on purpose alone. In the 1980s, 25% of      DOJ objections--83 objections in total--were based on      intent alone; in the 1990s, this number increased to 43%,      with 151 objections solely based on discriminatory intent.      In the five years following Bossier II, only two out of a      total of forty-three objections (4%) have been interposed      because of retrogressive intent, the only purpose      prohibited by Bossier II. In the words of one House      Judiciary Committee witness, Mark Posner, the purpose      prong ``has effectively been read almost entirely out of      Section 5.''       According to Mr. Posner's testimony, the impact of Bossier      II on Section 5 enforcement is evident from the recent      history of decennial redistricting. After the 1980 Census,      the Department of Justice objected to 7% of redistricting      plans filed by covered jurisdictions; this rate increased to      8% after the 1990 Census. In contrast, DOJ objected to only      1% of redistricting plans filed after the 2000 Census. There      is strong evidence that the drop is significantly      attributable to the absence of purpose-based objections.       The inability of Section 5 to block changes enacted with a      discriminatory intent is highly troubling. At its core, the      Voting Rights Act was designed to fight discrimination in      American politics; the VRA is a vehicle to enforce the 14th      and 15th Amendments, which themselves prohibit intentional      discrimination in various settings. Section 5 was the      centerpiece of this effort, effectively shifting the burden      of fighting racial discrimination from the victims to the      state. Allowing expressly discriminatory plans to attain      preclearance solely because the voting strength of a minority      group is too weak to be further worsened undermines the      original impetus of the VRA in general, and Section 5 in      particular. Furthermore, it shifts the burden of fighting      voting discrimination back to its victims.                  Restoring Section 5 Purpose Inquiry       For the reasons I have described, we find it necessary to      amend Section 5 to restore the purpose prong to its original      scope, enabling the Attorney General and the District Court      of the District of Columbia to object to any voting changes      enacted with a discriminatory intent. The VRARA accomplishes      this by adding subsections (b) and (c) to Section 5, which      state that, ``(b) Any voting qualification or prerequisite to      voting, or standard, practice, or procedure with respect to      voting that has the purpose of or will have the effect of      diminishing the ability of any citizens of the United States      on account of race or color, or in contravention of the      guarantees set forth in section 4(f)(2), to elect their      preferred candidates of choice denies or abridges the right      to vote within the meaning of subsection (a) of this      section,'' and ``(c) The term ``purpose'' in subsections (a)      and (b) of this section shall include any discriminatory      purpose.''       These sections reject the holding in Bossier II and clarify      Congress' original intent that Section 5 prohibit all voting      changes enacted with a discriminatory purpose. This would      also realign the purpose prong with constitutional standards,      allowing Section 5 to prohibit intentional discrimination      that would otherwise be unconstitutional under the 15th      Amendment. I reject any reading of Section 5 that would allow      explicitly discriminatory voting changes to be precleared,      solely because the voting strength of the minority group in      question cannot be further diminished. I believe that the      VRARA remedies this problem and restores the purpose prong of      Section 5 to prevent purposeful discrimination.
