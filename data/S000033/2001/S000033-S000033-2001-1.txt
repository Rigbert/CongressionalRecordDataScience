 Speaker, I am pleased to announce today that over 1,700 local, State, and national organizations from throughout this country have endorsed H.R. 2394, legislation that I introduced last June, to create a National Affordable Housing Trust Fund. And I especially want to thank for their organizing efforts the National Low-Income Housing Coalition for all of their help in bringing these organizations together around this terribly important issue.  It is almost unprecedented to have such an outpouring of support from such a broad array of groups representing working people through their unions, business leaders, different religious affiliations, bankers, environmentalists, and, of course, affordable-housing advocates. This is perhaps one of the most significant grass roots campaigns to support legislation at one time and has helped us generate our already 126 bipartisan cosponsors. I am here today on the floor of the House to thank all of the groups that have endorsed this legislation and to ask my colleagues to cosponsor this important and much-needed bill. We have come a long way in a short time; but obviously, we need to go further.  A complete list of all of the groups that have endorsed this legislation can be found at the National Housing Trust Fund Campaign's Web site at www.nhtf.org. That is www.nhtf.org, for a complete list of all of the organizations that have endorsed the National Affordable Housing Trust Fund legislation.  Mr. Speaker, experts from across the country have acknowledged that the issue of affordable housing has rapidly become a major national problem. That is true in my State of Vermont, and it is true all across this country. It is an issue in which millions of low-income seniors, the elderly, disabled, and families with children are increasingly unable to afford decent housing.  According to HUD, about 5.4 million Americans today are paying more than half of their limited incomes, more than half of their limited incomes, on housing, or are living in severely substandard housing. Since 1990, the number of families who have ``worst case housing needs'' has increased by 12 percent. That is 600,000 more Americans who cannot afford a decent and safe place to live.                              {time}  1600  For these families living paycheck to paycheck, one unforeseen circumstance, a sick child, a needed car repair or a large utility bill can send them into homelessness.  This crisis must be addressed. Every American must be entitled to decent, affordable housing. The question is where do we begin? According to the accounting firm of Deloitte & Touche, profits generated by the Federal Housing Administration are expected to exceed $26 billion over the next 7 years. H.R. 2394 would use the surplus to increase affordable housing by creating an affordable housing trust fund. According to housing experts, if the FHA surplus was used to build affordable housing, we could more than triple affordable housing construction next year and provide accommodations to more than 200,000 families.  Mr. Speaker, not only would a national affordable housing trust fund help solve the affordable housing crisis in the United States, it would also generate 1.8 million decent paying new jobs and nearly $50 billion in wages according to a recent study. As today's economy continues to sputter with layoffs up over 600 percent from last year, and as millions of Americans are paying 40 to 50 percent of their limited incomes on housing, the creation of a national affordable housing trust fund is needed more than it has ever been needed.  Mr. Speaker, the bottom line here is that we can put Americans to work building the affordable housing that millions of our fellow Americans need, and we can accomplish two important goals at the same time. Number one, combatting the recession by putting people to work; and second of all, providing decent housing to the families that need it. This is a very important piece of legislation, and I am very proud that 1,700 different organizations, religious organizations, grassroots organizations, are supporting it. I ask my colleagues to support it as well.                          ____________________
