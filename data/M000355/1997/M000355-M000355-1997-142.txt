 President, I listened with interest to the comments of the Democratic leader and Senator Feingold. I would just like to say briefly in response, there is no reluctance to debate this issue. Those of us who oppose McCain-Feingold look forward to the debate. We relish the debate.  My colleague in the chair remembers when we stayed up all night to debate this about 5 weeks before the 1994 election, which was the greatest victory for my party in congressional races in this century.  So let me just disabuse all of my colleagues of the notion that there is any reluctance on the part of those who oppose putting the Government in charge of political speech of individual groups, candidates, and parties in this country, any reluctance to debate the merits of that proposal. There is no reluctance whatsoever.  What the majority leader was trying to do here today was to structure that debate in such a way as to provide minimal inconvenience to Members of the Senate. The Democratic leader said we can get there the hard way or the easy way. We have no reluctance to get there the hard way, Mr. President, no reluctance whatsoever.  The majority leader was simply trying to accommodate all of the Senate by providing an orderly, structured way to have a debate that we relish, look forward to making. My experience with this issue over the years is the more colleagues and the American people and, yes, the press learns about the issue the better, the greater likelihood the first amendment will be protected.  So bring on the debate. We are ready for it. But, obviously, it will be a lot easier on everyone if we did it an orderly, structured way. That is what the majority leader was seeking to do. I commend him for that, and look forward to the debate that will be forthcoming. We will be happy to do it either the hard way or the easy way, whichever seems to suit the Senate the best.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from Georgia.                          ____________________
