 President, I think I have about 3\1/2\ minutes. I am going to take 1\1/2\ minutes for myself, and then I hope Senator Kyl will get over here. He asked me for 2 minutes. Then that would use up our time.  The first reaction to the response to my remarks that I have that I want to clear up is that the author of the amendment speaks to the point that it only hits imports coming into the United States if a company moved overseas. The fact is--it may be a flaw in the way it is written--this amendment hits all imports coming into the United States.  The second point is, it was stated that this was not a tax increase. This amendment raises $6.5 billion. In my judgment, when you change tax law and you bring revenue in, that is a tax increase.  The second issue regarding Huffy moving overseas, the response to that is, their competition is in China and Taiwan. Companies have to do what they can to meet the competition. Would they rather have a Huffy company that existed as a U.S. corporation competing with China and Taiwan manufacturers or would they rather have the whole company go out of business? If you do not meet your competition, you do not compete you die.  Then there was reference to the fact the GAO report says 61 percent of companies did not pay taxes. That could be true. But that also includes new companies and it includes companies that maybe are dormant; in fact, it does include all of those.  Here is the significant thing about this GAO report: It says 96 percent of all large corporations in America pay tax.  We are back to the issue of what this amendment does or does not do. It does not do enough.  I have to ask the Presiding Officer if Senator Kyl does not arrive and I have 1 or 2 minutes remaining, what do I do? I want to save the time for him, if I can, under the rules of the Senate.  I yield the floor and save my time for Senator Kyl.
