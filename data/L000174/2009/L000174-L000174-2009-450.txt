 I have asked my colleagues on the other side--and I know this is something that is being looked at because we have both Republicans and Democrats, as I said earlier, trying on a rainy day to move around airplane schedules--if we might be able to have the vote very soon but to reserve the time for Senators who have asked to speak on this subsequent to the vote.  There are no Republicans on the floor at the moment, so I am obviously not going to make a unanimous consent request, but were I to make a unanimous consent request, it would be after consultation with the Republican side that we go ahead and have the rollcall vote and then continue whatever time is necessary for debate.  So I mention that is a request I will make at some point, when there is somebody to represent the Republican leader on the floor.  Until then, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask unanimous consent that the time be charged to both sides equally.
