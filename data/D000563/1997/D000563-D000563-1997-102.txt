 I rise in strong support of this amendment. Think about this for a moment. Have you ever met a parent who said, ``I had the greatest news last night; I went home and my daughter came home and announced she had started smoking.''  I have never heard that. I never heard a single parent say how proud they were to learn their children started smoking and yet statistics show us across America the fastest growing group of new smokers is children, and particularly young women, who decide in high school or sometimes earlier to start buying this product illegally to start smoking, to develop a nicotine addiction which can haunt them for a lifetime, leading to disease and sometimes to death.  What Senator Harkin is doing is just eminently sensible. If there is such a thing as a family value, this is a family value amendment because what Senator Harkin is doing with this amendment is to make sure that the Food and Drug Administration has the resources to enforce existing law. It is not a new imposition of law from the Federal Government. It is just common sense. Keep this dangerous addictive product out of the hands of children. And the people who want to sell it to kids illegally have to be stopped.  If we are going to do that, it takes more than a speech on the Senate floor. It takes a commitment of resources. I am sorry that Senator Harkin's effort lost last time by a handful of votes. There were a lot of speeches given and a lot of reasons given. I hope my colleagues have had a chance to go home during this break and talk to a number of families, as I have. They should realize, as I do, how critically important it is to pass the Harkin amendment and give the FDA the resources to make sure that our kids are not lured into this dangerous addiction.
