President, I rise today to introduce the Child Care Quality Incentive Act of 2001, which seeks to provide incentive grants to improve the quality of child care in this country.  The child care system in this country is in crisis; the need for affordable and accessible high quality child care far exceeds the supply.  As long as an estimated 14 million children under age six, including six million infants and toddlers, spend some part of every day in child care, the availability of quality programs and settings will continue to be a serious issue facing this Nation.  With full-day child care costing as much as $4,000 to $10,000 per year, per child, and with Federal assistance severely limited, many working families cannot afford quality child care. For low-income families with young children, the cost of child care can consume anywhere from 25 to 45 percent of their monthly income.  And the demand for all types of child care is likely to increase, as maternal employment continues to rise, as well as the need to meet the requirements of welfare reform. At the same time the need for care is growing, we must focus on the quality of care provided for our children.  Many studies, including research findings from the National Institute for Child Health and Development, show that quality early care and education leads to increased cognitive abilities, positive classroom learning behavior, an increased likelihood of long-term school success, and consequently, a greater likelihood of long-term and social self-sufficiency.  High quality child care not only prepares children for school, it helps them succeed in life. We must therefore be more diligent in our efforts to improve the quality of child care in this country.  Quality of care means providing a safe, healthy environment for our children; well-trained providers; good staff-to-child ratios so staff can interact with the children in a developmental setting; low staff turnover that fosters a sense of security for the children; and age-appropriate activities that enhance learning.  When we look at the quality of our current system, the findings are appalling. A study of Federal, nonprofit, for-profit, and in-home child care settings conducted by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission found that two-thirds of these child care settings had at least one major safety hazard. The study documented at least 56 deaths among children in child care settings since 1990, and reported that in 1997, 31,000 children ages four and younger received emergency room treatment for injuries in child care centers or schools.  Another study in four States found that only 1 in 7 child care centers provide care that promotes healthy development, while 1 in 8 child care centers provide care that actually threatens the safety and health of children.  The results of a very recent study conducted by the Center for the Child Care Workforce are also startling. It finds that the child care industry is losing well-educated teaching staff and administrators at an alarming rate and hiring replacement teachers with less training and education.  This study, conducted over a six-year period from 1994 to 2000, found that 76 percent of the teaching staff employed in the centers surveyed in 1996, and 82 percent of those working in the centers in 1994 were no longer on the job in 2000. And of those teaching staff who left, nearly half had completed a bachelor's degree, compared to only one-third of the new teachers who replaced them.  Furthermore, the study found that director turnover rates were exceedingly high, contributing to staff instability. Teaching staff and directors reported that high turnover among their colleagues negatively affected their ability to do their jobs.  We frequently hear of the critical shortage of qualified elementary and secondary school teachers. In contrast, the staffing crisis in early care barely registers in the public awareness, but is equally important and worthy of our attention.  The inability of many child care centers to offer competitive salaries is a serious obstacle to attracting and retaining qualified staff. Despite recognition that higher wages contribute to greater staff stability, compensation for the majority of teaching positions has not kept pace with the cost of living over the last six years.  Wages, when adjusted for inflation, have actually decreased six percent for day care teaching staff, and K-12 teachers earn up to twice as much as child care providers with equivalent education and experience. At present, there is little economic incentive to begin or continue a career in child care.  Researchers have consistently found that the cornerstone of quality child care is the presence of sensitive, consistent, well-trained and well-compensated caregivers. Yet many centers are unable to provide children with even this most essential component of early care.  This high rate of safety hazards and unstable workforce results significantly from low payment or reimbursement rates for the provision of child care. Prior to October 1996, states were required to make payments to (or subsidize) child care providers based on the 75th percentile of the market rate, or the level at which parents can afford 75 out of 100 local providers.  However, with the passage of welfare reform legislation, this requirement, which had not been effectively enforced in the first place, completely vanished. Currently, federal Child Care Development Fund regulations require states to conduct market rate surveys every other year, but there is no requirement for States to actually use the market rate surveys to set payment rates.  Indeed, according to a February 1998 report by the Department of Health and Human Services, 29 out of the 50 States and the District of Columbia did not make payment rates that were based on the 75th percentile of the current market rate, often asserting that budget constraints prevented them from doing so.  Furthermore, a January 1998 General Accounting Office report noted that while states conduct biennial market surveys, some set reimbursement rates based on older surveys. And when States set reimbursement rates significantly lower than actual costs, child care choices for families become severely limited.  When States set low rates or fail to update rates, they force working families into a difficult dilemma, they must either place their children into lower cost, lower quality child care programs that will accept the State subsidy or come up with extra dollars to supplement the State subsidy and buy better quality child care.  The Children's Defense Fund, in a March 1998 report entitled, ``Locked Doors: States Struggling to Meet the Child Care Needs of Low-Income Working Families,'' noted that when rates are set below the market rate, child care providers are forced to cut corners ``in ways that lower the quality of care for children.''  And when rates fall below the real cost of providing care, child care providers who do not choose to reduce staff or lower salaries and benefits, allow physical conditions to deteriorate, forgo educational book, toy, and equipment purchases, may simply not accept children with subsidies, or may go out of business. These dilemmas can be avoided if we help States set payment rates that keep up with the market.  Recently, Rhode Island and many other States celebrated the sixth annual national Provider Appreciation Day, which presented us with an opportunity to honor one of the most under-recognized and under-compensated professions. I am therefore pleased to be joined by Senator Chris Dodd, a leader in improving child care, along with Senators Kennedy, Murray, Kerry, and Corzine in introducing the Child Care Quality Incentive Act, which seeks to redouble our child care efforts and renew the child care partnership with the states by providing incentive funding for States to increase payment rates.  Our legislation establishes a new, mandatory pool of funding under the Child Care and Development Block Grant, CCDBG. This new funding, coupled with mandatory, current market rate surveys, will form the foundation for significant increases in state payment rates for the provision of quality child care.  Increasing payment rates for the provision of child care is the key to quality. Better payment rates lead to higher quality child care as child care providers are able to attract and retain qualified staff, maintain a safe and healthy environment, and purchase age-appropriate educational materials.  At the same time, increased payment rates expand the number of choices parents have in finding quality child care, as providers are able to accept children whose parents had previously been unable to afford the cost of care.  While there is currently money available through the CCDBG that may be spent for quality initiatives, most states opt to expand availability of care rather than focus on quality. This bill allows funding to be used only for quality initiatives.  We have received overwhelming support for this bill from the child care community, including endorsements from USA Child Care, the Children's Defense Fund, Catholic Charities of USA, YMCA of USA, the National Child Care Association, and a host of organizations and agencies across the country.  Children are the hope of America, and they need the best of America. We cannot ask working families to choose between paying the rent, buying food, and being able to afford the quality care their children need. We've made a lot of progress in improving the health, safety, and well-being of children in this country. But as we approach the 21st century, we need to do more. If we are serious about putting parents to work and protecting children, we must invest more in child care help for families.  Our youngest and most vulnerable citizens, our children, deserve better from us. I urge my colleagues to join Senators Dodd, Kennedy, Murray, Kerry, Corzine, and me in this endeavor to improve the quality of child care by cosponsoring the Child Care Quality Incentive Act.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1000       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Child Care Quality Incentive      Act of 2001''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Recent research on early brain development reveals that      much of a child's growth is determined by early learning and      nurturing care. Research also shows that quality early care      and education leads to increased cognitive abilities,      positive classroom learning behavior, increased likelihood of      long-term school success, and greater     likelihood of long-term economic and social self-sufficiency.       (2) Each day an estimated 13,000,000 children, including      6,000,000 infants and toddlers, spend some part of their day      in child care. However, a study in 4 States found that only 1      in 7 child care centers provide care that promotes healthy      development, while 1 in 8 child care centers provide care      that threatens the safety and health of children.       (3) Full-day child care can cost $4,000 to $10,000 per      year.       (4) Although Federal assistance is available for child      care, funding is severely limited. Even with Federal      subsidies, many families cannot afford child care. For      families with young children and a monthly income under      $1,200, the cost of child care typically consumes 25 percent      of their income.       (5) Payment (or reimbursement) rates, which determine the      maximum the State will reimburse a child care provider for      the care of a child who receives a subsidy, are too low to      ensure that quality care is accessible to all families.       (6) Low payment rates directly affect the kind of care      children get and whether families can find quality child care      in their communities. In many instances, low payment rates      force child care providers to cut corners in ways that lower      the quality of care for children, including reducing number      of staff, eliminating staff training opportunities, and      cutting enriching educational activities and services.       (7) Children in low quality child care are more likely to      have delayed reading and language skills, and display more      aggression toward other children and adults.       (8) Increased payment rates lead to higher quality child      care as child care providers are able to attract and retain      qualified staff, provide salary increases and professional      training, maintain a safe and healthy environment, and      purchase basic supplies and developmentally appropriate      educational materials.       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to improve the      quality of, and access to, child care by increasing child      care payment rates.     SEC. 3.
