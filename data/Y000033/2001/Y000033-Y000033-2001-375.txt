Mr. Chairman, there will be an appropriate time to consider this amendment. When theauthorizing bill is passed, the vehicle will be available.  But at the present time, I must make a point of order against the amendment because it provides an appropriation for an unauthorized program and therefore violates clause 2 of rule XXI. Clause 2 of rule XXI states, in pertinent part, ``An appropriation may not be in order as an amendment for an expenditure not previously authorized by law.''  Mr. Chairman, the authorization for this program has not been signed into law.
