 President, I rise today to recognize my good friend Ellen Williams for her tremendous work as chairwoman of the Kentucky Republican Party.  To say that Ellen Williams is a busy woman is quite the understatement. Besides being a wife, Mom, soccer coach, and part-time career woman, Ellen is chairwoman of the Republican Party of Kentucky. She has a history of service spanning more than 15 years, which includes work in President Reagan's 1984 reelection campaign, Larry Forgy's 1995 gubernatorial campaign, and as state executive director of the Kentucky Republican Party in 1992-93. Ellen has shared her time, knowledge, and spirit with Kentucky Republicans over the last several years, and she continues to share her able leadership skills with us now as chairwoman of our party.  Ellen is a confident, capable leader. In her position as chairwoman, one of her many responsibilities is to be the voice of the Kentucky Republican Party. Ellen makes it her business to have her finger on the pulse of the State's Republicans. Considering the liberal leaning nature of the Kentucky press, I am fully aware of the challenge that being a spokesperson presents. Ellen is a true professional when it comes to dealing with the media, and handles each statement she gives and each press conference she holds with style and grace.  Another part of Ellen's job is to rally Kentucky Republicans for local, State and national races. This responsibility requires her to do a great deal of traveling--a recent Anderson News article says that Ellen has driven nearly 30,000 miles in the last year going to meetings and party events across the State. The fresh enthusiasm Ellen has brought to her post as chairwoman is invaluable, and I thank you, Ellen, for all that you do.  I also thank your husband, Greg, whom you have referred to as your ``co-chairman,'' and to your two young sons, Sam and Joey. I thank them for sharing you with Kentucky's Republicans, and for the love and support they provide which makes it possible for you to do the excellent job you do.  Ellen leads the party during an exciting time in Kentucky politics and in national politics. Our great state boasts two Republican U.S. Senators, five Republican Members of the U.S. Congress, a Republican majority in the State senate, and a promising November election for our Presidential nominee, Gov. George W. Bush. As chairman of Bush/Cheney 2000 in Kentucky, I want to say a special thank you, Ellen, for all of your hard work thus far. Thank you in advance for all of the hours of work yet to come before November 7.                          ____________________
