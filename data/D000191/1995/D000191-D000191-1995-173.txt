EMERSON. In an issue involving the jurisdiction of FERC, it would be FERC.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Reclaiming my time then, so the gentleman is preempting States' rights, and in the western States a number of States have opted to oppose projects by FERC, and now in this case, should a State oppose a project approved by FERC, FERC could overrule the State? Is that correct? I guess it is.
