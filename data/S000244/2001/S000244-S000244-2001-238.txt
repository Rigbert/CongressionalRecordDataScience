 Madam Speaker, H.R. 1892, the Family Sponsor Immigration Act of 2001, was introduced by the gentleman from California (Mr. Calvert) and amended in the Committee on the Judiciary by our other colleague, the gentleman from California (Mr. Issa). I want to thank both of them for bringing to our attention an unintended quirk in the Immigration and Nationality Act that needlessly keeps families separated. I want to thank them for developing this bill, which brings families back together.  Each year the United States provides hundreds of thousands of immigrant visas for spouses and other family members of U.S. citizens and permanent residents. Tragically, each year a number of these U.S. citizens and permanent residents petitioning for their family members will die before the immigration process is complete. Generally, INS regulations provide for the automatic revocation of a petition when the petitioner dies. The consequences are severe for a beneficiary when his or her petitioner dies before the beneficiary has adjusted status or received an immigrant visa.                              {time}  1500  If no other relative can qualify as a petitioner, then the beneficiary would lose an opportunity to become a permanent resident.  For instance, if a petition is revoked because a widowed citizen's father dies after petitioning for an adult unmarried daughter, the daughter would have no living mother to file a new petition. If another relative can file an immigrant visa petition for the beneficiary, the beneficiary would still go to the end of the line if the visa category were numerically limited.  For instance, if the daughter's mother was alive, she could file a new first-family preference petition. However, the daughter would lose the priority date, based upon the time her father's petition had been filed with the INS and would receive a later priority date based upon the filing date of her mother's petition. Given that first-family preference visas are now available to beneficiaries from Mexico with priority dates from April, 1994, and are available to those from the Philippines with priority dates from May, 1988, this can result in a significant additional delay before a visa is available.  Because of the severe consequences of the revocation of a visa petition, INS regulations do allow the Attorney General, in his or her discretion, to determine that, for humanitarian reasons, revocation would be inappropriate and thus complete the unification of a family.  However, there is a complication. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 requires that when a family member petitions for a relative to receive an immigrant visa, that visa can only be granted if the petitioner signs a legally binding affidavit of support promising to provide for the support of the immigrant. If the petitioner has died, obviously he or she cannot sign that affidavit. Thus, even in cases where the Attorney General feels a humanitarian waiver of the revocation of the visa petition is warranted, under current law a permanent resident visa cannot be granted because the affidavit requirement is unfulfilled.  Madam Speaker, H.R. 1892 solves this dilemma. It simply provides that in cases where the petitioner has died and the Attorney General has determined for humanitarian reasons that revocation of the petition would be inappropriate, a close family member other than the petitioner would be allowed to sign the necessary affidavit of support. Eligible family members of beneficiaries would include spouses, parents, grandparents, mothers-in-law and fathers-in-law, siblings, adult sons and daughters, adult sons-in-law and daughters-in-law, and grandchildren. Legal guardians would also be eligible.  In order to sign an affidavit of support, the individual would need to meet the general eligibility requirements needed to be an immigrant sponsor. Thus, he or she would need to, first, be a citizen or national of the United States or an alien who is lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence; second, be at least 18 years of age; third, be domiciled in a State, the District of Columbia, or any territory or possession of the United States; and, fourth, demonstrate the means to maintain an annual income equal to at least 125 percent of the Federal poverty line.  Madam Speaker, H.R. 1892 is a humanitarian and pro-family piece of legislation. I would urge my colleagues to support this bill.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
