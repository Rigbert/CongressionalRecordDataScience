SHORT TITLE; REFERENCE; TABLE OF CONTENTS.       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Class      Action Fairness Act of 2002''.       (b) Reference.--Whenever in this Act reference is made to      an amendment to, or repeal of, a section or other provision,      the reference shall be considered to be made to a section or      other provision of title 28, United States Code.       (c) Table of Contents.--The table of contents for this Act      is as follows:Sec. 1. Short title; reference; table of contents.Sec. 2. Findings and purposes.Sec. 3. Consumer class action bill of rights and improved procedures               for interstate class actions.Sec. 4. Federal district court jurisdiction of interstate class               actions.Sec. 5. Removal of interstate class actions to Federal district court.Sec. 6. Appeals of class action certification orders.Sec. 7. Effective date.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:       (1) Class action lawsuits are an important and valuable      part of our legal system when they permit the fair and      efficient resolution of legitimate claims of numerous parties      by allowing the claims to be aggregated into a single action      against a defendant that has allegedly caused harm.       (2) Over the past decade, there have been abuses of the      class action device that have harmed class members with      legitimate claims and defendants that have acted responsibly,      and that have thereby undermined public respect for our      judicial system.       (3) Class members have been harmed by a number of actions      taken by plaintiffs' lawyers, which provide little or no      benefit to class members as a whole, including--       (A) plaintiffs' lawyers receiving large fees, while class      members are left with coupons or other awards of little or no      value;       (B) unjustified rewards being made to certain plaintiffs at      the expense of other class members; and       (C) the publication of confusing notices that prevent class      members from being able to fully understand and effectively      exercise their rights.       (4) Through the use of artful pleading, plaintiffs are able      to avoid litigating class actions in Federal court, forcing      businesses and other organizations to defend interstate class      action lawsuits in county and State courts where--       (A) the lawyers, rather than the claimants, are likely to      receive the maximum benefit;       (B) less scrutiny may be given to the merits of the case;      and       (C) defendants are effectively forced into settlements, in      order to avoid the possibility of huge judgments that could      destabilize their companies.       (5) These abuses undermine our Federal system and the      intent of the framers of the Constitution in creating      diversity jurisdiction, in that county and State courts are--       (A) handling interstate class actions that affect parties      from many States;       (B) sometimes acting in ways that demonstrate bias against      out-of-State defendants; and       (C) making judgments that impose their view of the law on      other States and bind the rights of the residents of those      States.       (6) Abusive interstate class actions have harmed society as      a whole by forcing innocent parties to settle cases rather      than risk a huge judgment by a local jury, thereby costing      consumers billions of dollars in increased costs to pay for      forced settlements and excessive judgments.       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--       (1) to assure fair and prompt recoveries for class members      with legitimate claims;       (2) to protect responsible companies and other institutions      against interstate class actions in State courts;       (3) to restore the intent of the framers of the      Constitution by providing for Federal court consideration of      interstate class actions; and       (4) to benefit society by encouraging innovation and      lowering consumer prices.
