President, I am pleased that the Senate is passing S. 1515, the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act Amendments of 2000, and sending it to President Clinton for his signature into law. I want to congratulate the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, and the Senator from New Mexico, Senator Bingaman, for their leadership on this bill.  During the Senate Judiciary Committee consideration of this legislation last year, I offered an amendment on behalf of Senator Bingaman to add the category of renal disease affecting uranium miners to the coverage of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act. I am pleased to report that our amendment has been retained in the final version of this legislation. I know that Senator Bingaman sought higher compensation levels for radiation exposure victims in his original legislation, but has agreed to this bipartisan compromise to ensure the bill's final passage into law this year and to expedite compensation to radiation exposure victims in New Mexico.  I want to commend Senator Hatch and Senator Bingaman for a job well done.
