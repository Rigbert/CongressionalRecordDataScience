Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 5319) to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to require recipients of universal service support for schools and libraries to protect minors from commercial social networking websites and chat rooms, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                               H.R. 5319       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Deleting Online Predators      Act of 2006''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       The Congress finds that--       (1) sexual predators approach minors on the Internet using      chat rooms and social networking websites, and, according to      the United States Attorney General, one in five children has      been approached sexually on the Internet;       (2) sexual predators can use these chat rooms and websites      to locate, learn about, befriend, and eventually prey on      children by engaging them in sexually explicit conversations,      asking for photographs, and attempting to lure children into      a face to face meeting; and       (3) with the explosive growth of trendy chat rooms and      social networking websites, it is becoming more and more      difficult to monitor and protect minors from those with      devious intentions, particularly when children are away from      parental supervision.
