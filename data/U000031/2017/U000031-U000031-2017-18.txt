Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3043, the HydropowerPolicy Modernization Act of 2017. This legislation, introduced by my friend and colleague from the Energy and Commerce Committee, Cathy McMorris Rodgers, is an important step toward modernizing our energy infrastructure, creating jobs, and, yes, strengthening our economy. I want to thank her for her commitment to this issue.  The committee went through regular order with the bill. We held two hearings on background issues, one legislative hearing, and both subcommittee and full committee markups, where the bill was agreed to by a voice vote. Following the markups, bipartisan committee staff held more meetings to hear from over a dozen Tribal governments to gather additional views.  I think that the resulting bill strikes a careful balance. Changes were made to increase State and Tribal consultation requirements, and a very strong savings clause was added to protect States' authorities under the Clean Water Act.  Hydropower is an essential component of an all-of-the-above energy strategy for this country. Hydropower is clean; it is renewable and affordable base load power. It is good for consumers' electricity bills, and it is also good for jobs, which is why labor is strongly supportive of this legislation.  There is a tremendous opportunity to expand hydropower production on existing nonpowered dams. Less than 3 percent of the dams in the U.S., approximately 2,200 dams, produce electricity. There are also opportunities to improve the process for the projects that are due for relicensing. By 2030, over 400 existing projects, with almost 19,000 megawatts of capacity, will begin the relicensing process, and these projects, in fact, may be at risk.  Fixing the licensing process would also improve safety. Upgrading the performance of existing dams and utilizing existing nonpowered dams, canals, and conduits would enable investments, which would address aging dams and, yes, improve overall safety.  The duration, complexity, and uncertainty of the hydropower licensing process creates significant challenges that prevent investments that would create jobs and benefit consumers. The licensing process for a new hydropower development project can last over a decade and costs tens of millions of dollars--significantly longer than the time that it takes to construct a natural gas-fired power plant of the same size.  This legislation, H.R. 3043, would level the playing field by modernizing the permitting process without compromising environmental protections. The bill improves administrative efficiency, accountability, and transparency. It requires balanced, timely decisionmaking and reduces duplicative oversight from the multiple Federal agencies that review hydropower applications.  This bill brings certainty and timeliness to the licensing process by enhancing consultation with Federal, State, and local agencies and Indian Tribes, and it requires FERC to establish a process for setting the schedule for review. H.R. 3043 streamlines and improves procedures to identify scheduling issues, propose licensing conditions, and resolve disputes.  This bill also contains provisions to expedite the approval process for an amendment to a license for a qualifying hydro project upgrade. Without the hydropower licensing improvements in this bill--without them--we risk losing investment opportunities in new hydropower infrastructure which would benefit consumers with affordable electricity and expand the use of clean, renewable energy.  Again, I thank my colleagues for their work, and the great staff, on this important piece of legislation.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.         House of Representatives, Committee on Oversight and            Government Reform,                                 Washington, DC, October 31, 2017.     Hon.
