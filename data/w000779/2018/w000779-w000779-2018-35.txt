President, today the Senate passed a preconferenced Federal Aviation Authority bill without amendment offered or accepted by myself or my colleagues. I voted against this bill primarily for three reasons.  First, this FAA reauthorization does not include a critical and necessary consumer protection bill, the FAIR Fees Act. The FAIR Fees Act would have limited the amount that airlines could gouge consumers when they wanted to change flights. Now, without this provision, working Oregonians will still have to pay absurd prices, such as $200, to change a simple $80 flight.  Second, Senator Merkley and I had introduced legislation to qualify the Crater Lake-Klamath Regional Airport to receive Essential Air Service funding, and despite our attempts to include it to this 5-year FAA authorization, the legislation was excluded. The airport near Klamath Falls is currently without commercial air service, and Essential Air Service funding would help them recruit an airline to return commercial air service to the region. I was disappointed this important provision was not included by either the House or the Senate because it would have increased economic development and tourism for the Klamath region. I will continue to pursue any and all avenues to help restore commercial air service to the Crater Lake-Klamath Regional Airport, a must for quality of life and economic development in the Klamath Falls area.  Third, this bill includes the Preventing Emerging Threats Act, legislation aimed at empowering Federal agents to prevent drone-based crime.This legislation confronts a clear need and represents careful--but incomplete--efforts to create a narrow program with appropriate congressional oversight. Specifically, this bill allows for broad carveouts to the Wiretap Act, and it is not clear this broad authority is necessary. Additionally, the privacy protections could be interpreted as applying only to information gathered between the drone and the drone operator and not applying to additional information gathered, collected, stored, or analyzed while initially detecting drones. Interpreted this way, the bill represents a massive expansion of the government's warrantless wiretapping authority.  I have received assurances from the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Justice, and my colleagues from the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee to work together to address my concerns. Despite that, I voted against this bill while looking forward to remedying this quickly in perfecting legislation. Similarly, I am looking forward to published guidance from the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security making clear that all information gathered, stored, analyzed, or collected under this act are subject to the privacy protections.                          ____________________
