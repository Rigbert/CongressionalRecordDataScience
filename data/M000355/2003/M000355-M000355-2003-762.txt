 President, I rise today to recognize the volunteers of the Fort Knox Game Warden Program for their longstanding commitment to the community. These volunteers assist the Provost Marshal, the Hunt Control and the Range Control offices in maintaining the hunting program's outstanding safety record by enforcing the Fort Knox and Kentucky Fish and Game regulations on the base's 170 square miles.  The program's loyal volunteers have an active role in the community, especially during the deer-hunting season when they operate the deer check stations and monitor hunter activities. Their efforts also have enhanced the natural habitat of the area's wildlife. Throughout the program's 50-year life, volunteers have planted food plots, developed wildlife sanctuaries and reintroduced wild quail to the environment.  These unsung heroes actively devote time to serving the post's six hunting zones consisting of 109,000 acres. They help protect both small and large game including squirrel, dove, rabbit, quail and turkey. In addition to the three weekends available each year for adult firearms deer hunting, the Game Warden Program sponsors a youth gun hunt for one weekend each year.  I would like to acknowledge each of the volunteers for their time and commitment protecting the community and surrounding environment: Donald Buhl, George Phelps, Bob Sherrard, Jack Baxter, Bill Schweiss, Alfred Maruszewski, Michael Dages, Charlie Flowers, Wayne Walters, Gerald Sasser, Jr., Daniel Clifford, Tim Dages, Kenny Kine, Ron O'Bannon, Harold Scott, Walter Sholar, Hugh Harris, William Magruder, James Elliott, Robbie Ammons, James Miller, Jackie Payne, Willard Campbell, Joseph Banks, Michael Gaddie, Richard McQuillen, Mary McQuillen, Wayne Creekmore, Gary Thompson, Martha Campbell, Karl Rohland, Ace Clark, James Prather, Mark McNutt, Kelley Argabright, Dr. Gerald Sasser, Tony Parsley, Crockett Banks, Dwayne Campbell, and Rodney Circle.  The Fort Knox Game Warden Program and its volunteers have faithfully served the community for many years, and their contributions should not be overlooked. On behalf of myself and my colleagues in the Senate, I thank them for their dedicated service to the Commonwealth of Kentucky.                          ____________________
