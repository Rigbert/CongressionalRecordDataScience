President, someone once said that the only thing which truly lives forever is a Government program in Washington, DC. I am introducing legislation today to rein in the growth of those big Government programs and to require the Congress to stop rubberstamping programs in this body. The sunset legislation that I put forward today will require the key programs of Government to face regular scrutiny and stand or fall on their merits.  This legislation would give Congress a new and powerful tool to rein in the bureaucracy and create a Federal Government that would be smaller, less costly, and more accountable to the American people.  The legislation that I introduce today would establish a special bipartisan, bicameral congressional committee which would be charged with reviewing the key programs of Government every 5 years. Any U.S. citizen of voting age could petition this committee for the termination of these programs. If the committee recommended termination and Congress failed to reauthorize that program within 1 year of that recommendation, it would then become impossible to provide any appropriation for that program without a three-fifths vote in both Houses. In other words, a sunset law would provide a mechanism for shutting the door on unneeded, mismanaged, or failed efforts in Government.  This legislation would end the inertia which sometimes carries Federal programs forward in perpetuity. It wouldbe a meaningful, effective check on the continual growth of Government.  Mr. President, I think that each of us sees, as we look at the Federal budget and carry out our duties, some programs that we believe have served their purpose and can be terminated, some programs that were mistakes in the first place, some that were well-intentioned and just have not worked out.  I look, for example, at programs like the 1872 mining statute which costs the Government about $1 billion per year; the tobacco subsidy programs where we continue to pay out vast sums year after year and then have to encourage, through public education campaigns, individuals not to smoke. I see fighter jet programs that cost billions; the $4.7 billion National Ignition Facility. The list goes on and on.  So it is time, Mr. President, to look at new tools to put the brakes on some of this spending. The legislation that I am introducing today will do that by putting an end to programs and providing an end date for those programs that would otherwise sit on the shelf forever. Twenty-four States, including my own, already have statutes like the Federal sunset law that I propose to the Senate today.  What has been the experience of those sunset laws? One analysis found that during a 5-year period, as many as 23 percent of the agencies reviewed under States' sunset laws were eliminated, including some legislative dinosaurs that would oversee lightning rod salesmen, septic tank cleaners, tourist guides, massage therapists, rainmakers, horse hunters, textbook salesmen, and even tattoo artists.  Sunset laws have given the State governments the chance to streamline and rationalize the myriad of agencies that spring up as governmental bodies respond to the concerns of the moment. I am of the view that the Federal Government needs a similar process to help clean up what former President Reagan used to call ``the puzzle palaces on the Potomac.''  At its heart, the legislation that I introduce today calls for using a sunset concept on Federal programs as a tool for good and careful government. There is a tendency in Washington, DC, to focus exhaustive attention on programs before they are created and then virtually ignore them from that point out. I sat on the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee of the Commerce Committee as a Member of the other body, and I saw firsthand that the Congress can spend an extraordinary amount of time and effort trying to pass laws and very little to actually see if what is on the books works.  Requiring that each and every program is periodically reauthorized would focus the Congress' attention and the attention of the media on the operations and effectiveness of individual Government programs in a way that is simply not done today. It will, in my view, increase the pressure on agency managers to perform and do so in a cost-effective fashion. I suspect that some Federal agencies will function a bit differently when they know that there is a certainty of accountability and potential termination of their program that hangs over them.  Mr. President, when any Member of this body has a town meeting at home, they will hear from citizens who are tired of Government programs that don't work and still grow larger each year. Now is the time for the Senate to establish a system to assure that only those parts of Government are kept that work and that there is a renewed effort to terminate programs which simply take up space and waste the taxpayers' money. Our constituents deserve better.  The States have found that sunset laws can provide them the opportunity to reduce waste while still keeping programs that work, and I believe that it is high time for the U.S. Senate to pass favorably on the sunset concept that is working at the State level across this country.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1730       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
