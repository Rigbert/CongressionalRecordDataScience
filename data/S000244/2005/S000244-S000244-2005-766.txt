Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Con. Res. 208, recognizing the 50th anniversary of Rosa Louise Parks' refusal to give up her seat on the bus and the subsequent desegregation of American society.  Fifty years ago, one individual, through one courageous act, gave strength to the citizens of Montgomery, Alabama, to stand up to the injustice and indignity that had become commonplace among its citizens. Rosa Parks accomplished this heroic feat through the single act of refusing to give up her seat on the bus to a white man. Her single act of defiance and refusal to accept the status quo led to the 381-day Montgomery bus boycott and eventually to the desegregation of Montgomery, Alabama.  However, Rosa Parks' courageous act meant much more. It inspired a broader movement that struggled and pushed back against a Nation that had failed to keep its promise to all its citizens to promote equality, justice, and fairness under the laws. It paved the way for this Nation to hold unacceptable the injustices and disparate treatment experienced by many of its citizens. Rosa Parks' courage helped restore to all citizens the dignity and respect that every person deserves. Hersingle act of courage will forever serve as a constant reminder of the true meaning of equal protection under the laws and the responsibility of each of us to stand up to inequality and injustice.  Rosa Parks is an inspiration to all of us and is a reflection of what it means to be an American. I encourage my colleagues to join me in recognizing Rosa Parks and her important contribution toward helping America realize the freedom and equality envisioned by our Constitution.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
