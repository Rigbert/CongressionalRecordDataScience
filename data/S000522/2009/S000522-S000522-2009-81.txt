I thank my good friend for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, the pro-life movement is absolutely nonviolent and is totally committed to protecting unborn children and their mothers through peaceful, nonviolent means. I have been in the pro-life movement for 37 years, and those peaceful, nonviolent means include legal and constitutional reform as well as tangibly assisting women with crisis pregnancies.  Dr. Tiller's murderer must be brought to swift justice commensurate with the heinous crime that he has committed.  Murder is murder. Murder is never justified and can never be condoned by any society committed to fundamental human rights, justice, and the rule of just law.  Let me, as well, like my other colleagues on the floor today, extend my profound condolences to the Tiller family.
