 President, today I am joining with Senator Brownback to introduce a bipartisan amendment to the Defense authorization bill that will save and create jobs in one of the most important sectors in our economy--our aerospace industry.  Our amendment is about protecting skilled family-wage jobs--manufacturing jobs, engineering jobs, and jobs with technical skills and expertise that are passed from one generation to the next.
