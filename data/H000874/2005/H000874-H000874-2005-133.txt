Speaker, on Wednesday, the new President of Iran made comments that chillingly confirm the hate, intolerance and militant intent to destroy Israel and her people that is shared by too many in the Arab world.  Speaking to 4,000 students at a conference called ``The World Without Zionism,'' the Iranian leader declared, ``Israel must be wiped off the map.''  He went on to say, ``Anybody who recognizes Israel will burn in the fire of the Islamic Nations' fury.''  This Congress and the American people and all civilized, freedom-loving people around the world must emphatically and unequivocally denounce these poisonous comments as outrageous incitement to international criminal acts.  Mr. Speaker, as my colleagues know, we just passed a resolution a little over an hour ago unanimously expressing that sentiment. All who seek international security, stability and respect for the rule of law must collectively and publicly reject these comments of the President of Iran, and not only reject them, but condemn them as well.  The silence in too many of the Arab capitals loudly testifies to the sympathy with which such despicable remarks were received. I am pleased, however, very pleased, that the prominent Palestinian negotiator Mr. Erekat reportedly told the media, ``We have recognized the State of Israel. We do not accept the statements of the President of Iran. This is unacceptable.'' That was said by one of the major Palestinian leaders. I congratulate him for those comments.  It is that spirit that will allow us to pursue peace on the roadmap set forth by President Bush. However, I am compelled to ask, where is the public outrage among other responsible respected leaders in the Arab world?  Mr. Speaker, I have been to Israel 8 times, 3 times in the last 2 years, and on each of those most recent visits, our Israeli allies have expressed increasing concern about Iran's support for terrorism and its continuing effort to develop and acquire nuclear weapons.  The President of Iran's dangerous comments only confirm our worst suspicions and fears about the Iranian government's intentions and malevolence. These remarks must inspire a renewed commitment by the United States and by our allies to do everything within our power to prevent Iran from acquiring weapons of mass destruction.  Those who rationalize acts of terrorism against Israel should reassess their opinion as to why Israel must be ever vigilant and must take all measures necessary to respond to terrorism and ensure the safety, security and sovereignty of its people and its land.  Mr. Speaker, we were right today to overwhelmingly and unanimously express our outrage at the President of Iran's suggestion that Israel would be wiped off the map. Peace will be possible in the international community only if the international community overwhelmingly, emphatically and without any tempering rejects and severely criticizes such comments when they are made.                          ____________________[Page H9412]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                    NO PLACE IN THE CIVILIZED WORLD
