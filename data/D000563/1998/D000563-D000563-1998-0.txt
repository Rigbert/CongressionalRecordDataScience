President, at the beginning of the 105th congressional session, a close friend of mine, Gene Callahan, retired and moved back to our home state of Illinois. Prior to Gene's retirement, he served as the director of government relations for Major League Baseball here in Washington, DC. Many of you may remember Gene as former U.S. Senator Alan J. Dixon's (IL) chief of staff. Gene and I have been in politics for many years beginning with the Illinois Democratic Party and working with my predecessor here in the Senate, former U.S. Senator Paul Simon when Senator Simon was the Illinois Lt. Governor, some thirty years ago.  Gene loves the game of baseball so I thought this would be the perfect opportunity to wish my dear friends, Gene and Ann Callahan, the best. I thought it fitting that the Callahans return to the great state of Illinois during this exciting baseball season and the home run chase between Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa. In fact, Gene and Ann's son, Dan, is the head baseball coach at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale. I know firsthand, that Gene will stay involved with baseball, and rest assured, I will call on him for political advice from time to time.  As the baseball season draws to a close with the World Series, I want to thank everyone connected with Major League Baseball for a great summer. The home run chase with McGwire and Sosa was a baseball fan's dream. It brought a sense of what's good about America to the forefront. America can't wait for spring training!                          ____________________
