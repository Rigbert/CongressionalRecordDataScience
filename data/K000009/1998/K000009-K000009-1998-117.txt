Speaker, it is with sadness yet also gratitude, that I enter in this Record the life of Mrs. Maxine Shore, an American of enormous talent and creativity whose 86 years of life contributed to the enrichment of America and our literary heritage. Her life of continuous learning and perseverance throughout holds an example for all who knew her, and all who will enjoy her writings for generations to come. Our deepest sympathies are extended to her son, Steven, her many friends, and associates.        In Remembrance: A Bio of Maxine Shore Author and Teacher       Maxine Shore, a prolific author and teacher, died June 2,      1998, at her home in Carmel,     CA. She was 86. She received her B.A. from McAllister College      in Minnesota, quickly moving into writing and publishing      after college.       Mrs. Shore, believed that everyone has inborn creativity      which she encouraged in her students, who successfully      published award winning books. At the time of her death she      was still teaching classes and editing five books a month.       One book, The Captive Princess which was authored by Shore      was set in the first century in England and told the story      about the first Christian princess of England. The book went      into seven printings and was chosen by two book clubs.       What made Mrs. Shore stand out from other creative writing      teachers was her dedication to the creativity of the      individual and her teaching methods of encouraging students      to never give up.       Her career spanned 75 years with Mrs. Shore submitting her      first article to a Minneapolis paper at the age of 11. She      began writing her first book at the age of 12. Throughout her      career she was an editor at Harper's and a member of the      prestigious writing group along with Dorothy Parker at the      Algonquin Table in New York. She authored hundreds of short      stories, serials and articles for national magazines, as well      as book reviews and radio scripts. Shore also authored plays      for youth.       After leaving New York and Minnesota, Mrs. Shore moved to      California with her son Steven. She continued to publish      books, and with her writing and interviewing skills, quickly      became involved with the stars in the Hollywood community.       Hoping to give her son a better education and home      environment, Mrs. Shore moved to Carmel when Steven was a      teenager. At the time of her move Shore was already an author      of all kinds of fiction, non-fiction and plays and poems. She      quickly became an established author and teacher for the      Carmel community readily sharing her knowledge of the      publishing business and her experience as a writer with her      students. Maxine Shore had much to share. A partial listing      of books she authored or co-authored in addition to the      Captive Princess are: Shipwreck Island, an adventure story      for boys which was based on the 19th century diary of Alfred      Glendenning who was shipwrecked at the tip of Cape Horn; a      biography, Hero of Darien; a biography, Knight of the      Wilderness; a historical book for boys, The Slave Who      Dreamed; she also ghost-wrote two other published books; and      Biography of Balboa.       Mrs. Shore co-authored, The Destiny Stone, the story of the      Stone of Scone with her son Steven. She just completed a book      in May on creative writing.       Mrs. Shore's students have published over 50 books as well      as articles, short stories and poems. One student, Mary Ann      Taylor also had a serial in Good Housekeeping.       Her son Steven, plans as a fitting tribute to Mrs. Shore      and her long career to publish poems and books not yet in      print.                               ____________________
