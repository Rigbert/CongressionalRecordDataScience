President, I rise today with Senators Chaffee, Reed and Boxer, to introduce the Child Firearm Access Prevention Act.  The tragedy which occurred in Jonesboro, AR, last week raises many questions. Two come to mind immediately. Why do children kill? I do not know the answer to that. I have heard a variety of opinions from people who suggest that violent television and violent movies are somehow contributing to this. There are others who say, if the children would just pray in school, it would make all the difference in the world. Some look to the families more than the schools; others think the schools have a greater role to play.  We will debate this at length, and I am sure many of us will come up with a lot of different explanations as to why children reach the point in their young lives where they would take the life of another.  But the tragedy in Jonesboro raised another question which I think we can address because it is a simpler question. How do children at that young age come to possess lethal weapons? Think about it. An 11-year-old and a 13-year-old with 10 firearms--rifles, shotguns, and handguns, and 3,000 rounds of ammunition--went into the woods behind that middle school, tricked the students out with a fake fire alarm, opened fire and shot off somewhere in the range of 30 to 40 rounds before they were finally stopped.  Four little girls were killed. A teacher, who deserves all of our recognition and praise for her courage, stood in the line of fire to protect one of those little girls and lost her own life. This teacher, the mother of a 2-year-old, lost her life defending her students.  How do kids come into possession of firearms? They do not buy them. In most States it is unthinkable that they would even approach a counter and try. And yet, day after day in America there is further evidence of children, younger and younger, being found with firearms.  The day after the Jonesboro, AR, tragedy, in Cleveland, OH, a 4-year-old showed up at a day-care center with a loaded handgun.  In my home State of Illinois, in Marion, IL, a high school student showed up at school the next day with a handgun.  In Daly City, CA, the day after Jonesboro, a 13-year-old was arrested for attempting to murder his principal with a semiautomatic pistol.  There is something we can do about this. I am not sure that it will solve the problem completely, but it can help. Fifteen States have already recognized this problem and done something about it. These States have passed a child access prevention law which is known as a CAP law, saying to those who purchase and own handguns, it is not enough for you to follow the law in purchasing them and to use those guns safely; you have another responsibility. If you are going to own a firearm in your home, you have to keep it safely and securely so that children do not have access to it.  And these laws are effective. Florida was the first state to pass a CAP law in 1989. The following year, unintentional shooting deaths of children dropped by 50 percent. Moreover, a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in October 1997 found that there was a 23% decrease in unintentional firearm related deaths among children younger than 15 in those states that had implemented CAP laws. According to the Journal of the American Medical Association, if all 50 states had CAP laws during the period of 1990-1994, 216 children might have lived.  Should we consider these state laws as a national model? I think the obvious answer is yes, because the tragedy in Jonesboro, which we will not forget for a long, long time, unfortunately, is not unique. Every day in America 14 young people, ages 19 and under, are killed in gun homicides, suicides and unintentional shootings, with many more wounded.  The scourge of gun violence frequently attacks the most helpless members of our society--our children.  Mr. President, what I propose today is Federal legislation that will apply to every State, not just 15, but every State. And this is what it says. If you want to own a handgun, a rifle or shotgun, and it is legal to do so, you can; but if you own it, you have a responsibility to make certain that it is kept securely and safely.  You may buy a trigger lock. Senator Herb Kohl of Wisconsin has a proposal that all handguns be sold with trigger locks. I support it. I am a cosponsor of it. It makes sense.  How many times do you read in the paper, how many times do you listen on TV, to kids with their playmates and the gun goes off and someone is killed? A trigger lock, as Senator Kohl has proposed, is sensible. It should be required. It shouldn't even be debated. I think that legislation will go a long way toward reducing gun violence.  But beyond that proposal, the legislation I propose today, says to every gunowner, if it is not a trigger lock, put that gun in a place where that child cannot get to it.  As to these two kids, 11 and 13 years old, God only knows what was going through their minds when they were setting out to get the guns to go out and start shooting. They first stopped at the parents of one of the kids and wanted to pick up that parents' guns. That parent had the guns under lock and key in a vault and they couldn't get to them. So they thought about it and said, wait a minute, my grandfather has some, too; let's go over to his place. And that is where they came up with the weapons and the ammunition.  In one instance, one parent had taken the necessary steps to take the guns and keep them away from kids. Sadly, it appears--and I just say ``appears'' because I do not know all the details--in another case that did not happen.  Now a lot of people will say to me, ``There they go again, those liberals on Capitol Hill. Another bill, another law to infringe on second amendment rights.'' Oh, I know I will hear from the folks from the National Rifle Association, all the other gun lobbies, screaming bloody murder about the second amendment.  But look at the 15 States that have already passed these child access prevention laws, to protect kids, to say to gun owners ``you have a special responsibility.'' You will not find a list of the most liberal States in America. The first State to pass this legislation in 1989 was Florida. The list goes on: Connecticut, Iowa, California, Nevada, New Jersey, Virginia, Wisconsin, Hawaii, Maryland, Minnesota, North Carolina, Delaware, Rhode Island, and in 1995, the last State to pass a child access prevention law, certainly no bleeding heart State by any political definition, was Texas. The Texas law says it is ``unlawful to store, transport or abandon an unsecured firearm in a place where children are likely to be and can obtain access to it,'' and it is a criminal misdemeanor if you do it.  I am going to ask my colleagues in the Senate to not only return home during this recess and to not only witness those sad events on television--the funerals in Jonesboro, the tributes--but to also resolve to do something about it. That is what we are here for. That is why we were elected to the Senate and the House, not just to be sad as we should be, but to do something about it. Not to infringe on people's right to own firearms, but to say ``Own them responsibly, put them securely in your homes, keep them safely, keep them away from children.''  Mark my words, my friends, and you know this from human experience, no matter where you hide a gun or a Christmas gift, a kid is going to find it. You can stick it in a drawer and say, ``Oh, they will never look behind my socks, that is the last place in the world,'' or up on some shelf in the closet and believe your child can't reach that, but you know better. You know when you are gone and the house is empty those kids are scurrying around and looking in those hiding places. So I hope we can address this issue.  First, Senator Kohl's legislation for these child safety devices, these trigger locks, will help. But then take the extra step, follow these 15 States and enact a federal law.  But please, let this Senate and this House, before we leave this year, do something to make certain that those troubled children cannot get their hands on a firearm. I think every parent in America, particularly those of children of school age, paused at least for a moment after they heard about Jonesboro and thought, could it happen to my son, my daughter, my grandson, my granddaughter? The sad reality of life in modern America, is, yes, it could. There are so many weapons being kept so carelessly that it could happen to any of us or any of our children in virtually any school in America.  Mr. President, I know that the Senate has a very busy schedule and limited opportunity this year, but I hope as part of our work we will let the lesson of the tragedy of Jonesboro result in legislation that will be designed to protect children and schoolteachers and innocent people in the future.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1917         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives      of the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
