 President, the Senate is about to begin a series of three stacked votes. The first vote is on a cloture motion to proceed to the Transportation appropriations bill, followed by a vote on or in relation to the Bond amendment No. 1621, and the third vote on or in relation to the Robb amendment No. 1583.  Following these votes, the Senate will resume consideration of the pending Hutchison amendment regarding oil royalties. Further amendments and votes are expected throughout the day, with the anticipation of completing action on this bill.  As previously announced, there will be no votes on Friday in observance of the Rosh Hashanah holiday.  I thank my colleagues for their attention.                          ____________________
