  This was a historic first step in an important negotiation. In the words of the joint statement agreed to by the United States and North Korea, both sides have committed to pursuing a lasting and robust peace regime and complete--complete--denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.  The next steps in the negotiation will test whether we can get to a verifiable deal that enhances the security of Northeast Asia, our allies, and, of course, the United States.  Resolving this 61-year-old international challenge will take a great deal of hard work. As President Trump explained a few hours ago, ``Today is the beginning of the arduous process. Our eyes are wide open.''  I support the goals contained in the joint statement, and I remain supportive of the administration's stated position as Secretary Pompeo has reiterated: The goal of the United States is the ``complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.'' If North Korea does not prove willing to follow through, we and our allies must be prepared to restore the policy of maximum pressure.  Today, I congratulate the President on this major step and share his hope that it will begin a process that leads to a historic peace.                          ____________________
