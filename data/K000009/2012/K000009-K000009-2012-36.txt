That paid its own way. Just look where federal dollar flow to Arizona--if one looks at the defense bases across northern Ohio, we don't have anything like Arizona has. Defense dollars flow heavily to Arizona. Or, if we look at the kinds of subsidies we are providing for water in the West--The Central Arizona project or for Bureau of Land Management projects, for all of the investments that have been made to allow Arizona to even get water, federal funds have built Arizona--and then to say to the part of the country that said, Well, we want the West to develop. So we're going to help you out. But now you say, No, no, no, no. Now we're going to take money away from Cleveland and Toledo and Detroit and Pittsburgh and Philadelphia and Chicago and Milwaukee--all of the places that taxed themselves for the development of the modern West.  So I would say to the gentleman, I think the answer to the problem we have is economic growth, and we have to invest in that. The housing sector has been dead in the water since 2008, largely because of the nonregulation of the Bush administration during those years when the Wall Street house of cards and derivatives were created. So let's look at what happened back then.  But, please, don't take it out of the hides of the most stressed communities in America that, despite all the odds, are in the process of reinvesting and rebuilding themselves to fuel recovery.  So I just want to associate myself with the remarks of the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Olver). Oppose the Flake amendment. Support programs that will help the revitalization of the housing sector of this country.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Flake).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it.
