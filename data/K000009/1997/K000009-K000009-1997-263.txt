Speaker, I rise today to recognize Jacqueline Alex of Oregon, OH, in my district. Mrs. Alex is the National Catholic War Veterans Auxiliary president, and is being honored for her work with a testimonial dinner on March 8, 1997.  Jackie and her husband, John, were married in 1947. Together they raised two sons, James and John. Her husband passed away only 10 years later, in 1957. A year later, Jackie joined the Toledo Logsdon--Walla Catholic War Veterans Post 639 Auxiliary, serving the auxiliary in every capacity. She was elected auxiliary president several times through those years, and in 1971 Jackie was named president of the Department of Ohio's Auxiliary. She began her service with the National Department in 1985, and served as the president of the 1995 Auxiliary National Convention.  Her tireless efforts have been recognized by the organization, and Mrs. Alex has been awarded numerous honors: the National Auxiliary President's Gold Medal Award For Outstanding Service; the Ohio Auxiliary President's Award; the Ann Senft Award For Meritorious Service to the Auxiliary; the National Auxiliary's St. Agnes Medal; Department of Ohio Auxiliary 1988 Woman of the Year; and a citation for meritorious service from the Chapel of Four Chaplains in Gettysburg.  Our Nation pays tribute to its veterans in various ways, but often overlooked in such recognition is the role of women, wives, and families who served here on the homefront. For whether they bought war bonds, planted a victory garden, worked in a munitions factory, went to work to support a family, or played both mother and father to a family growing up, they kept our Nation running in times of war. Their contributions created a strong backup system to those engaged in combat and in service to our Nation. Their ideals of service are upheld through their auxiliaries, which are the sinew that binds a veterans post together.  For nearly 40 years, Jacqueline Alex has served our Nation and its veterans honorably. I am pleased to join with her sons, grandchildren, colleagues, and friends in a deep and heartfelt salute of gratitude.                          ____________________
