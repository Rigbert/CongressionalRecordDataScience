 President, I oppose this amendment. This is an increase in the price of gasoline. Also, I don't know how many times we have to vote on a windfall profits tax. This is at least the third or fourth time.  Although there is a tax credit that the tax funds, I want everybody to know there is no guarantee that the tax will not be passed on to consumers with these higher prices at the pump as well as home heating.  This amendment raises revenue. The bill before us raises revenue from oil already taxed. This new tax is not well designed and should be defeated.  I raise a point of order that the amendment is not germane.
