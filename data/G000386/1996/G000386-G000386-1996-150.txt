 President, Congress has been struggling to address the problems of our health care system for at least 4 years now. We have a bill before us which constructively addresses some of these problems. And the President has indicated that he will sign it.  The bill preserves the essence of the Kassebaum bill. It provides a medical savings account opportunity. It increases the health insurance deduction for the self-employed. It will facilitate and encourage the purchase of private long-term care insurance. And, it will provide major new weapons in the fight against health care fraud and abuse.  Senator Kassebaum's legislation addresses some of the most distressing health insurance problems of Americans. It should increase the availability of health insurance by requiring insurers to issue health coverage to businesses which want to purchase health insurance for their employees.  It should substantially increase the portability of health insurance by limiting the ability of group health plans to impose pre-existing condition exclusions on workers moving from one job to another. Workers insured in one job will now be able to move to another job without fear of losing their health insurance. It will also improve portability for individuals moving from the group to the individual health insurance market.  The bill still defers to health insurance reforms passed by the states. In my State, we enacted earlier this year a good health insurance reform law. The Kassebaum bill defers to State insurance reforms which substantially achieve the ends the Kassebaum bill seeks. So, my expectation is that Iowans will continue to receive health insurance under the terms of the Iowa reforms.  But many States have not enacted health system reforms. Should those States continue without their own reforms, the Kassebaum bill will provide their citizens with these protections.  The bill includes a medical savings account program. As the sponsor of one of the major medical savings account proposals in the Senate, I am very pleased to see that the conferees agreed to include a modified version of the original proposal introduced by Congressman Archer and myself.  The provisions contained in the bill retain the essential structure of the MSA concept. I would have preferred to see the maximum annual contribution to an MSA account be larger than 65 or 75 percent of the deductible for an individual or a family. I would have preferred that more than 750,000 be able to participate. I do not see as a major limitation the fact that participation will be limited to smaller businesses and the self-employed. That's where the problem of the uninsured is greatest; hence, MSA's make sense for those individuals.  If I have any concerns about the MSA provisions, Mr. President, it is that I have been given to understand that the those provisions are elaborate and complicated. Given this, I can only hope that the MSA program laid out in this bill will not fail because of this complexity. If we must have a trial of this concept, we have the right to expect that it will have a fair chance to succeed, and not hamstrung by overly complicated rules and regulations.  The farm community and the small business community strongly support this MSA concept. In my State of Iowa, a great many people are familiar with high deductible health insurance policies. I believe that many Iowa farmers and small businesspeople will want to participate in this program.  Another feature of the bill that will be welcomed by the small business community in my State is an increase in the deductibility of health insurance premiums for the self-employed from 30 percent to 80 percent by the year 2006.  One of the great inequities in our health care system is that businesses that offer health insurance as an employee benefit can deduct the cost of that insurance from their Federal taxes. The employees of those companies get those benefits, which are a part of their earned compensation, tax free. The self-employed, however, get only the current law 30 percent deduction for what they must spend for health insurance.  The bill provides a medical expense deduction for payment of qualified long-term care insurance premiums and expenses. This should give a boost to the use of private long-term care insurance. Given our Federal budget deficit problem, and the difficulty we are going to have as a government and society paying for the benefits we have already promised, we simply must encourage increased use of private long-term care insurance. These provisions should help.  Second, Senator Cohen's waste, fraud and abuse legislation is included in the bill. These provisions constitute a substantial increase in the remedies available to law enforcement for combatting health care fraud and abuse. The General Accounting Office has estimated that fraud represents as much as 10 percent of total health care spending.  Perhaps 10 percent does not sound like much. But 10 percent of more than $900 billion per year is a huge amount of money. We must do our very best to insure that we are not defrauded of any of this money and that not a penny is wasted.  Mr. President, we have been promising these incremental reforms since at least 1992. Most of us have been saying, since at least 1992, that we could easily enact reforms such as those in this bill. We should pass it.  Mr. President, I feel that I should conclude by making clear to my own constituents what this bill is not designed to do. I think we will be making a serious mistake if we over-sell what it is designed to do and, therefore, what it will accomplish. If we do exaggerate what this bill is designed to do,the American people will be very disappointed and disillusioned when they discover that the bill does not live up to their expectations.  Therefore, I want to make clear, at least to the people I serve in Iowa, what this bill has never been designed to do.  It does not attempt to make health insurance more affordable;  It would not completely eliminate denial of coverage for pre-existing conditions;  It would not provide portability between different individual policies; and  It would not necessarily mean that currently uninsured individuals would have to be sold a health insurance policy.  Having said that, let me conclude by saying that this monumental piece of legislation is the kind of incremental common sense reform individuals and families across the country have been looking for. I am proud to support it and I urge the President to sign it.                          ____________________
