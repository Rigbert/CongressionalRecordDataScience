 President, I rise today to introduce a bipartisan bill with my colleague from Florida, Senator Connie Mack, and 11 other original cosponsors from the Banking Committee. Entitled the ``Financial Regulatory Relief and Economic Efficiency Act of 1997,'' the bill is designed to promote greater access to capital and credit for businesses and consumers, while ensuring the safety and soundness of our financial system.  The acronym for the bill, FRREE, is actually indicative of the bill itself. If enacted, the bill would free valuable resources at financial institutions now being used to comply with the bureaucratic maze of current rules and regulations, and instead allow institutions to commit more of those resources to the business of lending. This is especially important, now that we are entering the 80th month of the current economic expansion. The 9 completed expansions since the end of World War II have averaged 50 months. Thus, many professional economists, businessmen, and academics worry how much longer the expansion of the current business cycle can go. Because this bill frees up resources that are inefficiently being used in the private sector, I believe this bill could have a substantial positive impact on extending the current business cycle as well as minimize any future economic downturn.  One key provision would repeal an antiquated law that disallows banks to pay interest on business checking accounts. Due to sophisticated and expensive technology, big corporations can get around this problem by employing sweep accounts. However, smaller, family owned businesses cannot take advantage of this expensive technology and are forced to keep their money in noninterest bearing checking accounts. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Office of Thrift Supervision, concluded in their 1996 Joint Report, ``Streamlining of Regulatory Requirements,'' that the statutory prohibition against paying interest on demand deposits no longer serves a public purpose. Today, the repeal also has the support of the Chamber of Commerce, the National Federation of Independent Business, and the American Farm Bureau Federation.  The bill also allows the Federal Reserve to pay interest on reserve balances, thus reducing potential volatility in short-term lending rates. Given the historical importance of price stability, it is imperative we give the Federal Reserve this tool in order to better conduct monetary policy.  In short, Mr. President, the bill repeals outdated laws that hinder the management practices of institutions; cuts bureaucratic red tape; eliminates unnecessary bookkeeping; increases funds available for residential mortgage lending; and eliminates unnecessary restrictions on the discounting, and bundling of financial services to consumers.  The bill enjoys the overwhelming support of the Senate Banking Committee and the chairman of the committee, Chairman D'Amato, is committed to having hearings on this bill when we return early next year.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1405       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
