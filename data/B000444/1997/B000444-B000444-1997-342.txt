 President, I thank the Republican leader as well as the Democratic leader for attempting to hold the vote long enough for me to get here. I voted before in the affirmative on the Graham amendment. We voted on it last year.  I was one of the speakers at the International Chiefs of Police and Sheriffs Association discussing the juvenile justice bill. I thought I had left in plenty of time from a downtown hotel to get here. But, as Washingtonians will tell you, there is a good deal of road construction going on. I was caught behind the most polite cab driver in Washington. He stopped for everyone, which I was happy to see except for this day. Had I had the cab driver who runs over most people, I would have been up here. I should not say that. I will get letters about that. That was a joke, an attempted joke.  But I want the Record to show that had I been here, I would have once again voted for the Graham amendment.  I apologize if I inconvenienced the Senate in any way in attempting to hold it for me to get here.  I thank my distinguished friend from Rhode Island for yielding.
