President, I, too, would like to pay tribute to our Republican leadership in this great battle, this epic battle where we try to achieve some financial stability for future generations, more especially the Senator from Utah, Senator Hatch.  There were some comments that were made by a scholar over 200 years ago about the fall of the Greek Republic. It was prefaced by this statement:       When historians look back upon great civilizations, they      invariably identify a time when society chose growth or      decay.  Such is the time today in this body. And this scholar said this about the fall of the Greek Republic:       The average age of the world's greatest civilizations has      been 200 years. These nations have progressed through the      following sequence: From bondage to spiritual faith, from      spiritual faith to great courage, from courage to liberty,      from liberty to abundance, from abundance to complacency,      from complacency to apathy, from apathy to dependency, from      dependency back again into bondage.  And then he made this prediction, which I think applies to the vote that will be forthcoming:       A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government.      It can only exist until the voters discover that they can      vote themselves largess from the Public Treasury. From that      moment on, the majority always votes for the candidates      promising the most benefits, with the result that a democracy      always collapses over a loose fiscal policy, always followed      by a dictatorship.  I think those are sobering thoughts. Can our American system meet the challenges of future generations? We will have that vote this afternoon. The voters did not vote for a majority to continue down that path that was followed by the Greek Republic. That is why we need the balanced budget amendment.  I yield the floor.
