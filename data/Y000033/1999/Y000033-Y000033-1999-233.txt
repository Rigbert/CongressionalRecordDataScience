Mr. Speaker, today I rise to address an issue that is very critical to the constituents of my home State of Alaska. The issue I wish to speak about is the significant contribution which the cruise line industry has made to the great State of Alaska and this country.  Alaska is a State where the land mass is larger than all of the Northeastern and Great Lakes States put together. Approximately 600,000 Americans live there. Many Americans have heard of Alaska and have some image of its wildness but fewer than 10 percent of Americans have ever visited. Nonetheless, the opportunity for Americans to visit this great state has increased tenfold with the presence of the cruise industry. Furthermore, the economic benefits that the cruise lines bring have greatly impacted Alaska.  Recently, Price Waterhouse Coopers (PwC) and Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates concluded a Study on the Economic Impact of the Cruise Industry on the U.S. economy. This study reveals that the cruise industry spent $6.6 billion in the United States in 1997, and generated an additional $5 billion of impact on the economy. In the United States alone, the cruise lines purchased $1.8 billion in transportation from airlines, $794 million in fuel and lubricants, $626 million in business services, $1 billion in financial services, and $600 million in food and beverage supplies. In the State of Alaska in 1998, the cruise industry spent with Alaskan business and service providers $363,274,000. These statistics are significant and make clear that the cruise industry has benefited both the state of Alaska and our Nation.  This study also reveals that the cruise industry created 176,433 jobs for U.S. citizens in 1997. These jobs included direct employment by the industry and jobs attributable to the U.S. based cruise line suppliers and industry partners. Through its annual growth of 6-10 percent, the industry is responsible for thousands of new jobs every year for Americans. The cruise industry is the single largest direct employer in the maritime sector of the United States. In my State of Alaska in 1998, the cruise industry was responsible for the employment of 17,189 Alaskans. That is 3 percent of the population of our State.  Another issue that I wish to address is the matter regarding Federal and State taxation of the cruise industry. Some critics state that the cruise industry does not pay federal and state taxes in the United States. This statement is false. In fact the recently completed study revealed that the industry pays millions of dollars in taxes each year. In 1997, the cruise industry paid over $1 billion in Federal, State, and local taxes in the United States.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak to the contributions made by the cruise industry to our great Nation. The benefits have been abundant, both throughout this nation and in my home State, Alaska. In view of the many contributions, I wish to acknowledge the vital role which the cruise industry plays in sustaining the economy and the maritime sector of this country.                          ____________________
