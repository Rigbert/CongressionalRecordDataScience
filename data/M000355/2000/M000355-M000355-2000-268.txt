M. Newton on the occasion of his retirement as Athletics Director at the University of Kentucky.  C.M. Newton has made contributions to the University that are as great in number as they are significant in accomplishment in his 11 years as Wildcats Athletics Director. The positive changes and improvements he implemented over the years culminate into an unmatched legacy of excellence for C.M. and for the entire University of Kentucky community.  C.M.'s involvement with the Wildcats began long before his tenure as Athletics Director. He attended U.K. and received a bachelor's degree in 1952, and earned a masters degree in 1957. During his undergraduate years, C.M. played on the Wildcats basketball team and lettered on their 1951 NCAA championship team. He also pitched for the U.K. baseball team, and played quarterback for a Wildcats intramural football team.  In the years between his graduation from the University of Kentucky and his return in 1989, C.M. began his professional career in athletics. While serving in the Air Force in 1953, C.M. held his first official leadership position in athletics as the athletic officer for Andrews Air Force Base in Washington, D.C. He served as head basketball coach with Transylvania University, the University of Alabama, and Vanderbilt University, with a lifetime coaching record of 509 wins and 375 losses. He also served as Assistant Commissioner for the Southeastern Conference (SEC). C.M. approached these positions of leadership with a vigor, integrity, and enthusiasm that the world of sports took notice of by naming him Associated Press Southeastern Conference Coach of the Year in 1972, 1976, 1988 and 1989 and United Press International SEC Coach of the Year in 1972, 1978, and 1988.  C.M. also achieved a number of other honors, including membership on the Board of Directors of the National Association of Basketball Coaches, Chairman of the NCAA Basketball Rules Committee, Vice President and President of USA Basketball, Chairman of the USA Basketball Games Committee, membership in the NCAA Division I Basketball Committee, Chairman of the NCAA Basketball Officiating Committee, and membership on the FIBA Central Board.  It was with this vast list of accomplishments and honors that C.M. chose to return to the University of Kentucky on April 1, 1989. C.M. hit the ground running as Athletics Director and with his already well-established reputation for excellence and integrity, brought winning coaches and players to the Wildcats athletics programs. During C.M.'s leadership at U.K., the basketball and football teams soared, the men's and women's soccer teams received national attention, and the program grew to include 22 varsity sports--more than any other school in the SEC. The Wildcats athletic budget has more than tripled under C.M.'s tenure, allowing the school to expand and renovate several of the campus athletic facilities.  More than anything, though, C.M. Newton rejuvenated an excitement about athletics at the University of Kentucky. He led the Wildcats in a way that commanded respect--he led with dignity and embodied integrity.  Thank you, C.M., for your 11 years of dedicated service to the University of Kentucky, which resulted in winning teams, winning kids, and a top-quality program. Your spirit and legacy will continue to drive the Wildcats to victory for years to come. Best wishes in your retirement and may God bless you, Evelyn, and your family in this next phase of your life.                          ____________________
