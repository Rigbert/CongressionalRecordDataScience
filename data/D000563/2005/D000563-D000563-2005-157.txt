President, our Tax Code does two things. It raises revenue, but it also tries to encourage good behavior and discourage bad behavior. What this amendment does is reward good behavior on the part of American businesses. It is my belief that if a business does the right thing for its employees and for this country, it should have a tax benefit, and that is why we are designating patriotic employers.  Who are these employers? They are employers who maintain or increase the number of full-time workers in America relative to the number of full-time workers outside of America. They maintain their corporate headquarters in America if the company has ever been headquartered here. They pay decent wages to their employees, a livable wage of at least $7.75 an hour. They provide a retirement plan for their employees, either a defined benefit or defined contribution that matches at least 5 percent of their worker contributions for every employer. They pay at least 60 percent of workers' health care premiums, and when their workers are members of the Guard and Reserve and activated to serve overseas, they make up the difference in salary so their families can have peace of mind financially while their soldiers are off fighting.  I believe the companies who do this deserve a benefit. They deserve a reward. If you are not providing for your employees a decent wage, if you are sending all your jobs overseas, if you don't have a retirement plan, and you don't provide health insurance, why in the world should we reward that?  Let's pick those good, patriotic American companies and give them this tax credit, which is fully offset by this amendment.  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
