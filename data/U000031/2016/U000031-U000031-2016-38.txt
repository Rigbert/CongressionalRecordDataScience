Speaker, southwest Michigan has had some tough times lately, and now we are faced with the news that broke yesterday that two bailiffs at Berrien County Courthouse in my hometown of St. Joseph, Michigan, were slain by an inmate who had overpowered his guard.  So I rise today to offer support and love for the victims' friends, family and certainly our entire community. We should continue to keep those affected in our hearts and in our minds. I also want to thank the countless folks on the front lines who clearly prevented the tragedy from even being worse.  The swift actions of those on the ground need to be commended, particularly the Berrien County Sheriff's Department led by Sheriff Paul Bailey. I was with him just this past Saturday, and what he had to endure the last 24 hours is unthinkable.  I also want to thank the immediate action and outpouring of support from our local officials: St. Joseph Mayor Mike Garey; Benton Harbor Mayor Marcus Muhammad; and State-elected officials, including our Governor Rick Snyder and State legislators John Proos and Al Pscholka. It is times like these when we need to unite as one. This heartbreaking tragedy happenedin the blink of an eye, but we will never forget.  We will remember and honor Joe Zangaro, who I knew personally, who was the head of courthouse security, a retired Michigan State Police officer. We will remember and honor Ronald Kienzle, a U.S. Army veteran, retired Benton Township police officer.  I ask my colleagues and those who hear this message across the country to pray for the families of the two victims, the speedy recovery of another deputy, James Atterberry, Jr., and a civilian caught in the middle, Kenya Ellis. We will get through this together.                          ____________________
