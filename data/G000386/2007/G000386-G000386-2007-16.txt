 President, amendment No. 3823 deals with agricultural competition and increased consolidation in the agricultural industry. The amendment is cosponsored by me, Senator Grassley, and two Democrats--Senator Kohl and Senator Harkin.  I wish to make it very clear--and I will get into some detail--there may be some people who feel the amendment I have put before the Senate is exactly the same as a bill Senator Kohl and I had introduced previously. It is very slimmed down from that bill. So any staff who is watching the debate and getting nervous about an amendment coming up that every big industry in the United States may find fault with, we are talking about a very slimmed-down version of it. I will explain all that shortly.  I have been concerned with competition in the agricultural marketplace and increased competition in the agricultural industry for quite some time now. You have heard me speak about it on the floor. We have had hearings on it. I had hearings in the Senate Finance Committee, as well as hearings I participated in under both Republican and Democratic chairmanships of the Judiciary Committee.  Agriculture, as you know, is a fairly risky business. I know that from personal experience because I have lived and worked on a farm all my life. But for some time, working in agriculture has become even more difficult for the little guy. The trend has been for companies in the agricultural sector to consolidate. I am talking about businesses that serve agriculture with input. I am talking about industry that processes agriculture. So there has been consolidation in that industry. I am not talking about the consolidation of farms. There has been that as well. That has been going on since 1790, when 90 percent of the people in this country were farmers. Today, 2 percent of the people in this country are farmers. I am talking about the impact of agriculture agribusiness consolidation and the impact upon the 2 percent of the people in this country who are farmers.  This consolidation has created new business giants impacting competition in the marketplace for the family farmers, for producers, and for consumers. Family farms and independent producers are feeling the pressure of concentration in agriculture. Small and independent producers are seeing fewer choices--who the farmer can buy from and to whom the farmer can sell.  All this consolidation in industry at both the horizontal and vertical levels leads to the very real possibility of fewer product choices and higher prices for consumers.  I don't believe all mergers are, per se, bad, and I don't believe all are wrong and all lead to unfairness. But I think at the same time we need to make sure--we need to make very sure--open and fair access to the marketplace is preserved for everyone. We need to make sure large businesses are not acting in a predatory or anticompetitive manner. We need to make sure family farmers and independent producers can compete on a level playing field. We need to make sure consumers have as many choices as possible.  So I am not talking just about mergers and lack of competition being harmful just to farmers, I am talking about the impact that might have on consumers paying more. The antitrust laws are all about protecting consumers, not about protecting producers. But in the case of family farmers, they are purchasers of input, and so they are consumers. But they also have to make sure that the marketplace is protected for the ultimate end-consumer, the consumer of our agricultural products.  By looking out for these things, you know what we end up doing, Mr. President? We keep our economy strong because of competition. We keep our agricultural community vibrant. We keep it competitive. And hopefully, in the end, we keep our consumers happy, with quality food at a relatively inexpensive price. American consumers don't know that, but they already have that environment from our farmers. We take too much for granted in America, so I am not so sure consumers know that, and I like to remind them from time to time.  So we have this amendment before us. It is an amendment cosponsored, as I said, by Senator Kohl and Senator Harkin. The language of this amendment draws from a bill that Senator Kohl, Senator Thune, and I introduced earlier this year--S. 1759. It is called the Agriculture Competition Enhancement Act, ACE for short. We call it the ACE Act. However--and this is the point I started out with--I wish to make clear that this amendment which is being offered to the farm bill is quite different from the ACE Act as originally introduced earlier this year. Amendment No. 3823, which I have called up here under regular order, does not include all the provisions of S. 1759 and either eliminates provisions in that bill or incorporates many changes to address concerns raised by members of the agricultural industry, by the administration, as well as Senators on both sides of the aisle.  I also worked with the chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee because this bill, S. 1759, was referred to the Judiciary Committee. Because we are offering it as an amendment to this bill, I also worked with the ranking member of the Agriculture Committee to address issues that were in that original S. 1759, which I was hoping to offer here, to take care of some opposition to this bill coming up and yet still accomplishing quite a bit about the problems I see with lack of competition. So the amendment I have called up under regular order is the product of these discussions we had with business, with agricultural leaders, with the White House--or I should say with the administration generally, not necessarily the White House--and, of course, with the Judiciary Committee members and the ranking member of the Agriculture Committee.  Now, I want to explain what this bill does after having explained to you, as I just did, that it is not what we had introduced as a bill.  First, the amendment would create an Agriculture Competition Task Force to study problems in agricultural competition, establish ways to coordinate Federal and State activities to address competition problems in agriculture, and make recommendations to Congress. In particular, the task force would establish a smaller working group on buyer power to study the effects of concentration, the effects of monopsony, and the effects of oligopsony in agriculture, and make recommendations to the Department of Justice and to the Federal Trade Commission on and for agricultural guidelines. The task force will help give our antitrust regulators real insight and expertise specific to the farm community that I believe is currently lacking when they address competition issues in agriculture.  Second, the amendment would require the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission to issue agricultural guidelines, taking into account the special conditions of the agriculture industry, and require the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission to report to Congress on the guidelines.  Both the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Agriculture Committee heard witnesses in several hearings testify that there is a need for agriculture-specific guidelines when the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission look at agriculture mergers.  Currently, the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission have guidelines for specific industries and issues, such as health care and intellectual property, but not for agriculture. So it makes sense--not just to me but to these many experts in agriculture and antitrust law that we heard in these several hearings before our committees--that our Federal regulators should have agricultural guidelines because of the special circumstances and special characteristics particular to the agriculture industry and particularly because there tends to be, in Washington, DC, outside of the Agriculture Department, little consideration and understanding of the unique industry of agriculture. Some people would say that even within the U.S. Department of Agriculture there is a lack of understanding in Washington, DC, of what the problems of agriculture are all about.  I don't pretend that even with the adoption of this amendment we are necessarily going to bring about the total understanding that there ought to be for the 2 percent of the people in this country who produce food for the other 98 percent, as well as a lot of surplus that is exported beyond. But whatever we can do to help, and particularly when there are policy decisions made dealing with agriculture when it is not fully understood, if we can just get some attention on agriculture in those areas, I think we will be taking a giant step forward.  Those characteristics I am talking about include monopsony, which is a situation where there is a single purchaser of goods, and oligopsony, which is a situation where there are few buyers who, at the same time, have a disproportionate amount of market power.  Third, the amendment would formalize the Department of Agriculture's review of agriculture mergers with the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission, requiring the Department of Agriculture to provide comments on larger mergers in the industry--mergers that submitted second requests for information under the Clayton Act. That is already a process that is in law.  Currently, the Justice Department or the Federal Trade Commission informally consults with the Department of Agriculture when they analyze ag mergers. These agencies have what we call a memorandum of understanding to consult with each other. But I believe, following on the advice of experts who have testified on this matter before the Agriculture Committee, that the current process--meaning the current process of the memorandum of understanding--does not sufficiently ensure that farm community concerns are adequately considered.  Far more than the Justice Department and far more than the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Agriculture has extraordinary knowledge and expertise in agricultural matters. The Department of Agriculture formulates agricultural policy for our great Nation and works closely with the farm community and agricultural industry about various concerns. They have experts and economists who know and work with the data on a daily basis. The Department of Agriculture is the office that can best assess the true impact of ag mergers and other business transactions for farmers, ranchers, and independent producers, as well as the trickle-down effect on the consumer. So that is why it makes sense that the role the Department of Agriculture plays presently in antitrust review of ag mergers be more than just a memorandum of understanding; that, in fact, it be permanent and a formal role, not one that is informal and loosely contained in the memorandums.  Moreover, having such a requirement of formal participation or consultation is not some new novel idea. I wish I could claim a new novel idea. Other agencies, such as the Federal Communication Commission or the Department of Transportation, formally participate in the review of mergers in their industries. They render formal decisions that are then shared with the FTC or the Department of Justice. So along the lines of the precedent set by the FCC and the Department of Transportation, I am asking that we do the same thing with the Department of Agriculture and the FTC and the Department of Justice.  I hope I have described to you what is a very modest approach, much more modest than the ideas Senator Kohl and I had in the bill that I am saying I am offering a stripped-down version of here. I basically put in statute what the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission are allegedly already supposed to be doing with the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The approach we advocate in this amendment will ensure that all of agriculture's concerns and needs are fully discussed when Federal agencies examine proposed ag business mergers. By guaranteeing inclusion and openness, we will go a long way toward alleviating understandable anxiety about an increasingly concentrated industry.  Finally, the amendment would provide for additional resources to the Department of Justice and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's GIPSA division to enhance their ability to look at agricultural transactions and competition issues.  I want my colleagues to know that we worked very closely with severalagricultural and antitrust experts on the language contained in this very amendment, as we did in the original bill. The amendment is supported by a number of farm groups, and I would like to read these to you: the Organization for Competitive Markets, the Campaign for Contract Agriculture Reform, the Center for Rural Affairs, Food and Water Watch, the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, R-CALF USA--and just in case people don't understand that acronym, those are people who are cattle producers but who aren't necessarily affiliated with the National Cattlemen's Association. They could have dual memberships, but they do have some different points of view. Then another organization is the Sustainable Agriculture Coalition, and lastly the Western Organization of Resource Councils.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a December 10, 2007, letter in support of this amendment.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                December 10, 2007.     Re Agricultural Competition Enhancement Act.     Hon. Charles Grassley,     Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Herb Kohl,     Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Grassley and Kohl: We would like to thank you      and express our support for the Agricultural Competition      Enhancement Act, Amendments 3717, 3823 and 3631, proposed for      inclusion in the Farm Bill. Agricultural producers face buyer      power when selling their products--and seller power when      buying. This market power scissors effect has devastated the      economy of rural America. These Amendments can begin to      reverse the process.       Congress created antitrust law in 1890. This body of law      did not exist previously, except through a patchwork of      common law doctrines and state statutes. The courts weakened      the Sherman Act. Congress responded by enacting the Clayton      Act. Then the Federal Trade Commission Act was passed. Some      updating occurred in the 1970's. However, the last 30 years      has seen competition falter in agriculture as antitrust law      has been incrementally neutered. Powerful companies have      opposed antitrust law for decades, with substantial recent      success.                        Amendments 3717 and 3823       This Amendment will create the Agriculture Competition Task      Force. The Task Force is necessary to focus on the      agricultural concentration problem and solutions. We can no      longer pretend that unfair and deceptive practices do not      exist in the U.S. food industry, America's biggest industry.       New guidelines are needed at the Department of Justice      specific to agriculture. DOJ admits that antitrust laws apply      unaltered across the economy--thereby conceding the problem      that must be solved. The current economywide guidelines are      of only passing relevance to farmers, ranchers and growers.      Those guidelines may apply to an industry dominated by five      firms dealing vertically with an industry dominated by three      firms. But the guidelines do not tackle the real problems of      disparate farmers with no market power doing business with      sophisticated, multinational firms.       Better methods must be developed to establish geographic      and product markets. Black and white concentration thresholds      must be devised to provide certainty and concentration.      Neither judges nor Department of Justice officials have      sufficiently grasped these issues in the recent past.       Rather they accept pleasing theories of competition that      work in textbooks, but not on the ground.       The failures have been astounding. In this year alone, the      Department of Justice approved a Southeast U.S. hog packing      monopoly by allowing Smithfield Foods to acquire Premium      Standard Farms. And DOJ also allowed Monsanto to acquire a      near monopoly in the cotton seed market when acquiring Delta      & Pine Land Company. Legislation is clearly needed.                             Amendment 3631       We also support Amendment 3631. The Post Merger Review      provisions are needed to correct the past mistakes of DOJ      that have harmed the agricultural economy by extracting      wealth from farmers, ranchers and rural communities. We      cannot continue protecting those accumulating market power.      Studying those past mergers will reveal the worst past      mistakes, and enable correction when warranted.       The Special Counsel for Agricultural Competition is also      needed at the USDA. The Grain Inspection, Packers &      Stockyards Administration has not been up to the task.      GIPSA's competition activities should be transferred to more      professional, accountable and well-funded staff.       We strongly support the Amendment's clarifications      regarding the burden of proof in a merger case. Congress can      and should make the policy decision that competition is often      harmed by concentration. It is sensible to exempt mergers      that are not problematic by allowing a defendant to prove the      deal does not substantially lessen competition or create a      monopoly.       This Amendment could be improved if it clarified that the      benefits of any alleged efficiencies created by an      acquisition must be passed on to consumers or producers, not      merely maintained by the merged entities. Efficiencies      benefiting the merged entities are emblematic of market      power, not competition. Those efficiencies should be proved      by clear and convincing evidence to dissuade judges from      lazily accepting mere theories and arguments rather than      factual proof.                    Department of Justice Opposition       We note the surprisingly strident opposition of the      Department of Justice in a November 15, 2007 letter to      Chairman Leahy. That opposition is ideological and turf-     based, not substantive. Indeed, the letter is akin to an      industry association press release.       Both DOJ and USDA have repeatedly failed their charge to      enforce the law, protect competition, and eliminate ideology      from decision making. Congress should not enable further      failure.       DOJ makes some fairly large leaps of logic, stating that      the Amendments would actually harm competition in      agriculture. No sound basis exists for such a claim, and      doubt is thus cast on the entire submission. Bureaucratic      distaste for legislation does not beget economic harm.       The Constitutional concerns expressed by the Department are      consistent with its new Unitary Executive theory that      relegates Congress to a minor governmental role. Congress      should be assertive in maintaining its authority, including      the ability to establish Task Forces that assist the      formation of merger review guidelines and enforcement policy.       DOJ also claims a Special Counsel for Competition at USDA      ``would harm American agriculture.'' This again is a leap of      logic, sprung from ideology and bureaucratic turf protection      rather than law or fact. DOJ's defense of USDA's Grain      Inspection, Packers & Stockyards Administration fails to      acknowledge the repeated GAO and USDA-OIG investigations      showing incompetence at best, and falsifying reports to      Congress at worst.       Indeed, the protestations prove the point--that change must      be imposed from outside the agencies.       We commend you for taking this modest first step in      antitrust improvement for production agriculture.
