 Mr. Chairman, the transportation appropriation measure before us today contains $2 million for the Northern Indiana South Shore commuter rail line. The House report states that this funding is to be used to complete a major investment study. However, previously appropriated funds will be sufficient to complete the major investment study and it will be completed later this year.  The critical problem facing the commuter rail line is the tremendous increase in ridership over the past several years and the lack of adequate car space to meet this growth. Would the chairman agree that this $2 million could be used to allow the Northern Indiana Commuter Transportation District to acquire additional rail cars to relieve overload on the commuter rail line?
