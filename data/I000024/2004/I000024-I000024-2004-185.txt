President, I would like to pay tribute to Bill Pardue, who until recently was the CEO of Lexis Nexis of Dayton, OH, which now owns Dolon Information of Oklahoma City, OK.  I have had the privilege of working with Bill and Lexis Nexis on various initiatives to help secure the homeland, and wanted to say a sincere thank you, on behalf of all Americans to Bill, to Lexis-Nexis, and to the thousands of people who make up that fine company.                          ____________________
