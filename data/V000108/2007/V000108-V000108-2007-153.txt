Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  I rise in opposition to the gentleman's amendment because I believe the actions we have taken in the subcommittee will save the American taxpayers' money.  I would first note that all A-76 studies performed by the Corps of Engineers have been won by Corps employees. So the first question is: Why do it?  The Corps is working under also an arbitrary numerical quota to review certain numbers of jobs in certain time periods without research and analysis. It would suggest that this is an arbitrary requirement put into place by the Office of Management and Budget, and there is a doubt, at least in this Member's mind, that it has been subjected to analysis at OMB.  I also believe that historically there has been opposition in this body to privatization. That has been bipartisan. I would point out that from a monetary standpoint, that the cost of these studies often exceeds the benefits; and of those functions that are easily contracted out, the remainder are difficult to separate into contractible and governmental function groups.  The fact is that the committee recommendation allows the Corps to continue with high-performing organization studies which follow the same study process, with similar results,without incurring the additional time and costs associated with contracting competitions.  So what we would want to do is to use those high-performing organization studies, apply less cost to the taxpayers and to move this process along. I am opposed to the gentleman's amendment.
