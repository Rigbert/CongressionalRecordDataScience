 Maybe he can get the Senator from Illinois to yield for a question as well.  I don't think we want to complain about the fact we haven't been attacked again since 9/11, I say to my friend from Illinois. Containing terrorists at Guantanamo, going after terrorists in Iraq and Afghanistan, clearly something worked. And to argue we would somehow be made more safe in this country by closing down Guantanamo I find borders almost on the absurd.
