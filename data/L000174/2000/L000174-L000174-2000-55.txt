President, I rise today to recognize an outstanding history education program in Vermont and throughout the United States. National History Day is a year-long nonprofit program through which students in grades 6-12 research and create historical projects related to a broad theme, culminating in an annual contest. This year's National History Day theme, Frontiers in History: People, Places, Ideas, encompasses endless possibilities for exploration. Each year more than 500,000 students participate in this nationwide event that encourages students to delve into various facets of world, national, regional, or local history and to produce original research projects.  By encouraging young Vermonters to take advantage of the wealth of primary historical resources available to them, students are able to gain a richer understanding of historical issues, ideas, people and events. Students in this program learn how to analyze a variety of primary sources such as photographs, letters, posters, maps, artifacts, sound recordings and motion pictures. This significant academic exercise encourages intellectual growth while helping students to develop critical thinking and problem solving skills that will help them manage and use information.  In June I had the pleasure of meeting with the 25 winners of this year's Vermont History Day contest here in Washington as they participated in the national contest held at the University of Maryland. These impressive students represent the great benefit of fostering and encouraging academic curiosity in our youth. Every student in Vermont should have the opportunity to participate in this enriching experience. I commend the coordinator of our state program, the Vermont Historical Society, for its commitment to expanding History Day in Vermont. The National History Day program is a truly great asset to Vermont educators and students in their quest for educational excellence.                          ____________________
