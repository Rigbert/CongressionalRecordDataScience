Mr. Speaker, due to my absence, I was unable to attend the House of Representatives on several votes. If I had been present, I would have voted ``aye'' on final passage of H.R. 2140; ``aye'' on final passage on H.R. 2886; ``aye'' on final passage on H. Con. Res. 196; ``nay'' on the motion to instruct conferees on the Commerce/Justice State Appropriations Bill; and ``aye'' on approving the Journal.                          ____________________
