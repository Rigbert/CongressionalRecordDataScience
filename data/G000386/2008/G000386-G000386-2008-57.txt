 That choice is which of our colleagues, Senator McCain or Senator Obama, should we follow in terms of future tax policy. I speak as ranking member and former chairman of the Committee on Finance that has jurisdiction over tax policy.  In recent weeks--when I say in recent weeks, I mean in July because we weren't in session in August--I have talked about the history of party control and the likelihood of broad-based tax increases. I will use the tax increase thermometer--and that thermometer is up here--to point out history. I have discussed the specific precedent of the 1992 campaign with its promise of middle-class tax cuts andthe 1998 world record tax increase that hit taxpayers above $20,000. I have referred to a case of tax hike amnesia, and I put up my famous Rip Van Winkle chart. I have discussed the impact of the McCain and the Obama plans, and in July I also talked about how the McCain and Obama plans would affect seniors and middle-income families. Today, I wish to focus on small business and the effect on small business of the tax policies of the respective Presidential candidates.  There has been a lot of controversy over the years about the effect of marginal tax rate increases on small business. It first arose back in 1993. At that time, President Clinton and the congressional majority Democrats pushed through legislation that retroactively raised the top marginal income tax rates. The rate was 31 percent. Under the 1993 bill, two new higher rates went into effect: the 36-percent rate and the 39.6-percent rate, and that is where it was until the 2001 tax bill.  One of the criticisms of those higher marginal tax rates passed back in 1993 was that these rates would harm small business. Did they harm small business? Well, I am here to say they did, but I have to back up what I am saying.  In the year 2001, Chairman Baucus--now the Democratic chairman of the committee I used to chair--Chairman Baucus and I crafted a bipartisan package of marginal rate reductions. The first part of 2001, I was chairman of that committee, and Chairman Baucus was the ranking member. So in 2001, we had this bipartisan package of marginal tax rate reductions. Part of that package brought the top rate from that 39.6 setup in 1993 down to 35 where it is now.  Another part of the package lowered the 36-percent rate to 33 percent. Although the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, in its distribution analysis, concluded that the legislation improved the progressivity of the Tax Code, the top marginal rate reductions were controversial.  Many of the liberal Members of this body and in the punditry decried the marginal rate reductions as a tax cut for the wealthy. Many of the press echoed those criticisms. They focused on the top rate reductions and defined the bipartisan, broad-based tax relief as ``the Bush tax cuts for the rich.'' These critics and Members who shared their view failed to examine the data on the whole bill, and if they had, they would have come to a different conclusion.  The fact that the Democratic Presidential candidate this year is embracing most of the policy from the bipartisan deal should give these liberal critics some pause. Senator Obama's campaign tax plan confirms what I said many times over the last 7 years. It confirms that the bill Chairman Baucus and I crafted in 2001 was a bipartisan plan that would stand the test of time.  Since the top rates of 35 percent and 33 percent were the source of considerable opposition back then in 2001, there was a lot of debate about their merits. Aside from the general economic benefits of the increased incentives for work and investment, Chairman Baucus and I focused on the benefits to small business. On Monday, August 20, 2001, Chairman Baucus and I released a statement on the Treasury Department's analysis of that 2001 tax bill, and I will quote from part of that press release that Senator Baucus and I put out:       Owners of sole proprietorships, partnerships, S      corporations, and farms will receive 80 percent of the tax      relief associated with reducing the top income tax rate of 36      percent to 33 percent and 39.6 percent down to 35 percent.      Senators Baucus and Grassley said most of the job growth over      the last decade has come from small business. Experts agree      that lower taxes increase a business's cash flow which helps      with liquidity constraints during an economic slowdown and      could increase the demand for investment and labor.  That is the end of the quote of Senator Baucus's and my press release commentary on the 2001 tax bill impact on small business.  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent at this point to have printed in the Record a copy of that August 20, 2001, Baucus-Grassley press release.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                      U.S. Senate,                                         Committee on Finance,                                    Washington, DC, Aug. 20, 2001.  Baucus, Grassley, New Analysis Shows Tax Cuts Help Small Businesses       Washington.--Sen. Max Baucus, chairman of the Senate      Finance Committee, and Sen. Chuck Grassley, ranking member,      today said a new U.S. Treasury Department analysis shows that      farms, small businesses and entrepreneurs will receive most      of the tax relief from cutting the top marginal tax rates.       ``I'm pleased this analysis shows the tax cut we passed      will provide relief for farmers and ranchers and our      agriculture community, as well as small businesses and      entrepreneurs throughout our country,'' Baucus said. ``My      State is an agriculture and small business State, and it's      heartening to know that this tax cut will put money back in      the economy and help create more jobs.''       Grassley said, ``One of the goals of our bipartisan tax cut      was reducing the tax burden for small businesses. ``That's      important because small businesses create most of the jobs in      this country. The new analysis shows that we succeeded in our      desire to re-kindle the fire fueling the small business      engine.''       At the Senators' request, the Treasury Department's Office      of Tax Analysis calculated that when the new tax relief law      is fully phased in, entrepreneurs and small businesses--     owners of sole proprietorships, partnerships, S corporations,      and farms--will receive 80 percent of the tax relief      associated with reducing the top income tax rates of 36      percent to 33 percent and 39.6 percent to 35 percent. Such      business owners make up 62 percent (about 500,000) of the      800,000 tax returns that will benefit from the new 33 percent      and 35 percent rates, according to the analysis.       Baucus and Grassley said most of the job growth over the      past decade has come from small businesses, noting that 80      percent of the 11.1 million new jobs created between 1994 and      1998 were from businesses with fewer than 20 employees, and      80 percent of American businesses have fewer than 20      employees. Experts agree that lower taxes increase a      business' cash flow, which helps with liquidity constraints      during an economic slowdown and could increase the demand for      investment and labor, the senators said.       An October 2000 report by the National Bureau of Economic      Research, a well-regarded non-partisan organization, entitled      ``Personal Income Taxes and the Growth of Small Firms,'' says      plainly that when a sole proprietor's marginal tax rate goes      up, the rate of growth of his or her business enterprise goes      down, the senators said.       The bipartisan tax cut bill responded to the fact that      individual income tax collections were near an all-time high,      even higher than some levels imposed during World War II.      Baucus and Grassley said individual rate cuts are important      relief for small businesses because most small business      owners and farmers operate their businesses as sole      proprietorships, partnerships, Limited Liability,      Corporations or S corporations. The income of these types of      entities is reported directly on the individual tax returns      of the owners. A rate reduction for individuals reduces rates      for farms and small businesses.       Baucus and Grassley were instrumental in passing the      bipartisan tax cut legislation.
