Speaker, on the occasion of her departure at the end of this month for a teaching position in the Empire State, we rise to thank Dr. Christine Greer Ehrenberg for her exemplary service to this House.  For the past four and one-half years, Dr. Ehrenberg has served as the Director of the House of Representatives Child Care Center. Since 1985, the Center has provided outstanding preschool and educationally enriching care for children of Members and staff of the House, enabling parents to work free of worry about their children's welfare. We are grateful to Dr. Ehrenberg, and her dedicated staff, for making this possible, and for the many improvements which she has initiated and implemented for the Center during her tenure.  Christine is only the second director of HRCCC. When she arrived in 1997, she brought a wealth of experience in the educational field. Her direction of the Center, and her guidance to those who oversee it, have been invaluable. But we are supremely confident that the greatest beneficiaries of Christine's talents and efforts, by far, have been the children enrolled in the Center. Christine's has not always been an easy job--the events of the dreadful morning of September 11 come immediately to mind, together with the logistics of relocating the Center, once permanently to its current location, and once temporarily. But despite difficult circumstances, Christine always kept the Center on an even keel and moving in the right direction.  Through her work here, Christine has earned the respect and gratitude of dozens of House families whose children started their educational careers at the Center. We join them in thanking Christine for her tireless efforts in their behalf. We wish Christine and her husband Dale all the best as they set out for New York State. May they always look back fondly upon their days with the House, as we surely will.                          ____________________
