 This vote is as important as any vote we are going to cast this year. But I do not think we should confuse with something it is not. There are other votes for or against abortion, but as the distinguished Senator from California has said, that is not what this vote is. There seems to be no end to the number of times we will fight the fight on abortion. But that is not what this vote is about, despite what some would try to suggest.  This vote is about a program that is absolutely crucial if we are going to stabilize the Earth's population in the 21st century. The number of people born in the next decade are going to decide that question.  A quarter of the Earth's people live in poverty. They have no jobs. They have nothing resembling adequate shelter and medical care. They drink from the streams they and their animals bathe in. They live from hand to mouth in filth and in despair. We can do something to help.  Our family planning program gives those people a chance to get out from under the crushing weight of more and more hungry mouths to feed. Some argue that by giving them that chance, we impose our values on them. The people who make that argument should ask those people, as I have. They should ask them if they feel we are imposing our values on them. What they will hear, as I have, is that there are hundreds of millions of couples whowant access to family planning and cannot get it or cannot afford it. They desperately want to be able to decide when to have children and how many to have. They do not see that as us imposing our will on them, but giving them the chance to make their own decisions. Then they will decide.  The only question is whether they will decide with family planning, or with abortion or by having more children who die in infancy of hunger and disease. If we ask those people if they want to have the technology, and the knowledge, so they can make the choice of when to have children and how many to have, or if they would rather rely on abortion or have more children who will die of disease or hunger, the answer is very simple. They want control over their own lives. And by passing this resolution, as the House did 2 weeks ago, we give those people safe alternatives to abortion now, not 4 months from now when for many of them it will already be too late.  Madam President, it is the height of arrogance for us to stand on this floor and say, because of a few single-issue groups in the United States, we will not give families in other countries the chance to make the decisions that any one of us could do in our own family or in our children's families because we live in a nation where family planning is readily available and all of us make the kind of income where it is not a problem for us.  But we stand here and say, so somebody can put a notch on the wall, that they voted politically correctly for which single-issue group or some fundraising letter has gone out, and we turn our backs on millions of people who want our help.  Again, I would remind my colleagues of the facts in the record here. In 4 years time in Russia, where we made available family planning services, where we increased just one simple thing, the use of contraceptives by just 4 or 5 percent, the number of abortions went down by 800,000.  But some of the same people stand on the floor of the Senate today and the floor of the House, and say that they are against providing these services because somehow they are following a right-to-life or antiabortion agenda, and they voted against the money that was used in Russia. And that same money helped reduce the number of abortions by 800,000.  We have Members in this body and the other body who say they have to be so dependent on single-issue groups that they cannot vote for this money. They cannot vote for this money because somebody somewhere in that country, some private organization, might use money of their own, not ours, for abortion, so we should not give them any money for family planning. Fortunately, a majority of the House was wise enough to stand up to the single-issue groups, and vote for this resolution.  Let us stop the hypocrisy and stop the pandering to single-issue groups. I do not care whether they are to the right or to the left. Let us do what is right. How can we stand here and say, ``Oh, we can do this because we're rich and we know better, but, boy, we're going to show you. We can't help you because somewhere somebody will send out newsletters to somebody will say they didn't stick to the agenda that our group asked them to do.'' Let us stop the hypocrisy and do what is right; and let's vote for this resolution.  I ask unanimous consent a letter by the distinguished Secretary of State Madeleine Albright be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                       The Secretary of State,                                    Washington, February 21, 1997.     Hon. Thomas A. Daschle,     Minority Leader,     U.S. Senate.       Dear Senator Daschle: I am writing to urge your support on      the upcoming vote to release already-delayed international      family planning funds in March instead of July of this year.      Given the negative consequences to women and men in      developing countries, as well as the administrative costs      associated with further constraints on these funds, I am      confident that you will agree that a March release date is      justified and that no identifiable purpose is served by      further delay.       In his January 31 report to the Congress, the President      made it unmistakably clear that ``a delay will cause serious,      irreversible and avoidable harm.'' At least 17 separate      programs, administered by the U.S. Agency for International      Development and amounting to at least $35 million, would be      seriously impacted by the funding delay. As a result,      unintended pregnancies will rise, maternal and infant deaths      will be more numerous, and abortions will increase. Clearly,      family planning saves lives, enhances the health and well-     being of women and their children, and prevents the tragic      recourse to abortion.       International family planning also serves important U.S.      foreign policy interests; elevating the status of women, and      reducing the flow of refugees, protecting the global      environment, and promoting sustainable development which      leads to greater economic growth and trade opportunities for      our businesses. Efforts to slow population growth, reduce      poverty, promote economic progress, and empower women are      mutually reinforcing. The proof is not found in arcane      studies, but in vigorous economic development in countries      like South Korea and Thailand.       The President and I are committed to building bipartisan      support for a foreign policy that will serve our national      interests into the 21st century. International family      planning programs have a successful track record and have      garnered bipartisan support for the past 30 years; we must      rebuild this support for the next 30 and beyond. Unhappily,      international family planning programs have often been      misunderstood, creating unnecessary rancor. Let me be clear--     the United States does not, has not, and will not promote or      provide abortion services as a method of family planing in      developing countries. These programs are carefully executed      and monitored to ensure that U.S. funds are not used for      illegal purposes. The upcoming vote is not about abortion. It      is, in fact, just the opposite: the release of family      planning funds now will reduce the incidence of unintended      pregnancy and abortion.       On the other hand, it is an indisputable fact that family      planning does reduce abortion, as best evidenced by      significant declines in abortion as family planning services      are becoming available in Russia and Central and Eastern      Europe. The argument is also made that by providing support      for family planning services, the United States may      unwittingly enable organizations to use some of their private      funds to provide legal abortion services. Carried to its      logical conclusion, of course, the United States would not      provide support for child survival or any other health      programs in countries where legal abortion services are      supported by national health systems.       The Congress has a real opportunity to correct a problem      with funding set in place last fall. In so doing, you can      help advance our interest in improving the status of women,      protecting the environment, and encouraging robust economic      progress around the world. This progress will make the      difference for hundreds of thousands of citizens abroad. Most      important, voluntary international family planning programs      are in the interest of our own citizens. I urge your support      for S.J. Res. 14.           Sincerely,                                            Madeleine K. Albright.
