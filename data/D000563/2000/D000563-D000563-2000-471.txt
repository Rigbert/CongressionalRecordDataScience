But I would like to ask him a question. I hope I am not inviting a speech. It is a very simple question.  I am holding Vice President Gore's book, ``Earth in the Balance'' in my hand. Can the Senator from Texas tell me which page he refers to when he says that Vice President Gore has called for a $3 gasoline tax increase? I want to turn to that page immediately. Can the Senator give me the number of the page?
