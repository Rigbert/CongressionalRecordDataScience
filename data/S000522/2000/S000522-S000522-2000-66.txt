Mr. Chairman, let me just say there is at least, hopefully, only one government per country, whereas there is a myriad of NGOs--a large number of NGOs, NGOs that are trying to lobby governments to topple pro-life laws. That is what we are talking about.  Way back in 1984 we accepted a compromise to fund countries, again, because there is only one government per country.  But when we talk about a nongovernmental organization, if this nongovernmental organization does not take the money, another will step up to the plate and procure the grant.
