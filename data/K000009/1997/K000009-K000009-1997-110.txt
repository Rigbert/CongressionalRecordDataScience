Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. McHale].  Mr. McHALE. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the American Heritage Rivers Initiative and in sharp contrast to the comments that were made previously by the gentlewoman from Idaho [Mrs. Chenoweth], my friend and colleague.  As indicated by the gentlewoman from Idaho [Mrs. Chenoweth] in her comments, the American Heritage Rivers Initiative was a subject of a full hearing yesterday of the Committee on Resources. There is now an extended comment period for public participation.  Today's debate and the legislation introduced by the gentlewoman from Idaho [Mrs. Chenoweth] amply demonstrates that there will be a full legislative role in this process. There is no new bureaucracy under this program, no new statutory authority given in terms of land use policy to the administration.  The initiative for inclusion in this program is purely local and voluntary. I would suggest to the gentlewoman from Idaho [Mrs. Chenoweth] that if her community does not wish to participate, I respect that, but that she not block those efforts and those interests locally generated in communities, such as my own, to have 10 rivers nationwide designated for participation in this program.  I represent a community of 70 different municipalities. We are attempting to restore a river; and in that effort, we seek a Federal voluntary partnership.
