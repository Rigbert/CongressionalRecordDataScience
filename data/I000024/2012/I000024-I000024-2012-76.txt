President, I rise for an announcement. At the conclusion of these votes, I will be making what I think is a fairly significant announcement in terms of 35 Members of this body who have stated they will oppose the Law of the Sea Treaty, which, of course, means it would not be able to be passed this session. So I will be doing that immediately following the votes that take place momentarily.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
