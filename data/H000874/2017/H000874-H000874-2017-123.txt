Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, the United States Senate is now considering what is called a ``skinny bill'' on the Affordable Care Act.  The Senators are being told that they are voting for that bill to send it over here so it can go to conference and be perfected.  The Rules Committee has just met and a provision was offered to the martial law, which means that we can take something up right away, that what we can take up is to go to conference. That was rejected by the Rules Committee.  There is a suspicion that I have--and I see the majority leader on the floor--that there may be an intent to send the bill immediately back to the Senate and have it go to the President without 72 hours of consideration, without hearings, without scoring. I would hope the majority leader could give us assurances.
