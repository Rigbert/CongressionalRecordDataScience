President, I rise today to address shortfalls in the budget resolution for key community and economic development programs. The budget before us includes a reduction of roughly $2 billion in Federal assistance to distressed and underserved communities. These cuts are shortsighted, ill-advised and represent a significant retreat from our long-standing commitment to invest in our Nation's communities. I join Senator Sarbanes in offering an amendment to restore funding for these programs to their fiscal year 2005 levels.  Last year the Federal Government invested $5.7 billion in communities across the country through a network of community and economic development programs. These programs were used to enhance social services, invest in infrastructure, promote affordable housing, provide public services and revitalize our downtowns. These investments changed the face of our cities and helped improve the standards of living across the Nation.  Unfortunately, the President has proposed to eliminate this network of programs and replace them with a single block grant at the Department of Commerce. Eighteen programs are on the chopping block, including the Community Development Block Grant, CDBG, the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund, CDFI, the Community Services Block Grant, CSBG, Brownfields Economic Development Initiatives and the Economic Development Agency, EDA. I find this proposal underwhelming and unacceptable. To add insult to injury the President has proposed, and this budget includes, only $3.7 billion for community and economic development activities covered under this initiative--a 34-percent reduction in all programs combined. This is simply not adequate.  Each of the programs slated for elimination was created for a specific purpose, each serves targeted constituencies and addresses distinct needs. Consolidating and under funding these programs would leave critical gaps in the web of support for our Nation's cities and towns. I question the President's assertion that these programs are ineffective or inefficient and I question the wisdom of starting a new program at a new agency when the old system is not broken.  I am particularly concerned with the elimination of the Community Development Block Grant program. CDBG is the centerpiece of the Federal government's efforts to help States and localities meet the needs of low-income communities. CDBG funds vital housing rehabilitation, supportive services, public improvements and economic development projects in communities across the Nation. It serves more than 1,100 entitlement communities, urban counties and States, and more than 3,000 rural communities.  Last year over 95 percent of CDBG funds went to activities benefiting low and moderate income persons. CDBG housing projects assisted over 160,000 households, public service projects benefited over 13 million individuals, and economic development projects helped create or retain over 90,000 jobs. Vermont used CDBG grants to rehabilitate over 270 units of affordable housing and help create or preserve over 150 jobs.  I recently led a bipartisan letter with Senator Coleman to the Budget Committee attesting to the effectiveness of CDBG and urged that it be fully funded and retained at the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Fifty-seven members of the Senate joined me in this letter.  I ask unanimous consent to print this letter in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                                    Washington, DC, March 2, 2005.     Hon. Judd Gregg,     Chairman, Committee on the Budget,     U.S. Senate, Washington. DC.     Hon. Kent Conrad,     Ranking Member, Committee on the Budget, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Gregg and Ranking Member Conrad: The      Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program funds      housing rehabilitation, supportive services, public      improvements and economic development projects in communities      across the nation. CDBG serves more than 1,100 entitlement      communities, urban counties and states, and more than 3,000      rural communities. We urge the Budget Committee to maintain      the Federal government's current commitment to community      development programs at the Department of Housing and Urban      Development and support a budget allocation of $4,732 billion      in Function 450 for CDBG, Section 108 economic development      loan guarantees, and the Brownfields Economic Development      Initiative.       HUD is the Federal Department principally responsible for      community economic development. CDBG is the center piece of      the Federal government's efforts to help states and      localities meet the needs of low-income communities. Section      101 of the Housing and Community Development Act created the      CDBG program to consolidate a number of complex and      overlapping programs of financial assistance in order to      encourage community development activities which are      consistent with comprehensive local and areawide development      planning; to further the national housing goal of a decent      home and a suitable living environment for every American      family; and to foster the undertaking of housing and      community development activities in a coordinated and      mutually supportive manner by Federal agencies and programs,      as well as by communities. HUD's community development      programs coupled with HUD's housing and homeless programs and      supportive services, provide communities with a comprehensive      approach to serving the needs of residents. CDBG is the glue      that holds other Federal programs serving low-income      communities together.       The Strengthening America's Community proposal aims to      create strong accountability standards, offer flexibility to      communities and create a more unified federal approach. These      goals are already hallmarks; of the CDBG program. On the 30th      Anniversary of CDBG in 2004, HUD Deputy Secretary Roy      Bernardi said the following about the program: ``HUD has a      long history of `being there' and providing help for people,      particularly those with the greatest needs--our lower income      constituents. CDBG has certainly been there, during boom      years and most importantly in times of tightening budgets,      which place greater demands on existing services. We must      continue to support and build upon programs that work, those      that have a proven record of flexibility and the ability to      fit in with locally determined needs. CDBG is such a program      and ranks among our nation's oldest and most successful      programs. It continues to set the standard for all other      block grant programs.''       The Strengthening America's Communities proposal would      recreate a block grant program similar to CDBG within the      Deparment of Commerce. The Department of Commerce, however,      does not have the vital infrastructure or institutional      capacity to provide a comprehensive approach to neighborhood      development. Replicating HUD's CDBG program within the      Department of Commerce would require rebuilding HUD's      ``infrastructure'' and would result in inefficiencies,      greater complexity and less aid to fewer cities, an approach      which does not serve America's communities or taxpayers.      CDBG's success depends on a locally driven, citizen      participation process that provides flexibility and does not      take a ``one-size-fits-all'' approach. The needs of Nashua,      New Hampshire; Bismarck, North Dakota; Cincinnati, Ohio and      Kansas City, Missouri are very different from the needs of      Miami, Florida; El Paso, Texas; Pueblo, Colorado; or San      Diego, California. CDBG is capable of addressing the diverse      needs of these communities whether it is housing      rehabilitation, homeownership, supported services for the      elderly or children, business development or infrastructure      improvements.       CDBG is one of the most effective Federal domestic programs      to revitalize neighborhoods with proven results. Over 95      percent of CDBG funds went to activities principally      benefiting low- and moderate-income persons. Twenty-eight      percent of CDBG funds supported housing activities in      distressed communities, 24 percent supported public      improvements, 15 percent went to the provision of public      services, and 7 percent supported economic deve1opment      activities. In FY2004, CDBG housing projects assisted 168,938      households. Public service projects funded with CDBG served      13,312,631 individuals. Economic development programs funded      by CDBG in fiscal 2004 created or retained 90,637 jobs for      Americans and public improvement projects benefited 9,453,993      persons. CDBG also has a strong record in business retention:      CDBG ensured that over 80 percent of the businesses assisted      through the program were still in operation after three      years.       Thank you for your consideration. We look forward to      working with you to ensure that communities across the      country can provide good jobs, affordable housing, and public      services to meet the needs of all Americans.
