 Mr. Delmer Gross was a bus driver for the Laurel County Board of Education for 39 years and cherishes his memories driving kids to and from school--many of his former students are his good friends still to this day. In his spare time, Delmer serves as the pastor at London Community Church, a role he has enjoyed for almost 43 years.  Delmer started driving a school bus in 1969 when he was only 21 years old. He spent 5 years driving a double route as his first assignment. Each morning he would start by busing students in grades 1 through 12 to Swiss Colony. Then he would go to Mitchell Creek, located west of Interstate 75, and pick up elementary school students, only to return them to Swiss Colony via the road that is now Ky. 1956.  His second route took him all the way down to Rockcastle River and was much more dangerous because of the truck traffic. ``We didn't have a four-lane road then,'' Delmer recalls. ``There were a lot of crooked places where I had to pick up kids on the opposite side of a curve. I've had trucks slide at me sideways. A couple of times it was quite frightening.'' Delmer drove this route for almost 24 years before he began driving a town route with special-needs students in 1997.  One time, Delmer was driving on Ky. 1956 through freezing rain and snow and made a stop just under the crest of a hill. Two girls got off the bus just before a car came over the hill and barely stopped in time. Unfortunately, a second car came along and was unable to stop. It crashed into the back of the first, sending the car spinning into a driveway. The second car bounced into Delmer's lane as a result of the crash and hit the bus head-on, clipping one of the girls in the knee. Delmer went straight home, got in his car, and drove over to the little girl's house to help her father take her to the hospital. Thankfully, she walked away with only minor injuries.  Delmer deeply cherishes the countless memories that he made with the students he shuttled throughout his three-decade-long career, and he rarely had any disciplinary issues with any of the children. ``I had a good relationship with almost all of the students I hauled,'' Delmer said.  Madam President, Mr. Delmer Gross's dedication to his job and the safety of his students is admirable. I commend him for his 39 years of excellent service to the children of Laurel County schools. Delmer's career serves as an inspiration to the people of our great Commonwealth and exemplifies the true spirit of Kentucky. The Laurel County-area Sentinel Echo published an article in the spring of this year to honor Mr. Delmer Gross's achievements. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:                 [From the Sentinel Echo, Spring 2011]                  Driving a Bus Is No Laughing Matter                            (By Carol Mills)       Delmer Gross loved being a bus driver for the Laurel County      Board of Education for 39 years, but he saw the behavior of      students getting worse over the years.       ``The last 15 years the students have been getting      progressively worse,'' he said. ``Less respect for adults,      less respect for authority. You had several that were pushing      their boundaries. I see the attitudes of children, the      discipline and behavior is a much greater problem than it was      20 years ago. It's becoming a problem in all public places.      Kids don't have parents who really discipline them. As adults      they have major problems with society. They weren't taught      respect, weren't forced to respect and it's showing.''       Gross said the Bible teaches ``to spare the rod we hate our      child.'' ``I don't think we get much smarter than the man who      said that,'' he said. ``In his day he was the wisest man     that ever lived. Solomon wrote all those proverbs that are      recorded in the Bible.''       Gross did not have many disciplinary problems with the      students on the bus and when he did, he usually handled them      himself.       Gross, now 64, started driving a school bus in 1969 when he      was 21 years old. He also painted houses between routes and      has been the pastor at London Community Church for almost 43      years.       ``I had a double route, which most drivers did,'' Gross      recalled. ``I left this community and went to the next      community which is White Oak. I transported all of the      children first through 12th grade to Swiss Colony and then I      would drop all of the kids and go to Mitchell Creek, which is      back by Interstate 75 just on the west side of 75. Then I      would go through that community and would pick up just      elementary kids and bring them back on what was old Route 80      at the time. It's (Ky.) 1956 now. I would run that route from      Interstate 75 along with Mitchell Creek and transport them      back to Swiss Colony. I did that for a short time.''       Gross drove the White Oak route for five years and then he      let someone else take it over who lived in that community. He      then took a dangerous route on Old Ky. 80.       ``It was a very dangerous route because of the truck      traffic. We didn't have a four-lane road then,'' he said. ``I      drove all the way down to the Rockcastle River. I drove that      route for 23 or 24 years. There were a lot of crooked places      where I had to pick up kids on the opposite side of a curve.      I've had trucks slide at me sideways. A couple of times it      was quite frightening.''       In 1997, Gross started driving a town route with special-     needs students. He said it was not as hectic as driving a      route with all the age groups.       Over the years while driving a school bus, Gross had two or      three minor accidents and one that could have been very      dangerous.       ``It was a day in March. It would snow and then it would      melt, then freeze and then snow some more, melt and freeze,''      he recalled. ``The officials kept an eye on most of the main      roads, but just about 3 o'clock it started freezing and      snowing. I picked up a load at South High School and came to      (Ky.) 1956. I made a stop just under the crest of a hill,      probably 150 to 200 yards away. A car came over the hill just      after I dropped off two girls. The car stopped in time.      Another car came over the crest and when she braked, she hit      the little car in the rear end and spun it around and pushed      it back into a driveway.''       ``One of the girls managed to run across the road and over      to the edge of a bank,'' he continued. ``The car that caused      all of this bounced off that little car and into my lane and      hit my bus head on and went underneath the bus. The other      girl who had gotten off the bus was clipped on the knee by      the car that caused the accident. She only had a minor      injury. The drivers of the two cars weren't hurt. I thought      both girls were going to be pinned between my bus and the      car.''       Gross said the officer who worked the accident did not      mandate the girl who was hurt be taken to the hospital to be      checked out.       ``I was quite surprised after it was all over and when I      went home, I called back to the child's home and I took my      little car and waited until her father got home from work and      we took her to the hospital.''       One of Gross's memorable moments on the bus route was the      day two boys were cutting up and joking. They were sitting up      front so that he could keep an eye on them.       ``They were cutting up quite a bit, joking, teasing and      laughing,'' Gross said. ``That didn't bother me. I was      listening to them. One of them said something kind of funny.      I thought I could be cute so I said something I thought      topped what he had said. He looked at his little buddy--they      were both elementary kids--`Tell you what,' he said, 5,000      comedians in this country out of a job and look what we're      stuck with.' I got so tickled I didn't even try to top that      line.''       ``I had a good relationship with almost all of the students      I hauled,'' Gross added. ``A lot of the older age groups are      grown up now and are good friends of mine.''       Gross is married to Yvonne and they have three children--     Suzanne Gray, Cheryl Winters, and Delmer Paul Gross.                          ____________________
