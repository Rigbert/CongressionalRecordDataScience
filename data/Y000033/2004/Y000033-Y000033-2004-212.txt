Mr. Speaker, today I rise to pay tribute to the men and women in blue who have given the ultimate sacrifice. Every year, thousands of law enforcement officers from all corners of our Nation come together to hold a candlelight vigil at the National Law Enforcement Officers' Memorial at Judiciary Square. Spouses, children and even those who just want to say thank you come together to honor the over 16,000 heroes whose names have been inscribed on that marble wall. These heroes are law enforcement officers who lost their lives in the line of duty.  Today, I pay my respects to these heroes and to share the sorrow as we remember and honor them for their unselfish commitment to protect and serve. We honor their lives and all they have done to make our streets a safer place for us to live.  Last year, 145 law enforcement officers gave their lives in the line of duty. Today, I would like to recognize and honor a fellow Alaskan: Officer John Patrick Watson, who gave his life Christmas Evening, 2003 while responding to a possible domestic dispute call. Officer Watson, an eighteen-year veteran of the force and resident of Kenai, Alaska was shot to death with his own weapon, allegedly by one of the individuals on whose welfare he was checking. Officer Watson is the first member of the Kenai Police Department to lose his life in the line of duty but his loss was not in vain. He will be remembered for his commitment to his job, his friends and most of all his family. He along with the other fallen members of the law enforcement community share a special bond with one another. They will be regarded as heroes, a bond they will share for eternity. It is only fitting that we celebrate their lives not for the way they died, but for the way they lived.  Officer John Patrick Watson went to work on Christmas Day as a hero and that is the way he will always be remembered. I pray for his wife Kathy, his daughter, six stepchildren and his family in Michigan. Officer Watson is a true Alaskan Hero.                          ____________________
