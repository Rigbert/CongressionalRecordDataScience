 I think everybody knows that the taxpayers pay 75 percent of the Part B premium and 25 percent is paid by the individual. Whenever we increase doctors' reimbursement--and we do that in this bill by 5.3 percent so that doctors do not lose their money--then, obviously, the 25 percent is going to go up a little bit, just as the 75 percent goes up a little bit when reimbursement is increased.
