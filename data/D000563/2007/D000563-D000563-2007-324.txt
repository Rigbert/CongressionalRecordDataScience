President, I rise today to introduce the Child Soldiers Accountability Act of 2007. This narrowly-tailored bipartisan legislation would make it a crime and a violation of immigration law to recruit or use child soldiers. Congress must ensure that perpetrators who commit this war crime will not find safe haven in our country.  I would like to thank the other original cosponsors of the Child Soldiers Accountability Act, Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, Senator Russell Feingold of Wisconsin, and Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas. This bill is a product of the Judiciary Committee's new Subcommittee on Human Rights and the Law, which is the first ever congressional committee dealing specifically with human rights. I am the Chairman of this Subcommittee and Senator Coburn is its ranking member.  Up to 250,000 children currently serve as combatants, porters, human mine detectors and sex slaves in state-run armies, paramilitaries and guerilla groups around the world. These child soldiers are denied the childhood that our children and grandchildren have and to which every child has an inalienable right. Moreover, their health and lives are endangered.  Children are recruited and used in combat situations because their emotional and physical immaturity makes it easy to mold them into obedient combatants who will witness and partake in horrific violence, often without comprehending their actions. Child soldiers are frequently recruited in areas of long-standing conflict where there are no longer eligible adults for recruitment. In many cases, they are provided with drugs and alcohol to numb them to the atrocities they are required to commit, as well as to increase their dependency upon the armed group.  Children are more likely to be killed, injured or become ill in combat situations than adults. In combat, child soldiers have been forced to the front lines, sent into minefields ahead of older troops or even used for suicide missions.  The devastating effects of war and abuse on the physical, emotional and social development of children are long lasting. Former child soldiers require extensive care and support from family and others in order to be rehabilitated and reintegrated into society. In the absence of such support, former child soldiers may comprise a generation of adults who will perpetuate conflict and undermine security, creating unforeseen challenges that our children will have to address.  There is a clear legal prohibition on recruiting and using child soldiers. Under customary international law, recruitment or use of child soldiers under the age of 15 is a war crime. Over 110 countries, including the United States, have ratified the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which prohibits the recruitment and use of child soldiers under 18.  While there have been positive developments internationally in the prosecution of child soldier recruitment and use, especially by the Special Court for Sierra Leone, the ability of international tribunals or hybrid courts to try these cases is limited. The average perpetrator still runs very little risk of being prosecuted. National courts can and should play a greater role in prosecuting perpetrators.  Unfortunately, recruiting and using child soldiers does not violate U.S. criminal or immigration law. As a result, the U.S. government is unable to punish individuals found in our country who have recruited or used child soldiers. In contrast, other grave human rights violations, including genocide and torture, are punishable under U.S. criminal and immigration law.  This loophole in the law was identified during a hearing entitled ``Casualties of War: Child Soldiers and the Law,'' held by the Senate Subcommittee on Human Rights and the Law. Ismael Beah, a former child soldier and author of the bestselling book A Long Way Gone: Memoirs of a Boy Soldier, testified at this hearing. Mr. Beah said this gap in the law ``saddens me tremendously'' and that closing this loophole ``would set a clear example that there is no safe haven anywhere for those who recruit and use children in war.'' Mr. Beah also posed a moral challenge to all of us:       When you go home tonight to your children, your cousins,      and your grandchildren and watch them carrying out their      various childhood activities, I want you to remember that at      that same moment, there are countless children elsewhere who      are being killed; injured; exposed to extreme violence; and      forced to serve in armed groups, including girls who are      raped (leading some to have babies of commanders); all of      them between the ages of 8 and 17. As you watch your loved      ones, those children you adore most, ask yourselves whether      you would want these kinds of suffering for them. If you      don't, then you must stop this from happening to other      children around the world whose lives and humanity are as      important and of the same value as all children everywhere.  The Child Soldiers Accountability Act will help to ensure that the war criminals who recruit or use children as soldiers will not find safe haven in our country and allow the U.S. government to hold these individuals accountable for their actions.  First, this bill will make it a crime to recruit or use persons under the age of 15 as soldiers. Second, it will enable the government to deport or deny admission to an individual who recruited or used child soldiers under the age of 15.  This legislation will send a clear message to those who recruit or use child soldiers that there are real consequences to their actions. By holding such individuals criminally responsible, our country will help to deter the recruitment and use of child soldiers.  I urge my colleagues to ask themselves the question Ishmael Beah posed: Would we want our children or grandchildren to endure the pain and suffering that Mr. Beah and other child soldiers face? As Mr. Beah reminded us, the lives of child soldiers are just as important as those of our children and grandchildren. We have a moral obligation to take action to help these young people and to stop the abhorrent practice of recruiting and using child soldiers.  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2135       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
