The judge said at the sentencing hearing for Ahmed Ressam, an alleged terrorist now prosecuted and convicted, the following:       Okay. Let me say a few things. First of all, it will come      as no surprise to anybody that this sentencing is one that I      have struggled with a great deal, more than any other      sentencing that I've had in the 24 years I've been on the      bench.  The judge went on to say:       I've done my very best to arrive at a period of confinement      that appropriately recognizes the severity of the intended      offense, but also recognizes the practicalities of the      parties' positions before trial and the cooperation of     Mr. Ressam, even though it did terminate prematurely.  The judge said:       The message I would hope to convey in today's sentencing is      two-fold: First, that we have the resolve in this country to      deal with the subject of terrorism and people who engage in      it should be prepared to sacrifice a major portion of their      life in confinement.       Secondly, though, I would like to convey the message that      our system works. We did not need to use a secret military      tribunal, or detain the defendant indefinitely as an enemy      combatant, or deny him the right to counsel, or invoke any      proceedings beyond those guaranteed by or contrary to the      United States Constitution.  The judge said:       I would suggest that the message to the world from today's      sentencing is that our courts have not abandoned our      commitment to the ideals that set our nation apart. We can      deal with threats to our national security without denying      the accused fundamental constitutional protections.       Despite the fact that Mr. Ressam is not an American citizen      and despite the fact that he entered this country intent upon      killing American citizens, he received an effective, vigorous      defense, and the opportunity to have his guilt or innocence      determined by a jury of 12 ordinary citizens.       Most importantly, all of this occurred in the sunlight of a      public trial. There were no secret proceedings, no indefinite      detention, no denial of counsel.       The tragedy of September 11th shook our sense of security      and made us realize that we, too, are vulnerable to acts of      terrorism. Unfortunately, some believe that this threat      renders our Constitution obsolete. This is a Constitution for      which men and women have died and continue to die and which      has made us a model among nations. If that view is allowed to      prevail, the terrorists will have won.       It is my sworn duty, and as long as there is breath in my      body I'll perform it, to support and defend the Constitution      of the United States.  That is the end of the statement by Judge Coughenour. This judge was appointed by a Republican President. He clearly speaks to constitutional principles which know no party bounds.  All of us, Republicans and Democrats, swear to uphold that same Constitution in our service to the Senate and our service to this Government. It is clear that in some cases the open and public trial which this accused, Ahmed Ressam, received in Seattle could never occur because of concerns over classified information, over concerns of security for individuals. But it is very clear that in this case extraordinary efforts were made to make certain that we said to the world, this man can be tried in open court, judged by a jury of 12 ordinary citizens and his guilt determined according to a system bound by the Constitution we have sworn to uphold.  I am humbled by the wisdom of this simple statement from this Federal judge. I hope it serves as a reminder to all that we must seek not only security in this time of peril, but we must seek it in a way that never imperils our basic freedoms in America.                          ____________________
