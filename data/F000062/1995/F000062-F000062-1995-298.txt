 President, I come to the floor today joined by our colleague, Senator Kempthorne, to offer this amendment on behalf of a broad coalition of State and local governments. Since announcing my intention to proceed with this amendment, I have received letters of support from hundreds of cities across the country, including the States of Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, California, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, Oregon, Ohio, Texas, and Washington.  This amendment is supported by the National Governors' Association, the National Association of Counties, the National Conference of State Legislatures, the National League of Cities, and the U.S. Conference of Mayors, to name a few.  Mr. President, as a former mayor, I fully understand why Governors, mayors, city councils, and county boards of supervisors question allowing the Federal Communications Commission to second-guess decisions made at State and local government levels.  On one hand, the bill before the Senate gives cities and States the right to levy fair and reasonable fees and to control their rights of way; with the other hand, this bill, as it presently stands, takes these protections away.  The way in which it does so is found in section 201, which creates a new section 254(d) of the Cable Act, and provides sweeping preemption authority. The preemption gives any communications company the right, if they disagree with a law or regulation put forward by a State, county, or a city, to appeal that to the FCC.  That means that cities will have to send delegations of city attorneys to Washington to go before a panel of telecommunications specialist at the FCC, on what may be very broad question of State or local government rights.  In reality, this preemption provision is an unfunded mandate because it will create major new costs for cities and for States. I hope to explain why. I know my colleague, the Senator from Idaho, will do that as well.  A cable company would, and most likely will, appeal any local decision it does not like to the telecommunications experts at the Federal Communications Commission.  The city attorney of San Francisco advises that, in San Francisco, city laws provide that all street excavations must comply with local laws tailored to the specifics of the local communities, including the geography, the density of development, the age of public streets, their width, what other plumbing is under the street, the kind of surfacing the street has, et cetera.  The city attorney anticipates that whenever application of routine, local requirements interfere with the schedule or convenience of a telecommunications supplier, subsection (d), the provision we hope to strike, would authorize a cable company to seek FCC preemption. Any time they did not like the time and location of excavation to preserve effective traffic flow or to prevent hazardous road conditions, or minimize noise impacts, they could appeal to the FCC.  If they did not like an order to relocate facilities to accommodate a public improvement project, like the installation, repair, or replacement of water, sewer, our public transportation facilities, they would appeal.  If they did not like a requirement to utilize trenches owned by the city or another utility in order to avoid repeated excavation of heavily traveled streets, they would appeal.  If they did not like being required to place their facilities underground rather than overhead, consistent with the requirements imposed on other utilities, they could appeal.  If they were required to pay fees prior to installing any facility to cover the costs of reviewing plans and inspecting excavation work, they could appeal.  If they did not like being asked to pay fees to recover an appropriate share of increased street repair and paving costs that result from repeated excavation, they would appeal.  If they did not like the particular kinds of excavation equipment or techniques that a city mandate that they use, they could appeal.  If they did not like the indemnification, they could appeal.  The city attorney is right, that preemption would severely undermine local governments' ability to apply locally tailored requirements on a uniform basis.  Small cities are placed at risk and oppose the preemption because small cities are often financially strapped. As the city attorney of Redondo Beach, a suburb of Los Angeles writes, every time there is an appeal, they would have to find funds to come back to Washington to fight an appeal at the FCC.  Recently, the engineering design center at San Francisco State University, conducted an interesting study for San Francisco on the impact of street cuts on public roads. The expected life and value of public roads and streets directly correlates with the number of cuts into the road.  Although this is rather dull and esoteric to some, the study reveals that streets with three to nine utility cuts are expected to require resurfacing every 18 years, a 30-percent reduction in service life, relative to streets with less than three cuts. The more road cuts, the steeper the decline in value of the public's asset will be. Streets with more than nine cuts are expected to require resurfacing every 13 years, a 50-percent reduction in the service life of streets with less than three cuts.  An even more dramatic decline in a street's useful life is found on heavily traveled arterial streets with heavy wheel traffic. For those streets, the anticipated useful life declines even more rapidly, from 26 years for streets with fewer than three cuts to 17 years for streets with three to nine cuts, a 35-percent reduction, to 12 years for streets with more than nine cuts, a 54-percent reduction.  What does this mean? It means that financially struggling cities and counties will undoubtedly be forced to include in franchise fees, charges to allow the recovery of the additional maintenance requirements that constantly cutting into streets requires. The exemption means that every time a cable operator does not like it, the Washington staff of the cable operator is going to file a complaint with the FCC and the city has to send a delegation back to fight that complaint. It should not be this way. Cities should have control over their streets. Counties should have control over their roads. States should have control over their highways.  The right-of-way is the most valuable real estate the public owns. State, city, and county investments in right-of-way infrastructure was $86 billion in 1993 alone. Of the $86 billion, more than $22 billion represents the cost of maintaining these existing roadways. These State and local governments are entitled to be able to protect the public's investment in infrastructure. Exempting communication providers from paying the full costs they impose on State and local governments for the use of public right-of-way creates a subsidy to be paid for by taxpayers and other businesses that have no exemptions.   [[Page S8171]] I would also like to point out the preemption will change the outcome in some of the dispute between communication companies and cities and States. The FCC is the Nation's telecommunications experts. But they do not have the broad experience and concerns a mayor, a city council, a board of supervisors, or a Governor would have in negotiating and weighing a cable agreement and setting a cable fee.  If the preemption provision remains, a city would be forced to challenge the FCC ruling to gain a fair hearing in Federal court.  This is important because presently they can go directly to their local Federal court. Under the preemption, a city, State, or county government would have to come to the Federal court in Washington after an appeal to the FCC.  A city appealing an adverse ruling by the FCC would appear before the D.C. Federal Appeals Court rather than in the Federal district court of the locality involved. Further, the Federal court will evaluate a very different legal question--whether the FCC abused their discretion in reaching its determination. The preemption will force small cities to defend themselves in Washington, and many will be just unable to afford the cost.  By contrast, if no preemption exists, the cable company may challenge the city or State action directly to the Federal court in the locality and the court will review whether the city or State acted reasonably under the circumstances.  Edward Perez, assistant city attorney for Los Angeles, states this will be a very difficult standard to reverse, if they have to come to Washington. On matters involving communication issues, courts are likely to require a tough, heightened scrutiny standard for matters involving first amendment rights involving freedom of speech. Courts are likely to defer to the FCC judgment.  The FCC proceeding and its appeal in Washington will be very different from the Federal court action in a locality. Both the city and the communications company are more likely to be able to develop a more complete and thorough record if the proceeding is before the local Federal court rather than before a Government body in Washington.  We also believe the FCC lacks the expertise to address cities' concerns. As I said, if you have a city that is complicated in topography, that is very hilly, that is very old, that has very narrow streets, where the surfacing may be fragile, where there are earthquake problems, you are going to have different requirements on a cable entity constantly opening and recutting the streets. The fees should be able to reflect these regional and local distinctions.  Mr. President, this stack of letters opposing the preemption includes virtually every California city and virtually every major city in every State.  What the cities and the States tell us they want us to give local governments the opportunity for home rule on questions affecting their public rights-of-way. If the cable company does not like it, the cable company can go to court in that jurisdiction. By deleting the preemption, we can increase fairness, minimize cost to cities, counties, and States, and prevent an unfunded mandate.  If the preemption remains in this bill, it creates a major unfunded mandate for cities, for counties, and for States. I hope this body will sustain the cities and the counties and the States, and strike the preemption.  So I ask unanimous consent to have a number of letters printed in the Record.  There being no objections, the letters were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                  Office of the City Attorney,                                   Los Angeles, CA, June 12, 1995.     Re S. 652, Section 245(d) Preemption.     Mr. Kevin Cronin,     Office of Senator Diane Feinstein,     Senate Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Cronin: You asked for our thoughts regarding S.      652, Sec. 254(d), which would create broad preemption rights      in the FCC with respect to actions taken by local      governments. Specifically, you are interested as to how      section 254(d) could frustrate the ability of local      government to manage its rights of way as Congress believes      Local Government should (See Sec. 254(c)) and how it could      prevent Local Government from imposing competitively neutral      requirements on telecommunications providers to preserve and      advance Universal Service, protect the public safety and      welfare and to ensure the continued quality of      telecommunications services and safeguard the rights of      consumers. (See Sec. 254(b)).       Section 254(d) would permit the Federal Communications      Commission (``FCC'') to preempt local government:       ``(d) preemption.--If, after notice and an opportunity for      public comment, the Commission determined that a State or      local government has permitted or imposed any statute,      regulation, or legal requirement that violates or is      inconsistent with this section, the Commission shall      immediately preempt the enforcement of such statute,      regulation, or legal requirement to the extent necessary to      correct such violation or inconsistency.''       Section 254(d) reposes sweeping review powers in the FCC      and in effect converts a federal administrative agency into a      federal administrative Court. The FCC literally would have      the power to review any local government action it wishes      (either sua      sponte or at the request of the industry.) The undesirable      consequence of this result will be that a federal agency--     with personnel who do not answer directly to public--will      be dictating in fine detail what rules local government      and their citizens in distant places shall have to follow.      The FCC would be given plenary power to decide what      actions of local government are ``inconsistent with'' the      very broad provisions in the bill and, without further      review, to decide to nullify or preempt such governmental      actions. That is unprecedented and for reaching authority      for a federal agency to have over local government.       The FCC does have an important role to play in the scheme      of things. It has a professional staff with proven expertise      in telecommunications matters such as technical requirements.      Moreover, issues that transcend state borders need the FCC as      the overseer in order to ensure consistency and fairness      between the states. On the other hand, the FCC is not in the      best position to know what is best for citizens at the local      level regarding local issues. An example of a singularly      local issue, historically recognized by Congress and the      Courts, is the local government's right to manage the public      right-of-way (See Section 254(c)). Federal officials do not      have an adequate understanding of local issues nor do they      have the staff, either in size or proficiency, to resolve      local issues about every city in this country. Local      Governments and the local courts (entities which are      knowledgeable about local issues) should be the forum for      resolution of local issues.       An important point that needs to be explicated to Congress      is the procedural problems associated with the FCC resolving      local issues in Washington. First is the obvious problem.      Most citizens, community groups and cities do not have the      financial wherewithal to litigate before a federal agency      located in Washington. Even if an action of the FCC is      reviewed by the Courts, that also would occur in the      Washington D.C. Circuit miles away. Section 254(d) does      contain due process language and such a provision may meet      the technical requirements of the U.S. Constitution. However,      the provision ``If, after notice and an opportunity for      public comments * * *'' provides little solace for local      governments and its citizens. The FCC all too often provides      too little time to respond to its rules and rulemaking      proceedings for anyone other than the expensive FCC Bar. It      is impractical for local people to respond in a timely      fashion and FCC preemption consequently precludes the voice      of those most effected.       Second, as a general rule the courts pay great difference      to administrative agencies that are created for specific      purposes.      There is no argument with that proposition because of the      proven expertise of federal agencies in matters properly      within their purview. However, a serious problem is      created when a federal administrative agency is given      power over issues where it has little expertise, such as      the management of local rights-of-way. This is largely so      because of the legal standards for review of      administrative decisions. Generally, a decision will stand      unless the agency has abused its discretion or has      exceeded its authority.       Again, for matters properly within an agency's purview      there is no quarrel. However, the sweeping review powers that      Section 254(d) places in the FCC would in essence permit the      FCC to preempt any statute, regulation, or legal requirement      that it believes is inconsistent with the Section 254(a) of      the Act. This awesome power clearly belongs with the Courts      and not distant administrative staffers. As written, it will      be extremely difficult for a court to find that the FCC has      exceeded its authority. Consequently, with regard to this      standard its decisions may in effect be unreviewable.       Equally troublesome is the abuse of discretion standard      applied to federal agency actions. Practitioners in      administrative law know all too well that the courts will      uphold administrative decisions the vast majority of the      time. A reversal occurs only when there is a clear abuse of      discretion, a condition infrequently found by the Courts.       The bottom line becomes very clear to local governments,      such as Los Angeles, and its citizens. Control regarding      telecommunications and zoning issues will be exercised by      federal officials three thousand miles away. Individuals who      know little or nothing about local interests. the important      everyday decisions that should be made by local officials and      that should be reviewable by local [[Page S8172]] courts,      will be made by faceless names in Washington.       In addition, because if the procedural structure of the      FCC, the normal right to cross-examine witnesses and their      testimony is not present. The right to comment and reply to      another interested party's comments theorically permits the      FCC to make a fair and impartial judgment. However, the      comments are not under oath and the testimony that is filed      under penalty of perjury is never is reality tested for truth      and accuracy. The practical effect is that anybody may say      anything they wish with impunity. The decisionmakers,      therefore, may be misled into believing erroneous ``facts''.      This view is not intended to suggest that the courts are the      answer for all issues. There exist some practical problems      with the courts; they may be too slow and they may lack      the technical expertise. However, Section 254(d) appears to      effectively eliminate the courts because of the absence of      any real or effective review of FCC decisions. Senate Bill      652 must be amended to leave local issues to local      government and thereby permit local citizens, local      governments and local courts to be active participants in      the resolution of local issues.       Finally, the industry has clearly captured the decision      making of officials at the FCC. In recent years the voice of      local governments and its citizens have been routinely      rejected by the FCC and the industry appears to have a      lopsided influence.       We recommend that Section 254(d) be eliminated in its      entirety. If that is accomplished, violations of S. 652 will      be decided in the forum properly equipped to do so--the local      Federal Courts.       As an additional note, we wish to comment that section (a)      of S. 652 also represents a serious and significant invasion      of local government authority over local interests. Most any      action taken by local government in this area can be      construed as having ``the effect of prohibiting'' an entity      from providing telecommunications services. Surely more      precise wording can be developed which would not so      significantly erode the power of local government over local      matters. Please advise if you would like further comment      regarding this section.       If I can be of further assistance, please do not hesitate      to call on me.           Very truly yours,                                                  Edward J. Perez,     Assistant City Attorney.                                                                    ____                                          Office of City Attorney,                             City and County of San Francisco,                                                    June 12, 1995.     Re Telecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am writing to commend you for      sponsoring an amendment to the telecommunications bill to      preserve local control over the public rights of way. It is      critical to local governments that subsection (d) of proposed      47 U.S.C. Section 254, which would authorize the FCC to      preempt state and local authority, be deleted from the bill.       In San Francisco, as in other cities, we welcome the      prospect of new telecommunications providers making expanded      services available on a competitive basis. However,      deregulation only increases the importance of local control      over our streets because it brings many new companies seeking      to install facilities in our streets.       City laws now require all street excavators--including      telecommunications providers--to comply with      nondiscriminatory local laws designed to preserve the public      health and safety and minimize the costs to the public of      repeated street excavation. Throughout the country, such      local laws are tailored to the specific characteristics of      each local community, including local geography, density of      development and the age of public streets and facilities. The      language of subsection (d) would severely undermine local      government ability to apply such locally tailored      requirements on a uniform basis.       Whenever application of routine local requirements      interferes with the schedule or convenience of a      telecommunications supplier, subsection (d) would authorize      the company to seek FCC preemption. To identify just a few      examples, my colleague city attorneys and I will have to send      an attorney off to Washington every time a telecommunications      company challenges our authority to:       (1) Regulate the time or location of excavation to preserve      effective traffic flow, prevent hazardous road conditions, or      minimize noise impacts;       (2) Require a company to relocate its facilities to      accommodate a public improvement project, like the      installation, repair or replacement of water, sewer or public      transportation facilities;       (3) Require a company to place facilities in joint trenches      owned by the City or another utility company in order to      avoid repeated excavation of heavily traveled streets;       (4) Require a company to place its facilities underground,      rather than overhead, consistent with the requirements      imposed on other utility companies;       (5) Require a company to pay fees prior to installing any      facilities to cover the costs of reviewing plans and      inspecting excavation work;       (6) Require a company to pay fees to recover an appropriate      share of the increased street repair and paving costs that      result from repeated excavation;       (7) Require a company to use particular kinds of excavation      equipment or techniques suited to local circumstances to      minimize the risk of major public health and safety hazards;       (8) Enforce local zoning regulations; and       (9) Require a company to indemnify the City against any      claims of injury arising from the company's excavation.       All of the requirements described above are routinely      imposed by local governments in exercise of our      responsibility to manage the public rights of way. Granting      special favors to telecommunications suppliers, compared for      example to other utility companies, will undermine the      uniformity of local law and could dramatically increase the      costs to local taxpayers of maintaining public streets.       In these times, when the federal government is asking state      and local governments to take on many additional duties, the      FCC should not be empowered to interfere in this area of      classic local authority. This is especially true because, for      many cities, the FCC is a remote, costly and burdensome arena      in which to resolve disputes. The courts are well-suited to      resolve any disputes that may arise from the ``Removal of      Barriers to Entry'' language of Section 254 without placing      heavy burdens on local governments.       I appreciate the leadership you have shown on this      difficult issue. Please let me know if I can offer any      further assistance with your efforts on behalf of cities.           Very truly yours,                                                  Louise H. Renne,                                                    City Attorney.
