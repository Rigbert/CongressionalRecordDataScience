 President, this amendment would extend to the judicial branch certain procurement authorities that are parallel with the authorities that have already been granted to the executive branch and would allow the judiciary to achieve certain cost efficiencies that I think we all want.  This amendment has been cleared by the Judiciary Committee with the sunset provision that limits the authority to 5 years.  I encourage an aye vote from all of our colleagues.  I thank the Chair.
