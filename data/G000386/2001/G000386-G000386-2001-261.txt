 President, this amendment costs billions, and Senator Levin plans to pay for it by slashing any rate relief at the top rate. He proposes no estate tax and no capital gains tax on estates, and he pays for it with a denial of any tax break at all to the top rate.  This simply is not fair. This amendment will require a tax increase of billions of dollars, according to the Joint Tax Committee. It will increase taxes tens of thousands on small businessowners, and these folks throughout the country are the ones who create the jobs.  I urge everyone to vote against this amendment. Once again, I raise the point that this is probably the second, third, or fourth time we have voted on similar amendments. At some time, we ought to say enough is enough. I think now is time to say enough is enough.  I ask for the yeas and nays.
