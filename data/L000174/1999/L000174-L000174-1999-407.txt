President, while we talk about the actions in the other body, it is fascinating to me what has happened in the dark of night. The members of the other body aren't controlling their destiny; it apparently was controlled by a powerful lobby in this country. For a while, the same thing happened in the U.S. Senate. I asked the question on the floor of the Senate: ``Who will run the Senate, the U.S. Senators or the powerful gun lobby?'' Finally, by the slimmest of margins, they answered the question and said that the U.S. Senate will represent the people of America.  I have watched how posturing and symbolism sometimes wins out over substance. Members of the other body are all sworn to uphold the Constitution of the United States. They have taken the same oath that I and every Member of the Senate have taken. They flew in the face of the Constitution, a Supreme Court decision outlined in the Constitution, and said that we, the Members of the Congress, will say the 10 commandments shall be or may be put on schoolhouse walls.  Why did the House of Representatives do this and turn against the Constitution that they are sworn to uphold? Why? So that the students seeing it would be inspired to uphold the law. That's fascinating. We say that the other body will--the House of Representatives--will turn its back on the Constitution, and in so doing will encourage children who should look to them for leadership to uphold the laws of this country. It is an example that I cannot fathom. This is what they ought to do--work harder and make it possible for the parents of these children to spend more time with them, make it possible to have an educational system that can help teach the difference between right and wrong. Perhaps, if they are going to talk about the 10 commandments, they should remind the gun lobby of the fifth commandment: Thou shalt not kill.                          ____________________
