 President, last night the President took an important symbolic step in accepting the resignation of acting IRS Commissioner Miller. I had called for this resignation on Monday, when we learned Mr. Miller signed his name to one, if not more, letters that we now know couldn't possibly have been truthful--couldn't possibly have been truthful. But let us be clear: This symbolic step was just that, symbolic.  What Americans want right now is answers about what happened at the IRS, why it wasn't disclosed earlier, who is ultimately accountable for this behavior, and assurances this kind of thing isn't going to go on at the IRS or anywhere else in the Federal Government because the allegations of ideological targeting only continue to multiply. This is continuing to multiply.  This morning I would like to focus on just one of those incidents. It is the case of a group called the National Organization for Marriage. Last May Senator Hatch, the top Republican on the Finance Committee, sent a letter to the IRS inquiring about reports that someone--someone--at the IRS had leaked confidential donor information from NOM--the National Organization for Marriage--to an advocacy group whose political goals were in direct conflict with its own.  NOM has since released documents suggesting that this information came from one source--from within the IRS itself.  All this took place, by the way, in the middle of a national political campaign. Significantly, one of the NOM donors whose name was leaked was none other than Mitt Romney.  And what about the group it was leaked to?  It was headed by a guy who was named a national co-chair of the Obama campaign, and who published the confidential donor information on the website of the organization he ran, an organization opposed to the goals of NOM.  So here is another situation that, at the very least, clearly merits investigation.
