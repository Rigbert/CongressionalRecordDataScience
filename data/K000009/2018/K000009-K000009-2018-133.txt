Don't have a budget framework; can't make decisions; don't consult with our side. Why should we be in a helpful mood?  We were always told Republicans are stern taskmasters. Not only have they failed to pass a budget, now they have added a trillion more dollars to the deficit and the long-term debt because they wanted to give tax giveaways to all their donors.  I urge my colleagues to oppose this sinking effort and demand action for a final, full-year funding plan. That is what is responsible. That is essential, and that is what the American people expect.
