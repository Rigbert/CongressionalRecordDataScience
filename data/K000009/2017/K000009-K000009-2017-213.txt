. entry of certain refugees and travelers who were cleared and properly vetted. The arbitrary and discriminatory nature of his order is odd in that he only identified seven countries to be included.  One must ask: Why were other nations excluded? Yes, excluded from the executive order are several Middle Eastern, African, and other nations where The Trump Organization has business interests, including Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Azerbaijan, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia, where the majority of 9/11 terrorists originated.  We know Mr. Trump has failed to divest from his company, as ethics experts have duly noted. Every American should wonder whether he designed this executive order with his own business interests, at least, partly in mind. This is the purpose of divestiture, to eliminate any possible question of doubt or possible mal intent.  Without divesting from management and ownership, President Trump's circumstance threatens the basic tenet of the rule of law that the government and all of its actors will discharge duties in the best interest of the American people, not their self-interest or the interests of their cronies or the interest of their brand.                          ____________________
