 Chairman, the second amendment would question and challenge what the committee has done in requiring that the States provide a 25 percent match.  The bottom line here in terms of the weatherization program is that it is cost-effective. It is environmentally sound. What sense does it make to have low-income people put money into their heating bills, into their electric bills, and see the energy go right out the door?  So what the weatherization program has done, which has been very successful, is allow lower-income homes all over the United States of America to have decent insulation, storm windows, decent roofing to retain the heat or to keep their homes cool.  So this is a sensible program. It is a program that has worked. What we are asking in this particular amendment is to restore the funding that has been cut, to raise the funding by $13 million, and to allow us to have the level funding that we had from last year and the funding that the Senate has provided.  This is not as much as the President has asked for, but, at the very least, we should level fund this very important program, which is very important to so many lower-income families throughout the United States.
