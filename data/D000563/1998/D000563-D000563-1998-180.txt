President, I am going to yield a minute to my colleague and cosponsor, Senator Chafee of Rhode Island. I urge my colleagues to understand that 15 States have enacted these laws to protect children. We all read about these horrible situations in Jonesboro, in Springfield, in Pearl, MS. Let us not just lament this situation, let us do something about it.  Gun owners understand their responsibility. That is why the NRA supported this law in its enactment in five different States. We can do this tonight to save children's lives.  I yield my remaining time to my colleague from Rhode Island.
