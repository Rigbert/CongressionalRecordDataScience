Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to southern California and higher education are exceptional. The University of California has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Chancellor Timothy P. White is one of these individuals. After four years of service to the University of California, Riverside (UCR), he will be leaving the University of California to take a new post as Chancellor of the California State University system.  Chancellor White was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina. He later immigrated to northern California, and is a first-generation college student who has matriculated within every college system in California. After beginning at Diablo Valley Community College, he earned a Bachelor's Degree from Fresno State University, a Master's from Cal State Hayward (East Bay), and a Ph.D. in Exercise Physiology at the University of California, Berkeley. He previously held positions as Professor and Chair of the Department of Human Biodynamics at UC Berkeley, and as Professor and Chair of the Department of Movement Science and research scientist in the Institute of Gerontology at the University of Michigan. White had previously served as Dean, Provost, and Executive Vice President at Oregon State University, and came to UCR from the University of Idaho, where he had been President since August 2004. There he established a strategic direction to further the university's role as the state's land-grant and flagship research university. He is internationally recognized for his work in muscle plasticity, injury, and aging.  One of the many accomplishments during Chancellor White's tenure at UCR was the University's successful receipt of ``preliminary accreditation'' from the Liaison Committee on Medical Education, the national accrediting body for educational programs leading to the M.D. degree in U.S. and Canadian medical schools. This was UCR's second attempt to gain accreditation for an independent, four-year medical school. This momentous achievement was made possible due to the tremendous efforts of Chancellor White and the future Dean of the Medical School, Dr. G. Richard Olds, in partnership with local, state and federal officials, as well as community and business leaders. UCR will be able to recruit students for the charter class of 50 medical students, enrolling in August 2013.  UCR has also gained national and international recognition for excellence in research, teaching and service under Chancellor White's tenure. UCR is ranked among the top 200 campuses around the globe in both the Shanghai Jiao Tong Academic Ranking of World Universities and the Times Higher Education rankings, and was recognized for its exceptional commitment to public service by Washington Monthly. Other accomplishments include the creation of a strategic plan to guide the institution, the announcement of the new School of Public Policy, growth of campus enrollment to almost 21,000 students, and new levels of achievement and accomplishment by faculty and students alike. In addition, under Chancellor White's guidance, Riverside was selected to host the new UCPath project, which will consolidate basic human resources operations across the entire UC system as a permanent cost-saving measure.  I have come to know Chancellor White well through many years working together on a variety of educational issues in Riverside. I can personally attest to the Chancellor's incredible work-ethic, professionalism, and positive attitude. He is married to Dr. Karen N. White, who is an Associate of the Chancellor and an assistant clinical Professor for the UCR Biomedical Sciences Program. She has been a great advocate on behalf of our veterans through the Operation Education Scholarship Program, which she founded and established on the UCR campus in 2010. They have four sons.  In light of all Chancellor White has done for the University of California and the Inland Empire, it is only fitting that he be honored as he continues his service to higher education. Chancellor White's tireless passion for public service and higher education has contributed immensely to the betterment of our region and the state and I am proud to call him a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for his service and salute him as he moves onto the next phase of his life.                          ____________________
