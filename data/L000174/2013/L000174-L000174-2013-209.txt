President, as we look forward to bringing our debate on comprehensive immigration reform to a close, I especially want to recognize the work of one Senator who made a major contribution to this legislation. Provisions contained in this legislation will rewrite our entire agricultural visa program, and they will do so for the better. For the first time, America's dairy farmers will have access to temporary foreign workers, and the population of undocumented farm workers will have the chance to come out of the shadows and into the lawful immigration system, where they will have rights and the protection of the law. I am grateful for the work she has done, and I am proud to support her important contributions to this legislation.  The work of the senior Senator from California on this legislation should be recognized and commended. She worked long and hard to bring agricultural workers and employers together to find consensus.  She spent many hours keeping these negotiations going, and she did not give up until a fair agreement was reached. And just this week I know that Senator Feinstein stood up for farmers in the Northeastern part of the United States and resisted last-minute efforts related to this bill to create a divide between farmers in different parts of the country. For this, I thank her.  Yesterday, the Washington Post published an article about Senator Feinstein's distinguished service in the Senate, her leadership, her incredible work ethic, and her tenacity. I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, June 25, 2013]  Feinstein, NSA's Top Congressional Defender, Has Built Respect Over                            Decades of Service                            (By Emily Heil)       She stands before television cameras just hours after the      news breaks that the U.S. government has been conducting a      massive survillance program, compiling a database of      Americans' phone records and monitoring foreign terrorism      suspects' Internet traffic.       Her hands form fists.       ``It's called protecting America,'' says Dianne Feinstein.       A five-term California Democrat who chairs the Senate      intelligence committee, Feinstein hardly needs to flex her      muscles these days to command deference. On Sunday talk shows      and from podiums around the Capitol, she's playing the role      of chief congressional defender of the surveillance program      to skeptical colleagues and critics who say it's Big Brother      run amok. She is also one of the most senior members of the      powerful Judiciary and Appropriations panels.       Just as she is playing such high-profile roles, Feinstein,      who turned 80 on Saturday, is blazing a new political trail      as a symbol--an unwilling one--of the changing workplace.       ``It's a non-role as far as I'm concerned,'' Feinstein      says. ``I've always had the belief that age is just      chronology. I know people who are 50 who are older than I      am.''       With the death of Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg (D-N.J.) this      month, Feinstein became the Senate's oldest member, a      distinction never before held by a woman. In fact, there's      only been one other female senator over 80: Rebecca L.      Felton, an 87-year-old, lace-collared white-supremacist      suffragette who was appointed to a vacant seat from Georgia      and served for less than two months in 1922.       Feinstein's age is in most ways incidental to her success;      in others, it's key. She's benefiting from the privileges      that seniority brings in the Senate and from a work ethic      forged in an era where women had to work twice as hard as      their male counterparts to succeed.       There are now a record 20 female senators, many of whom      have taken on high-ranking roles such as chairmanships of key      committees that can help ensure long political life spans.      They may soon be as likely as men to grow old in elected      office--or in any office.       Women over 60 make up the fastest-growing segment of the      workforce, notes Elizabeth Fideler, a fellow at the Sloan      Center on Aging and Work at Boston College and the author of      ``Women Still at Work: Professionals Over 60 and on the      Job.'' And the sight of older woman at the office--even when      that office is the Capitol--is becoming more familiar.      ``Obviously, politics is a bit harsher an arena, but people      are willing to accept an older person so long as they remain      effective,'' she says.       Age is a sensitive topic for anyone. For politicians, even      more so. When Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.) at 72 launched his      presidential campaign in 1995, Time magazine's cover asked,      ``Is Dole Too Old for the Job?'' And recall Sen. John      McCain's (R-Ariz.) anger at a question about his age during      the 2008 presidential campaign. (McCain was 70, and called      the questioner a ``little jerk.'')       If the politician in question happens to be a woman, she's      even more likely to get The Question or be the target of      late-night vitriol.       In 2007, at the age of 67, Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) became      speaker of the House--the highest-ranking woman in the      history of the republic--and a feast for comedians' Botox      jokes.       ``Nancy Pelosi said today we've waited 200 years for      this,'' Jay Leno cracked after Pelosi was sworn in. ``Two      hundred years? How many face-lifts has this woman had?''       Former congresswoman Pat Schroeder (D-Colo.) predicts that      even as women remain in office into old age, the public will      never tolerate ``a female Strom Thurmond,'' a reference to      the late South Carolina Republican senator who left office at      the age of 100, his final years spent with staffers and      colleagues overlooking (and compensating for) his diminished      mental and physical powers.       ``The public would turn on her,'' Schroeder says. ``Not      like they did with Strom, who everyone thought was funny--     this kind of character.''       Tall and unstooped, Feinstein is often seen striding down      the Capitol's marble halls.       Even her political adversaries say she remains more engaged      in the minutiae of her job than many of her younger      counterparts.       ``I always think if I'm half as prepared and energetic as      Senator Feinstein, I'm doing okay,'' says Sen. Claire      McCaskill. The Missouri Democrat calls Feinstein ``the ideal      of what a senator should be.''       ``Role model'' is the one part of her new status that      Feinstein embraces. ``That is the biggest compliment,'' she      says.       Former secretary of state Madeleine Albright says the      scrutiny that female politicians will draw in their older      years will be just a continuation of what they have faced at      other points in their careers. ``They'll talk about      [Feinstein's] hair--but that's what happens now anyway,'' she      says.       It did, at least, early in Feinstein's career, when media      reports swooned over her looks and her impeccable ensembles.      ``Charm Is Only Half Her Story,'' was the headline of a Time      magazine 1990 story, which described her as ``a casting      director's idea of a Bryn Mawr president who must be bodily      restrained from adding gloves--or perhaps even a pillbox      hat--to her already ultra-conservative banker-blue suits and      fitted red blazers and pearls.''       Ask friends and colleagues to describe Feinstein and      something surprising happens.       ``She does her homework,'' says former senator Olympia      Snowe (R-Maine).       ``She does her homework,'' says Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-     Ga.), the vice chairman of the intelligence committee.       ``She just does her homework,'' says Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-     Calif.)       At home, as in the office, Feinstein works constantly. That      includes spending her days off poring over thick briefing      books and, always, the ``weeklies,'' a stack of the memos she      requires every member of her staff to submit each Friday.       In the memo, each employee--from top policy advisers to      mailroom clerks--describes what he or she has done that week:      meetings they attended, people they met with, legislation      they worked on, or what kind of letters have been coming in      from constituents. Feinstein scours them, and then asks      pointed questions at mandatory Monday-morning staff meetings      in her Washington office.       This interrogative style has led some former staffers to      grouse that she is a tough boss, prone to calling out      underlings, even in group settings where such queries can      come off as insults. Mark Kadesh, a lobbyist who was her      longtime chief of staff, says that the rigors of working for      her weren't for everyone. ``The thing is that she's no more      demanding of herself than she is of her staff,'' he says.      ``If you couldn't keep up, it was tough. If you accepted that      challenge, it was a great experience.''       Yet colleagues--even Republicans--find her approachable.      ``You knew that she always came to her conclusions based on      real knowledge and understanding, not in a partisan way,''      Snowe says.       Chambliss credits her with helping to smooth over the once-     strained relationship between the Senate and House      intelligence committees. The bipartisan leaders now meet      regularly to talk about how to speak with one voice on tricky      issues--a change from the past. ``We couldn't afford that--     the world has become too dangerous a place on intelligence      issues,'' he says.       Feinstein's always-be-prepared ethos seems, in part, a      holdover from an earlier time. When she first entered public      office as a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors      in 1969, few women held elected offices. Those who did faced      far more scrutiny than their male counterparts.       Feinstein recalls being the top vote-getter in her first      election to the board, which by law, meant she would be its      president. But some, citing her inexperience, called on her      to cede that position to the second-place man. She politely      declined. Her ascent from supervisor to mayor was accompanied      by tests. ``You would get pressed,'' she says. ``And so you      learn to know your stuff.''       To this day, Feinstein enters no forum--be it a hearing      with top military brass or a one-on-one with a low-level      staffer--without excruciatingly detailed preparation.       ``On the NSA issue, none of the members had gone to these      briefings, and yet they're all talking about them--whereas if      Dianne hadn't gone to them, known everything about them,      she'd have the grace not to say something,'' Schroeder says.      ``My jaw always drops when I see someone who'd rather be at      the gym or running to the airport who wants to stand up and      criticize something they don't know anything about.''       While she's surely come a long way from those board      meetings in San Francisco, the tests still come.       In March, Feinstein had a YouTube-able moment when she      spoke before the Senate Judiciary Committee about her      proposal to ban assault weapons. Sen. Ted Cruz, a Republican      freshman from Texas and a tea party favorite, prefaced a      question to her with a discourse on the Constitution, in      which he informed Feinstein (who has served on Judiciary for      20 years and was the panel's first female member), that the      Second Amendment gives people the right to bear arms.       ``I am not a sixth grader,'' she replied, calmly, but with      a rare edge to her voice that indicated that she was just a      bit peeved with the gentleman from Texas. ``It's fine you      want to lecture me on the Constitution. I appreciate it. Just      know I've been here for a long time.''       And may be longer still. Feinstein, who won reelection in      2012, will be 85 when her term ends. Will she run again?      ``Ask me in three years,'' she says.
