 President, polling consistently shows that lowering the cost of prescription drugs is a top priority for Americans. That is why I hope we can act on this pressing issue in the coming months. A failure to act would be remembered by Americans.  This week, the Democratic House is poised to pass a bill. There are many problems with that legislation, and it doesn't stand a chance of passage in the Senate. Thankfully, we have bipartisan legislation in the House-titled ``Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Act'' that President Trump supports and has a clear path to being signed into law. We need the full Senate to act on this legislation. Republicans should not want to be the party that failed to act.                          ____________________
