Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the late John Patrick Collins, best known simply as Pat. A prolific businessman with an insatiable appetite for public service and an insurmountable sense of humility, Pat Collins was an individual who touched the lives of many and made a true difference in his community.  Pat entered the automotive sales industry in the early sixties, and became the general manager of a dealership before the age of 30. His ambitions knew no horizons. He eventually bought, helped turn around, and prospered from a failing dealership in northern Virginia. With those profits, he was often found working behind the scenes, donating resources to several organizations, often anonymously, to causes which he felt were important.  Pat's early life was impacted by living in a large, close-knit family of nine children where everyone looked out for one another, especially his brother Brian who was born with Down Syndrome. From this life experience, Pat became an outspoken advocate of the mentally impaired and fought to assure their equal rights. When it was discovered that a local facility was neglecting patient care, Pat devoted his time and energy to help bring about changes to remedy conditions for current and future patients. He was constantly speaking out for those who could not speak out for themselves.  Those who knew Pat best will always remember him as an incredibly bright man whose intellect was surpassed only by his generosity. Pat's departure leaves a significant void in the community where he was well known for his uncanny ability to cut directly to the heart of a matter and craft a commonsense solution. Pat Collins played an important role in the lives of many individuals who relied greatly on his counsel, advice, and mentoring to assist in running businesses, operating community projects, or putting together deals and programs to improve a community. As a philanthropist, Pat generously gave to several organizations, including Gonzaga College High School, St. Mary's Ryken High School, Calvert Hospice, and the Calvert County Chapter of the American Cancer Society.  Pat Collins is survived by his wife Ann; three children, John R., Daniel E. Collins, and Mary Mulford, all of St. Leonard; two sisters, Margaret Mary O'Brien of Rockville and Sheila Cotter of Annapolis; three brothers, Paul of Ocean City, Edward of Silver Spring, and Terence of Arnold; and three granddaughters.  Mr. Speaker, I was always impressed by Pat's energy and ability to get things done during his lifetime. He will be missed by many. Fortunately for us, his contributions of his time, energy, and money will benefit the entiresouthern Maryland community for decades to come. Pat Collins was a giant who was successful in life, but who never forgot his roots and always gave back to his community. I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring this great American who leaves behind a loving family and many admirers who will miss him greatly.                          ____________________
