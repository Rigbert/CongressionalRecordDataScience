Speaker, it is always a pleasure to join the gentlewoman from Houston, Texas (Ms. Jackson-Lee), and commend her highly for the forum that will be held in Houston on Iraq and should America go to war. As always she is in the forefront of the leadership in this institution and in our country.  Mr. Speaker, I just wanted to follow up on something that the gentlewoman had stated regarding reasons of war and to point out to those who are listening that there is in this post-Cold War world that there is a shifting of relationships, and nations are trying to find their way forward with new alliances; and the United States in that context has to be careful in order to not be perceived as, one, a Nation that would commit naked aggression. That is something the United States fought for the entirety of the 20th century. Rather, a Nation that always engages for justified wars, justifiable purposes. And there is a distinction, and we should not abrogate our heritage. It is what has gained us the stature that we do have internally and externally.  Mr. Speaker, I also wanted to follow on something the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Kucinich) talked about when we were discussing the internal state of Iraq, their economy and their military. I think it is important to put on the record that two-thirds of Saddam Hussein's forces were leveled in the Persian Gulf War. In other words, the force is one-third of what it used to be.  The American people should not have the illusion that over the 10 years during which we and other countries have maintained the no-fly zone over Iraq that there has not been constant bombing and constant economic sanctions that have made life difficult for people inside that country, and, indeed, children dying, not enough food, extraordinary poverty among so many people. The conditions inside Iraq are abysmal.  In addition to that, Iraq essentially is an oil state. And as I mentioned earlier, it has the largest reserves outside of Saudi Arabia. Prior to the Persian Gulf War, Iraq had been pumping 3.5 million barrels a day. Today she pumps but 1.7 million barrels a day. That says that not only are the sanctions hurting her, but the lack of production is hurting her as well.  And Iraq does not operate in a vacuum. She operates in a part of the world where not everyone is her friend. And certainly she has had historic rivalries with Iran, and we all know about the invasion of Kuwait. Iraq is a secular nation in that part of the world that also has tried to defend herself from fears relating to relations with surrounding countries. So I think it is important to be realistic about what is going on there.  Therefore, we read in the Wall Street Journal, September 17, Lawrence Lindsey, the President's head of the White House National Economic Council, making the following statement, `` `When there is a regime change in Iraq, you could add 3 million to 5 million barrels of production to world supply each day,' Mr. Lindsey estimated. `The successful prosecution of the war would be good for the U.S. economy.' ''  Mr. Speaker, the entire article is as follows:             [From the Wall Street Journal, Sept. 17, 2002]     Bush Economic Aide Says Cost of Iraq War May Top $100 Billion                             (By Bob Davis)       Washington.--President Bush's chief economic adviser      estimates that the U.S. may have to spend between $100      billion and $200 billion to wage a war in Iraq, but doubts      that the hostilities would push the nation into recession or      a sustained period of inflation.       Lawrence Lindsey, head of the White House's National      Economic Council, projected the ``upper bound'' of war costs      at between 1% and 2% of U.S. gross domestic product. With the      U.S. GDP at about $10 trillion per year, that translates into      a one-time cost of $100 billion to $200 billion. That is      considerably higher than a preliminary, private Pentagon      estimate of about $50 billion.       In an interview in his White House office. Mr. Lindsey      dismissed the economic consequences of such spending, saying      it wouldn't have an appreciable effect on interest rates or      add much to the federal debt, which is already about $3.6      trillion. ``One year'' of additional spending? he said.      ``That's nothing.''       At the same time, he doubted that the additional spending      would give the economy much of a lift. ``Government spending      tends not to be that stimulative,'' he said. ``Building      weapons and expending them isn't the basis of sustained      economic growth.''       Administration officials have been unwilling to talk about      the specific costs of a war, preferring to discuss the      removal of Mr. Hussein in foreign-policy or even moral terms.      Discussing the economics of the war could make it seem as if      the U.S. were going to war over oil. That could sap support      domestically and abroad, especially in the Mideast where      critics suspect the U.S. of wanting to seize Arab oil fields.       Mr. Lindsey, who didn't provide a detailed analysis of the      costs, drew an analogy between the potential war expenditures      with an investment in the removal of a threat to the economy.      ``It's hard for me to see how we have sustained economic      growth in a world where terrorists with weapons of mass      destruction are running around,'' he said. If you weigh the      cost of the war against the removal of a ``huge drag on      global economic growth for a foreseeable time in the future,      there's no comparison.''       Other administration economists say that their main fear is      that an Iraq war could lead to a sustained spike in prices.      The past four recessions have been preceded by the price of      oil jumping to higher than $30 a barrel, according to BCA      Research.com in Montreal. But the White House believes that      removing Iraqi oil from production during a war--which would      likely lead to a short-term rise in prices--would be      insufficient to tip the economy into recession. What is      worrisome, economists say, is if the war widens and another      large Middle East supplier stops selling to the U.S., either      because of an Iraqi attack or out of solidarity with Saddam      Hussein's regime.       Mr. Lindsey said that Mr. Hussein's ouster could actually      ease the oil problem by increasing supplies. Iraqi production      has been constrained somewhat because of its limited      investment and political factors. ``When there is a regime      change in Iraq, you could add three million to five million      barrels of production to world supply'' each day. Mr. Lindsey      estimated. ``The successful prosecution of the war would be      good for the economy.''       Currently, Iraq produces 1.7 million barrels of oil daily,      according to OPEC figures. Before the Gulf War, Iraq produced      around 3.5 million barrels a day.       Mr. Lindsey's cost estimate is higher than the $50 billion      number offered privately by the pentagon in its conversations      with Congress. The difference shows the pitfalls of      predicting the cost of a military conflict when nobody is      sure how difficult or long it will be. Whatever the bottom      line, the war's costs would be significant enough to make it     harder for the Bush administration to climb out of the      budget-deficit hole it faces because of the economic slowdown      and expense of the war on terrorism.       Mr. Lindsey didn't spell out the specifics of the spending      and didn't make clear whether he was including in his      estimate the cost of rebuilding Iraq or installing a new      regime. His estimate is roughly in line with the $58 billion      cost of the gulf War, which equaled about 1 percent of GDP in      1991. During that war, U.S. allies paid $48 billion of the      cost, says William Hoagland, chief Republican staffer of the      Senate Budget Committee.       This time it is far from clear how much of the cost--if      any--America's allies would be willing to bear. Most European      allies, apart form Britain, have been trying to dissuade Mr.      Bush from launching an attack, at least without a United      Nations resolution of approval. But if the U.S. decides to      invade, it may be able to get the allies to pick up some of      the tab if only to help their companies cash in on the bounty      from a post-Saddam Iraq.       Toppling Mr. Hussein could be more expensive than the      Persian Gulf War if the U.S. has to keep a large number of      troops in the country to stabilize it once Mr. Hussein is      removed from power. Despite the Bush administration's      aversion to nation building, Gen. Tommy Franks, commander of      U.S. troops in the Middle East and Central Asia, recently      said that the U.S. troops in Afghanistan likely would remain      for years to come. The same is almost certain to be true in      Iraq. Keeping the peace among Iraq's fractious ethnic groups      almost certainly will require a long-term commitment of U.S.      troops.       During the Gulf War, the U.S. fielded 500,000 troops. A far      smaller force is anticipated in a new attack on Iraq. But the      GOP's Mr. Hoagland said the costs could be higher because of      the expense of a new generation of smart missiles and bombs.      In addition, the nature of the assault this time is expected      to be different. During the Gulf War, U.S. troops bombed from      above and sent tank-led troops in for a lighting sweep      through the Iraqi desert. A new Iraq war could involve      prolonged fighting in Baghdad and other Iraqi cities--even      including house-to-house combat.       The Gulf War started with the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in      August 1990, which prompted a brief recession. The U.S.      started bombing Iraq on Jan. 16, 1991, and called a halt to      the ground offensive at the end of February.       With Iraq's invasion, oil prices spiked and consumer      confidence in the U.S. plunged. But Mr. Lindsey said the      chance of that happening again is ``small.'' U.S. diplomats      have been trying to get assurances from Saudi Arabia, Russia      and other oil-producing states that they would make up for      any lost Iraqi oil production. In addition, Mr. Lindsey said      that the pumping equipment at the nation's Strategic      Petroleum Reserve has been improved so oil is easier to tap,      if necessary. Both the Bush and Clinton administrations, he      said, wanted to ``make sure you can pump oil out quickly.''       On Thursday, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said      he doubted a war would lead to recession because of the      reduced dependence of the U.S. economy on oil. ``I don't      think that . . . the effect of oil as it stands at this      particular stage, is large enough to impact the economy      unless the hostilities are prolonged.'' Mr. Greenspan told      the House Budget Committee. ``If we go through a time frame      such as the Gulf War, it is unlikely to have a significant      impact on us.''       The U.S. economy also has become less dependent on oil than      it was in 1990, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at      Economy.com, an economic consulting group in West Chester,      Pa. A larger percentage of economic activity comes from      services, as compared with energy-intensive manufacturers, he      said. Many of those manufacturers also use more energy-     efficient machinery.  We have to begin to connect the dots here with the President's advisers and with what is really going on, knowing the internals of Iraq, the nations that she relates to, her internal economic situation, and keeping our eye on when the enemy is, who was responsible for the World Trade Center, for the Pentagon and for the disaster over Pennsylvania. It is al Qaeda. They do not have roots in Iraq.  We have persistently asked the administration for any ties that they can see there; and I would just urge, as I know my colleagues are, the American people to distinguish between hearsay and evidence regarding what al Qaeda has done and what Iraq's record might be.  Now, is Iraq a perfect country? I daresay not. It is not my favorite form of government. No repressive state is. But in that part of the world there is not a single democracy or functioning democratic republic. It simply does not exist. This is the challenge for the new generation, to embrace this part of the world in ways that builds more open societies. But, certainly, naked aggression by a superpower with no evidence presented to this Congress is not a way to make friends in that part of the world where, frankly, America needs to make friends.  Mr. Speaker, I would just like to put on the record tonight if there are any officials who may be listening, and I am sure my colleague, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Kucinich), would agree with this, from the government of Iraq. I, as one Member of Congress, and I know some of my colleagues would join me in this, would certainly entertain a request from the government of Iraq from Saddam Hussein to meet with Members of this Congress to negotiate the terms of inspection, respecting the role of the United Nations, having members of the United Nations team join us for that; but to extend an open arm to the people of Iraq as we move into this 21st century, to write a new page in history.  We know we do not have a great deal of trust, but one has to confront one's enemies. One has to be able to talk. Only with that kind of negotiation does one avoid war. Whether it is through third parties first and then we move to that step, as I as one Member of Congress would certainly be open to it. And I think that a number of my colleagues would join me in that effort.
