 1652. A bill to amend the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 to establish a national resource center and clearinghouse to carry out training of State and local law enforcement personnel to more effectively respond to cases involving missing or exploited children, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.  the jimmy ryce law enforcement training center establishment act of                                   1996 Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce a bill to establish the Jimmy Ryce Law Enforcement Training Center for the Recovery of Missing and Exploited Children.  Each year tens of thousands of children are reported missing from their homes. The Department of Justice estimates that 3,000 to 4,000 children are taken coercively by nonfamily members. And the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children gets involved with almost 300 cases a year which involve children abducted by strangers intending harm. Many of these children are never seen again.  This is the most critical factor in a missing child investigation. And too, often, local law enforcement officials lack the experience and the resources to conduct a swift and effective investigation which will maximize the chances for a safe recovery.  The Jimmy Ryce Center, which will be established by this bill, will combine the resources of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children with those the F.B.I.'s National Crime Information Center and Child Abduction and Serial Killer Unit, as well as the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. The Jimmy Ryce Center will be a national training center for law enforcement officials from all over the United States and its programs will address: identifying the elements of a missing and exploited child case investigations; applying research regarding missing and exploited child case investigations and analyzing successful and unsuccessful investigative techniques; and educating about the national resources available to assist local efforts in a missing and exploited child case investigation.  The Jimmy Ryce Center will also make it a priority to provide comprehensive nationwide training for law enforcement regarding report taking and NCIC entry of missing child information. And, the training center will expand current training done by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention and coordinate programs in all 50 States and the District of Columbia.  I am confident the bill will have the support of the Department of Justice. It already has the support of the Fraternal Order of Police, and I ask unanimous consent that the FOP's letter, as well a copy of the bill, be included in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1652       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.       The Congress finds that--       (1) an investigation to find a missing child presents      unique circumstances for law enforcement agencies, including      the need for specialized training and the capability of swift      response to maximize the chances for the safe recovery of the      child;       (2) local law enforcement officials often lack experience      and are unaware of the Federal resources available to assist      in the investigation of cases involving a missing child; and       (3) a national training facility should be established to      assist State and local law enforcement agencies in--       (A) providing comprehensive training in investigations of      cases involving missing or exploited children;       (B) ensuring uniform, consistent, and meaningful use of      reporting systems and processes; and       (C) promoting the use of vital national resources.

Hon. Mitch McConnell,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Hon. Peter Deutsch,     U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, DC.       Gentlemen: On behalf of the 270,000 members of the      Fraternal Order of Police, this is to express our strong      support for your legislation to provide funding and      facilities to train state and local law enforcement officers      in investigative techniques for utilization in missing and      exploited children case.       As a member of the Board of the National Center for Missing      and Exploited Children (NCMEC), I am thoroughly familiar with      the wonderful work of the Center, and with the strong bond      which the NCMEC has forged with state and local officers. The      proposed Jimmy Ryce Law Enforcement Training Center for the      Recovery of Missing Children, which would operate within the      framework of the NCMEC, can only enhance that relationship,      and will make it even more productive.       We thank both of you for your leadership on this issue, and      in the many other areas where both of you have weighed in on      the side of tough yet progressive law enforcement.           Sincerely,                                              Gilbert G. Gallegos,                                       National President.                                 ______      By
