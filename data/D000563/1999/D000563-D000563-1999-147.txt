President, there are several issues that have been debated on the floor this morning, and it is typical of the Senate, which considers myriad issues, to consider some that are quite contrasting. To move from nuclear proliferation to help for soybean growers is about as much a contrast as you could ask for. But it reflects the workload that we face in the Senate, and it reflects the diversity of issues with which we have to deal.  I will speak very briefly to the issue of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty. This nuclear test ban treaty, which may be considered for a vote this afternoon, could be one of the most significant votes ever cast by many Members of the Senate. It appears the vote will be overwhelmingly in favor of the treaty on the Democratic side of the aisle, with a handful of Republican Senators joining us--not enough to enact this treaty into law and to ratify it so that it becomes virtually a law governing the United States. If that occurs, if we defeat this treaty this afternoon--as it appears we are headed to do--it could be one of the single most irresponsible acts ever by the Senate.  Let me give specifics. It was only a few hours ago, in Pakistan, that a military coup took place and replaced the administration of Mr. Sharif. Mr. Sharif had been elected. He was a man with whom we had dealt. He was a person who at least came out of the democratic process. But he was toppled. We have not had that experience in the United States, and I pray we never will. But the military leaders decided they had had enough of Mr. Sharif. They weren't going to wait for an election. They decided to take over. It appears from the press reports that the source of their anger was the fact that Mr. Sharif had not aggressively pursued the war against India, nor had he escalated the nuclear testing that took place just a few months ago.  You may remember, on the Fourth of July, the President of the United States of America stayed in the White House for a special meeting--a rare meeting on a very important national holiday with Mr. Sharif of Pakistan, where he laid down the rule to him that we didn't want to see the Pakistani army engaged in the militia tactics against the Indians in an escalated fight over their territory in Kashmir. He produced, I am told, satellite imagery that verified that the Pakistanis were involved, and he told Mr. Sharif to stop right then and there. If this escalated, two nascent nuclear powers could see this develop into a conflagration that could consume greater parts of Asia. The President was persuasive. Sharif went home and the tension seemed to decline--until yesterday when the military took over.  Why does that have any significance with our vote on a nuclear test ban treaty? How on God's Earth can the United States of America argue to India and Pakistan to stop this madness of testing nuclear weapons and escalating the struggle when we reject a treaty that would end nuclear testing once and for all? It is really talking out of both sides of your mouth.  This nuclear test ban treaty had been supported originally by Presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy, Democratic and Republican Presidents, over the years. It was President George Bush who unilaterally said we will stop nuclear testing in the United States. He did not believe that it compromised our national defense, and he certainly was a Republican.  If you listen to the arguments of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, you would think this is just a cut and dried partisan issue, with Republicans on one side and Democrats on the other. The polling tells us that 82 percent of the American people want us to pass this test ban treaty. They understand full well that if more and more nations around the world acquire nuclear weapons, it doesn't make the United States any safer; it makes the world more dangerous. Leaders in some of these countries, who should not be entrusted with a cap gun, will end up with a nuclear weapon, and we will have to worry whether they have the delivery capability.  Why is a nuclear test an important part of it? You can't take this nuclear concept from a tiny little model on a bench and move it up to a bomb that can destroy millions of people without testing it. If you stop the testing, you stop the progress of these countries. Some say there will be rogue nations that will ignore that, that they don't care if you sign a treaty in the United States; they are going to go ahead and build their weapons.  I don't think any of us would suggest that we can guarantee a nuclear-free world or a nuclear-controlled world by a treaty. But ask yourself a basic question: Are we a safer world if we have a nuclear test ban treaty that puts sensing devices in 350 different locations so we can detect these tests that occur? Are we a safer world if we have a regime in place where one nation can challenge another and say, ``I think you have just engaged in the development of a nuclear weapon you are about to test, and under the terms of the treaty I have a right to send in an international inspection team to answer the question once and for all.''  Why, of course, we are a safer world if those two things occur. They will not occur if the Republicans beat down this treaty today, as they have promised they will. An old friend of mine--now passed away--from the city of Chicago, said, ``When it comes to politics, there is always a good reason and a real reason.''  The so-called good reason for opposing the treaty has to do with this belief that it doesn't cover every nation and every possible test.  The real reason, frankly, that a lot of them are nervous about going against this treaty is the fear that in a week or a month or a few months we will have another member of the nuclear club; in a week or a month or a few months we will have more testing between India and Pakistan; in a few weeks we may see what is happening in Pakistan disintegrating further and then having to worry about whether there will be nuclear weapons used in the process of their confrontation with India.  Those who vote to defeat the treaty will wear that collar, and they will know full well that they missed the signal opportunity for the United States to have the moral leadership to say our policy of no nuclear testing should be the world policy; it makes us safer. It makes the world safer.  Sadly, we have spent virtually no time in having committee hearings necessary for a treaty of this complexity, and a very limited time for floor debate. It is a rush to judgment. I am afraid the judgment has already been made. But ultimately the judgment will be made in November of the year 2000 when the American voters have their voice in this process. Our debates on the floor will be long forgotten. But the voters will have the final voice as to which was the moral, responsible course of action to enact a treaty supported by Presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy, and the Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a treaty that really gives us an opportunity for a safer world, or to turn our backs on it.  I sincerely hope that enough Republicans on that side of the aisle will muster the political courage to join us. The right thing to do is to pass this treaty.                          ____________________
