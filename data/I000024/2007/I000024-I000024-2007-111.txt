President, today, I want to reiterate something I talked about on Monday and maybe elaborate a little bit. I am one of the cosponsors of an amendment that several people will be discussing today, amendment No. 2020--it is primarily offered by my colleague, Senator Coleman, and myself and Senator DeMint and Senator Thune and, I believe, some others also--to prohibit the reimplementation of the Fairness Doctrine.  Over the past few weeks, the Fairness Doctrine has received quite a bit of attention.
