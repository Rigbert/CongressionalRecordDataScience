Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Stokes-Boehlert amendment. These riders are an all-out assault on environmental law. It is not to be considered simply reform, but rather, in toto, these would eviscerate environmental enforcement throughout the United States. It is also an abuse of the legislative process.  In my Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law of the Committee on the Judiciary, we are beginning to consider one of the provisions contained herein, and that is recognizing State environmental audit legislation. We have not proceeded to any conclusion. We have more questions and comments. In fact, the only consistent element we have found in considering this environmental audit language is the opposition, almost a total opposition, of law enforcement officers throughout the United States. The National District Attorneys Association is against it, the attorney generals of New Mexico, Minnesota, California, Massachusetts, Arizona, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Tennessee, the New Jersey State Attorney General, the New York District Attorneys Association, all these law enforcement officials condemn a rider which is included in this legislation. This is not the way to reform environmental laws in the United States. This is the way to destroy environmental laws in the United States.
