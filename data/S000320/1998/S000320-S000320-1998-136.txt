 President, I appreciate the chairman's statement. I have worked with him before. I just think it is very, very important for the American people that we, as Members of the U.S. Senate and House, should be the people who lay taxes, or reduce taxes, according to the Constitution. But that is not what is happening. The Internal Revenue Service is doing it through the back door. We should do things through the front door because that is the American way, and I think it is accountable. I have worked with the distinguished Senator from Nebraska on this for several years and got some of this going at his suggestion.  I yield to the Senator from Nebraska.
