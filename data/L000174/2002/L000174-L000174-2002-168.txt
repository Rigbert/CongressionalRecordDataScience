President, I tell the distinguished majority leader, the only concern I have had about having rollcall votes is, a couple times we have taken a group of these and had voice votes, with seven, eight going through, and the next day my good friends on the other side of the aisle and the White House have had a press release saying we have not had a single judge voted on in weeks in the Senate. I think they only notice it if there is a rollcall vote.  I ask my friend, the majority leader, if we do these 7, am I correct that would mean we will have confirmed 72 judges in less than 13 months?
