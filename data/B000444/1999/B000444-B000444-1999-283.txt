 President, you do not have the authority to send in ground troops without congressional authorization. Since you have said, Mr. President, you have no intention of doing that, why don't you affirmatively send a letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives committing that you will not do that without their authority? He said: I will. And he did. I think we accomplished that.  To now say that we are going to add to that the requirement to cut off funds, that we will cut off funds, is a very direct way of saying: We don't trust you, Mr. President. You gave your word; you put it in writing; you put your signature on it; and we still don't trust you.  I am not prepared to vote for that.
