 President, tomorrow following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of the class action bill. The chairman and ranking member will be here as we resume debate. We expect to begin the amending process tomorrow morning. Rollcall votes are expected during tomorrow's session. No votes are expected prior to the party luncheons.  Several Senators have expressed an interest in offering amendments, and we want to encourage all Senators who have amendments to contact the managers and get about offering them.                          ____________________
