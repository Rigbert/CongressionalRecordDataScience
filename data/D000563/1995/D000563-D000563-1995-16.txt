Take the word of the Consumers Union. I hope you are familiar with this organization. They publish Consumers Report. They are noncommercial, nonpolitical.  Yesterday, they analyzed the Gingrich Republican budget and its impact on working families, particularly when it comes to Medicaid, the program that pays for over half the cost of nursing homes across America.  Mr. Speaker, if you have a member of your family in a nursing home or if you anticipate that possibility, it is a troubling challenge to every family. It costs on average $38,000 a year to keep a person in a nursing home, and the Federal Government picks up the lion's share of that cost so that families will not be decimated and bankrupted by this experience. The Gingrich Republican budget, according to Consumers Union, will force 395,000 long-term care patients off these Medicaid payments for nursing homes.  Now, what will happen to these working families? I wish they had the same sensitivity for working families as they have when they give tax breaks to the wealthy.                          ____________________
