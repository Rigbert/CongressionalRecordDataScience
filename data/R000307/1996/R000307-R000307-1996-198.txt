Speaker, today, I am introducing legislation to restore to the Secretary of Agriculture the optional authority to extend existing Conservation Reserve Program [CRP] contracts. This action is necessitated by a provision contained in the 1997 agricultural appropriations law that rescinded that long-standing authority at a time when the Secretary is attempting to implement a revised CRP that currently does not have final regulations in place.  Contracts covering 24 million acres, or two-thirds of the existing enrolled acres, are scheduled to expire next September and must be considered for re-enrollment before that time. Congress devoted considerable time and resources during the farm bill to insuring the continuation of the CRP with its important conservation and environmental benefits. The administration was tasked with proposing new regulations for the CRP by early June of this year to give farmers sufficient time to understand the revised program and make decisions on their participation.  Unfortunately, USDA's proposed regulations did not appear until mid-September. The proposed changes are so massive and so many factors are still unknown, it is unlikely that farmers will have the final details well into next year. If the proposed changes are contained in the final rules, it is clear that many weeks of intensive work by USDA will be needed to apply the general rules to each individual farmer's land before the producer will know whether he is eligible and whether he wants to make a bid to enter the program.  It was the clear intent of Congress to give the producer the maximum flexibility in making the decision on whether or not to continue his land in the CRP. Farmers cannot sensibly make that decision until all the information is available to them. The slightest delay in USDA's schedule will create chaos on the farm with an arbitrary deadline forcing a decisions for which the producer has insufficient information.  If this situation arises, which in the mind of this Member is a probability rather than a possibility, it is imperative that the Secretary of Agriculture retain the authority to extend existing contracts so that properly thoughtful decisions can be made that will affect farmers and our environment for a decade to come.  By eliminating the limitation on the Secretary's authority contained in this year's agricultural appropriations law, this bill will insure that USDA has the flexibility to implement the Conservation Reserve Program successfully and avoid a train wreck next August.                          ____________________
