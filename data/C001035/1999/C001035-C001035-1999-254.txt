Let me give you a specific example. In 1998, HCFA instituted a new policy for sequential billing. Under this policy, home health agencies are required to submit claims in a sequential order to Medicare. Now, this required a substantial investment in computer software, a lot of process changes on behalf of the home health agencies and the fiscal intermediaries. Moreover, the way the system was set up, if there were subsequent claims for a particular patient, they could not be paid until all previous claims relating to this patient were settled. This caused enormous cash flow problems for home health agencies. They experienced delays as long as 120 days before they could get the payment they were due.  One witness at my hearing testified that her agency was still owed about $20,000 for fiscal '98, and other agencies reported they had to obtain bridge loans, or tap into their credit lines, solely because of this ill-conceived policy.  Now, due to the objections raised by the Senator from Kansas, myself, other Members, and the home health care industry, HCFA finally decided to suspend the policy this past July. But, in the meantime, we have had over a year of turmoil because of this policy, and home health agencies had already spent time, energy, training, and effort to comply with a misguided policy that now is, as you put it, in ``HCFA purgatory.''
