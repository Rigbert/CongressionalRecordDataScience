President, it has been our intention to get as many of the obstacles out of the way and as many amendments here as possible relating to the highway bill. The leader told us he wants to have the highway bill completed by late next week. I think we can do that. If Members have amendments they would like to have considered by the managers, our staff will be available this afternoon and Saturday afternoon from noon until 5 p.m. in Hart-415.  If you have any amendments you would like to work out, I strongly advise you to bring them down today or tomorrow instead of waiting until next week. Again, that will be in Hart, room 415, and anytime today or tomorrow, Saturday, between noon and 5 p.m.  I also note we have been inviting people to come and speak on the bill. No one has come down yet. It is now 11:15. In the event that no one wants to speak on the bill by noon, we will probably shut down.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
