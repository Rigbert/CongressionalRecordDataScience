Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise today to herald the accomplishments of my good friend and community leader, Mr. Edward V. Cox. On June 30 Ed Cox will retire from his position as the county administrator of St. Mary's County, MD. Ed's retirement will mark the end of 22 years of public service to St. Mary's County. As a resident of St. Mary's County, I know that Ed's departure will be a great loss for his colleagues and, most importantly, the citizens who have been well served by his leadership.  As the administrator of St. Mary's County, Ed established an extraordinary record of fairness, decency, and a faithfulness to the interests of all of our residents. During his 22 years of service, Ed has served as the administrator to six different boards of county commissioners. He led St. Mary's County through periods of great turmoil and unprecedented growth. His work in the community has been consistently guided by a commitment to excellence and an unwavering loyalty to the public good.  Ed is an advocate of community participation in government. He worked tirelessly to provide the citizens of our county with access to the decisionmaking process. Time and time again, he has found the means and served as a catalyst for improvement in St. Mary's County.  It is impossible to list all of the programs and initiatives that Ed Cox has championed in his 22 years of service. His work is respected by our entire community and he has brought a level of integrity to public service that is unmatched. Ed Cox will be sadly missed.                          ____________________
