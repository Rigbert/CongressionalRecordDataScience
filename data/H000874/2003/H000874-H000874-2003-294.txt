 Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this substitute and reiterate what the distinguished gentleman from Texas said.                              {time}  1400  Obviously, adversely affecting pending cases, in my opinion, is extraordinarily bad policy and precedent that we should not follow. Have we done it from time to time? We have. Have I opposed it? I have. I think that is not the way we ought to go.  Now, I think that legislation in this area is appropriate. The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sandlin) I think has offered an appropriate substitute. Are there abuses in our system of civil justice specifically regarding class action lawsuits? I want to tell the gentleman that I believe there are, and we need to write legislation that addresses and remedies those problems.  However, the bill offered on the floor today, if not amended, in my opinion, does not do that. Instead, its provisions would apply to pending class actions, making it more difficult for shareholders, retirees, and former employees frankly to hold companies such as Enron, WorldCom and Arthur Andersen accountable for their alleged wrongdoing. We ought not to, because of our desire to protect those cases, therefore not address other corporate citizens who are responsible and who are doing a good job and who want to be ought to be subject, obviously, to suits, but ought to be subject to suits that are legitimate.  The addition of this retroactivity provision is a major change. Let me stress that, Mr. Chairman. This is a major change from the class action bill considered in the last Congress. I do not know who it is in there to protect. I do not know who came forward and said we need protection; it is not a question of reform in the future, but we need protection.  We have seen a few reports of that, from people who want protection. Maybe that is what that retroactivity is for. As matter of fact, invariably in my plus-30 years of service in legislative bodies, when retroactive provisions are included in the bill, invariably it is there to protect somebody. And it is very bad policy. Congress should not be changing the rules that govern this resolution of civil disputes in midstream.  Furthermore, this legislation would give defendants in class actions vast new opportunities to delay cases for 2 years or more and stay discovery during the same period. Again, these rule changes would apply retroactively to pending cases.  H.R. 1115 also would force our Federal courts to handle State class actions, in addition to their large caseload and judicial vacancy rate. Thus, it is not surprising, I tell my colleagues, that both Federal and State judges oppose this measure. In fact, the Federal Judicial Conference, which is headed by Chief Justice Rehnquist, recently wrote a letter in which it ``strongly cautions Congress to uphold principles of federalism and to not increase the workload of the already overburdened Federal courts.''  In sharp contrast to this overreaching GOP bill, Democrats have offered legislation that, among other things, would base attorneys' fees on the amount redeemed by class members rather than the amount of the settlement. I think that is appropriate.  I understand the concerns of corporate leaders when they say the attorneys get all the money, and the aggrieved parties get a piece of paper saying that they may get something prospectively if they buy another product. That is a legitimate concern. This substitute speaks to it.  Our bill would require courts to determine that a class action settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate to the class. That is a protection against specious suits and those who would misuse the system.  This substitute would bar litigants from sealing court records and documents under protective orders unless a court finds that it is necessary to protect a trade or business secret and it is in the public interest.  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this substitute and then support its passage. We need reform. This is the appropriate step for us to take.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore (Mr. Gillmor). The time of the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sandlin) has expired.
