President, first of all, I have so much respect for both the Senator from Arizona and the Senators from Michigan and Virginia. I have to say, I am sure the Senator from Arizona would agree that there is no stronger proponent for a strong national defense than I am. We work hard.  One of the big problems I have is that we need to look at the overall picture. All this talk about base closings is important. I support base closures. I made it very clear that we have time on this. If we do not have base closures until the year 2001, there is no reason to be addressing base closures in this bill.  Certainly--I also respond to the Senator from Arizona--what he referred to was a sense-of-the-Senate portion of this bill. It says, ``Notwithstanding any other provision of the law,'' no action would be taken, and no funds appropriated, and so forth, as you read.  However, if we should authorize another BRAC process, that would have precedence over this and this would not be in effect.  It is my understanding that the Senator from Washington has a request for a couple, 3 minutes and I would like to yield to him, and then I will respond to the rest of the comments that have been made.
