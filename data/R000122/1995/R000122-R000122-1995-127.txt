Speaker, I rise today to submit for the record a letter I have sent to Secretary of State Christopher on behalf of the Hmong refugees in Thailand. Incidents of human rights abuses, forced repatriation, and retaliation upon their return to Laos continue to be reported. The Hmong community in Rhode Island remains very concerned about this situation, and I believe it is time we work to resolve it. I will be certain to submit for the record any response I receive from the State Department on this urgent matter:                                    Congress of the United States,                                     House of Representatives,                                Washington, DC, November 28, 1995.     Secretary Warren Christopher,     Secretary of State, Department of State, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Secretary: I write to express my concern about the      status of Hmong combat veterans and refugees in Thailand.       You may recall that I wrote last year regarding the plight      of the Hmong refugees. At that time, I was assured that      additional resources had been committed to UNHCR to provide      assistance to and monitor the safety of Hmong refugees, and      that the State Department was working with the Thai      government to resolve the question of repatriation to non-     communist third countries. Thus, I have supported efforts to      maintain a fair and responsible U.S. refugee policy that      would prevent further persecution of Hmong refugees.       However, I am distressed that this situation has not yet      been resolved. The Hmong people were our loyal allies and      have been a great asset to our nation. Yet, thousands of      Hmong remain in Thailand in refugee camps and continue to be      persecuted because of their relationship with the U.S. While      I recognize the difficulties in administering a refugee      program, cases of forced repatriation, disappearances, and      human rights abuses continue to be reported.       I would sincerely appreciate an update on the current      status of the Hmong refugees. Specifically, I would like to      know: what progress has been made to resettle the remaining      Hmong combat veterans and refugees in safe, third countries;      what efforts are being made to assist and monitor the safety      and welfare of those refugees who have been voluntarily      repatriated; have all means of forced repatriation ceased;      are there currently immigration slots available for these      refugees to come to the United States; is the Thai government      cooperating with these efforts; and if not, what action will      the State Department take to help the remaining Hmong      refugees and ensure that they are not forcibly repatriated?       This issue is of great importance to the Hmong community in      Rhode Island. Thank you in advance for your attention to this      urgent issue, and I look forward to your response.           Sincerely,                                                        Jack Reed,     Member of Congress.                          ____________________
