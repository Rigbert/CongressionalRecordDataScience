I would like to engage in a brief colloquy with you regarding a provision of great importance to the Alaska Native community. As you and I have previously discussed on numerous occasions, section 646 of the Internal Revenue Code allows Alaska Native Settlement Trusts to provide health, education, and welfare benefits to Alaska Natives, who are generally recognized as among the most economically disadvantaged populations in the United States.  It is my understanding that this provision was not included in the bill before us today because the bill only extends tax benefits that terminate in 2009, and this benefit does not terminate until December 31, 2010. Its omission is not a reflection of your views on the merits of the provision.
