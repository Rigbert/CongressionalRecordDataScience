President, I rise today to discuss an issue of children's rights and human rights: the recruitment and use of child soldiers.  Hundreds of thousands of children in the world today serve as child soldiers, boys and girls alike.  They serve as combatants, porters, human mine detectors and sex slaves.  Their health and lives are endangered and their childhoods are sacrificed.  The bulk of these children are captured, recruited, or sold into service with rebel groups such as the infamous Lord's Resistance Army in Uganda.  But some serve with uniformed armed forces or government-supported paramilitaries or militias.  Even more troubling, children have served as child soldiers for governments that receive U.S. military assistance.  Today, Senator Sam Brownback and I are introducing legislation addressing this issue.  Our bill, the Child Soldiers Prevention Act, will ensure that U.S. taxpayer dollars are not used to support foreign militaries known to recruit or use child soldiers in government armed forces or government-supported militaries.  U.S. military assistance can continue under this bill, but it will be used to remedy the problem by helping countries successfully demobilize their child soldiers and professionalize their forces.  Under the terms of this bill, Foreign Military Assistance and other defense-related aid would be limited if countries are clearly identified in the State Department's Human Rights report as recruiting or using child soldiers.  Military assistance to these countries would be limited to supporting the professionalization of their forces until they eliminate the use of child soldiers.  If years of abuse continue, then U.S. assistance would eventually be eliminated.  In all circumstances, the President would be able to waive these rules if he deems that it is in the national interest.  What do we mean by professionalization?  We mean creating regular militaries which conform to long-standing international norms, such as not using children, respecting human rights, and functioning as professional armies.  This bill can only affect governmental or government sanctioned military and paramilitary organizations.  But that is where we have leverage through our foreign military assistance programs and we will use whatever leverage we have to address this heinous phenomenon.  In the last year, many of us have read the haunting memoir of Ishmael Beah, A LONG WAY GONE: Memoirs of a Boy Soldier.  Beah is all of 26: that might seem too young to write a memoir, but sadly, his youth was stolen from him many years ago.  Beah grew up in war-torn Sierra Leone. He was born in 1980.  Eleven years later, civil war broke out, killing tens of thousands of people and driving millions from their homes.  At the age of twelve, he fled attacking rebels.  Beah's parents and his two brothers were among those killed.  By thirteen, he'd been picked up by the government army, but that was no refuge.  Fleeing the rebels who had killed so many of his friends and family, Beah wound up in a village run by government troops.  He wrote of this moment in his life, ``In the beginning it seemed we had found safety the smiles on people's faces assured us that there was nothing to worry about anymore. All that darkened the mood of the village was the sight of orphaned children. There were over thirty boys between the ages of six and sixteen. I was one of them. Apart from this, there were no indications that our childhood was threatened, much less that we would be robbed of it.''  That was exactly what was happening, though.  In Beah's first battle he watched his eleven-year old tent-mate bleed out before his very eyes.  He writes of this awful day, ``My face, my hands, my shirt and gun were covered with blood. I raised the gun and pulled the trigger, and I killed a man. Suddenly, as if someone wasshooting them inside my brain, all the massacres I had seen since the day I was touched by war began flashing in my head. Every time I stopped shooting to change magazines and saw my two young lifeless friends, I angrily pointed my gun into the swamp and killed more people.''  That was at 13. Thirteen--- an age for junior high soccer games, not for going to war.  Ultimately during his time in the government army, Beah says he killed ``too many people to count.''  In 1998 he fled and in 1999 he was able to come to New York.  Returning to civilization, according to Beah, was actually harder than the act of becoming a child soldier because ``dehumanizing children is a relatively easy task.''  Thank God, Sierra Leone's civil war is over.  But too many children in the world continue to be forced to serve as child soldiers.  Ensuring that countries professionalize their militaries and help their child soldiers make the transition back into civil society is a humanitarian issue but also in the best interest for our own armed forces.  We do not want American soldiers in a position where they have to return fire on children.  Delay in such a moment could cost an American soldier his life, but think also of the psychic costs of having to kill a child in battle.  We want our troops to avoid such a situation and we want to ensure that American taxpayer dollars are used as they should be: for professionalizing the militaries of countries whom we are assisting.  It is not enough for child soldiers simply to be demobilized: U.S.-funded programs assist in the rehabilitation of child soldiers and the reintegration of these young people back into civilian life.  Some of these child veterans of war have witnessed or been forced to do terrible things.  Many of the girls have been victims of rape and may be coming back into civilian life with their own children.  I strongly support programs to provide psychological services, educational and vocational training, and other assistance to these traumatized young people.  I also support efforts to bring to justice those rebel leaders and others who kidnap children for use as child soldiers.  The use of child soldiers represents a basic issue of human rights.  For that reason, next week Senator Coburn, who is the ranking member on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Human Rights and the Law, and I will be holding a Subcommittee hearing on Child Soldiers and the Law.  In this hearing, we will explore the persistent use of child soldiers despite the fact that this practice is widely acknowledged as a war crime.  Is this persistent crime in part a failure of enforcement?  Are reforms needed in U.S. law to criminalize this terrible practice?  How is this issue addressed under our immigration laws?  Expert witnesses from non-governmental and faith-based organizations will speak to these issues in our hearing next Tuesday.  So too will Ishmael Beah, whose words vividly capture the horror of children at war.  I am introducing this bill and our subcommittee is holding this hearing as progressive steps to remedy a terrible and persistent problem.  Here in Washington, on the floor of the Senate, it is hard to imagine the atrocities that children endure every day, as combatants, as sex slaves, and as forced labor for militaries and paramilitaries.  But those atrocities do continue.  At the least we should ensure that U.S. assistance goes to remedy the problem and that it is never used to prolong it.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1175       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Child Soldier Prevention Act      of 2007''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) According to the September 7, 2005, report to the      General Assembly of the United Nations by the Special      Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and      Armed Conflict, ``In the last decade, two million children      have been killed in situations of armed conflict, while six      million children have been permanently disabled or injured.      Over 250,000 children continue to be exploited as child      soldiers and tens of thousands of girls are being subjected      to rape and other forms of sexual violence.''.       (2) According to the Center for Emerging Threats and      Opportunities (CETO), Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory,      ``The Child Soldier Phenomenon has become a post-Cold War      epidemic that has proliferated to every continent with the      exception of Antarctica and Australia.''.       (3) Many of the children currently serving in armed forces      or paramilitaries were forcibly conscripted through      kidnapping or coercion, a form of human trafficking, while      others joined military units due to economic necessity, to      avenge the loss of a family member, or for their own personal      safety.       (4) Some military and militia commanders force child      soldiers to commit gruesome acts of ritual killings or      torture, including acts of violence against other children.       (5) Many female child soldiers face the additional      psychological and physical horrors of rape and sexual abuse,      enslavement for sexual purposes by militia commanders, and      severe social stigma should they return home.       (6) Some military and militia commanders target children      for recruitment because of their psychological immaturity and      vulnerability to manipulation and indoctrination. Children      are often separated from their families in order to foster      dependence on military units and leaders. Consequently, many      of these children suffer from deep trauma and are in need of      psychological counseling and rehabilitation.       (7) Child soldiers are exposed to hazardous conditions and      are at risk of physical injury and disability, psychological      trauma, sexually transmitted diseases, respiratory and skin      infections, and often death.       (8) On May 25, 2000, the United Nations adopted and opened      for signature, ratification, and accession the Optional      Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the      Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict (in this Act      referred to as the ``Optional Protocol''), which establishes      18 as the minimum age for conscription or forced recruitment      and requires states party to ensure that members of their      armed forces under the age of 18 do not take a direct part in      hostilities.       (9) On June 18, 2002, the Senate unanimously approved the      resolution advising and consenting to the ratification of the      Optional Protocol.       (10) On December 23, 2002, the United States presented the      ratified optional protocol to the United Nations.       (11) More than 110 governments worldwide have ratified the      optional protocol, establishing a clear international norm      concerning the use of children in combat.       (12) On December 2, 1999, the United States ratified      International Labour Convention 182, the Convention      concerning the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the      Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour, which      includes the use of child soldiers among the worst forms of      child labor.       (13) On October 7, 2005, the Senate gave its advice and      consent to the ratification of the Protocol to Prevent,      Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women      and Children, Supplementing the United Nations Convention      Against Transnational Organized Crime.       (14) It is in the national security interest of the United      States to reduce the chances that members of the United      States Armed Forces will be forced to encounter children in      combat situations.       (15) Section 502B(a)(3) of the Foreign Assistance Act of      1961 (22 U.S.C. 2304(a)(3)) provides that ``the President is      directed to formulate and conduct international security      assistance programs of the United States in a manner which      will promote and advance human rights and avoid      identification of the United States, through such programs,      with governments which deny to their people internationally      recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms, in      violation of international law or in contravention of the      policy of the United States as expressed in this section or      otherwise''.     SEC. 3. CHILD SOLDIER DEFINED.       In this Act, consistent with the provisions of the Optional      Protocol, the term ``child soldier''--       (1) means--       (A) any person under age 18 who takes a direct part in      hostilities as a member of governmental armed forces;       (B) any person under age 18 who has been compulsorily      recruited into governmental armed forces;       (C) any person under age 16 voluntarily recruited into      governmental armed forces; and       (D) any person under age 18 recruited or used in      hostilities by armed forces distinct from the armed forces of      a state; and       (2) includes any person described in subparagraphs (B),      (C), and (D) of paragraph (1) who is serving in any capacity,      including in     a support role such as a cook, porter, messenger, medic,      guard, or sex slave.     SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS.
