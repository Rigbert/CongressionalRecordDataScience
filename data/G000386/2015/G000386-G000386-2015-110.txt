 Edward ``Ed'' Brown, FACHE, on his election to the American Medical Group Association's Policy Hall of Fame. Ed has a long track record in Iowa and Washington as a leading advocate in health care policy reform. He also served in numerous leadership roles at the American Medical Group Association, chairing its public policy committee for 4 years and serving as chairman of its board.  Mr. Brown has had a distinguished career in health care in Iowa, where he has served for the last 21 years as chief executive officer of the Iowa Clinic, a multispecialty group practice in Des Moines. The Iowa Clinic is the largest physician-owned multispecialty group in central Iowa, with nearly 200 physicians and health care providers practicing in 40 specialties. The clinic serves a population area of 1.1 million, averaging 400,000 patient visits each year.  Ed has a long list of achievements in delivering cutting edge, quality-focused health care to the benefit of Iowans, and his achievements include the Iowa Clinic's adoption of electronic medical records and information technology systems. He holds a bachelor's degree in nursing from the University of Evansville and a master's degree in health administration from Washington University in St. Louis. Also, he is a fellow of the American College of Healthcare Executives, with more than 30 years of experience in executive and senior levels of health care management.  As an advocate for multispecialty medical groups and AMGA, Ed has been a leader in promoting a model of care delivery and an organization that represents some of the Nation's highest quality and most prestigious health care delivery systems. It is wonderful to see someone with such a distinguished health care record in Iowa recognized at the national level as a dedicated leader who is committed to improving health care at such an important time for our Nation's health care delivery system.  Ed's voice has been an invaluable contribution to the health care debate in this country, and I congratulate him on this deserved recognition for his countless achievements in the public policy realm.                           ____________________
