Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 663, I call up the Senate bill (S. 2485) to direct the Secretary of the Interior to provide assistance in planning and constructing a regional heritage center in Calais, Maine, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.  The Clerk read the title of the Senate bill.  The text of S. 2485 is as follows:                                S. 2485       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Saint Croix Island Heritage      Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--       (1) Saint Croix Island is located in the Saint Croix River,      a river that is the boundary between the State of Maine and      Canada;       (2) the Island is the only international historic site in      the National Park System;       (3) in 1604, French nobleman Pierre Dugua Sieur de Mons,      accompanied by a courageous group of adventurers that      included Samuel Champlain, landed on the Island and began the      construction of a settlement;       (4) the French settlement on the Island in 1604 and 1605      was the initial site of the first permanent settlement in the      New World, predating the English settlement of 1607 at      Jamestown, Virginia;       (5) many people view the expedition that settled on the      Island in 1604 as the beginning of the Acadian culture in      North America;       (6) in October, 1998, the National Park Service completed a      general management plan to manage and interpret the Saint      Croix Island International Historic Site;       (7) the plan addresses a variety of management      alternatives, and concludes that the best management strategy      entails developing an interpretive trail and ranger station      at Red Beach, Maine, and a regional heritage center in      downtown Calais, Maine, in cooperation with Federal, State,      and local agencies;       (8) a 1982 memorandum of understanding, signed by the      Department of the Interior and the Canadian Department for      the Environment, outlines a cooperative program to      commemorate the international heritage of the Saint Croix      Island site and specifically to prepare for the 400th      anniversary of the settlement in 2004; and       (9) only 4 years remain before the 400th anniversary of the      settlement at Saint Croix Island, an occasion that should be      appropriately commemorated.       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to direct the      Secretary of the Interior to take all necessary and      appropriate steps to work with Federal, State, and local      agencies, historical societies, and nonprofit organizations      to facilitate the development of a regional heritage center      in downtown Calais, Maine before the 400th anniversary of the      settlement of Saint Croix Island.
