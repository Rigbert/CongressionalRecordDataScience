Speaker, I thank the gentleman; and I understand that the accommodation we are making this week and next week is so that we can hopefully, both of our respective parties, can determine where we are going to go and, as the President suggested at the White House, perhaps come together and try to take such action as we can agree upon be positive for our country. So I appreciate that accommodation for us as for the gentleman's group as well.  My colleague talked about we are going to do the community service block grant reauthorization next week. Will amendments and/or a substitute be allowed to the community service block grant bill?  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman would yield, I would reserve answering that question. I believe there is going to be an announcement by the Committee on Rules following this colloquy, and I think the gentleman will be very pleased with that announcement; but I would reserve that the Committee on Rules ought to make that decision and announcement.
