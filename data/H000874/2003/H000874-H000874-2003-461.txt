Speaker, I thank the distinguished leader for that information.  First, Mr. Leader, I presume we have concluded all of our work this week; is that correct?  Mr. DeLAY. If the gentleman would yield, the gentleman is correct. I failed to say that we have completed the work of the House for the week and will not return until Tuesday.
