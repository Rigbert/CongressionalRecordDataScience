 Why do we have in our bill a refundable tax credit? Basically, because many low-income people in America want to adopt a child and would not have the $5,000 tax liability, and thus would not benefit as much from the Finance Committee proposal. The adoption community supports our version. I hope the Senate will continue to support it.  I yield back the remaining time, if the Senator from Delaware will yield back his time.
