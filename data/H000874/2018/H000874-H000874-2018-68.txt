 Mr. McCARTHY. As we all know, America is a Nation of immigrants. Almost all of our ancestors came from somewhere else in search of a better life in this land of freedom and opportunity, and we want to maintain that.  Mr. Speaker, America is also a Nation of laws. We support immigration, but it also must be legal immigration. We must have the security, especially, along our southern border. As we speak, our men and women at the border are doing their absolute best to maintain both order and decency.  Since 2014, Border Patrol has completed more than 13,000--let me say that again, 13,000--life-saving rescues along the border, including many children. We would be naive to think that there are not certain individuals hoping to enter this country illegally and to do us harm.  Yesterday, when we talked about ICE, one of the elements that came up was the thousands of gang members that they stop. We all know the most vicious gang out there is MS-13. We know it because we know it in our communities. We see the murders. We see the drugs. We know the hundreds of MS-13 members that they have stopped from being a part of our communities. That is why we had that vote.  Simply put, the entire immigration enforcement community deserves our support because they work under very difficult circumstances. I think everybody would agree with that, which is why, if I can be very honest with my friend, I was upset to see many Democrats refuse to stand with the men and women of ICE yesterday.  Why? Six individuals who work for ICE gave the ultimate sacrifice of their life. One was murdered by the Los Zetas cartel.  The gentleman asked if I would bring up a bill. I offered to bring up a Democrat bill, but the author of the bill who put it across the desk and asked people to cosponsor said he would vote against it.  What was most shocking to me is the number of people who voted ``present.'' The gentleman can argue with me all day on things I vote ``yes'' and things I vote ``no'' on. The only time he will ever see my vote up there for ``present'' is a quorum call, because I believe the American public and my constituents expect me to make a decision when I come.  I think it was very clear yesterday. You can make a decision. I know my friend and his beliefs, but I also know his party has a new movement. It is a socialist party, and they are gaining steam. But that new party and that new movement in there, I still believe, would want you to make a decision one place or the other.  Just last year alone, ICE made almost 5,000 gang-related arrests. They seized nearly 1 million pounds of narcotics and opioids.  The gentleman knows, those 2 weeks we spent on this floor dealing with the opioid epidemic, there will be more than 100 Americans who will die today because of opioids, and tomorrow will be the same. That is why we did CARA in the last Congress. That is why we came back with billions of dollars of funding to combat the epidemic. That is why we came back and spent 2 weeks on this floor passing more than 50 bills.                              {time}  1130  But think for one moment. If my friend on the other side, his colleague, was able to abolish ICE, that would be 1 million more pounds of narcotics. And it is more than just opioids. It is fentanyl. A small dose will kill you.  They rescued more than 900 sexually exploited children. They stopped thousands of predators. My friend knows that, too, when we were able to finally stop human trafficking on the internet.  Backpage.com is no longer there because this Congress acted, and they are being prosecuted. Seventy percent of all human trafficking happens online. But do you know what? We can celebrate that that has changed because of this Congress.  Now, Mr. Speaker, we want America to remain a land of opportunity, but demeaning the individuals who keep this country safe and calling to abolish ICE is certainly not the way to do it.  I thank my friend, and I think we have a difference of opinion, and I think a strong difference of opinion, and that is healthy. But sometimes when you have a difference of opinion, it is a ``no'' and a ``yes,'' not just a ``present.'' You might come to the debate, but you ought to participate and you ought to take a stance.
