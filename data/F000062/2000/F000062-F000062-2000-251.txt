 President, I am pleased to offer today, legislation that would provide lawful permanent residence status to Guy Taylor, a Canadian national who was orphaned at age 16. Guy is now 18.  Guy Taylor was born in Canada but spent the first half of his life in the United States attending school and living with his mother. Guy's father died before he was born. In the summer of 1998, his mother died of a drug overdose. This left him without any other family except for his extensive family in Southern California.  Upon his mother's death, Guy's grandmother, Oleta Hansen, flew to Canada to secure her daughter's body and bring her grandchild back to the United States.  The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) allowed Guy to temporarily enter the United States by granting him a one-year humanitarian parole. Once the parole expired, the INS extended for one more year. This is a very rare act on the INS' part.  Initially, Guy had sought to obtain permanent resident status by being declared a dependent of a United States court. However, the Orange County, California Social Services referee declined to name Guy a court dependent because he was considered to be under the guardianship of his grandmother.  Because the INS has declared Guy too old to be a dependent of his grandmother, Guy is unable to obtain permanent residence in the United States. Immigration law prohibits permanent legal residency to minor children under the age of twenty-one without their parents.  Guy's dream is to join the United States Army. Although Guy's Army recruiter said he has successfully tested and is qualified for enlistment, without permanent resident status, Guy will be unable to join.  Today Guy, a first-year college student and a young man willing to fight for his adopted country, faces deportation.  News about this young man's imminent deportation has shaken the community in southern California. More than 1,000 of Guy's friends and neighbors have signed a petition calling for legislation on his behalf.  I hope you support this bill so that we can help Guy rebuild his life and continue to contribute to his community in the United States.  Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that the bill and a recent news article depicting the compelling circumstances of Guy Taylor's life be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2000       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENT STATUS FOR GUY TAYLOR.       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of      section 201 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, Guy      Taylor shall be eligible for issuance of an immigrant visa or      for adjustment of status to that of an alien lawfully      admitted for permanent residence upon filing an application      for issuance of an immigrant visa under section 204 of such      Act or for adjustment of status to lawful permanent resident.       (b) Adjustment of Status.--If Guy Taylor enters the United      States before the filing deadline specified in subsection      (c), he shall be considered to have entered and remained      lawfully and shall, if otherwise eligible, be eligible for      adjustment of status under section 245 of the Immigration and      Nationality Act as of the date of enactment of this Act.       (c) Deadline for Application and Payment of Fees.--     Subsections (a) and (b) shall apply only if the application      for issuance of an immigrant visa or the application for      adjustment of status are filed with appropriate fees within 2      years after the date of enactment of this Act.       (d) Reduction of Immigrant Visa Number.--Upon the granting      of an immigrant visa or permanent residence to Guy Taylor,      the Secretary of State shall instruct the proper officer to      reduce by one, during the current or next following fiscal      year, the total number of immigrant visas that are made      available to natives of the country of the alien's birth      under section 203(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act      or, if applicable, the total number of immigrant visas that      are made available to natives of the country of the alien's      birth under section 202(e) of such Act.            One Last Hope for Teenager Who Deserves a Break                            (By Mike Downey)       The calls and letters came in regularly for a while.       ``So what became of Guy Taylor?'' ``Whatever happened to      that poor kid from Orange County they were trying to kick out      of the country?'' It was a story that amazed people, confused      people. How could an orphan be ordered to leave his      grandparents in the United States and be required to live      where he has no family at all?       Eventually, though, everyone forgot Guy and got on with      their own lives. The news crews were gone, because nothing      was new. No politician came through for Guy in the nick of      time, here in a land where campaign speeches preach family      values. No loophole in the law was located. No judge found it      in his heart to cite extenuating circumstances for a boy who      had done nothing wrong.       Guy Taylor could have a country without a home, but no home      without a country.       He was born in Canada. He was 16 when his mother died. (The      father's identify is unknown.) He celebrated his 17th      birthday and high school graduation in Garden Grove, where he      came to live with his grandparents. The law said they could      be Guy's guardians but not legally adopt him. A judge refused      in July to make him a ward of the court, because he was too      old.       Unable to establish permanent residence and gain a green      card, Guy, who turned 18 a few weeks ago, faces expulsion      from the United States.       ``What will you do?'' he is asked.       ``I try not to think about it,'' he says.       Actually, it is unfair to say that Guy Taylor has been      forgotten by all. Not long ago, for example, a United Parcel      Service deliveryman was making his rounds in downtown Los      Angeles when he spotted Carl Shusterman.       ``Hey, aren't you the lawyer who represented that nice kid      they were trying to deport to Canada?'' the UPS guy inquired.       ``Yes, that's me,'' Shusterman said.       ``Whatever happened to him?''       Susterman still hears this question here and there. This      case isn't typical of the immigration cases he usually      handles. It touched a nerve.       Guy's mother died in Canada from a drug overdose. His      grandmother was 17 when she gave birth there. Here's where it      gets complicated: To adopt a grandson, the law stipulates she      needed to be a U.S. citizen before giving birth (which she      was), needed to live in the U.S. for 10 years before giving      birth (which she did), but five of those 10 years had to      follow her 14th birthday (which they didn't).       The family has tried everything it can think of, including      petitions and appeals to politicians, to keep Guy here.       ``Show him your Native American card,'' Shusterman tells      him in his law office.       Guy slides a laminated badge across a conference table.      Issued by the U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of      Indian affairs, it identifies Guy Douglas Taylor as      officially being of ``\1/32\nd Choctaw'' heritage.       Since exemptions are given to Native Americans in      immigration matters, Guy's grandmother, Oleta Hansen, who has      some Choctaw blood in her, figured it was worth a try. That's      how desperate she and her husband, Charles, are to keep their      grandson from being sent away. Unfortunately, it wasn't quite      enough Choctaw blood.       The best--perhaps last--chance for Guy could be Sen. Dianne      Feinstein, who could introduce a private bill to Congress on      the boy's behalf. Her office has been receptive, Shusterman      says. And such a bill is not without precedent. Earlier this      year, Rep. Bill McCollum (R.-Fla.) proposed one on behalf of      Robert Anthony Broley, a 32-year-old felon deported to Canada      after serving four years in a Florida prison on 13 counts,      including forgery and theft.       Shusterman does not believe it a coincidence that Broley's      father is the Republican Party treasurer in McCollum's home      district.       ``How about a young guy right here,'' Shusterman says of      the boy by his side, ``who's been in no trouble at all?''       So here sits Guy, in need of a holiday miracle.       A temporary visa was extended one last time, to next      summer. He takes classes at Cypress College and wants to join      the U.S. Army, but can't without a green card.       ``He's a good boy who does his schoolwork and his chores,''      his grandmother says. ``We're all he has left I was born      here. My husband was born here. We want our grandson here      with us.''       They were with him at lunch Tuesday, when that same UPS      driver happened by.       ``Remember that nice kid you asked me about?'' Shusterman      said. ``This is him.''  By
