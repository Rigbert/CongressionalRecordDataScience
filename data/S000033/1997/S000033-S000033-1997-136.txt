 They come before this body every day trying to figure out a way not to have to pay taxes, leading the efforts against organized labor.  Well, great shock of all shocks. NBC does not have a feature on the decline of the middle class. They do not talk about it too much. O.J. Simpson, we can get thousands of hours. Every airplane crash that ever happened, we can see the great visuals. But the fact that the average American worker has seen a decline in their standard of living, struggling just to keep their heads above water, somehow that story, gee, they just did not get it.  Well, what about ABC? We flip the dial and maybe ABC will give us the story. But who owns ABC? Why, that is the Disney Co. The Disney Co. is busy running to China, they are in Haiti, they are paying people in those countries pennies an hour to produce products that come back into America. I do not recall seeing too many features on their station about the trade issue, or about the exploitation of Haitian or Chinese workers. I do not recall that.  Maybe we will go to CBS, we will get a better story. Well, I guess not. That station is owned by Westinghouse, or maybe we will go to the Fox network that is owned by that strong, progressive Rupert Murdoch worth many billions of dollars. No, I do not think we will see it there either.  So I would argue that one of the reasons that the American people are not seeing the pain of their lives being reflected in the media is that the media is owned by very large multinational corporations, many of whom are taking our jobs to Mexico and China, and the media would rather, what is the word, obfuscate, perhaps, rather give us a lot of entertainment and game shows and soap operas rather than discuss with the American people the important issues, and that would be one reflection I would have on the gentleman's question.
