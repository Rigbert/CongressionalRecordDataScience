President, during the past 4 years, I have stood on the floor of the Senate many times to express my strong committment for Federal support of breast cancer research. I have been joined by colleagues from both sides of the aisle, many whose lives have been personally touched by this deadly disease. Our voices have joined the millions of American families who have known all too well the real consequences of this indiscriminate killer.  In 1992, the Members of this Chamber heeded the message we sent about the inadequacies of Federal dollars provided to researchers to find the causes and cure of breast cancer. It was then that Senator Harkin and I successfully transfered $210 million from star wars to the Army Breast Cancer Research Program at the Department of Defense. Despite some formidable forces, an additional $250 million has been appropriated for this successful program in the 4 years since that time.  This year, I rise to thank my colleagues for their continued support of the Army Breast Cancer Research Program, particularly Senator Stevens for his leadership as the chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense. When we first began circulating the letter of support for the Army Breast Cancer Program to Members of the Senate, we were encouraged by the number of Senators who supported the program. But when we completed the process, we were extremely excited by the extraordinary support expressed by 54 Senators, the largest number since the birth of this program.  Continued funding for the Department of Defense Breast Cancer Program is more critical now than ever. Over the past 2 years, there have been incredible discoveries at a very rapid rate that offer fascinating insights into the biology of breast cancer, such as the isolation of breast cancer susceptibility genes, and discoveries about the basic mechanism of cancer cells. These discoveries have brought into sharp focus the areas of research that hold promise and will build on the knowledge and investment we have made. The Army Breast Cancer Research Program has provided researchers with the tools to make these tremendous breakthroughs.                          ____________________
