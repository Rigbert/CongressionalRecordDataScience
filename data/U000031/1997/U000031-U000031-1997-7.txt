Chairman, I would just remind my colleagues that this is a duplicative amendment. Under the existing law and this bill, H.R. 1270, DOE provides funding from the income under this program to provide emergency response training for State and local entities in the unlikely event of an accident with radioactive materials.  Under the funding, the DOE already provides assistance for training of State and local officials and tribal emergency rescue workers. The commercial nuclear safe record during 2,900 shipments speak to the effectiveness of the training.  I remind my colleagues that this radioactive material did not just show up at these 80 different facilities around the country. It had to get there. And some 1,300 tons of the radioactive rods were shipped without accident, without spillage, without a single release of nuclear material, all under the safe guidance of the Department of Energy.  Mr. Chairman, to change that record and give it to somebody else and let them start all over and do their regulations is just further delay. I would urge my colleagues: ``If it ain't broke, don't fix it.'' The system works now under the guidance of the Department of Energy, and I have a feeling of confidence that it will continue without this amendment.
