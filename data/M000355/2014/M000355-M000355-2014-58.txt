 President, it frequently happens when we head into a recess that we have to say a reluctant farewell to some member of the Senate family. So before I yield the floor, I wish to say a word of thanks to Jerry Linnell, who has been a fixture here for more than 3 decades as an official reporter of debates and for the past 15 years as a somewhat hidden fixture up on the fourth floor as the chief reporter.  It is a tough job having to listen to the rest of us drone on every day, and as chief reporter Jerry has had the unenviable task of reviewing every single word we have said.  In his trademark suspenders, Jerry is a friendly and unmistakable presence up on the fourth floor, guiding his team through their daily rounds and maintaining a level of professionalism and integrity that has always been a key characteristic of the office.  It is a proud group. Back in the 1930s Senator Huey Long is said to have donated his own personal Bible to the office so they would have a handy reference when he quoted from it. It quickly became a tradition for new reporters to sign it when they were hired and then once they left.  In a sign of how dedicated these reporters are, only 35 names have been entered in the Bible over the past 80 years. So it is a very venerable fraternity, one that has its roots in article I of the Constitution. We thank Jerry for his many, many years of dedicated, honorable service.  I know Jerry and his wife Jane look forward to spending more time with their many children and grandchildren. After listening to us for all those years, I think he deserves it.  You have done your time. You have done it well. The entire Senate family thanks you. Jerry, all the best.  I yield the floor.                       Reservation of Leader Time
