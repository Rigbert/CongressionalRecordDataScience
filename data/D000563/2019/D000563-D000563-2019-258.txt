Many of us worked long and hard to be elected to the U.S. Senate, not just to represent our States but to respond to the challenges that face us in the United States. The challenge of gun safety faces everyone. Thank you to the Senator from Maryland for making that point on the floor of the Senate.  Many people come to the Senate Galleries, sit in the chairs, and wait for the Senate to act. It is a long waiting game because, unfortunately, the Senate does little or nothing under theleadership of Senator McConnell. I don't know why this Senator has not accepted the fact that the U.S. Senate has an important role to play. We speak for people not only in Illinois and in Maryland but for those all across the United States, and they are very concerned.  In the recent trip home over the recess, I visited some of the areas around Chicago and in the city, and there were many conversations about the gun violence that we see across America. That gun violence has been punctuated by the horrible events in El Paso and Odessa, TX, and in other communities that have been affected by these mass killings. We have become numb, I am afraid, to the reality of gun violence in America. We have decided, I am afraid, that the Second Amendment to the Constitution is somehow holding us back--binding us and restraining us--from even doing the most basic things.  Overwhelmingly, the people of America, by a factor of over 90 percent--Democrats and Republicans--believe that we should have background checks. We believe that the people who have been convicted of violent felonies shouldn't own guns--period. We believe, as well, that when it comes to those who have serious mental instability, they should also be precluded from gun ownership. The laws do not allow us to adequately ask the question or to test whether the buyer has been convicted of a felony or has such a background.  In the city of Chicago, hardly a weekend goes by without there being dozens shot and 9 or 10 or more losing their lives. Most of them are young people, but not exclusively. Older people, as well, are caught in the crossfire.  People say: Well, I thought Chicago had these tough gun laws. What is going on there? Why do you have so many gun deaths?  The answer is obvious for those of us who spend time in that great city. We are about 20 minutes away from northwestern Indiana and from the gun shows that are held there, where people don't ask questions when they sell firearms. All you need to do is to have the money and the open trunk of your car to fill it up with guns and drive them back to the city of Chicago. That is why no State can solve this problem. We need Federal legislation.  As I talk to people across this country, they tell me the heartbreaking stories of sitting down with their children who have gone through some drill or program at school to forewarn them of what would happen if an active shooter were to come onto the premises. As we know, that reality is not beyond reach. In Connecticut, we saw a beautiful first grade class that was attacked by a killer with a weapon who took the lives of those children. If that scandalous massacre of children in a first grade classroom didn't move this Congress and this President to act, what will?  The President said to me in a conversation several weeks ago that we are going to have a background check bill and that it will be the best in the history of the world. Well, I was skeptical when he said it. I am even more skeptical today. I knew what would happen. When the President had a choice between the public interest of gun safety and the special interest of the National Rifle Association, the National Rifle Association prevailed.  This President refuses to come forward with any proposal, and Senator McConnell believes his hands are tied and cannot bring this issue to the floor of the Senate. He cannot run the risk that his Members would have to be on the record as having taken a vote, as they were elected to do, on an issue of this importance.                                 S. 386  Madam President, this is not the only issue that we are ignoring--the only issue that is, frankly, not even being considered on the floor of the Senate. There is another one that is equally important to me and to most people across this country, and that is dealing with the challenge of immigration.  A few years ago, a bipartisan group of Senators--eight of us--I, Senator McCain, Senator Schumer, and others--sat down and wrote a comprehensive immigration reform bill. It was months of Republicans and Democrats sitting down, face-to-face, night after night, going through every section of our immigration code to come up with a comprehensive bill to deal with the obvious shortcomings, but we did it. We brought it to the floor of the Senate and it received 68 votes. There were 14 Republicans who joined the Democrats to pass this comprehensive immigration reform. We sent it to the Republican House of Representatives, and Speaker Boehner refused to even consider it. So all of our effort and all of our work was really for nothing.  We continue to face the challenge of immigration. We know what it is like at the border. Under this President, we have seen the worst border situation in modern times. His refusal to acknowledge the three Central American countries that are sending all of these immigrants to the United States has led to some horrible circumstances.  Recently, the inspector general of Health and Human Services came forward with a report on the Trump administration's response to this border crisis. It was a report on the policy of zero tolerance. I am sure you will remember it. It was under Attorney General Sessions, and he somehow found a quotation in the Bible to justify forcibly removing children from their parents. We removed 2,880 children from their parents at the border under this zero tolerance policy before there was an uprising in the United States against it and before the President backed off of it.  I commend the inspector general's report on what happened to those children--to every American. I saw it firsthand. I witnessed these children as they were being removed from their parents and the trauma they went through as a result.  So why aren't we debating the immigration policy on the floor of the U.S. Senate? I am told that perhaps, later today, the junior Senator from Utah--at this point, I think he is the senior Senator from Utah--will come forward with a unanimous consent request to consider fixing one part of the immigration problem. I want to fix that problem and many more.                             The DREAM Act  Madam President, I want to make sure that when we come to the floor to discuss immigration, as we should, that we take up the issue of the DREAM Act.  The DREAM Act was a bill that I introduced in the Senate 18 years ago. It states, if you were brought to the United States as a child and are undocumented in this country but you have gone through school and have had no criminal record of any serious consequence, you deserve a chance to be able to earn your way to legal status and citizenship. I introduced this bill 18 years ago. It passed in the Senate in 1 year and passed in the House in another, but it has never come up with the 60 votes--the supermajority requirement--in the Senate.  President Obama was a cosponsor when he was in the Senate, and when he had the White House under his control, I asked him to consider an Executive order to achieve the same goal, and he did. He created a program called DACA. There were 790,000 young people across America who paid the filing fee, who went through the criminal background checks, and who then received the protection to stay in this country and work legally.  Of course, in September of 2017, President Trump abolished this program. It took away the protection these young people had. He was challenged in court, and the court said we are going to continue this program until it is resolved at the highest levels of our Federal judiciary as to whether President Trump has this authority.  On November 12, across the street, the U.S. Supreme Court will consider that case--790,000 lives and more, for that matter, hang in the balance of how the Justices will make this decision on their future.  This should be debated on the floor of the Senate. It is why we are here. It is why we were elected. I think we can find bipartisan answers to many of these questions, but we need the Senate majority leader, the Republican leader, to really accept the reality of the Senate actually going to work. Instead of speeches by individual Senators on the floor, as impressive as they may be, we might actually pass a law. Think of that--a bill coming to the floor, subject to amendment, and actual debate in the Senate Chamber. We would fill the Galleries. It is such a novelty. It doesn't happen anymore.  Unfortunately for America, many issues, whether it is gun safety or sensible immigration policy, are the victims of our inaction in the U.S. Senate. We can do better, and we should. Ultimately, the American people have the last word as to whether this Senate will act on issues like gun safety and immigration. The last word is your vote. In the next election, I hope more and more Americans will vote for a Senate that responds to the challenges of our day and doesn't avoid our responsibility under the Constitution.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
