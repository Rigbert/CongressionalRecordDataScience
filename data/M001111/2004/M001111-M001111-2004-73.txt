 President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for defining for all of us what I think we are seeing across our country in every school and every classroom where the morale among our educators who are responsible for caring for our children every day has declined dramatically.  The Senator will remember not that long ago when the Senate passed a bill to increase class sizes in kindergarten, first, and second grades. As I traveled around my State at that time, teachers were so enthusiastic. They were excited about being given the opportunity to help their young students learn to write and learn to do math so they could be successful in life.  That atmosphere has changed dramatically. Now you travel around to classrooms and they are begging and pleading for help. Every teacher says to me: I want to do the right thing. I want to be accountable. I want my students to be able to succeed. I want to make this work. But my class size is twice as large. I get less time with parents. I am paying more out of my own pocket for basic supplies. We don't have enough books for all of our students. And even more so, I am spendingevery single second teaching to this test because my students don't have art and music and other things that help them be well-rounded adults.  We can change this. We can make it better. We can do what we promised 2 years ago and fund this and really make a difference in our children's lives.  I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his question. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Montana.
