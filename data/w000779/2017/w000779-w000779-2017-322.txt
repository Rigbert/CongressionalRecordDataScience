 Mr. President, I wish to now discuss what is known about the facts and timing of Congressman Price's investment in Innate. This is a timeline that is based on public documents, press reports, and information the nominee provided the Finance Committee.  If you have never heard of Innate until the last few weeks, you would be forgiven. The New York Times described it as a ``tiny pharmaceutical company from Australia that has no approved drugs and no backing from flashy venture capital firms.'' Innate has fewer than a dozen full-time employees. The company's stock was first listed on the Australian Stock Exchange in 2013, and until recently its market capitalization was well below $100 million. Innate has never generated revenue from drug sales. It has repeatedly teetered on the brink of running out of cash. It has just 2,500 shareholders. By way of comparison, a major American pharmaceutical company could have hundreds of thousands of shareholders.  Innate is planning to submit an investigational drug application to the Food and Drug Administration, and its ultimate goal is to one day sell itself to a large pharmaceutical manufacturer, which would take its early-stage experimental therapy to market.  What I am describing is, this company is the poster child for obscure companies. It is so small and so obscure, it doesn't even have a Wikipedia page. So the question is, How did Congressman Price come to learn about this company, and how did he decide to make it the single largest investment in his sprawling portfolio of health care stocks? The answer is, the Congressman learned about Innate in 2014 during a conversation with his colleague, Congressman Collins of New York. As I indicated, Congressman Collins sits on Innate's board of directors. Congressman Collins is also the company's largest shareholder, holding 38 million shares. Congressman Collins' adult children, his chief of staff, and many of his political backers are also heavily invested in the company. I am going to touch on those issues in a few minutes.  According to disclosures with the House Ethics Committee, Congressman Price bought some 61,000 shares of Innate stock in 3 separate purchases during January of 2015. At the time, the stock was trading at roughly 10 cents a share. Congressman Price testified to the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee that he directed his broker to make the January 2015 purchases.  Fast-forward to August 2016. Congressman Price bought another 400,000 shares of Innate as part of a private stock sale for U.S. investors. When the private sale took place, Innate's shares were trading on the Australian Stock Exchange for the equivalent of 31 American cents. Participants in the private sale got the shares at a deep discount.  In written testimony to the Finance Committee, Congressman Price said he paid 84,000 American dollars to buy the 400,000 shares. He bought 250,000 of those shares for 18 American cents per share in one private stock placement. He bought another 150,000 shares for 26 American cents each in a second private stock placement. Congressman Price's House Ethics Committee disclosures showed that he acquired the stock on August 31. On that day, Innate's stock was trading for the U.S. equivalent of 31 cents a share on the Australian Stock Exchange. In my book, that is a special deal.  The bottom line is that Congressman Price bought these shares for $40,000 less than an average investor would have paid to buy the same amount of stock off the open market. That is nearly 33 percent off the price on the Australian Stock Exchange at the time. Since that time, Innate's stock has more than doubled. These facts are not in dispute.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record Congressman Price's written testimony in response to my questions for the record as part of his nomination hearings.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                        Questions for the Record``the honorable thomas e. price nomination hearing for hhs secretary''                      hearing date: january 24, 2017         questions for the record from ranking member ron wyden                  Innate Immunotherapeutics purchases       5. The nominee owns 461,238 shares of Innate      Immunotherapeutics Ltd. (``Innate''), a small Australian      biopharmaceutical firm developing a multiple sclerosis      therapy. The nominee acquired the stock in four separate      purchases on January 8, 9 and 23 of 2015 (``2015 tranche''),      and in a pair of private stock placements on August 31, 2016      (``2016 tranche''). Regarding Innate:       a. Question: Please describe how and when the nominee first      learned about Innate.       Answer: I previously answered this question for the SFC. I      learned about Innate during the course of a conversation in      the fall of 2014 with Representative Chris Collins regarding      their respective personal backgrounds. I cannot recall the      specific date of that conversation. During that exchange,      Representative Collins told me that he sat on a number of      public company boards including Innate, which was developing      a treatment for multiple sclerosis (MS),       b. Question: Did the nominee or his staff ever meet or      otherwise communicate with current or former employees,      directors, consultants or other officials affiliated with      Innate. If so, please describe the communication, including      who it involved, the date, subject, place and form (e.g. in      person, by phone of communication.       Answer: I previously answered this question for the SFC.       I communicated with Representative Collins, who is a      director of Innate. As noted above, I learned about Innate      through a general conversation with him in the fall of 2014.      I also communicated with Simon Wilkinson of Innate regarding      my interest in participating in the 2016 private placement of      company stock. According to Innate's website, Mr. Wilkinson      is currently the Managing Director and CEO of Innate.       My Congressional staff has not met or otherwise      communicated with current or former employees, directors,      consultants or other officials affiliated with Innate.       c. Question: Please describe any communication between the      nominee and Congressman Collins regarding Innate      Immunotherapy, including the date, subject, place and form.       Answer: I previously answered this question for the SFC.       I had a conversation with Representative Collins in the      fall of 2014 that brought Innate, as a company, to my      attention. The nature of that conversation did not, however,      influence my decision to invest in the company in either 2015      or 2016.       I believe I had subsequent general communications with      Representative Collins regarding Innate. I do not have a      specific recollection of when those conversations occurred or      their substance. Any such communications did not impact my      investment decisions, however, because my purchases of Innate      stock were based solely on my own research.       d. Question: The nominee bought 400,316 shares in the 2016      tranche in a private stock sale that included two placements      at two prices. Please provide the number of shares bought in      each placement, and the price at which the shares were      bought.       Answer: I previously answered this question for the SFC. I      purchased 250,000 shares of Innate in Private Placement 1 at      US$0.18/share--the same price offered all participants in      this private placement. I purchased 150,613 shares of Innate      in Private Placement     2 at US$0.26/share--the same price offered all participants      in this private placement.
