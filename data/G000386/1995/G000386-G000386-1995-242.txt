(b) Technical Amendment.--The item for section 1464 in the      chapter analysis for chapter 71 of title 18, United States      Code, is amended to read as follows:``1464. Utterance of indecent or profane language by radio               communication; transmission to minor of indecent material               from remote computer facility.''.                                                                                  ____                                      Family Research Council,                                     Washington, DC, June 7, 1995.     Statement of Legal Director Family Research Council       Pursuant to your request, the Family Research Council has      reviewed the constitutionality of the ``Protection of      Children from Computer Pornography Act of 1995.'' It is our      opinion that the Act is fully consistent with the Supreme      Court's indecency precedents.       Before providing more extensive analysis, it is prudent      that I state my qualifications to render this opinion. I have      practiced in the area of pornography law and have      participated in extensive litigation before the Supreme      Court, federal courts of appeal, and state courts on      pornography-related controversies. I am thus very familiar      with the manner in which courts have treated statutes aimed      at regulating pornographic materials.       The seminal cases applicable to the Act are FCC v.      Pacifica, 438 U.S. 726 (1978) and Sable Communications, Inc.      v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115 (1989). Taken together, these cases      clearly and unambiguously establish the principle that      society may prohibit the transmission of indecent material to      children. As the Act only attempts to do that, in my view it      presents no serious constitutional concerns.       Please contact me if I can be of further assistance.                                        Cathleen A. Cleaver, Esq.,                                         Director of Legal Policy.                                 ______      By
