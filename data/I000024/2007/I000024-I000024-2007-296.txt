President, the independent producers of oil and gas are the backbone of our domestic supply of energy. They have played and continue to play a critical role in meeting our domestic needs, especially as the big oil companies' focus mainly offshore. In fact, independents develop 90 percent of our Nation's wells. According to the Department of Energy, independent producers supply 68 percent of American oil production and 82 percent of overall American natural gas.  Therefore, I rise today to introduce legislation that eliminates the taxable income limit on percentage depletion for oil and natural gas produced from marginal wells; wells producing 15 barrels of day and less than 90 thousand cubic feet of natural gas.  Under current law, the percentage depletion method is limited to only independent producers and royalty owners. It is a form of cost recovery for capital initially invested toward production of oil and gas wells. Generally, the percentage depletion rate is 15 percent of the taxpayer's gross income from an oil and gas producing property and is limited to a daily average of 1,000 barrels of oil or 6,000 thousand cubic feet of natural gas. However, under the net income limitation, percentage depletion is limited to 100 percent of the net income from an individual property. In the case of marginal wells, where total deductions often do exceed this net-income, this limitation discourages producers from investing in the continued production from marginal wells.  As a result Congress has suspended the net-income limitation for 1998 through 2005; and again for 2006 and 2007, with the passage of the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, H.R. 6111.  My bill would simply clarify the policy by doing away with the taxable net income limitation altogether.  In my own State of Oklahoma, it is the small independents, basically mom-and-pop operations, producing the majority of oil and natural gas, with 85 percent of Oklahoma's oil coming from marginal wells.  Because marginal wells supply such a significant amount of our oil and gas, it is vital we keep them in operation. According to the Energy Department, between 1994 and 2003, we lost 110 million barrels of crude oil due to plugged marginal wells. Thus, when we lose marginal wells, we become more dependent upon foreign sources of energy, at a time when virtually all agree that U.S. policies should encourage reliance upon domestic sources. Furthermore, we lose domestic jobs to foreign nations.  My bill would allow independents the necessary capital to continue to produce from these existing marginal wells--which is critical to the Nation's overall energy security. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 905       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. ELIMINATION OF TAXABLE INCOME LIMIT ON PERCENTAGE                    DEPLETION FOR OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCED FROM                    MARGINAL PROPERTIES.       (a) In General.--Subparagraph (H) of section 613A(c)(6) of      the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to oil and      natural gas produced from marginal properties) is amended to      read as follows:       ``(H) Nonapplication of taxable income limit with respect      to marginal production.--The second sentence of subsection      (a) of section 613 shall not apply to so much of the      allowance for depletion as is determined under subparagraph      (A).''.       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section      shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31,      2006.                                 ______                                       By
