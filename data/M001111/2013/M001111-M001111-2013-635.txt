 President, I thank the Senator from Maryland. First of all, let me just say it is truly a pleasure to be on the floor with the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. I just remember when the Senator and I were here back in 1992, the Year of the Woman, and now here we are managing these critical financial bills.
