Chairman, I appreciate my friend's comments about me. But essentially, I was quoting Mr. Archer of Texas, the chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means, expressing his views, because I understand that some may believe I am subjective to protect Federal employees, which I am, that is why I quoted Mr. Archer of the gentleman's party and chair of the Committee on Ways and Means.
