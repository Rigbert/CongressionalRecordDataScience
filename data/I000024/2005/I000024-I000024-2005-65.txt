I have used my time. I have not yielded back the remainder of my time. I probably only have 30 or 40 seconds left. It is my desire to get a vote on this amendment, if the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island has an amendment that we get a vote on his amendment, and whatever the allocation of time is at that point, we will exercise that.
