Corona has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Frank Nelson is one of these individuals.  Frank Nelson has been a Realtor in the Corona area for 17 years. He is the currentBoard President for the Inland Gateway Association of Realtors and he also served as President in 1998. Frank has served the Realtors as the Federal Political Coordinator and State Director for 14 years, and is the 14th district Vice President.  Frank has also served as Chairman of Land Use and Vice Chairman of Property Management and Land Use for the California Association of Realtors. He is a member of Federal Issues, Local Government Relations, and served on a special task force for Private Transfer Tax and presently is serving on the Department of Real Estates for rewriting questions for the California Department of Real Estate license exam.  I also have a personal connection with Frank. He lived across the street from my mother, Marsha, and would often look in on her while I was away. Frank epitomized a good neighbor who was always there to lend a helping hand.  Frank's tireless passion for community service has contributed immensely to the betterment of the community of Corona, California. I am proud to call Frank a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for his service and salute him as his term ends as the Inland Gateway Association of Realtors Board President.                          ____________________
