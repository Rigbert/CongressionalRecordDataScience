Speaker, if Members have not decided how to vote on the $40 billion Mexican bailout package, let me refer them to yesterday's U.S.A. Today business page which says that mutual fund speculators in emerging markets earned 66 percent yields on their investments since 1990. Would my colleagues not like to earn some of that money?  Then today on the Washington Post editorial page Robert Dunn, an economist at George Washington University advises against a $40 billion bailout of Wall Street by saying the proposed bailout is really a rescue package for investment bankers and mutual fund managers in New York and other financial centers who took huge risks in exchange for very high-interest rates in Mexico.  We now have a wonderful recipe for prosperity on Wall Street. When risky assets pay, keep the money and complain about high taxes; but when such high risk assets approach default, get the U.S. treasury and taxpayers to cover the losses.  Vote against the Mexican bailout.                          ____________________
