Speaker, in 2008, gas prices that rose above $4 a gallon triggered the Wall Street meltdown and housing crisis that continue to plague our country. We're in the same boat today again with gas prices going over $4 a gallon, so be prepared.  I rise today to talk about that housing crisis that is devaluing our housing stock across our country and destroying neighborhoods and communities across the Nation.  Last week, the New York Times ran a piece I wish to place in the Record highlighting one more twist in this crisis. According to their front page expose, the big banks and mortgage companies have profited even more from the foreclosure crisis by amassing giant ``real estate empires'' that span across our country. So not only do six banks now control two-thirds of the banking system of this country, they've also become real estate magnates, too. When is too much too much?  The impact on communities has been devastating. The numbers are simply shocking. In my community alone, over 6,700 more homes are in some type of foreclosure filings. While thousands of America's families are being thrown out on the street, the big Wall Street banks have nearly doubled the number of houses they've taken through foreclosure since the crisis began 5 years ago. That represents nearly 900,000 homes. That's 900,000 more families whose American Dream ended in foreclosure.  Sadly, this doesn't include those who are barely hanging on. Approximately one in four mortgaged homes are still underwater, where families owe more than the home is worth.  After taking billions of dollars from our taxpayers, we might expect that the Wall Street banks would want to help people stay in their homes and help more vacant properties be taken off the market. Well, that's not what I'm hearing from local realtors. I spoke with a group of them over a week ago. They keep running up against a brick wall any time they even try to do a workout with one of these banks. They continue to have difficulty accessing credit for qualified, willing buyers. More and more, I hear how it's only our local banks and our credit unions that are making any effort to make this troubled housing market function.  Wall Street walked away with billions in bailout money, and then walked away from the housing mess they created. But they want even more. All the while they are sitting on top of huge profits and taking enormous tax breaks. The six largest banks in the country, including Wells Fargo, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, together paid an approximate tax rate of only 11 percent of their pretax U.S. earnings in 2009 and 2010, less than half of what other businesses pay. I wish someone in this place could explain why this is allowed to go on.  We need to understand that this foreclosure crisis is far from over. In the first quarter of this year alone, approximately 215,000 more properties were in foreclosure across our country, and another 700,000 properties were either in foreclosure filings, received default notice, bank repossession or scheduled auction. As these banks continue to agglomerate these properties that are becoming vacant, neighborhoods across our country are being devalued and continue to disintegrate. Every Member here knows what I'm talking about.  There are some signs that our economy is slowly improving. But, boy, we aren't out of the woods yet. Moody's is predicting that housing prices across our Nation will continue to fall by as much as 5 percent by this year's end--I should say 5 percent more. We cannot sit on our hands and hope the situation gets better. Revival of the housing sector and the jobs it creates has always played a crucial and leading role in any economic recovery. We need to work to help struggling families stay in their homes, protect neighborhoods from being riddled with vacant structures and get our economy moving again by arresting the continuing decline in our vital housing assets built up over decades coast to coast.  Importantly, revitalizing and reoccupying the troubled housing stock would put millions of Americans to work. And isn't it over time to do exactly that?                [From the New York Times, May 22, 2011]          As Lenders Hold Homes in Foreclosure, Sales Are Hurt                             (By Eric Dash)       El Mirage, AZ.--The nation's biggest banks and mortgage      lenders have steadily amassed real estate empires, acquiring      a glut of foreclosed homes that threatens to deepen the      housing slump and create a further drag on the economic      recovery.       All told, they own more than 872,000 homes as a result of      the groundswell in foreclosures, almost twice as many as when      the financial crisis began in 2007, according to RealtyTrac,      a real estate data provider. In addition, they are in the      process of foreclosing on an additional one million homes and      are poised to take possession of several million more in the      years ahead.       Five years after the housing market started teetering,      economists now worry that the rise in lender-owned homes      could create another vicious circle, in which the growing      inventory of distressed property further depresses home      values and leads to even more distressed sales. With the      spring home-selling season under way, real estate prices have      been declining across the country in recent months.       ``It remains a heavy weight on the banking system,'' said      Mark Zandi, the chief economist of Moody's Analytics.      ``Housing prices are falling, and they are going to fall some      more.''       Over all, economists project that it would take about three      years for lenders to sell their backlog of foreclosed homes.      As a result, home values nationally could fall 5 percent by      the end of 2011, according to Moody's, and rise only modestly      over the following year. Regions that were hardest hit by the      housing collapse and recession could take even longer to      recover--dealing yet another blow to a still-struggling      economy.       Although sales have picked up a bit in the last few weeks,      banks and other lenders remain overwhelmed by the wave of      foreclosures. In Atlanta, lenders are repossessing eight      homes for each distressed home they sell, according to March      data from RealtyTrac. In Minneapolis, they are bringing in at      least six foreclosed homes for each they sell, and in once-     hot markets like Chicago and Miami, the ratio still hovers      close to two to one.       Before the housing implosion, the inflow and outflow      figures were typically one-to-one.       The reasons for the backlog include inadequate staffs and      delays imposed by the lenders because of investigations into      foreclosure practices. The pileup could lead to $40 billion      in additional losses for banks and other lenders as they sell      houses at steep discounts over the next two years, according      to Trepp, a real estate research firm.       ``These shops are under siege; it's just a tsunami of stuff      coming in,'' said Taj Bindra, who oversaw Washington Mutual's      servicing unit from 2004 to 2006 and now advises financial      institutions on risk management. ``Lenders have a strong      incentive to clear out inventory in a controlled and timely      manner, but if you had problems on the front end of the      foreclosure process, it should be no surprise you are having      problems on the back end.''       A drive through the sprawling subdivisions outside Phoenix      shows the ravages of the real estate collapse. Here in this      working-class neighborhood of El Mirage, northwest of      Phoenix, rows of small stucco homes sprouted up during the      boom. Now block after block is pockmarked by properties with      overgrown shrubs, weeds and foreclosure notices tacked to the      doors. About 116 lender-owned homes are on the market or      under contract in El Mirage, according to local real estate      listings.       But that's just a small fraction of what is to come. An      additional 491 houses are either sitting in the lenders'      inventory or are in the foreclosure process. On average,      homes in El Mirage sell for $65,300, down 75 percent from the      height of the boom in July 2006, according to the Cromford      Report, a Phoenix-area real estate data provider. Real estate      agents and market analysts say those ultra-cheap prices have      recently started attracting first-time buyers as well as      investors looking for several properties at once.       Lenders have also been more willing to let distressed      borrowers sidestep foreclosure by selling homes for a loss.      That has accelerated the pace of sales in the area and even      caused prices to slowly rise in the last two months, but      realty agents worry about all the distressed homes that are      coming down the pike.       ``My biggest fear right now is that the supply has been      artificially restricted,'' said Jayson Meyerovitz, a local      broker. ``They can't just sit there forever. If so many      houses hit the market, what is going to happen then?''       The major lenders say they are not deliberately holding      back any foreclosed homes. They say that a long sales process      can stigmatize a property and ratchet up maintenance and      other costs. But they also do not want to unload properties      in a fire sale.       ``If we are out there undercutting prices, we are      contributing to the downward spiral in market values,'' said      Eric Will, who oversees distressed home sales for Freddie      Mac. ``We want to make sure we are helping stabilize      communities.''       The biggest reason for the backlog is that it takes longer      to sell foreclosed homes, currently an average of 176 days--     and that's after the 400 days it takes for lenders to      foreclose. After drawing government scrutiny over improper      foreclosures practices last fall, many big lenders have      slowed their operations in order to check the paperwork, and      in two dozen or so states they halted them for months.       Conscious of their image, many lenders have recently      started telling real estate agents to be more lenient to      renters who happen to live in a foreclosed home and give them      extra time to move out before changing the locks.       ``Wells Fargo has sent me back knocking on doors two or      three times, offering to give renters money if they cooperate      with us,''     said Claude A. Worrell, a longtime real estate agent from      Minneapolis who specializes in selling bank-owned property.      ``It's a lot different than it used to be.''       Realty agents and buyers say the lenders are simply      overwhelmed. Just as lenders were ill-prepared to handle the      flood of foreclosures, they do not have the staff and      infrastructure to manage and sell this much property.       Most of the major lenders outsourced almost every part of      the process, be it sales or repairs. Some agents complain      that lender-owned home listings are routinely out of date,      that properties are overpriced by as much as 10 percent, and      that lenders take days or longer to accept an offer.       The silver lining for home lenders, however, is that the      number of new foreclosures and recent borrowers falling      behind on their payments by three months or longer is      shrinking.       ``If they are able to manage through the next 12 to 18      months,'' said Mr. Zandi, the Moody's Analytics economist,      ``they will be in really good shape.''                          ____________________
