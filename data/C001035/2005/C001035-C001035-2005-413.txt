Feingold, and Mr. Coleman) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions:                               S. Res. 8       Whereas public investment in higher education yields a      return of several dollars for each dollar invested;       Whereas higher education promotes economic opportunity and      recipients of bachelor's degrees earn 73 percent more in      lifetime earnings than those with only a secondary school      diploma and are also significantly less likely to be      unemployed;       Whereas access to a college education has become a hallmark      of American society, and is vital to upholding our belief in      equality of opportunity;       Whereas for a generation, the Federal Pell Grant has served      as an established and effective means of providing access to      higher education;       Whereas when viewed in constant dollars, the value of      today's Pell Grant maximum award has actually declined by 16      percent since the mid 1970s;       Whereas grant aid as a portion of student aid has fallen      significantly in the past 30 years;       Whereas in 1975, grant aid constituted approximately 80      percent of total student aid awarded to college students and      loans constituted only 17 percent, now this has reversed with      grants making up only 38 percent, and loans covering 56      percent of total student aid; and       Whereas the increasing reliance on borrowing to finance a      higher education is particularly burdensome on low-income      families and has negative consequences for the enrollment of      these students.       Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--       (1) the maximum Federal Pell Grant for which a student      should be eligible during award year 2005-2006 should be      $4,500; and       (2) the authorized levels for the Federal Pell Grant      maximum amount found in section 401 of the Higher Education      Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070a) should be set high enough to      accommodate a Federal Pell Grant amount of $9,000 by award      year 2010-2011.
