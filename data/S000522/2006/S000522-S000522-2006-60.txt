Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 992) urging the President to appoint aPresidential Special Envoy for Sudan, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                              H. Res. 992       Whereas in July 2004, the United States House of      Representatives and Senate declared that the atrocities in      the Darfur region of Sudan constitute genocide, and the Bush      administration reached the same conclusion in September 2004,      when then Secretary of State Colin Powell stated that ``the      evidence leads us to the conclusion that genocide has      occurred and may still be occurring in Darfur'';       Whereas an estimated 300,000 to 400,000 people have been      killed by the Government of Sudan and its Janjaweed allies      since the crisis began in 2003, more than 2,000,000 people      have been displaced from their homes, and more than 250,000      people from Darfur remain in refugee camps in Chad;       Whereas some rebel factions, which have targeted civilians      in the Darfur region, have intensified their attacks even      after the signing of the Darfur Peace Agreement in May 2006;       Whereas the United Nations Under-Secretary General for      Humanitarian Affairs, Jan Egeland, in late August 2006 stated      that ``[i]nsecurity is at its highest level since 2004,      access at its lowest levels since that date, and we may well      be on the brink of a return to all-out war'';       Whereas despite the signing of the Darfur Peace Agreement      in May 2006, violence against civilians, peacekeepers, and      humanitarian workers continues unabated; and an estimated 12      humanitarian workers have been killed in Darfur, including a      nurse in September 2006;       Whereas in August 2006, the Government of Sudan began to      deploy thousands of government troops for a major offensive      in Darfur, once again threatening a major humanitarian      catastrophe and risking the safety and security of millions      of civilians;       Whereas according to the Government of Sudan's plan, in a      document submitted to the United Nations Secretary-General      Kofi Annan, the Government of Sudan plans to deploy      approximately 26,500 additional troops and 7,050 additional      police to Darfur;       Whereas the objectives of this deployment are ``to deal      with the threats posed by the activities of groups that have      rejected the Darfur Peace Agreement and to gain control over      the security situation and achieve stability in Darfur'';       Whereas the United Nations Security Council passed a      resolution expanding the mandate of the United Nations      Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) for the additional deployment of      17,300 peacekeeping troops and 3,300 civilian police      personnel as well as 16 formed police units to Darfur;       Whereas President Omar Bashir of Sudan has rejected the      deployment of a United Nations peacekeeping force to Darfur,      even as First Vice President Salva Kiir has publicly stated      his support for the deployment of a United Nations      peacekeeping mission to Darfur;       Whereas implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement      (CPA) between the Government of Sudan and the Sudan People's      Liberation Movement (SPLM) is slow, raising serious concern      about the commitment of the Government of Sudan to fulfill      its responsibilities;       Whereas in July 2005, although the Abyei Boundary      Commission, established to define and demarcate the area of      the nine Ngok Dinka chiefdoms, finished its work and      submitted its report to President Bashir, the President has      yet to implement the conclusions of the Commission, as called      for in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement;       Whereas the reconstruction and development of Southern      Sudan and other marginalized areas remains a major challenge,      while the return of refugees and displaced people to their      homes in Darfur will require major financial commitments and      the establishment of a secure and safe environment throughout      Darfur;       Whereas in order to tackle these many and difficult      challenges, the appointment of a Presidential Special Envoy      for Sudan with a robust mandate and access to, and support      of, senior Administration officials, including the President,      is crucial;       Whereas Members of Congress, leading foreign policy      experts, and many nongovernmental organizations have called      repeatedly for the appointment of a Presidential Envoy for      Sudan to effectively represent the United States Government      in heading off a further escalation of genocide in Darfur;       Whereas United States Government officials have diligently      pursued peace agreements to end the North-South conflict and      the Darfur conflict and the United States Government has      provided more than $2 billion in assistance to help the      suffering people of Sudan; and       Whereas during a speech before the United Nations General      Assembly on September 19, 2006, President George W. Bush      announced the appointment of Andrew Natsios to serve as      Presidential Special Envoy for Sudan: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved,  That the House of Representatives--       (1) commends the many years of tireless efforts of United      States officials who have helped secure the Comprehensive      Peace Agreement and the Darfur Peace Agreement;       (2) strongly supports the appointment of an adequately      staffed Presidential Special Envoy for Sudan with a robust      mandate to develop and coordinate United States policy toward      Sudan with regular access to senior Administration officials;      and       (3) strongly urges the mandate of the Presidential Special      Envoy for Sudan to include--       (A) deterring a further escalation of violence and      humanitarian disaster in the Darfur region of Sudan while      ensuring civilians are adequately protected and the Darfur      Peace Agreement is fully implemented;       (B) facilitating the development of an international      peacekeeping mission to Darfur with a mandate to protect      civilians and humanitarian workers;       (C) ensuring implementation of the Comprehensive Peace      Agreement, which ended the 21-year civil war in Southern      Sudan, Nuba, Southern Blue Nile, and Abyei and helping secure      a just peace in Eastern Sudan;       (D) coordination of reconstruction and development work in      Southern Sudan and other marginalized areas;       (E) coordination and monitoring of the return of refugees      and displaced people to their homes in Darfur and southern      Sudan;       (F) securing and consolidating peace in Northern Uganda by      working closely with the Government of South Sudan and the      Government of Uganda;       (G) coordination of efforts to ensure implementation of the      transformation of the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA)      into a professional armed force;       (H) work toward achieving a peaceful, stable, and      democratic Sudan by ensuring that free and fair elections are      held, as called for in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, by      coordinating and implementing programs necessary to achieve      these objectives; and       (I) coordination of efforts to work toward achieving      accountability for the crimes committed in Darfur by working      closely with relevant individuals and entities engaged in      this area.
