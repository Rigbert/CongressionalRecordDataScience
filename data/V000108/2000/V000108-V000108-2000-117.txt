Speaker, it is my distinct honor to congratulate the Gary Educational Development Foundation on the occasion of its 25th anniversary. Founded in 1975, the Gary Education Development Foundation is committed to enhancing learning within the Gary Schools. Various external resources are utilized to help ensure that students of every level acquire the skills, knowledge, and vision needed for success in careers and as citizens.  Though the Gary Educational Development Foundation is celebrating its 25th anniversary of service, the seed for this revolutionary initiative was planted four decades ago with the idea of a fund to expand educational opportunities beyond those provided by tax dollars.  In December 1950, Gary College was dissolved. After the passage of a resolution offered by Dean Fertsch, the College Board of Directors donated its remaining fiscal assets to public school officials to be used by Gary students. The grant remained dormant until June 1956, when Acting Superintendent of Gary Public Schools Clarence Swingley assembled a group of high school principals to determine the disposition of the Gary College assets. The committee of principals divided the $11,153 of assets into a $10,000 scholarship endowment and left the remainder in an expendable account to be used for annual scholarship awards. The endowment fund was named the William A. Wirt Scholarship in memory of the first superintendent of Gary public schools.  The idea of the business community participating in the program evolved during the 1969-70 school years, when Frederick C. Ford was a member of the Gary School Board. The notion was warmly received by the business sector, and a steering committee was formed. It consisted of Superintendent Gordon McAndrew; board members Ford, YJean Chambers, Joe Torres and Montague Oliver; schools business manager Richard Bass; attorney Fred Eichorn and Assistant Superintendent Haron J. Battle. The committee established the Gary Educational Development Foundation as a not-for-profit corporation. In September 1970, Urban Ventures, Inc.--a non-profit corporation in Chicago with which Ford was involved--made the first donation of $28,000. The money was earmarked for the Foundation, but placed in escrow with the Gary Community Schools until the organization was fully established. In January 1977, the Gary School Board passed a resolution that recognized the Foundation as an operating entity, and pledged to it the support of the board and school system.  The school board then transferred several trust fund assets to the Foundation and encouraged gifts, bequests, legacies and other donations from varied sources. The trust funds included the assets for the Wirt and Urban Ventures scholarships. It also included two other ``identified'' funds: William Titzel contributions to assist primary teachers through workshops, and gifts toward a scholarship in memory of Catherine Hughes who served as supervisor of Foreign Languages for Gary schools. The foundation grew considerably from the modest nucleus of a $28,000 endowment, and exceeded $1.4 million in assets by 1990. The money continues to address the educational needs of Gary students--beyond those provided by tax dollars--and promises to benefit our community for generations to come.  Beyond the distinguished alliance with the education community, the Foundation has collaborated with other community organizations and programs that share the Foundation's commitment to the learning needs of Gary students. This year over sixty students in Gary will receive scholarships from the Foundation to help defray college costs.  The Gary Educational Development Foundation will hold an anniversary reception at the Genesis Center in Gary, Indiana on March 24, 2000, and a formal banquet will occur at St. Timothy's Church the following day.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my distinguished colleagues to join me in commending the Gary Educational Development Foundation on the occasion of its 25th anniversary. The hard work and dedication of everyone involved with this distinguished organization is truly inspirational.                          ____________________
