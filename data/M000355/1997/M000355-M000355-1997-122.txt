 THOMPSON. For about two decades we did not have a soft money problem because people abided under the rules laid down in 1974.  What has happened since that time is that soft money has come into the system and now we have about $262 million in soft money in the system that we didn't have back in 1974 when we laid down the rules at that time.  Mr. McCONNELL. Let me make sure I understand what the Senator is saying. The soft money problem has arisen in the Presidential years, for the most part. Is it not reasonable to assume that the reason the candidates having been spending the limit of the taxpayer funds, turning to soft money, it is a way to get around the spending limit, is that not correct?
