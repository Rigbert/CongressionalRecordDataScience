 President, I rise today to extend my strong support for S. 2307, the Department of Transportation's Appropriations Bill for FY 1999. This funding comes at a critical time for our nation and in particular, Washington state.  Mr. President, as I fly home each weekend, I join thousands of other commuters in the Puget Sound Region immersed in daily and agonizing gridlock. Our State Department of Transportation is working furiously to construct HOV lanes, park and rides and additional interchanges. I applaud our State Secretary Sid Morrison for his innovative thinking and leadership during this time of enormous growth.  Our region's economic boom has brought many advantages, however, its impact on mobility in the region has been dramatic and continually frustrates motorists. This bill will provide much needed relief for our Puget Sound Region and for infrastructure improvements throughout Washington state. I am most pleased that I was able to work with the committee to secure $60 million for the Puget Sound's Regional Transit Authority, known as Sound Move. This will include $47 million for commuter rail between Seattle and Tacoma and $13 million to begin light rail construction.  Additionally, I want to express my support for the committee's work in funding the Elliot Bay Water Taxi, the Columbia River Marine Fire and Safety Association, ITS systems near Spokane's SR 395, airport improvements at Everett's Paine Field, Boeing Field and the Pullman Airport.
