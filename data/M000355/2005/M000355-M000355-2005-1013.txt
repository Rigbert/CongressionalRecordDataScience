 President, I rise today to briefly celebrate the service of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. I met Justice O'Connor through my wife,Labor Secretary Elaine Chao. Justice O'Connor swore her in for two of the positions she has held in the Federal Government, as chairman of the Federal Maritime Commission and, also, most recently, as Secretary of Labor. Through Secretary Chao, I have seen her on several occasions socially. I must say that she is an extraordinary individual. During her time on the Court, Justice O'Connor has proven herself to be a brilliant jurist and a strong defender of the Constitution. She is known for her fairness and her desire to seek practical solutions for even the most difficult decisions upon which the Court had to rule.  Justice O'Connor has proved to be an independent thinker and a vigorous questioner, narrowing in on precise legal issues with laser-like precision from the bench. She has lived up to the promise to respect the Constitution and to interpret the law judiciously, seeking the narrowest reach possible for the Court's rulings. Justice O'Connor is known for approaching each case individually, seeking to arrive at practical conclusions.  Justice O'Connor has been a great advocate for the Court. She has traveled the globe, speaking to thousands of students, lawyers, foreign dignitaries, and others on the judiciary, the Constitution, and the law. Justice O'Connor's love of this Nation, its judicial process, and the law is widely known.  In her most recent book, ``Majesty of the Law, Reflections of a Supreme Court Justice,'' she insightfully describes the institution of the Court, its history, customs, and some of its most able members. Certainly, we will all agree that Justice O'Connor will long be remembered as one of the most distinguished persons ever to serve on the High Court. We wish her very well in her retirement.  I yield the floor.
