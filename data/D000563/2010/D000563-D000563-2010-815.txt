So the representation that these names or nominations are being held because of the leaders--meaning the Democratic and Republican leaders--is not accurate? There is no intention of the Democratic leader to hold any of these nominations; is that not true?  Mrs. McCASKILL. That is true.  Mr. President, notwithstanding rule XXII, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to Executive Calendar No. 500, which is the nomination of Julie Reiskin, member of the LSC; that the nomination be confirmed, the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, no further motions be in order, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and any statements relating to the nominee be printed at the appropriate place in the Record.
