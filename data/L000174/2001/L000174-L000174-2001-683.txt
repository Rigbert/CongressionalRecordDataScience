President, I am pleased today to be a original cosponsor of the Financial Information Privacy Protection Act of 2001. I am delighted to join Senator Sarbanes, the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, who is a real leader in the Senate on protecting personal financial information.  In November 1999, President Clinton signed into law the landmark Financial Modernization Act, which updated our financial laws and opens up the financial services industry to become more competitive, both at home and abroad. Many of my colleagues and I supported that legislation because we believe it will benefit businesses and consumers. It is already making it easier for banking, securities, and insurance firms to consolidate their services, cut expenses and offer more products at a lower cost to all. But this consolidation also raises new concern about our financial privacy.  New conglomerates in the financial services industry are offering a widening variety of services, each of which may require a customer to provide financial, medical or other personal information. Nothing in the new law prevents these new subsidiaries or affiliates of financial conglomerates from sharing this information for uses beyond those the customer thought he or she was providing it. For example, the new law has no requirement for the consumer to control whether these new financial subsidiaries or affiliates sell, share, or publish information on savings account balances, certificates of deposit maturity dates and balances, stock and mutual fund purchases and sales, life insurance payouts or health insurance claims. That is wrong.  I believe the Financial Information Privacy Protection Act of 2001 should serve as the foundation for model financial privacy legislation that Congress enacts into law this year. This bill is a common sense approach that can attract both consumers and the industry.  Privacy is one of our most vulnerable rights in the information age. Digitalization of information offers tremendous benefits but also new threats. Some in Congress are content to punt the privacy issue down the field for another year. The public disagrees. People know that the longer we dawdle, the harder it will be to halt the erosion of privacy. A year is an eternity in the digital age.  The right of privacy is a personal and fundamental right protected by the Constitution of the United States. But today, the American people are growing more and more concerned over encroachments on their personal privacy. To return personal financial privacy to the control of the consumer, this legislation would create the following rights in Federal law.  New Right To Opt-out of Information Sharing By Affiliates. The new financial modernization law permits consumers to say no to information sharing, selling or publishing among third parties in many cases, but not among affiliated firms. The Financial Information Privacy Act of 2001 would require financial conglomerates, which will only grow under the new modernization law, to expand this protection to give consumers the right to notify it (opt-out) to stop all information sharing, selling or publishing of personal financial information among all third parties and affiliates.  New Right For Consumers To Opt-In For Sharing of Medical Information and Personal Spending Habits. The Financial Information Privacy Protection Act of 2001 would require financial firms to get the affirmative consent (opt-in) of consumers before a firm could gain access to medical information within a financial conglomerate or share detailed information about a consumer's personal spending habits.  New Right To Access and Correct Financial Information. The Financial Information Privacy Protection Act of 2001 would give consumers the right to review and correct their financial records, just like consumers today may review and correct their credit reports.  New Right To Privacy Policy Up Front. The Financial Information Privacy Protection Act of 2001 would require financial firms to provide their privacy policies to consumers before committing to a customer relationship, not after. In addition, the bill's new rights would be enforced by federal banking regulators, the Federal Trade Commission and state attorney generals.  Unfortunately, if you have a checking account, you may have a financial privacy problem. Your bank may sell or share with business allies information about who you are writing checks to, when, and for how much. And even if you tell your bank to stop, it can ignore you under current law. This legislation returns to consumers the power to stop the selling or sharing of personal financial information.  Americans ought to be able to enjoy the exciting innovations of this burgeoning information era without losing control over the use of their financial information. The Financial Information Privacy Protection Act of 2001 updates United States privacy laws to provide these fundamentals protections of personal financial information in the evolving financial services industry. I urge my colleagues to support it.                                 ______                                       By
