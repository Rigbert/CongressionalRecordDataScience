 President, today, I rise to thank a longtime member of my staff who is retiring from the Senate. Mary Day began working in my Cedar Rapids office in 1987 as a constituent services specialist, and in 1996 rose to become the regional director based in the same office.  You would be hard pressed to find somebody in the region who doesn't know Mary. It is no wonder. She is a tireless worker for the 14-county area in eastern Iowa, and her infectious sense of humor, genuine demeanor, and kindness was sought by those she came across in her daily travels around the region.  There isn't anybody who knows the pulse of the community like Mary. She has been through the good, the bad, and the ugly. She has seen historic floods and business downturns. Through it all, Mary has remained a good-hearted, conscientious and effective staff member.  We spent many hours over the years traveling from county to county in her region. Mary wasn't always the most spirited or active person in the early hours of the day, but she was forever reliable and dependable no matter what hour of the day.  Not only has Mary been dedicated to the people of Iowa, but she also served as a mentor, confidant, and friend to others on my staff. Her colleagues say that Mary was their ``go-to'' person. She knew the bureaucracy inside and out and had sound advice on how to handle just about any situation.  The people of Iowa have been fortunate to have somebody like Mary Day working on their behalf for the last 23 years. I have been privileged to have her represent me in such a well-respected and honest manner.  Thank you, Mary, for everything you have done for me and the people of Iowa.                          ____________________
