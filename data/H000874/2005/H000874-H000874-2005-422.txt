Leader, the highway bill, we have discussed trying to reauthorize the highway bill, and both sides feel it is important to get it through. We have had the 8th extension, and that expires this coming Tuesday. Can the leader shed some light on the status of the conference?  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer) is correct. The highway bill is, as we all know, an incredibly important bill. It is an important jobs bill. It is important for the infrastructure of this country. Maybe that is why it is taking so long to do this. But the conference on the highway bill is slowly rolling along. Compromises are being made in some key areas. I am optimistic that a conference report can be ready maybe even next week, but certainly be ready in the next 2 weeks.
