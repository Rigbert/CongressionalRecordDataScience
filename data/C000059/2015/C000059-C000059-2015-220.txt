Chairman, I wish the gentlewoman was able to share this amendment with both the majority and the minority in the committee where we could have reviewed it. But saying that, I still must oppose the amendment because of the offset.  Mr. Chairman, the offset obviously would take money from the Secretary and move it over to the EPA, and at this time we have used the Secretary's Office tremendously as an offset already, and I am afraid that this may start affecting other programs within the Department of the Interior. So I would have to oppose this amendment.  The gentlewoman's amendment won't increase the cleanup of a brownfields site, it will only pay for salaries over at the EPA, and I believe that we don't need to do any more for the EPA than has already been done.  So with that, Mr. Chairman, I oppose the amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.
