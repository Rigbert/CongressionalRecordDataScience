 President, I rise today to honor the heroic efforts of an honored Kentuckian. Known for his service and his allegiance to his country, PFC Marvin Clevinger is a true World War II hero in Pike County, KY.  Born March 18, 1922, to James and Dollie May Clevinger, Marvin was the eldest of eight. Growing up on a farm in eastern Kentucky, Mr. Clevinger, also known as ``Garl'' around his family, was an intelligent young man who dropped out of the 7th grade to help provide for his family. Working as a timber man and a farmer before his days as a soldier, ``Garl'' did all he could to help his family as well as his community.  After enrolling in the war, Private First Class Clevinger, also known as ``Zeke'' to his platoon, fought in numerous battles, putting his life on the line for his country. Clevinger was said to be amongst the strongest and most agile of the soldiers and was honored with the privilege of being a scout for his platoon. In one battle, when his platoon found itself pinned by German machine gun fire, Private First Class Clevinger advanced 150 yards under intense fire and threw several grenades to silence the enemy. He received a Bronze Star for his heroic actions.  Private First Class Clevinger spent a month in the hospital in Paris after receiving multiple wounds in his legs during battle. He received numerous medals, awards, and decorations, including the Bronze Star with Three Oak Leaf Clusters, the Purple Heart, the Good Conduct Medal, the Rifle Sharpshooter Badge, the Combat Infantryman Badge, the American Campaign Ribbon, the World War II Victory Medal Ribbon, and the European/African/Middle Eastern Theatre Campaign Ribbon.  Marvin Clevinger returned to Belcher, KY, after the war and worked for the Russell Fork Coal Company Preparation Plant for 32 years. Currently, Marvin is an active member of Ferrell's Creek Church of Christ, and he serves as an inspiration to his family. Because of his hard work and all he has achieved and overcome in his 89 years, Marvin Clevinger is a hero to us all.  Mr. President, the Appalachian News Express recently published an article highlighting Marvin Clevinger's life and service. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:           [From the Appalachian News Express, May 28, 2011]                 Marvin Clevinger: A World War II Hero                           (By Nancy M. Goss)       Belcher.--Over 66 years ago 89-year-old Marvin ``Garl''      Clevinger of Belcher fought in the European Campaign during      World War II.       Because he suffered a stroke 10 years ago that affected his      ability to converse fluently, Marvin allowed family members      to tell his story, adding comments from time to time. His      nephew, Phillip Ratliff, is an authority on his uncle's role      in World War II and provided most of this information.       ``I fought in Germany,'' Marvin said. Then added, ``I was      shot three times.''       ``Marvin never really talked about his war time experiences      when I was young, but I'm familiar with the battles he was      in,'' Phillip said. ``I was always fascinated by soldiers and      military stuff so I just read a lot and later on, I had the      little campaign book Garl brought back from the war and I      read it a couple times.''       Marvin is mentioned in the book by the nickname his platoon      gave him, ``Zeke'' Clevinger.       Phillip said there were probably only about 200 copies of      the campaign booklet of Marvin's company's actions during the      war; they were given to the men at the end of the fighting.       Marvin's rank and unit: PFC Marvin Clevinger, 1st Rifle      Squad, 2nd Platoon, Company B, 61st Armored Infantry      Battalion, 10th Armored Division, 3rd Army, USA.       He was also a scout for his platoon.       ``Only a couple men in a platoon were scouts,'' Phillip      explained. ``Back then, if there was a man like Marvin, who      was agile and able to move through heavy woods and rough      terrain, he was pretty much sought out.''       Many of the men were city boys and not used to tramping      through woods as was Marvin, who grew up in the mountains of      Eastern Kentucky.       ``Garl was a deadly shot when he was a young man and came      back from the war,'' Phillip said. ``I feel sorry for any      human that got in front of his rifle sight because you're      talking about a man who could shoot squirrels out of a tree      with a 22 rifle. And in the army, those men were pretty      valuable, I'd say.''       ``He got the medal for sharp shooter,'' added Marvin's      brother Paul. ``And the Purple Heart and Bronze Star.''       According to a paper accompanying his Bronze Star:       ``Private First Class Marvin Clevinger, Company B, Armored      Infantry Battalion, United States Army. For heroic      achievement in connection with military operations against an      enemy of the United States in Germany on March 26, 1945.      During an attack on Schoden, Germany, an infantry platoon was      suddenly pinned down by machine gun and sniper fire from a      well-concealed pillbox. Private First Class Clevinger, scout,      advanced 150 yards under the intense fire to within five      yards of the enemy position from where he threw grenades      through an embrasure in the pillbox, silencing the enemy      fire. PFC Clevinger's intrepid action reflects great credit      upon himself and the military forces of the United States.      Entered the military service from Belcher, Kentucky.''       Marvin was shot twice in one leg and once in the other, but      still managed to walk and crawl about three miles to an aid      station that was back down the side of the mountain. He spent      a month and a half in Paris at the hospital and then went      straight back to the front lines and saw heavy action again.       Phillip said the winter of '44, during the Battle of the      Bulge, was the coldest winter of the 20th century and Marvin      got frostbit, as did most of the men in his unit.       Besides the battle at Schoden and the Battle of the Bulge,      Martin also fought in the Battle of Bastogne, and at the      Saar-Moselle Triangle, Trier, Berdorf, Consdorf, Echtemach,      Landau, Oehringer, Heilbronn, Ulm, Inst, Oberammergau and      countless other sites.       Marvin was born March 18, 1922, the son of the late James      and Dollie May Clevinger. He was raised at Belcher, close to      where he lives now, and according to Paul, attended Belcher      Grade School up to seventh grade. He had to quit to help on      the family's farm. He is the oldest of eight children. He,      his sister Faye Potter, and Paul, are the only ones living.       Before Marvin went to war, he timbered and farmed. After      the war, he was employed in the preparation plant at the      Russell Fork Coal Company, owned by A.T. Massey, where he      worked for 32 years. He was a member of United Mine Workers      of America, Local 8338, at Beaver, which closed many years      ago.       Marvin said he remembers working at the coal company.       ``He would come home from work at the tipple and hoe corn      until dark,'' Phillip said. ``For his size, Garl was the      strongest guy and the hardest working man I ever saw.''       ``He had been out pulling brush and trees down on the road      on the day he had the stroke,'' said Gloria Sweeney, Marvin's      cousin and caretaker.       ``And he knew the woods,'' Phillip said. ``If you went into      the woods any time of the year with him, whether there were      leaves on the trees or not, he could look at the tree and      tell you, ``that's a black oak, that's a chestnut oak, that's      a red oak . . .''.       ``He was an expert on ginseng, too,'' added his nephew      Jason Clevinger. ``Every time we went into the woods--and he      was much older than I--he could find much more than I      could.''       Marvin was an active member of DAV Chapter 140, Elkhorn      City, until he had the stroke and is a member of the Ferrells      Creek Church of Christ.       ``You'll never find a more humble man than this one right      here,'' Gloria said. ``Best man in the world.''       ``He was always my hero,'' Phillip said.       Then he added, ``There's a much larger story here really,      even than Garl. He deserves to be the centerpiece because of      what he did, but Garl had two first cousins and they all grew      up in this holler here. One of his cousins was named Clyde      Clevinger and he was killed in action during the first Allied      landings in North Africa. His other first cousin's name was      Gordon ``Bennett'' Clevinger. Bennett enlisted in the Navy      and was on an American submarine right after Pearl Harbor and      was captured by the Japanese. He spent about three and a half      years in a Japanese prisoner of war camp. But he did survive      and came home.       ``Of those three boys who grew up in this little narrow      holler here, all of them were heroes. You can't find men like      that anymore,'' Phillip said.                          ____________________
