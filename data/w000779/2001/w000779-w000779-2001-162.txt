President, I rise as the original cosponsor of the Pelton Dam Agreement legislation introduced today by my friend and colleague from Oregon, Senator Gordon Smith.  This legislation sanctions an historic agreement, reached on April 12, 2000, between the Oregon Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation, Warm Springs, Portland General Electric Company, PGE, and the United States Department of the Interior (Department). This agreement is important because it sets a responsible precedent for the joint ownership and operation of the Pelton-Round Butte Hydroelectric Project located in Jefferson County, Oregon, on the Deschutes River. It also provides a model for how the United States, Indian tribes and private companies can work together to solve contentious issues.  Beginning in the summer of 1998, the Warm Springs and PGE began negotiations to settle Pelton Dam Project ownership and operation issues. Approximately one-third of the Project lands are located on the Warm Springs Reservation. Because of the Department's legal trust responsibility to the Warm Springs, Department representatives also participated in the negotiations. On April 12, 2000, Department, Warm Springs and PGE representatives signed the Long Term Global Settlement and Compensation Agreement (Agreement). The Agreement creates shared ownership responsibilities and benefits between PGE and the Warm Springs for all three Pelton Project dams and facilities located both on and off the Warm Springs Reservation.  The Warm Springs, PGE and the Department worked with myself and Senator Smith to carefully craft this legislation to authorize the Department to sanction the Agreement. This legislation provides Federal approval for only the aspects of the Agreement that affect tribal lands, resources, or other tribal assets. Section 2(b)(1) makes it clear that the legislation does not affect the normal Federal and State regulatory approvals that would be required for an agreement of this type. Section 2(b)(2) was included to address a Departmental concern that this legislation will not be interpreted to mean that legislative approval of future similar agreements will be necessary. In addition, this bill authorizes a 99-year leasing authority for the Warm Springs that is shared by countless other tribes.  This bill is supported by PGE, the Warm Springs Tribe and Jefferson County.                                 ______                                       By
