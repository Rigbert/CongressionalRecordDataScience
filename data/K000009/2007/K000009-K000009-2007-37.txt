Chairman, I just want to place on the record that Issa's amendment, Issa's choice, is would you rather have the inventor shot with a pistol or a rifle? In either case, he or she ends up dead.  Now, why is that? Because the 1999 Patent Act required the Patent Office to publish on the Internet a patent application 18 months from the date of filing. But the issue really is, it takes an average of 31 months for patent review. Mr. Issa, I think, brings it up to 24 months. Thus, what happens is there's a gap between when it's filed and when it's approved, and you have to go up on the Internet. Under current law, you can opt out of that so you can protect your invention and not have some pirate in China or Japan or somewhere else take it from you. That is not in this bill.  The elimination of the opt-out provision is a terrible, terrible omission and a major change from existing law, and the Issa amendment does not make it better.
