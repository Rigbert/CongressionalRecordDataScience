 President, I would like to say a brief word about last night's tragedy near Waco. From the media reports we have seen, there have clearly been a great many injuries and a terrible loss of life. We are all thinking of and praying for the victims and their families.  Given the horrendous event at the Boston Marathon on Monday, followed by the event near Waco last night, it has been a very difficult week for all of us. Our hearts are a little bit heavier.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
