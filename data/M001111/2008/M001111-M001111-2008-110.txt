 President, I have not received answers to those questions either. This is a critically important matter. What happens if France or Russia--which, by the way, is pushing to increase its stake in EADS--want to slow down our military capacity because they do not like our policies? Do we want another country to have that kind of control for decades to come--especially given the concerns the Defense Secretary has now raised about decisionmaking and leadership at the Air Force? I think we have to push for an explanation before we move forward on this contract.  I have detailed this morning three very serious concerns about Airbus and EADS.
