This is not the way to address it. I thought it was the only way to bring the subject up before the Senate. I wish to ask the Senator from Wyoming, whom I respect and I have worked with and we have been able to work out some very serious difficulties in the past and I know he genuinely wants to reach solutions, can the Senator from Wyoming give me his assurance that he will try to schedule hearings in the consideration of this issue on a timely basis before his committee so that we can raise this issue in a thoughtful way and address it beyond the Department of Defense?
