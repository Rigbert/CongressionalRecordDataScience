Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Dornan resolution as the only crystal-clear vote this House will cast on this precedent-setting U.S. military involvement of our ground forces in an unstable former Soviet bloc nation.  I rise in support of the Dornan resolution as the only crystal clear vote this House will cast on this precedent-setting U.S. military involvement of our ground forces in an unstable former Soviet bloc nation. The most assured way of maintaining our troops' safety is not sending them there in the first place.  Moreover, there is no possibility that the age-old hatreds that have fueled the killings and plunder in the former Yugoslavia will be calmed in one year. Reestablishing civility in that region will require years of dedicated commitment, and the resources to back it up. Other instabilities in that corner of the globe are likely to bubble up in years ahead. Unless Europe, now rebuilt 50 years after World War II, seizes its proper leadership role, the United States cannot keep filling the vacuum. The initial cost of U.S. ground force involvement is projected at $2.6 billion including an initial $600 million for rebuilding roads, bridges and infrastructure. The cost in American lives tonight is uncertain. This operation is high risk and its ultimate resolution unclear. Thus, before committing U.S. forces, it is critical to ask the Clinton Administration:  Under what Constitutional authority is your Administration committing 20,000 U.S. ground forces to Bosnia and thousands more to adjacent nations?  Under what specific treaty obligation and amended obligations is your Administration committing U.S. ground forces to Bosnia?  Please define peace-keeping.  Please outline the mission in Bosnia and when our nation will know it has succeeded and thus withdraw.  Please define peace-making.  In the past, when, where and through what legal or treaty authority has the U.S. deployed ground forces through NATO, or other European Security institutions for ``peace-keeping'' operations in the former Soviet bloc?  Since the administration's Bosnia initiative is precedent-setting--U.S. ground forces in a former, unstable Soviet nation--on what basis will our forces be committed to other internal civil wars in the future? What will be the U.S. military ``peacekeeping'' relationship to the United Nations, NATO and other such international entities in the future?  Has the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe formally requested NATO assistance in Bosnia? Please provide the document requesting such involvement.  What is the role of the Western European Union, if any, in the Bosnia deployment?  Is Eurocorps functional and what force level has it committed to Bosnia?  Describe the Bosnian Commission that is to settle property disputes and its legal structure. Is it operational? If not, when will it become functional?  How does the United States role in Bosnia differ from our role in Lebanon?  Do the three parties to the peace accord--Presidents Milosevic, Izetbegovic, Tudjamn--represent legitimate authority for their respective constituencies? Through what legal process was each elected to preside over those countries? Please detail the nature of their respective elections.  Finally, why in this post Cold War era--when the U.S. citizenry has been clamoring for more defense-burden sharing by U.S. allies--has the U.S. again been asked to assume the central role in resolving this situation, even convening the peace talks in Dayton, OH, rather than on the European continent.  This matter is a defining moment in U.S. foreign policy in that the U.S. is being asked to substitute for European resolve.  In the NATO nations of Europe we have thousands of European trained, deployable troops that could be dispatched immediately to the Bosnia region in the event a final peace accord is signed in Paris.  Let me read to you the countries and the number of their combat ready troops:Belgium..........................................................63,000Denmark..........................................................27,000France..........................................................409,000Germany.........................................................367,300Greece..........................................................159,300Italy...........................................................322,300Luxembourg..........................................................800Netherlands......................................................70,900Norway...........................................................33,500Portugal.........................................................50,700Spain...........................................................206,500Turkey..........................................................503,800United Kingdom..................................................254,300                                                               ________  Total.......................................................2,468,400  The Administration states that Europe, since 1914, has been unable to effectively maintain the peace and there was no other recourse but for the U.S. to assume the lead in bringing the warring factions to peaceful resolution. We are urged not to become ``isolationist''.  The truth is the long-term prospects for peace in this troubled region are slim. Once the NATO troops withdraw, it will require 50 years of cooling off between warring factions and maintenance of borders by external forces to give peace a chance, not a one-year quick fix. And who will commit to that? Who will pay for it?
