Mr. Speaker, I insert this exchange of letters between Don Young and Sherwood Boehlert for the Record.                                         House of Representatives,                                         Committee on Science,                               Washington, DC, September 29, 2006.     Hon. Don Young,     Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,          Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to you concerning the      jurisdictional interest of the Science Committee in matters      being considered in H.R. 6233--To amend the Safe,      Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A      Legacy for Users to make technical corrections, and for other      purposes. The bill amends research portions of H.R. 3, Safe,      Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A      Legacy for Users (P.L. 109-59), which are within the Science      Committee's jurisdiction. The Science Committee acknowledges      the importance of H.R. 6233 and the need for the legislation      to move expeditiously. Therefore, while we have a valid claim      to jurisdiction over the bill, I agree not to request a      sequential referral. This, of course, is conditional on our      mutual understanding that nothing in this legislation or my      decision to forgo a sequential referral waives, reduces or      otherwise affects the jurisdiction of the Science Committee,      and that a copy of this letter and of your response will be      included in the Congressional Record when the bill is      considered on the House floor.       The Science Committee also asks that you support our      request to be conferees on any provisions over which we have      jurisdiction during House-Senate conference on this      legislation.       Thank you for your attention to this matter.           Sincerely,                                                Sherwood Boehlert,     Chairman.                                  ____         House of Representatives, Committee on Transportation and            Infrastructure,                               Washington, DC, September 29, 2006.     Hon. Sherwood L. Boehlert,     Chairman, Committee on Science,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter of September      29, 2006, regarding H.R. 6233, making technical corrections      to SAFETEA: LU, and for your willingness to waive      consideration of provisions in the bill that fall within your      Committee's jurisdiction under House Rules.       I agree that your waiving consideration of relevant      provisions of H.R. 6233 does not waive your Committee's      jurisdiction over the bill. I also acknowledge your right to      seek conferees on any provisions that are under your      Committee's jurisdiction during any House-Senate conference      on H.R. 6233 or similar legislation, and will support your      request for conferees on such provisions.       As you request, your letter and this response will be      included in the Congressional Record during consideration on      the House floor.       Thank you for your cooperation in moving this important      legislation.           Sincerely,                                                        Don Young,                                                         Chairman.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.
