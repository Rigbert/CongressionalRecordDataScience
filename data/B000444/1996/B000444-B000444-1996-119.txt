 Then I will be happy to yield.  First of all, the Republican-appointed Director of the Congressional Budget Office states in the latest CBO report--and I quote from the summary page:       Both the Congress and the President, however, have proposed      changes in policies that would balance the budget in 2002.  Let me read it again.       Both the Congress and the President, however, have proposed      changes in policies that would balance the budget in the year      2002.  I am reading from the ``Economic and Budget Outlook, Fiscal Years 1997 to 2002, Report to the Senate and House Committees on the Budget, Congress of the United States, Congressional Budget Office.''  The second point that I will make: That does not suggest that what my friend said is not true, but it is kind of like you have to watch the pea and the shells here.  The idea of these dual books, the President all along has said the economy is going to grow more robustly, has all along said that the CBO's estimates are too cabined, that things are going to be better than they say. So far he looks like he is right. But he said, ``You want me to do it according to the way you want the numbers,'' which I do not think are realistic numbers. I think they are too conservative. Business thinks they are too conservative. Everybody thinks they are too conservative except our conservative Republican friends.  He said, ``OK, if that's the deal, I'll submit a budget based on that.'' And he submitted a budget based on that. Their Republican-appointed Director of the Congressional Budget Office said, ``Yeah, he submitted one on that, and it balances that way.''  It is not, then, inconsistent for the President to say, ``By the way, I submitted it,'' but basically saying, ``I am predicting to you things are going to be better than these economic forecasts called for. If it turns out the economic forecast is as bad as you all say it is going to be, then this is what we're going to have to do to balance it. I will balance it under those conditions.''  But what he is saying makes it sound sinister, this two-book thing. He is saying, ``But my prediction to you is, you won't have to do it this badly, you won't have to cut this much.'' He is not saying, ``I won't do it if the economic forecasts turn out this way.'' He is just saying, ``I don't think the economic forecasts are going to be that way.''  You know, it is kind of like my saying to my son or my daughter when they were teenagers--they say, ``Dad, I want to go away to camp, and I would like to go for 2 weeks to camp.'' I say, ``How much is camp, honey?'' They say,``Well, it's $100 a week.'' I say, ``I don't have $200. I've got $100. We'll sign you up for camp for 1 week. You're going, but I think I'm going to find another $100, and I think before it's time to go to camp you'll get to go for 2 weeks because I think economically I'm going to find another $100. But if I don't, you only go for 1 week.''  These guys make everything sound so sinister. Like, you know, ``Well, let's find the fingerprints on budget No. 2.''  So all I am saying to you is, keep your eye on the ball. The bottom line in this budget debate, no pun intended, is the summary of the Republican-led Congressional Budget Office that says--unless they changed their mind in the last couple hours--both the Congress and the President, however, have proposed changes in policy that would balance the budget in 2002.  Now, Mr. President, a number of our colleagues, including two who have just spoken, have once again attacked the President's budget as providing too little in appropriated spending. I find this a fascinating debate. They say, ``By the way, you are not going to balance the budget because you have two books. You really do not mean it. You are really going to cut something you have not told us,'' et cetera. But then they say, ``By the way, one of the reasons we do not like this President's budget is it provides too little in appropriated spending.''  They criticize the President's cuts as being too painful. It is true, the President's budget does make substantial cuts in discretionary spending. But the cuts in the Republican budget are far deeper. Over the 6 years of the budget, the Republican budget cuts appropriated spending by $68 billion more than the President's budget. In the year about which the Senator from Missouri most complains, 2002, the Republican budget cuts appropriated spending by $16 billion more than does the President's budget, using the assumptions that we are both using.  If the Senator from Missouri and others find the President's budget cuts too painful, and they are painful, he must find the Republican budget positively deadly.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent two tables comparing the cuts in the Republican budget with those of the President's budget be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                COMPARISON OF BUDGET PLANS: 6-YEAR TOTALS                                       [In billions of dollars]                        ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                   President's   Republican                                                   budget       budget     Difference------------------------------------------------------------------------Spending cuts:                                                              Discretionary................         -230         -298          -68    Mandatory:                                                                  Medicare.................         -117         -168          -51        Medicaid.................          -54          -72          -18        Other health \1\.........            9           10            1        Welfare..................          -38          -53          -15        EITC.....................           -5          -19          -14        Spectrum auctions........          -37          -19           18        Other mandatory..........          -24          -34          -10                                  --------------------------------------          Subtotal...............         -265         -355          -90                                  ======================================Revenues: \2\                                                                   Tax relief and other.....           99          180           81        Corporate reforms........          -40          -21           19        Other proposals..........           -5          (?)            5        Expiring provisions......          -43          -36            7                                  --------------------------------------          Subtotal...............           11          122          112                                  ======================================Policy savings...................         -485         -531          -46Debt service.....................          -41          -49           -8                                  --------------------------------------      Total savings..............         -525         -580          -552002 deficit/surplus.............            0            5            5------------------------------------------------------------------------\1\ Health care reforms in President's budget; GME add-back in            Republican plan.                                                      \2\ The Republican plan reconciles a net tax change of $122 billion over  6 years, but includes reserve fund language that allows for additional  tax cuts on a revenue neutral basis.
