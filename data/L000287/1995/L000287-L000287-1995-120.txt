Mr. Speaker, I rise today to say that the nomination of Dr. Henry Foster as Surgeon General of the United States is a choice of great vision.  This nomination should not and must not be about how many abortions Dr. Foster has performed. Those who oppose a woman's right to choose must take that fight somewhere else. Every woman in America has the right to choose--that is the law of the land. Dr. Foster has done nothing wrong.  Dr. Foster has done a great deal that is right. He has become a leading authority on reducing infant mortality and preventing teen pregnancy and drug abuse.  This is a man who has spent a lifetime working to improve the lives of others. It is clear to me that Dr. Foster should be confirmed as Surgeon General. There are no more questions that need to be answered. Dr. Foster should be confirmed and he should be confirmed now.                          ____________________
