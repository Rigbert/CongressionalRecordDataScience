Speaker, I will vote in support of H. Res. 326, a non-binding resolution reiterating the U.S. House of Representatives' support for long-standing U.S. policy to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through a negotiated two-state solution.  I have consistently supported a two-state solution throughout my time in Congress. While there is no perfect solution to this complex and heated conflict, I believe a negotiated two-state solution between Israeli and Palestinian leaders is a viable framework to achieve security, peace, and address the legitimate needs of both peoples.  Furthermore, I am pleased that H. Res. 326 condemns actions by the Trump administration and the Israeli government under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu which have severely undermined the possibility of a two-state solution.  For example, H. Res. 326 puts the House of Representatives on the record as opposing unilateral annexation of territory. This is an important rebuke of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's disturbing announcement that he plans to annex large swathes of the occupied Palestinian territories, a move that I strongly oppose.  Additionally, I am opposed to President Trump's decision to discontinue bilateral assistance to the Palestinians and U.S. contributions to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). That's why I am pleased H. Res. 326 states that ``it is in the United States' interest to continue promoting the security, stability, and humanitarian well-being of Palestinians and their neighbors by resuming the provision of foreign assistance pursuant to United States law.''  I am also pleased this resolution opposes the Trump administration's continued greenlighting of Israeli settlement expansion in the West Bank. This declaration is especially timely given the Trump administration's recent outrageous reversal of the decades-long U.S. position that Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories are against international law. I also joined my colleagues in signing a letter condemning President Trump's reversal.  However, while I support this resolution, I believe it should have gone further to address additional actions by the Trump administration and the Netanyahu government which have severely undermined a two-state solution.  For example, H. Res. 326 fails to condemn the Trump administration's decision to recognize the city of Jerusalem as the Israeli capital and to relocate the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, and it fails to denounce the Netanyahu government's continued human rights abuses, including demolition of Palestinian homes and villages, military detention of Palestinian children, and more. Protecting human rights, regardless of any ongoing tension between Israelis and Palestinians, should be a fundamental American value.  Additionally, the original text of H. Res. 326--which I cosponsored--included a call for an ``end to the occupation'' of Palestinian territory. Unfortunately, this language was removed from the final version brought to the floor.  As an ally of Israel, the United States invests more than $3 billion in aid to Israel annually, and H. Res. 326 reiterates U.S. support for this aid. Accordingly, I believe it is only appropriate that lawmakers voice their legitimate concerns with Israeli policies in a constructive way, as I have done throughout my time in Congress and will continue to do.  Unfortunately, recent rhetoric over U.S.-Israeli relations and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has devolved into a divisive--and even partisan--war of words. It is only through thoughtful, respectful, nuanced debate that Congress can productively contribute towards resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and addressing the legitimate needs of both peoples. The bottom line is it is critical that the U.S. pursue policies that will move Israelis and Palestinians towards a negotiated, two-state solution, and I will continue to push the Trump administration and Congress to do so.                          ____________________
