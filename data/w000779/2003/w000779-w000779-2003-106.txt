President, I have enjoy working with my colleague from Maine over the last 5 or 6 months.  This amendment is especially important because it would mean for the first time the Congress is going to restrict the funds under this effort for reconstruction to only those contracts let in an open and competitive bid, except in very narrow circumstances.  In my view, much of the work to rebuild Iraq has been outsourced to private companies and it is now time, with this legislation, to end the outsourcing of accountability. What our constituents have said is: How much is this whole effort going to cost? How long is it going to take? And how is this money going to be spent?  As I have said, my view is that right now the contracting process looks a little like Dodge City before the marshall showed up. It seems very influential companies and others seem to write the rules that the United States is essentially in the dark.
