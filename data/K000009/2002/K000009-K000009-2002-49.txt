Speaker, the best you can say about the comments made yesterday by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Armey), the House Republican leader, of U.S. companies fleeing to offshore locations in order to reap additional tax benefits, is that he spoke from his heart, and the heart of the Republican Party.  At the same time as his party was raising over $30 million up the street at the Washington Convention Center from groups like the pharmaceutical industry, Congressional Quarterly reported that he defended the actions of corporations to move their headquarters abroad to reduce their tax burdens. With all his party is taking from the Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds, his remarks reveal the true heart of the Republican Party: Take our people's money before everything, before Social Security and Medicare, before prescription drugs, before jobs in America.  So the best I can do is to thank the Republican leader for revealing the true heart of the Republican Party. It is the reason this Member is a Democrat.                          ____________________
