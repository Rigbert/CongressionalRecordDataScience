If there is anything he overlooked, it was in addition to our having electricity, power, and energy in the country, it is also the No. 1 national security issue.  I can remember, as can the Senator from Idaho, way back in the Reagan administration when we were about 37 percent dependent on foreign countries for our ability to fight a war, and we still did not have an energy policy. As did the Senator from Idaho, I talked to President Bush, then-Governor Bush, before he ran, and he committed himself to an energy policy. It is absolutely essential. I agree we should stay whatever time it takes to get it done.                          ____________________
