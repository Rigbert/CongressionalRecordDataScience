 President, I want to say to the Senator from Texas how much I appreciate what he had to say. There is no question that he gets it. It is all about the first amendment. It is all about the first amendment and the rights of Americans to have their say.  This bill, as the Senator from Texas pointed out, is simply trying to pick winners and losers. It takes the parties and it crushes them. And the irony of it all is there will be way more money spent in the next election than there was in the last one. It just won't be spent by the parties.  So we have taken resources away from the parties, which will be spent otherwise because of all of these other efforts, as the Senator from Texas pointed out. And I assure him I will be in court. I will be the plaintiff, and we will win if we have to go to court. Efforts to restrict the voices of outside groups will be struck down.  I hope we will be able to save the ability of parties to engage in speech that isn't federally regulated, which is what soft money is. It is everything that isn't hard money. I thank the Senator from Texas for always being there on so many issues, and especially for the kind things he said tonight about this struggle. It isn't a lot of fun being the national pinata. But there are some rewards.  I say to my friend from Texas my reward is that I really could not think of a group of enemies I would rather have than the ones I have made in this debate. I can't think of a single set of friends I would rather be associated with than people such as the Senator from Texas, who understand what freedom is all about and understand what this debate is all about.  I say to my colleague, we may lose tonight, but we will ultimately win this no matter how long it takes; we will win it. I thank him so much for being there when it counts.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
