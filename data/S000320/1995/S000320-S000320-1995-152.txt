 President, the House rescinded $136,593,000 from buildings for which funds have been appropriated in the fund.  A number of projects they included were inserted by the Senate, most, but not all have been authorized by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, but not the House Public Works Committee.  The committee chose to rescind $241,011,000 from new construction and repair and alterations projects.  Some of the projects the committee included have not been authorized by the Senate.  Some are included because GSA has indicated savings as a result of last year's time out and review.  Some have been canceled or delayed. We did not take all of the funds in some cases, nor did we take all of the projects GSA indicated where savings might be attained as a result of time out and review.  We attempted to take Members concerns into account in making our decision.  Our total cuts are significantly over the House and there will plenty of room to negotiate in conference.  We might not agree, but this is a significant adjustment.  I say to the Senate do not make it a political bidding war regarding projects.  I have tried to be fair in this process as the Senator from Nebraska is aware. Should we follow the Senator from Nebraska and his process, in all fairness, should we not put all projects on the table. I have a list here which includes all of the new construction projects, repair and alteration projects, as well as, the time out and review savings the GSA has indicated can be saved.  The project list is inclusive of projects where no construction has begun.  I hope we will not get into this on the Senate floor.  I believe a majority of my colleagues agrees with me as they did in the appropriations committee, so at the appropriate time I will move to table the Kerrey amendment.
