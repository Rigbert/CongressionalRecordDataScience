 And that would, relating to the list of the 16 amendments, make it five of them relating to firearms, including the one Senator John Kerry filed. The point being, it was filed almost 4 hours ago at the desk in accordance with the rule requiring first degrees to have been filed.  The only point I want to make is there is not any subterfuge here that no one knows what is going on. We may not know what is going on because we did not go look, but it has been filed. It is there. We have, of the total of 16 amendments we are talking about, five of them relating to firearms.  We are ready to vote. We can dispose of all these amendments including those five amendments I have just referenced. It can all be done and all finished before the cloture vote tomorrow if there is good faith to try to move. We are willing to enter into time agreements.  What I would like to suggest, since we cannot enter into a time agreement on those five amendments, maybe while the Republican side is responding to Senator John Kerry's amendment--and a further parliamentary inquiry--I mean Robert Kerrey's amendment --what is the pending business?
