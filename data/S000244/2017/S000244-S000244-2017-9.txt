Speaker, I proudly rise to recognize the March for Life on Friday January 27th, 2017 here in Washington D.C. This is a gathering of thousands of Americans from across our great country, all who are standing up for the protection of unborn children.  Ever since the abysmal ruling by the Supreme Court in Roe vs. Wade, the barbaric practice of abortion on demand has been rampant in our country. All too often we fall into the trap of conflating women's health with abortion, assuming that if one supports protecting life, then we're failing to care for women's health. Nothing could be further from the truth.  I stand here today with the millions of Americans across our country who believe that the lives of innocent children must be protected. I have long been a staunch advocate for pro-life issues despite vocal opposition. As Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, I shepherded the partial-birth abortion ban through Congress. It was one of my greatest honors to watch President George W. Bush sign it into law, and I was relieved that the Supreme Court upheld it. I have fully supported every effort in Congress to stop federally funded abortions, both in the United States and abroad, and will continue to fight efforts to federally fund these horrific practices.                          ____________________
