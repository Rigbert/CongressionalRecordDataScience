 President, last month the former Chairman of the Federal Communications Commissions, Newton Minow, delivered the Morris I. Liebman Lecture at Loyola College in Baltimore.  Mr. Minow's address was entitled ``The Whisper of America,'' and is focused on the need for the United States to significantly increase the resources it devotes to international broadcasting.  I believe Mr. Minow makes a very thoughtful case for expanding our efforts in this area. In order that it may be available to a wider audience, and to call it to the attention of my colleagues, I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                         The Whisper of America       In World War II, when the survival of freedom was still far      from certain, the United States created a new international      radio service, the Voice of America. On February 24, 1942,      William Harlan Hale opened the German-language program with      these words: ``Here speaks a voice from America. Every day at      this time we will bring you the news of the war. The news may      be good. The news may be bad. We will tell you the truth.''       My old boss, William Benton, came up with the idea of the      Voice of America. He was then Assistant Secretary of State      and would later become Senator from Connecticut. He was      immensely proud of the Voice of America. One day he described      the new VOA to RCA Chairman David Sarnoff, the tough-minded      and passionate pioneer of American broadcasting. Sarnoff      noticed how little electronic power and transmitter scope the      VOA had via short-wave radio, then said, ``Benton, all you've      got here is the whisper of America.''       Although The Voice of America, and later other      international radio services, have made valuable      contributions, our international broadcasting services suffer      from miserly funding. In many areas of the world, they have      seldom been more than a whisper. Today, when we most need to      communicate our story, especially in the Middle East, our      broadcasts are not even a whisper. People in every country      know our music, our movies, our clothes, and our sports. But      they do not know our freedom or our values or our democracy.       I want to talk with you about how and why this happened,      and what we must do about it.       First, some history:       At first, the Voice of America was part of the Office of      War Information. When the war ended, the VOA was transferred      to the Department of State. With the beginning of the Cold      War, officials within the government began to debate the core      mission of the VOA: Was it to be a professional, impartial      news service serving as an example of press freedom to the      world? Or was it an instrument of U.S. foreign policy, a      strategic weapon to be employed against those we fight? What      is the line between news and propaganda? Should our      broadcasts advocate America's values-or should they provide      neutral, objective journalism?       That debate has never been resolved, only recast for each      succeeding generation. In August 1953, for example, our      government concluded that whatever the VOA was or would be,      it should not be part of the State Department. So we      established the United States Information Agency, and the VOA      became its single largest operation.       A few years ago, Congress decided that all our      international broadcasts were to be governed by a bi-partisan      board appointed by the President, with the Secretary of State      as an ex- officio member.       This includes other U.S. international broadcast services      which were born in the Cold War, the so-called ``Freedom      Radios.'' The first was Radio Free Europe, established in      1949 as a non-profit, non-governmental private corporation to      broadcast news and information to East Europeans behind the      Iron Curtain. The second was Radio Liberty, created in 1951      to broadcast similar programming to the citizens of Russia      and the Soviet republics. Both Radio Free Europe and Radio      Liberty were secretly funded by the Central Intelligence      Agency, a fact not known to the American public until 1967,      when the New York Times first reported the connection. The      immediate result of the story was a huge controversy, because      the radios had for years solicited donations from the public      through an advertising campaign known as the Crusade for      Freedom. Such secrecy, critics argued, undermined the very      message of democratic openness the stations were intended to      convey in their broadcasts to the closed, totalitarian      regimes of the East.       In 1971, Congress terminated CIA funding for the stations      and provided for their continued existence by open      appropriations. The stations survived and contributed to      American strategy in the Cold War. That strategy was simple:      to persuade and convince the leaders and people of the      communist bloc that freedom was better than dictatorship,      that free enterprise was better than central planning, and      that no country could survive if it did not respect human      rights and the rule of law. Broadcasting into regimes      where travel was severely restricted, where all incoming      mail was censored, and all internal media were tools of      state propaganda, Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty      communicated two messages that conventional weapons never      could--doubt about the present and hope for the future.       They did so against repeated efforts by Soviet and East      European secret police to sabotage their broadcast      facilities, to create friction between the stations and their      host governments, and even to murder the stations' personnel.      In 1962, I personally witnessed an effort by Soviet delegates      to an international communications conference in Geneva to      eliminate our broadcasts to Eastern Europe. Because I was      then Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, the      Soviets assumed I was in charge of these broadcasts. I      explained that although this was not my department, I thought      we should double the broadcasts.       Listening to the radios' evening broadcasts became a      standard ritual throughout Russia and Eastern Europe. Moscow,      no matter how hard it tried, could not successfully jam the      transmissions. As a result, communism had to face a public      that every year knew more about its lies. In his 1970 Nobel      Prize speech, Aleksander Solzhenitsyn said of Radio Liberty,      ``If we learn anything about events in our own country, it's      from there.'' When the Berlin Wall fell, and soon after the      Soviet Union crumbled, Lech Walesa was asked about the      significance of Radio Free Europe to the Polish democracy      movement. He replied, ``Where would the Earth be without the      sun?''       Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty continue to broadcast,      from headquarters in downtown Prague, at the invitation of      Vaclav Havel. The studios are now guarded by tanks in the      street to protect against terrorists.       With very little money, Congress authorized several new      services: Radio Free Asia, Radio Free Iraq, Radio Free Iran,      Radio and TV Marti, Radio Democracy Africa, and Worldnet, a      television service that broadcasts a daily block of American      news. After 9/11, Congress approved funding for a new Radio      Free Afghanistan. What most people don't know is that this      service is not new--Congress authorized funds for Radio Free      Afghanistan first in 1985, when the country was under Soviet      domination. Even then the service was minimal--one half-hour      a day of news in the Dari and Pashto languages. When the      Soviets withdrew, we mistakenly thought the service was no      longer needed. We dismantled it as the country plunged into      chaos. We are finally beginning to correct our mistakes with      a smart new service in the Middle East called ``The New      Station for the New Generation.''       Indeed, as the Cold War wound down, we forgot its most      potent lesson: that totalitarianism was defeated not with      missiles, tanks and carriers, but with ideas--and that words      can be weapons. Even though the Voice of America had earned      the trust and respect of listeners for its accuracy and      fairness, our government starved our international      broadcasts. Many of the resources that had once been given to      public diplomacy--to explaining ourselves and our values to      the world--were eliminated. In the Middle East, particularly,      American broadcasting is not even a whisper. An Arab-language      radio service is operated by Voice of America, but its budget      is tiny and its audience tinier--only about 1 to 2 percent of      Arabs ever listen to it. Among those under the age of 30--60      percent of the population in the region--virtually no one      listens.       As we fell mute in the Cold War's aftermath, other voices      grew in influence.                               Al Jazeera       In the past few months, Westerners began to learn about Al      Jazeera as a source of anti-American tirades by Muslim      extremists and as the favored news outlet of both Osama bin      Laden and the Taliban. The service had its beginnings in      1995, when the BBC withdrew from a joint venture with Saudi-     owned Orbit Communications that had provided news on a Middle      East channel. The BBC and the Saudi government clashed over      editorial judgments, and the business relationship fell      apart. Into the breach stepped a big fan of CNN, Qatar's      Emir, Sheikh Hamed bin Khalifa Al Thani. He admired CNN's      satellite technology and decided to bankroll a Middle East      satellite network with a small budget. He hired most of the      BBC's anchors, editors and technicians, and Al Jazeera was      born.       Al Jazeera means ``the peninsula'' in Arabic, and the name      is fitting. Just as Qatar is a peninsula, the station's      programming protrudes conspicuously into the world of state-      controlled broadcasting in the Middle East. Several      commentators, including many Arabs, have sharply criticized      the service for being unprofessional and biased. CNN and Al      Jazeera had a dispute this year and terminated their      cooperative relationship.       Well before September 11, Al Jazeera had managed to anger      most of the governments in its own region. Libya withdrew its      ambassador from Qatar when Al Jazeera broadcast an interview      with a critic of the Libyan government. Tunisia's ambassador      complained to the Qatari foreign ministry about a program      accusing Tunisia of violating human rights. Kuwait complained      after a program criticized Kuwait's relations with Iraq. In      Saudi Arabia, officials called for a ``political fatwa''      prohibiting Saudis from appearing on any Al Jazeera      programming. In March 2001, Yasser Arafat closed Al Jazeera's      West Bank news bureau, complaining of an offensive depiction      of Arafat in a documentary. Algeria shut off electricity to      prevent its citizens from watching Al Jazeera's programs.      Other countries deny Al Jazeera's reporters entry visas.       And of course, our own country has plenty to complain about      Al Jazeera.       Al Jazeera came to our notice first because a 1998      interview with Osama bin Laden called upon Muslims to      ``target all Americans.'' Al Jazeera broadcast the tape many      times. As the only network with an office in Afghanistan, Al      Jazeera was the only one the Taliban allowed to broadcast      from the country. On October 7, 2001, the network's Kabul      office received a videotape message from Osama bin Laden,      which it transmitted around the world. Hiding in caves, Osama      could still speak to the world in a voice louder than ours      because we allowed our story to be told by our enemies.       Forty years ago, I accompanied President Kennedy on a tour      of our space program facilities. He asked me why it was so      important to launch a communications satellite. I said, ``Mr.      President, unlike other rocket launches, this one will not      send a man into space, but it will send ideas. And ideas      last longer than people do.'' I never dreamed that the      ideas millions of people receive every day would come from      Al Jazeera.                      The Global Media Marketplace       Whatever one thinks of Al Jazeera, it teaches an important      lesson: The global marketplace of news and information is no      longer dominated by the United States. Our own government,      because it has no outlet of its own in the area, is looking      into buying commercial time on Al Jazeera to get America's      anti-terrorism message out. And because of privatization and      deregulation in the international satellite business, a huge      number of Americans now have direct access to Al Jazeera      through the EchoStar satellite service.       The point is simply this: Whether the message is one of      hate or peace, in the globalized communications environment      it is impossible either to silence those who send the      message, or stop those who want to receive it. Satellites      have no respect for national borders. Satellites surmount      walls. Like Joshua's Trumpet, satellites blow walls down.       That was the last lesson of the Cold War. In Beijing, the      Chinese government would not begin its brutal sweep through      Tianamen Square until it thought the world's video cameras      were out of range. In Manila, Warsaw and Bucharest,      dissenters first captured the television station--the      Electronic Bastille of modern revolutions. In Prague, a      classic urban rebellion became a revolution through      television. The Romanian revolution was not won until      television showed pictures of the Ceaucescus' corpses and      scenes of rebels controlling the square in Bucharest. In the      final days of the Soviet Union, the August 1991 coup against      President Mikhail Gorbachev failed when video of the      supposedly ill president was broadcast by satellite around      the world. Those satellites, Gorbachev later said,      ``prevented the triumph of dictatorship.'' Now, we have the      newer technologies of the internet and e-mail--technologies      the Voice of America and the Freedom Radios use with      enthusiasm without adequate support.       What we have failed to realize is that the last lesson of      the Cold War is also the first lesson of the new global      information age. We live now in a world where we are the lone      superpower, and the target of envy and resentment not just in      the Middle East but elsewhere. Terror is now the weapon of      choice.       But if you believe we are only in a war against terrorism,      you are only half-right. Nation-states can sponsor terrorism      and provide cover to terrorists, but the war against      terrorism is asymmetric. This is my friend Don Rumsfeld's      favorite word--asymmetric. This means that war is not waged      by a state against another state per se, but against an      ideology. Think of the campaign of the past few months. The      enemy has been a band of religious zealots and the Al Qaeda      terrorists they harbor, not the people of Afghanistan.      President Bush has been emphatic and effective on this point,      as have Prime Minister Tony Blair and other world leaders.       Asymmetry also refers to the strategies and tactics used by      those who cannot compete in a conventional war. In an      asymmetric war, it is not enough to have Air Forces to      command the skies, Navies to roam the seas, or Armies to      control mountain passes. Although the Cold War led to      staggering advances in military technology to win the      battles, there is not a corresponding change in our      government's use of communications technology to win the      peace.       Asymmetry, in other words, is not limited to what happens      on the battlefield. While U.S. Special Operations forces in      Afghanistan use laptops and satellites and sophisticated      wireless telecommunications to guide pilots flying bombing      missions from aircraft carriers in the Arabian Sea, we still      use obsolete, clumsy and primitive methods, such as short-     wave radio, to communicate to the people.       Here is another incongruity: American marketing talent is      successfully selling Madonna's music, Pepsi Cola and Coca      Cola, Michael Jordan's shoes and McDonald's hamburgers around      the world. Our film, television and computer software      industries dominate their markets worldwide. Yet, the United      States government has tried to get its message of freedom and      democracy out to the 1 billion Muslims in the world and can't      seem to do it. How is it that America, a nation founded on      ideas--not religion or race or ethnicity or clan--cannot      explain itself to the world?       In the months since September 11, Americans have been      surprised to learn of the deep and bitter resentment that      much of the Muslim world feels toward us. Our situation is      not just a public relations problem. Anyone who has traveled      the world knows that much anti-American sentiment springs      from disagreements with some of our economic and foreign      policies. Our support of authoritarian regimes in the Muslim      world has not endeared us to the people who live there. And      there is no more poisonous imagery than that of Palestinians      and Israelis locked in mortal and what seems to be never-     ending combat.       Still, the United States has an important story to tell,      the story of human striving for freedom, democracy and      opportunity. Since the end of the Cold War, we have failed to      tell that story to a world waiting to hear it on the radio      and see it on television. We have failed to use the power of      ideas.       Within days of the Taliban's flight from Kabul, television      was back on the air in the country. The Taliban had not only      banned television broadcasts, but confiscated and destroyed      thousands of TV sets. They hung the smashed husks of TV sets      on light poles, along with videocassettes and musical      instruments, as a warning to anyone who might try to break      the regime's reign of ignorance. And yet no sooner were the      Taliban driven from the city than hundreds of TV sets      appeared from nowhere. Even in the midst of a totalitarian,      theocratic regime, there had been a thriving underground      market for news and information. Television antennas were      quickly hung outside of windows and on rooftops. The antennas      are like periscopes, enabling those inside to see what is      happening outside.       Where were we when those people needed us? Where were we      when Al Jazeera went on the air? It was as if we put on our      own self-created burka and disappeared from sight. The voices      of America, the voices of freedom, were not even a whisper.                           The New Challenge       I believe the United States must re-commit itself to public      diplomacy--to explaining and advocating our values to the      world. As Tom Friedman put it in his New York Times column      not long ago: ``It is no easy trick to lose a PR war to two      mass murderers--(Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein) but      we've been doing just that lately. It is not enough for the      White House to label them `evildoers.' We have to take the PR      war right to them, just like the real one.''       There are two leaders of both parties who need our support      in this fight for aggressive, vigorous public diplomacy.      Illinois Republican Congressman Henry Hyde, chairman of the      House International Relations Committee, wants to strengthen      the Voice of America and the many Freedom Radio services that      broadcast from Cuba to Afghanistan. Democratic Senator Joseph      Biden, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is      on the same page. He has developed legislation known as      ``Initiative 911'' to give special emphasis to more      programming for the entire Muslim world, from Nigeria to      Indonesia.       In November, Congress finally set aside $30 million to      launch a new Middle East radio network. The AM and FM      broadcasts (not short wave) will offer pop music--American      and Arabic--along with a mix of current events and talk      shows. The proposal to fund Radio Free Afghanistan is for      $27.5 million this year and next, and will allow about 12      hours a day of broadcasting into the country. The goal is to      make our ideas clear not just to leaders in the Muslim world,      but to those in the street, and particularly the young, many      of whom are uneducated and desperately poor, and among whom      hostility toward the United States is very high.       These efforts are late and, in my view, too timid. They are      tactical, not strategic. They are smart, not visionary. The      cost of putting Radio Free Afghanistan on the air and      underwriting its annual budget, for example, is less than      even one Commanche helicopter. We have many hundreds of      helicopters which we need to destroy tyranny, but they are      insufficient to secure freedom. In an asymmetric war, we must      also fight on the idea front.       Bob Shieffer put the issue well not long ago on CBS' ``Face      the Nation'':       ``The real enemy is not Osama, it is the ignorance that      breeds the hatred that fuels his cause. This is what we have      to change. I realized what an enormous job that was going to      be the other day when I heard a young Pakistani student tell      an interviewer that everyone in his school knew that Israel      was behind the attacks on the Twin Towers and everyone in his      school knew all the Jews who worked there had stayed home      that day.       ``What we have all come to realize now is that a large part      of the world not only misunderstands us but is teaching its      children to hate us.''       Steve Forbes, who once headed the Broadcasting Board of      Governors, put the issue even more bluntly: ``Washington      should cease its petty, penny-minded approach to our      international radios and give them the resources and capable      personnel to do the job that so badly needs to be done right.      . . . What are we waiting for?''                              The proposal       What are we waiting for? I suggest three simple proposals.      First, define a clear strategic mission and vision for U.S.      international broadcasting. Second, provide the financial      resources to get the job done. Third, use the unique talent      that the United States has--all of it--to communicate that      vision to the world.       First, and above all, U.S. international broadcasting      should be unapologetically proud to advocate freedom and      democracy in the world. There is no inconsistency in      reporting the news accurately while also advocating America's      values. The real issue is whether we will carry the debate on      the meaning of freedom to places on the globe, where open      debate is unknown and freedom has no seed. Does anyone      seriously believe that the twin goals of providing solid      journalism and undermining tyranny are incompatible? As a      people, Americans have always been committed to the      proposition that these goals go hand in hand. As the leader      of the free world, it is time for us to do what's right--to      speak of idealism, sacrifice and the nurturing of values      essential to human freedom--and to speak in a bold, clear      voice.       Second, if we are to do that, we will need to put our money      where out mouths are not. We now spend more than a billion      dollars each day for the Department of Defense. Results in      the war on terrorism demonstrate that this is money well      invested in our national security.       Whatever Don Rumsfeld says he needs should be provided by      the Congress with pride in the extraordinary service his      imaginative leadership is giving our country. As President      Bush has proposed, we will need to increase the defense      budget. When we do, let's compare what we need to spend on      the Voice of America and the Freedom Radio services with what      we need to spend on defense. Our international broadcasting      efforts amount to less than two-tenths of one percent of      Defense expenditures. Al Jazeera was started with an initial      budget of less than $30 million a year. Now Al Jazeera      reaches some 40 million men, women and children every day, at      a cost of pennies per viewer every month.       Congress should hold hearings now to decide what we should      spend to get our message of freedom, democracy and peace into      the non-democratic and authoritarian regions of the world.      One suggestion is to consider a relationship between what we      spend on defense with what we spend on communication. For      example, should we spend 10 percent of what we spend on      defense for communication? That would be $33 billion a year.      Too much. Should we spend 1 percent? That would be $3.3      billion, and that seems about right to me--one dollar to      launch ideas for every $100 we invest to launch bombs. This      would be about six times more than we invest now in      international communications. We must establish a ratio      sufficient to our need to inform and persuade others of the      values of freedom and democracy. More importantly, we should      seek a ratio sufficient to lessen our need for bombs.       Third, throwing money alone at the problem will not do the      job. We need to use all of the communications talent we have      at our disposal. This job is not only for journalists. As      important as balanced news and public affairs programming are      to our public diplomacy mission, the fact is that we are now      in a global information marketplace. An American news source,      even a highly professional one like the VOA, is not      necessarily persuasive in a market of shouting, often      deceitful and hateful voices. Telling the truth in a      persuasive, convincing way is not propaganda. Churchill's and      Roosevelt's words--``never was so much owed by so many to so      few''--``The only thing we have to fear is fear itself''--     were as powerful as a thousand guns.       When Colin Powell chose advertising executive Charlotte      Beers as Under Secretary of State for public diplomacy and      public affairs, some journalists sneered. You cannot peddle      freedom as you would cars and shampoo, went the refrain. That      is undoubtedly so, and Beers has several times said as much      herself. But you can't peddle freedom if no one is listening,      and Charlotte Beers is a master at getting people to listen--     and to communicate in terms people understand.       So was another visionary in this business, Bill Benton.      Before he served as Assistant Secretary of State, Benton had      been a founding partner in one of the country's largest and      most successful advertising firms, Benton and Bowles. To win      the information war, we will need the Bentons and Beers of      this world every bit as much as we will need the journalists.      We have the smartest, most talented, and most creative people      in the world in our communications industries--in radio,      television, film, newspapers, magazines, advertising,      publishing, public relations, marketing. These men and women      want to help their country, and will volunteer eagerly to      help get our message across. One of the first people we      should enlist is a West Point graduate named Bill Roedy, who      is President of MTV Networks International. His enterprise      reaches one billion people in 18 languages in 164 countries.      Eight out of ten MTV viewers live outside the United States.      He can teach us a lot about how to tell our story.                               conclusion       In 1945, a few years after the VOA first went on the air,      the newly founded United Nations had 51 members. Today it has      189. In the last decade alone, more than 20 countries have      been added to the globe, many of them former Soviet      republics, but not all. Some of these new countries, as with      the Balkan example, have been cut bloodily from the fabric of      ethnic and religious hatred. Some of these countries are      nominally democratic, but many--especially in Central Asia--     are authoritarian regimes. Some are also deeply unstable, and      thus pose a threat not only to their neighbors, but to the      free world. Afghanistan, we discovered too late, is a concern      not only to its region, but to all of us.       In virtually every case, those whose rule is based on an      ideology of hate have understood better than we have the      power of ideas and the power of communicating ideas. The      bloodshed in the Balkans began with hate radio blaring from      Zagreb and Belgrade, and hate radio is still common in the      region today. The murder of 2 million Hutus and Tutsis in      central Africa could not have happened but for the urging of      madmen with broadcast towers at their disposal. The same has      been true of ethnic violence in India and Pakistan.       I saw this first hand in the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962.      President Kennedy asked me to organize eight American      commercial radio stations to carry the Voice of America to      Cuba because the VOA was shut out by Soviet jamming. We      succeeded, and President Kennedy's speeches were heard in      Spanish in Cuba at the height of the crisis. As we kept the      destroyers and missiles out of Cuba, we got the Voice of      America in because we had enough power to surmount the      jamming. On that occasion, our American broadcasts were more      than a whisper.       Last spring--well before the events of September 11--     Illinois Congressman Henry Hyde put the need eloquently. I      quote him: ``During the last several years it has been argued      that our broadcasting services have done their job so well      that they are no longer needed. This argument assumes that      the great battle of the 20th century, the long struggle for      the soul of the world, is over: that the forces of freedom      and democracy have won. But the argument is terribly      shortsighted. It ignores the people of China and Cuba, of      Vietnam and Burma, of Iraq and Iran and Sudan and North Korea      and now Russia. It ignores the fragility of freedom and the      difficulty of building and keeping democracy. And it ignores      the resilience of evil.''       Fifty-eight years ago, Albert Einstein returned from a day      of sailing to find a group of reporters waiting for him at      the shore. The reporters told him that the United States had      dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima, wiping out the city.      Einstein shook his head and said, ``Everything in the world      has changed except the way we think.''       On September 11 everything changed except the way we think.      It is hard to change the way we think. But we know that ideas      last longer than people do, and that two important ideas of      the 20th century are now in direct competition: the ideas of      mass communication and mass destruction. The great question      of our time is whether we will be wise enough to use one to      avoid the other.                          ____________________
