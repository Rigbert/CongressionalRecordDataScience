 President, today, I am reintroducing private relief legislation on behalf of Joseph Gabra and Sharon Kamel, a couple living with their family in Camarillo, CA.  Joseph and Sharon are nationals of Egypt who fled their home country over twelve years ago after being targeted for their religious involvement in the Christian Coptic Church in Egypt. They became involved with this church during the 1990s, Joseph as an accountant and project coordinator helping to build community facilities and Sharon as the church's training director in human resources.  Unfortunately, Joseph and Sharon were also subjected to threats and abuse. Joseph was jailed repeatedly because of his involvement with the church. Sharon's family members were violently targeted, including her cousin who was murdered and her brother whose business was firebombed. When Sharon became pregnant with her first child, she was threatened by a member of a different religious organization against raising her child in a non-Muslim faith.  Joseph and Sharon came to the United States legally seeking refuge in November 1998. They immediately notified authorities of their intent to seek protection in the United States, filing for political asylum in May 1999.  However, Joseph, who has a speech impediment, had difficulty communicating why he was afraid to return to Egypt, and one year later their asylum application was denied because they could not adequately establish that they were victims of persecution. Joseph and Sharon pursued the appropriate means for appealing this decision, to no avail.  It should be noted that sometime later Sharon's brother applied for asylum in the United States. He, too, applied on the basis of persecution he and his family faced in Egypt, but his application was approved and he was granted this status in the United States.  There are no other avenues for Joseph and Sharon to pursue relief here in the United States. If they are deported, they will be forced back to a country where they sincerely fear for their safety.  Since arriving in the United States more than twelve years ago, Joseph and Sharon have built a family here, including four children who are United States citizens: Jessica, age 14, Rebecca, age 13, Rafael, age 12, and Veronica, age 7. Jessica, Rebecca, and Rafael attend school in California and maintain good grades. Veronica is attending second grade at Camarillo Heights Elementary School.  Joseph and Sharon worked hard to achieve financial security for their children, and they created a meaningful place for their family in California. Both earned college degrees in Egypt. Joseph, who has his Certified Public Accountant license, has opened his own accounting firm.  Joseph and Sharon carry strong support from friends, members of their local church, and other Californians who attest to their good character and community contributions.  I am concerned that the entire family would face serious and unwarranted hardships if forced to relocate to Egypt. For Jessica, Rebecca, Rafael, and Veronica, the only home they know is in the United States. It is quite possible these four American children would face discrimination or worse in Egypt on account of their religion, as was the experience of many of their family members.  Joseph and Sharon have made a compelling plea to remain in the United States. These parents emphasize their commitment to supporting their children and making a healthy and productive place for them to grow up in California. I believe this family deserves that opportunity.  I respectfully ask my colleagues to support this private relief bill on behalf of Joseph Gabra and Sharon Kamel.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 589       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. ADJUSTMENT OF STATUS.       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of      law, for the purposes of the Immigration and Nationality Act      (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.), Joseph Gabra and Sharon Kamel shall      each be deemed to have been lawfully admitted to, and      remained in, the United States, and shall be eligible for      adjustment of status to that of an alien lawfully admitted      for permanent residence under section 245 of the Immigration      and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1255) upon filing an      application for such adjustment of status.       (b) Application and Payment of Fees.--Subsection (a) shall      apply only if the application for adjustment of status is      filed with appropriate fees not later than 2 years after the      date of the enactment of this Act.       (c) Reduction of Immigrant Visa Numbers.--Upon the granting      of permanent resident status to Joseph Gabra and Sharon      Kamel, the Secretary of State shall instruct the proper      officer to reduce by 2, during the current or subsequent      fiscal year, the total number of immigrant visas that are      made available to natives of the country of birth of Joseph      Gabra and Sharon Kamel under section 203(a) of the      Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1153(a)), or, if      applicable, the total number of immigrant visas that are made      available to natives to the country of birth of Joseph Gabra      and Sharon Kamel under section 202(e) of that Act (8 U.S.C.      1152(e)).       (d) PAYGO.--The budgetary effects of this Act, for the      purpose of complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of      2010, shall be determined by reference to the latest      statement titled ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation''      for this Act, submitted for printing in the Congressional      Record by the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee,      provided that such statement has been submitted prior to the      vote on passage.                                 ______                                       By
