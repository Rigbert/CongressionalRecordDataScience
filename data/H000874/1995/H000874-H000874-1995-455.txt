Chairman, I thank my colleagues for not objecting.  Mr. Chairman, here we are 1 year later, and what has time brought the Bosnians?  All of us know: Further deaths, further ethnic cleansing, further disruption to the democratically elected government.                              {time}  1300  For the aggressors however, Mr. Chairman, they just dug their trenches a little deeper. And the Bosnian Serbs upped the ante by taking more than 370 U.N. troops hostage. They released some, but they still hold others, and then, on last Friday they shot down a U.S. F-16 fighter. Thank God that he has now been retrieved. We thank the technology that allowed him to get out of that plane and to let us know where he was.  But, Mr. Chairman, let us be clear.  It is not just UNPROFOR that is being held hostage but the United Nations and NATO itself. A test of wills has been going on now for 3 years between the Bosnian Serbs, Milosevic, and the United Nations and NATO. The Serbs have won every time. And the world's most powerful collective institution is being rendered helpless.  On several occasions, we have witnessed Bosnia's aggressors stay their assaults at the prospect that Bosnia would be aided by the international community. But each time, Mr. Chairman, they have returned even more bold and resolute to try to finish their crime, the annihilation of an independent democratic, internationally recognized Bosnia, when the international community has failed to act decisively. The taking of UNPROFOR hostages is but the latest example of such boldness and of such contempt for the international community's lack of resolve.  Mr. Chairman, we in America have serious national interests in helping the people of Bosnia, which I think it very important to point out consists of Moslems, Croats, and Serbs.  First, this is a recognized member state of the United Nations. We have an interest as we did with Kuwait in seeing that it is not destroyed.  Second, we have an interest in stopping a genocide. Surely we do not want history to show that within years of one genocide we stood idly by while it was committed in Europe again?  Third, we have an interest in international norms and laws being upheld and ultimately respected. If not, why should any nation seek help from an international community that espouses rule by law yet acknowledges and ultimately respects rule by force.  Fourth, we have an interest in making sure that the carnage of Bosnia does not spread to other nations with the real possibility of pitting NATO allies against each other.  I think it is also useful, Mr. Chairman, for us to take a moment to recall the actions that led up to the crisis with which we are now concerned. Those actions included:  First, the increasingly bold and unrelenting Serb violations of a heavy weapon exclusion zone;  Second, the shelling of Sarajevo;  Third, the carrying off with artillery pieces and a mortar out of a U.N.-NATO impoundment depot, and  Fourth, the ignoring of a U.N.-NATO ultimatum.  It was only then that NATO conducted an air raid. The Serbs retaliated by shelling 5 ``safe-areas'' in Bosnia killing 76 people. That triggered a second NATO strike on other pale ammunition dumps. The Serb response was to seize hundreds of members of U.N. peace-keeping forces and then to shoot down a United States fighter enforcing the no-fly zone.  It seems to me, Mr. Chairman, that what we are encountering is similar to a scene dating back to the 1930's when another dictator sought to carve up a neighboring country in the name of ethnic unity. It occurred in Munich in 1938. It is appeasement.  At the outset of the crisis in Czechoslovakia one European leader remarked and I wish that everybody would listen to this, ``How horrible, fantastic incredible it is that we should be digging trenches and tying on gas masks here because of a quarrel in a faraway country between people of whom we know nothing.''  All of us, and particularly our fathers, and many who serve in this room, learned the lessons of that negligence.  Mr. Chairman, I am hopeful that this House will repeat its message of 1993-94 and say that we are going to allow the Bosnians to have the right and ability to defend themselves from terrorists.
