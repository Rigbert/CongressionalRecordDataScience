Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an article about this bill's impact on graduate students in my district.         [From the Atlanta Journal Constitution, Nov. 16, 2017] Opinion: Only Wealthy Can Afford Grad School Under House Tax Plan Up                              for Vote Today                          (By Maureen Downey)       Jenny C. Bledsoe is a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in English      at Emory University, specializing in medieval literature. She      was featured in a New York Times story last week that      examined how the GOP House tax plan would impact a range of      American students. In this essay, Bledsoe focuses on the      change that makes graduate tuition waivers taxable income.       The tax plan is expected to come to the House floor today      where passage is predicted. The Senate, however, is not      expected to take up its own tax bill until after      Thanksgiving. And then House and Senate conferees will have      to hammer out their differences and come up with a compromise      plan.       Under the House plan, Bledsoe and other doctoral students      would be hurt by a new provision that would tax graduate      students on tuition wavers granted them in exchange for      working as teaching assistants or researchers. The tax      accountants hired by The New York Times estimated Bledsoe and      her husband would pay an additional $7,194 in taxes under the      House tax bill.       When I about this last week, some readers contended the      increase in the standard deduction will offset the      eliminations of these education deductions. However, some      reviews found that not to be true for graduate students.                                  ____                   Impact of GOP Tax Plan on Students                         (By Jenny C. Bledsoe)       The House GOP tax bill makes graduate school inaccessible      for anyone who is not independently wealthy, and it will      likely cause current graduate students to drop out of      doctoral programs and/or declare bankruptcy.       A single line in the 429-page bill effects this change: 26      U.S. tax code Sec. 117(d) allows students conducting research      or teaching for a university (usually Ph.D. students on      fellowship) to receive tuition waivers tax free. Any stipends      are taxed.       The House ``Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,'' however, will repeal      this provision, meaning that a Ph.D. student making a stipend      of $24,000 will be taxed as if they are making $85,200. This      would have been my situation two years ago. During the first      three years of Emory's Ph.D. program, a student currently      receives a tuition waiver amounting to $61,200. Once you      reach ``tuition-paid'' status after your third year, the      annual tuition is $30,600.       Tax experts hired by The New York Times estimated that my      husband's and my tax bill would increase by $7,194--despite      the increase in the standard deduction--because of the newly      taxable tuition waiver.       Tuition amounts vary widely depending on the institution,      and the situation may be worse (or better) for some      individuals, depending on tuition rates and stipend amounts.      At Georgia Tech, full-time graduate student tuition for one      semester is $6,894 in-state and $14,284 out-of-state. Georgia      State's tuition is $4,680 in-state and $15,012 out-of-state      for one semester.       Graduate students will clearly owe much larger federal      income tax bills, and in some states, including Georgia, they      will also have to pay more due to the proposed changes to the      federal tax credit for state and local income taxes. Those at      private colleges and universities will be responsible for      larger taxable amounts (given the higher tuition at private      institutions).       Those at public universities will pay the taxes on their      relatively lower tuition waiver amounts, but they will have      to do so with already significantly smaller stipends than      Ph.D. students receive at private universities.       This is an issue across the disciplines. It will affect any      graduate student pursuing a Ph.D. on a research or teaching      fellowship, which common for those pursuing doctorates in      STEM, the social sciences, and the humanities. In addition to      graduate students suffering personally, universities will      experience the effects of their graduate students' tax      burdens in multiple ways (in addition to the bill's other      deleterious effects on higher education).       Graduate students will have less time for research because      they will have to work additional jobs. Humanities Ph.D.      students, who provide essential labor as instructors, will      have less time to devote to the classes they teach to      undergraduates.       Long-term effects are difficult to measure, but surely many      lower-income students will no longer attend. It's unlikely      that international students will be able to maintain a decent      standard of living since they are often forbidden from taking      on additional work.       The House GOP tax bill will lead to a ``brain drain,'' with      international students and Americans alike seeking graduate      study elsewhere or not all. In terms of personal finance, it      will be extremely challenging (if not impossible) to meet      one's basic needs--food, shelter--while pursuing a higher      degree.       Unless . . . you're independently wealthy. This single line      in a massive tax bill destroys lower- and middle-class young      Americans' ability to pursue a professional career in      academia, industry, or government. The bill reduces other      education tax credits, which will adversely affect access to      undergraduate as well as graduate education. The GOP will      effectively end class mobility, return the academy fully to      the so-called one percent, and reduce charitable donations to      universities by de-incentivizing itemized deductions.       Even if you don't believe in the value of academic study,      eliminating section 117(d) of the U.S. tax code would be bad      for the economy. Those who were not independently wealthy and      who chose to pursue graduate studies anyway would have to do      so with the help of student loans. Student loans are with you      forever; student loan debt is not forgiven even when      bankruptcy is declared. Young Americans are already saddled      with too much debt, causing many opinion pieces to complain      about the latest store or product that ``millennials have      killed'' by not spending enough money.       Eliminating this line of tax code effectively condemns      those who pursue higher education to a life of debt      servitude. How is our economy, our country, our world to      progress with these barriers against access to education, an      essential asset in our dynamic world?
