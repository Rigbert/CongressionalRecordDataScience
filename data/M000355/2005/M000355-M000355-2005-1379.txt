 Several Members have indicated a desire to speak on the conference report. I encourage anyone who wishes to speak to contact the managers at this time. It is my expectation that we will be able to lock in a short time agreement tomorrow morning. Senators should therefore expect a vote on the conference report by early afternoon.  For the remainder of the week, we will continue consideration of the highway bill. The managers will work through amendments, and we expect to make good progress on the bill during the day tomorrow. Again, it is my intention to finish the bill by the end of the week. Senators who wish to offer amendments should inform the bill managers as soon as possible. So rollcall votes in relation to amendments to the highway bill will be expected tomorrow afternoon as well.                          ____________________
