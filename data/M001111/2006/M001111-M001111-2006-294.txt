 President, I do want to talk for a minute about Senator Byrd and recognize he has set a record in the Senate, as many of my colleagues have noted on the floor.  He marked his l7,327th day in office yesterday and became the longest serving Senator in history. That is truly a remarkable accomplishment, and I personally have many fond memories of working with Senator Byrd and look forward to many more.  I remember well when I came here as a freshman Senator 13 \1/2\ years ago. Senator Byrd at the time brought in all of us freshmen Senators to sit across from him in his very important office and looked down at us and told us that we would be presiding, as is the Presiding Officer today, and told us about our responsibilities and made it very clear he would be watching from his office, and if we were reading any other material or talking to anyone, it would be noted.  I certainly did remember that during the many hours I spent in the Presiding Officer's chair because I knew he was watching. But I think it was a simple reminder to all of us as to the importance of the office we hold here and the respect we have to have for our colleagues.  I remember as well that he invited me to lunch several months later with the Senator from Oregon, Mr. Hatfield, a Republican, to sit down and talk with me about the responsibilities I had as a Senator. And I was so impressed sitting in the room with Senator Byrd and Senator Hatfield, never in my life expecting to have that kind of opportunity. At that meeting they impressed upon me the importance of working across the aisle and respect for the minority and how important everybody's voice is here. It was an important lesson and one I think we all should be reminded of more often.  But just that simple act of inviting me to lunch with two incredible leaders in the Senate is a memory I hold dear, and I thank my colleague for doing that.  But, frankly, I think what I most will remember Senator Byrd for--and is a good reminder to all of us, too--is several years ago when my husband came out here to Washington, DC--he lives in Washington State. I go home every weekend. But he came out here because it was our wedding anniversary, and instead of me having to fly home, he flew out here. He was coming up the steps of the Capitol, and I met him as Senator Byrd was walking out to his car.  Senator Byrd saw my husband, and he said: Welcome. Nice to have you here at this end of the country. What brings you here?  And my husband said: Well, it is our wedding anniversary.  And Senator Byrd, who, as we well know, lost his beloved wife just a few short weeks ago, was about to celebrate I think it was his 67th wedding anniversary. He looked at my husband and said: Which anniversary is this?  And my husband said: It is our 32nd.  Senator Byrd paused and said: Well, it is a good start.  I think the message of that is important for all of us in our everyday lives, in our responsibilities as spouses, and as Senators, to remember it is a good start every day, and you can't rest on your laurels and think back: Well, we have done this for 32 years. The next 32 will be easy. Every day you have to come out and work hard at whatever role you are in at the time.  I certainly say to my good friend, Senator Byrd, how much I respect him and admire him. And today, as he marks his l7,328th day in office, I say to him: It is a good start.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The Senator from Alaska is recognized.                          ____________________
