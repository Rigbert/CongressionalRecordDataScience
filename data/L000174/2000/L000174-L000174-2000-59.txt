President, I rise today to call on the Senate to support H.R. 4068, which will extend the religious worker visa for an additional three years. I am a cosponsor and strong supporter of Senate legislation that would make permanent the provisions of our immigration law that provide for special immigrant visas for religious workers sponsored by religious organizations in the United States. These visas allow religious denominations or organizations in the United States to bring in foreign nationals to perform religious work here. This modest program--which provides for up to 5,000 religious immigrant visas a year--was created in the Immigration Act of 1990, and has been extended ever since. Although I believe the program should be made permanent, I am willing to support a three-year extension given the lateness of the session and the fact that the program expired upon last week's end of the fiscal year.  The importance of this program to America's religious community has been demonstrated by the fact that leaders from a variety of faiths have come to Congress both this year and in past years to testify on its behalf. It is also important to note, however, that these religious workers contribute significantly not just to their religious communities, but to the community as a whole. They work in hospitals, nursing homes, and homeless shelters. They help immigrants and refugees adjust to the United States. In other words, they perform vital tasks that too often go undone.  I have worked on this issue consistently over the years. Most recently, I cosponsored a bill in 1997 that would have made this program permanent. We were forced in that year as well to settle for a 3-year extension of the program. It is my hope and expectation that this will be the last short-term extension of this program, and that the substantial benefit that our country has derived from this program will lead us to make the program permanent 3 years from now.
