SANDERS. Thank you. We do not hear much about that figure. He is suggesting a terribly radical idea hardly heard on the floor of the House, and that is that maybe trade policy should work for the benefit of the average American worker rather than the head of the large corporations who are trying to take our jobs to Mexico and China.  We are delighted now to welcome a Congressman from upstate New York, the gentleman from New York [Mr. Hinchey].
