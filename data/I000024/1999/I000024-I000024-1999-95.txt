I ask that an article and narrative on Rear Admiral Vincent be printed in the Record.  The article and narrative follows: Rear Admiral Leonard Vincent--Commandant, Defense Systems Management                                 College       Rear Admiral Leonard ``Lenn'' Vincent became the Commandant      Defense Systems Management College (DSMC), Fort Belvoir,      Virginia, in January 1998. The College is a graduate-level      institution that promotes sound systems-management principles      by the acquisition workforce through education, research,      consulting, and information dissemination.       Admiral Vincent entered the Naval Reserve program as a sea-     man recruit in October 1961. Upon graduation from      Southeastern State Teachers College in Oklahoma, he received      a commission in July 1965 from the Officers Candidate School,      Newport, Rhode Island, as an ensign in the Supply Corps, U.S.      Navy.       Since returning to the Navy in 1970, RADM Vincent's wide      variety of afloat and shore-based assignments have provided      him extensive contracting, contract management, and logistics      experience.       Afloat he has served as the Supply Officer of an amphibious      ship, the USS PENSACOLA (LSD 38) and the Supply Officer of a      submarine tender, the USS DIXON (AS 37).       Ashore his assignments have included duty as Supply Officer      with Naval Special Warfare Group and with Naval Inshore      Warfare Command, Atlantic, both in Little Creek, Virginia. He      attended the Armed Forces Staff College, Norfolk, Virginia;      and then in Washington, D.C., he earned a Masters in Business      Administration from George Washington University.       His varied acquisition assignments include Director of      Contracts, Naval Supply Center, Puget Sound; Contracting      Officer for the Supervisor, Shipbuilding and Repair, Bath,      Maine; Director of the Combat Systems department and Director      of the Contracts department at the Navy's inventory control      point, Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania; Assistant Commander for      Contracts, Naval Air Systems Command; Deputy Director for      Acquisition for the Defense Logistics Agency; and prior to      his current assignment, RADM Vincent was the Deputy Chief of      Staff for Logistics, Fleet Supply and Ordnance, Pacific      Fleet.       In addition to his current assignment as Commandant, DSMC,      his command tours have included Commander, Defense Contract      Administration Services Region, Los Angeles, Contract      Administration Services Region, Los Angeles, California;      Commander, Defense Contract Management Command International,      Dayton, Ohio; and Commander, Contract Management Command,      Washington, D.C.       His military decorations include the Defense Superior      Service Medal with gold star, Legion of Merit with gold star,      Defense Meritorious Service Medal, Meritorious Service Medal      with three gold stars, Navy Commendation Medal, and Navy      Achievement Medal.                                  ____                               Narrative       Rear Admiral Vincent distinguished himself by exceptionally      outstanding achievement throughout thirty two years of      service culminating in his distinguished performance as      Commandant of the Defense Systems Management College (DSMC)      from 30 December 1997 to 31 July 1999.       Admiral Vincent exhibited extensive knowledge, technical      competence, tireless energy, imagination, and superb      leadership.     As Commandant, he focused the College on improvements      essential for the entire Department of Defense Acquisition      Workforce (AWF), and dramatically improved the quality and      greatly expanded the scope of their education and training.      During his tenure, student throughput increased by nearly      five percent, greatly helping the military departments to      meet the formal acquisition education requirements that      public law imposed on all major system program managers.      These achievements are all the more remarkable because they      were accomplished during a period when DSMC funding decreased      by over seven percent, and personnel by over 11 percent.       Admiral Vincent also successfully focused the exceptional      capabilities of the College's staff and faculty on meeting      the rapidly changing needs of the acquisition workforce. Upon      assuming command of DSMC, he led the College's senior      leadership through the development of a corporate plan that      set the course into the new millennium for the education and      training of acquisition professionals. This dynamic plan      provided the foundation for DSMC operations and outlined a      series of strategic goals, objectives, and metrics that      guided the College through the efficient accomplishment of      its four-pronged mission of providing education and training,      research, consulting, and information dissemination. He      successfully challenged the College to achieve these      improvements, while maintaining the highest quality of      support available to the acquisition workforce.       Anticipating the need to achieve a cultural transformation      within the acquisition community, Admiral Vincent encouraged      the students, staff, and faculty at DSMC to become change      agents and instilled in them a sense of urgency to keep up      the momentum of Acquisition Reform. He directed the      assessment and revision of over thirty DSMC-sponsored courses      to reflect the latest changes, ensuring that Acquisition      Reform initiatives are seamlessly threaded throughout the 12      functional areas. To further enrich the learning environment,      he spearheaded the effort to recruit students from industry,      bringing a commercial business perspective into every      classroom--he served as the catalyst to stimulate partnering      with industry and effective teaming within program offices.      Beginning with the students, staff, and faculty at DSMC, he      successfully developed a cultural mindset that would      revolutionize the way DoD approaches its business affairs--     embracing best practices, empowering the workforce, and      achieving optimal solutions at the lowest costs.       In a push to constantly improve the quality of integrated      courses, Admiral Vincent created the Acquisition Management      Curriculum Enhancement Program (AMCEP) to      seamlessly integrate the Acquisition Management Functional      Board requirements with the Defense Acquisition University      (DAU) course development and delivery processes. The      result was a continuous evolutionary process that      facilitated and improved the current integrated      acquisition management curriculum. The enhancement effort      created a learning environment characterized by a problem-     based learning curriculum which replicated to the highest      possible fidelity actual problems the graduates would      likely encounter in their subsequent assignments.       Additionally, to further improve the efficiency at DSMC,      Admiral Vincent consolidated all information/automation      systems enhancement efforts at the College under the Chief      Information/Knowledge Officer. By concentrating the      information technology activities under one person, Admiral      Vincent effectively orchestrated the consolidation of      automated systems requirements, significantly reducing costs      and making educational information widely available to      internal and external customers. Under Admiral Vincent's      guidance, the College underwent the process of standardizing      the automation equipment in each classroom and upgrading the      server infrastructure, along with video tele-conference      capability, to better support distance learning conversion      efforts of DSMC courses. This initiative, while minimizing      costs to infuse information technology capability, not only      improved the students' learning environment, but also made      acquisition education and training more accessible to the      workforce.       Admiral Vincent also provided the thrust behind the      development of the Integrated Curriculum Environment (ICE)      database, an automated, centralized management system for      DSMC courseware and supporting documentation. This      standardized curriculum management tool will significantly      simplify the course revision process, and eventually, will      make course materials available electronically to all      students and accessible by all graduates. Through his active      leadership and visionary foresight of the information      revolution, Admiral Vincent launched DSMC--and acquisition      education and training--into the 21st Century, guiding the      College through the transformation process of becoming the      acquisition workforce's Center for Continuous Learning.       Admiral Vincent further improved the stature of DSMC as the      Department of Defense world-class center for international      acquisition education excellence. Under his leadership, DSMC      co-sponsored the 10th Annual International Defense      Educational Arrangement (IDEA) seminar with France and hosted      the 11th IDEA seminar in the United States--a fifteen-nation      symposium on Intra-European and Transatlantic armaments      cooperation. Additionally, Admiral Vincent initiated the      first IDEA Pacific seminar with the Australian Defense Force      Academy, providing eight nations of the Pacific Rim with a      forum for exchange of acquisition best practices. With the      growing emphasis on international cooperation, the College      also hosted biannual international acquisition forums for      DUSD (International Programs) and the Services international      program offices. As the principal U.S. representative to      IDEA, Admiral Vincent provided the leadership and facilitated      international cooperation, significantly advancing the      understanding and effectiveness of international cooperative      acquisition issues among participating nations.       His distinguished career included additional command tours      as Commander, Defense Contract Administration Services      Region, Los Angeles; Commander, Defense Contract Management      Command International; Deputy Director for Acquisition      Management and Commander, Defense Contract Management      Command, Defense Logistics Agency.       Throughout the period of his assignment as Commandant,      DSMC, and his thirty-two-year career, Admiral Vincent      displayed exemplary performance of duty, extraordinary      initiative and leadership, keen judgment, and dedication to      the highest principles of devotion to his country. He leaves      the Defense Systems Management College and the acquisition      community better by having served them. His personal      dedication has been solely responsible for numerous      contributions of lasting consequence, which will enhance the      ability of each Service to accomplish its mission better, now      and in the future. His exceptional performance in extremely      important and challenging positions has been in keeping with      the highest traditions of the Service and reflects great      credit upon himself, the United States Navy, and the      Department of Defense.                          ____________________
