Mr. Speaker, I rise in very strong support of H.R. 5109, a bill affecting very positively health care personnel and formulating a pilot system for coordination of services between the VA and non-VA health care facilities.  I would like to thank at the outset the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Stump), the good and very able and very distinguished chairman of the full committee, for his leadership on this. He is indefatigable in his efforts to help and enhance veterans benefits. I have been on this committee for 20 years, and it has always been a real joy to watch him in action; and I want to thank him for his leadership. Also I want to thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Stearns), the chairman of the subcommittee, who has done yeoman's work on this legislation and the Millennium Act and other important bills; and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Evans), my good friend, for his good bipartisanship and very strong commitment to our veterans and for his work on this bill as well.  In summary, the bill not only updates pay to nurses, but adjusts the mechanism for making nurses' pay more responsive to today's market realities, increases rates of special pay to dentists, increases the salary rates to our pharmacists, and designates a physician's assistant to serve as a consultant to the Undersecretary of Veterans' Administration.  As a cutting edge initiative, it establishes pilot programs to allow veteransdependent upon medical services to be seen in facilities in much greater proximity to the veteran's home. We all know, as my good friend just said a moment ago, very often, the very long trips that members of our veterans' communities have to make to get to a hospital, I hear about it over and over again in my own district, and then there is always that legendary wait once you get there to get that service sometimes becomes a disincentive for our veterans to utilize the system. So, it is very important that we see if this experiment works and if it does, then perhaps roll it out even more.  Again, I want to congratulate my colleagues on an excellent, outstanding bill that should get the unanimous support of my colleagues.  I rise today in support of H.R. 5109 a veterans bill affecting Healthcare Personel formulating a pilot system for coordination of services between VA and Non-VA Healthcare facilities.  In summary, this bill not only updates pay to nurses but adjusts the mechanism for making nurses pay more responsive to today's market realities, increases rate of special pay to dentists, increases salary rates to pharmacist, and designates a physicians assistant to serve as a consultant to the Under Secretary of Veterans Administration. As a cutting edge initiative, it establishes pilot programs to allow veterans dependant upon medical services to be seen in facilities of much greater proximity to the veteran's home.  There is a general agreement that there is a nation-wide nursing shortage. In addition, the VA has experienced significant nurse retention problems. Appropriate and timely pay increases must be provided as part of a satisfactory work environment. This bill addresses this concern in several ways. First, it authorizes national comparability pay raise for VA nurses on par with that of other federal employees. Second, it makes optional annual locality survey process for VA nurse pay. Third, it eliminates facility directors as the sole discretionary authority to make pay increases and introduces an automatic mechanism. This will stimulate more timely raises for nurses at VA hospitals. These provisions added together, are designed to make the VA more responsive to the economic needs of nurses and will increase their retention.                    pay for dentists and pharmacists  The bill revises and increases the rates of special pay which is provided to dentists employed by the Veterans Health Administration and is long over due. It eliminates the salary cap on pharmacists.                   physician assistant as consultant  The VA employs some 1,200 PA's as the nation's largest employer of PA's in the past 30 years. But amazingly the VA does not have a PA representative to advise the Administration on the optimal usage of PA's. This bill designates a Physician's Assistant to serve as a consultant to the Under Secretary which will greatly improve understanding and utilization of the PA's by the Veterans Administration.                 pilot program on coordinating benefits  There appear to be many veterans in all areas of the country who while in need of medical services, must travel a good distance for care. In some cases this is 100 miles or more round trip. This is accomplished often at considerable inconvenience to the patient and to the family of the loved one who must provide transportation to and from VA hospitals. Add that to the legendary wait. This bill sets up a 4 site pilot program coordinating healthcare benefits between VA and non-VA health care facilities. Following up on a previously successful program in Florida, this pilot program will see if coordinated and contracted care would be satisfactory to the veteran and a cost saving gain to the Veterans Administration.  Let me emphasize that this is a program which is totally voluntary. No veteran who feels uncomfortable participating in the program is forced to do so. This is not intended to replace the parent program which has served veterans so well in the past.
