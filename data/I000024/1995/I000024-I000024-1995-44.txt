Even last night we talked about 12 months.  When the Senator and I sat next to each other at the Senate Armed Services Committee, when we had Secretary Perry and General Shalikashvili, and we asked the question that they had written up, ``Are you going to commit yourself to 12 months, to a time period after which we withdraw and we come back?'' they said, ``Yes, we are absolutely committed to that.''  Did you find anyone, who were the military people, either with NATO, the United Nations, with any of our NATO partners, or anyone up there in the Tuzla area who felt there is even a remote idea or notion we could be out of there in a 12-month period as far as achieving peace?
