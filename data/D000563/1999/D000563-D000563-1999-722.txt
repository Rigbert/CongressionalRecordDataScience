President, I rise today with my colleagues Senators Chafee, Schumer, Lautenberg, Torricelli, Reed, Boxer and Dodd to introduce the ``Permanent Brady Waiting Period Act of 1999.'' It is vital that we enact this measure if we are to ensure Americans that the popular Brady Bill will continue to be one hundred percent effective.  Five years ago, Congress passed the Brady Bill. That law contained a provision that required a 5-day waiting period before a person can buy a gun. Unfortunately last November, the waiting period was eliminated when we begin using the national instant check system for gun purchasers.  I fully support the use of an instant check system to determine if a putative firearm purchaser is legally barred from owning a gun because of a criminal record. But I believe that it must be coupled with a cooling off period.  Let me briefly explain what this legislation would do. It would require that anyone who wishes a buy a handgun must wait three days. There are two exceptions to this requirement. First, if a prospective purchaser presents a written statement from his of her local chief law enforcement officer stating that the handgun is needed immediately because of a threat to that person's life or that of his family, then the cooling off period will not apply. Second, if a prospective purchaser lives in a state that has a licensing requirement--and there are 27 such states--then the federal cooling off period will not apply.  I think both of these are common sense exceptions. Obviously people who have a legitimate and immediate need of a handgun for self-defense should be able to buy one. And in the states that have licensing or permit systems, the process of getting a permit acts as a state cooling off period.  This measure also requires that when a person applies to buy a gun that the gun shop owner send a copy of the application to the local chief law enforcement officer. In addition, it alters the amount of time that the state or federal government has to investigate a potential purchaser who has an arrest record. Under the law that will go into effect on the first of December this year, if a person with an arrest record applies for a gun, law enforcement will have three days to determine if that arrest resulted in a conviction. The measure we introduce today would give law enforcement five days.  Mr. President, let me walk you through the process of buying a gun if this law were in place.  If you are in a state that does not have a permit system in place, then you go into a store and fill out a purchase form. A copy of that form will be sent to the Insta-Check point of contact for your state and a copy will also be sent to the chief law enforcement officer for where you live. You will then need to wait three days whereupon, assuming that you do not have a criminal record or any of the other disqualifying characteristics, you will be able to pick up your gun.  If on the other hand, when the Insta-Check is run, the FBI learns that you were arrested, then you will have to wait at least 5 days. That five days will be used to determine if the arrest resulted in a conviction. If it did not, then after 5 days you can get your gun. If you were arrested and convicted then you cannot get your gun and may be prosecuted.  Enacting this law is only sensible. A cooling off period may be the only barrier between a woman and her abusive husband whose local restraining order doesn't show up on a computer check or the only obstacle in the way of a troubled person planning to commit suicide and take others with them. A cooling off period will prevent crimes of passion and spontaneous suicides. The list of people who have bought guns and used them within a few hours or a day to kill themselves or others is far too long.  A recent study by the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence demonstrates a disturbing trend that reinforces the need for a cooling off period. Normally, 4 to 5 percent of all crime guns traced by the police were used in murders. But the study found that 20 percent of all guns traced within 7 days of purchase were used in murders. That is a startlingly high incidence of guns being bought and used very soon thereafter to commit a murder.  But this measure has a second, equally important justification.  That the Insta-Check system is in very good shape, but it will never be perfect. For example, it will not have a lot of mental health records. And it is unlikely to have information like restraining orders entered in domestic violence cases. Letting local law enforcement know about a potential gun purchase is a good idea--the local sheriff may know that a person trying to buy a gun has a restraining order while the FBI's Insta-check computer might not. In short, then, this bill will help serve as a fail safe mechanism for the Insta-Check system. I for one do not want to learn a year from now that someone got a gun and used it to harm someone else when a simple check of local records in addition to the Insta-Check would have revealed that the purchaser had a history of mental instability.  Making the Brady waiting period permanent is not about more government. It's about fewer gun crime victims. I hope that we can all agree on this goal. Thank you.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 457       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
