In reference to the system being deployed this September in Alaska, my understanding, which I stated, is that it would only provide coverage for essentially the North Korean threat. And then I heard you say the system--it might be in the future--but the system would cover all threats. My sense is that this system that will be deployed would cover North Korea.
