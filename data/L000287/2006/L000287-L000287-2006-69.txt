Mr. Speaker, I wanted to inform fellow Members about a recent academic competition featuring some of the nation's sharpest young minds. The 17th annual Honda Campus All-Star Challenge (HCASC) in Orlando featured students from the nation's Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). This year, the team from Morehouse College, which is located in my Congressional District, won the competition. I want to offer my sincere congratulations to Dr. Anderson Williams, Coach of the Morehouse team, along with Jordan A. Harris who was captain of the winning team.  In addition to the sense of personal satisfaction the Morehouse team gained from winning, they also received a $50,000 grant for their school. The runner-up, North Carolina Central University, took home a $25,000 grant. The remaining 62 teams earned grants ranging from $3,000 to $15,000. Through the program, more than $300,000 in institutional grants are awarded annually to participating schools.  For 17 years, HCASC has celebrated the academic and cultural benefits offered by the HBCUs while honoring African American cultural icons. Since Honda founded this program in 1989, more than 50,000 HBCU students have participated, and Honda annually awards educational grants to participating HBCUs.  More than 320 college students from 64 HBCUs across the country competed in the 4-day round-robin format tournament. The top two teams from each of eight divisions advance to the ``Sweet 16,'' in a single-elimination playoff. The final two teams then compete for the National Champion title in a best 2- out of 3-final series.  Nearly 100 HBCU presidents, educators, alumni and community volunteers attended the event, themed ``Your Challenging Spirit'' to support the participating students. The theme speaks to the spirit the students have exhibited to get to this point and may have to call upon throughout their lives. Influential PBS Talk Show Host and radio personality, Tavis Smiley, kicked off the event with a keynote speech at the welcome dinner.  In addition to winning institutional grants, the one-of-a-kind competition gives HCASC students the chance to exercise teamwork and establish long-term relationships through unique networking forums.  The Morehouse team included: captain Jordan A. Harris (Senior, Economics), and players Mark A. Bernard (Senior, Chemistry), Anthony Christopher Smith (Senior, Political Science & Pre-Law), John Ramsey Clarke (Senior, Economics) and Alvin McNair (Freshman, Undeclared). They were coached by Dr. Anderson Cornelius Williams (Professor; Elberton, Ga.).  The Honda Campus All-Star Challenge is the only competition of its kind and was established by American Honda Motor Co., Inc., in 1989. Since the inception of the program, more than 50,000 HBCU students have participated, and Honda has awarded more than $5 million in grants to HBCUs to improve campus life through facility improvements and increasing academic resources.  Below is a list of the 16 playoff teams which qualified for the ``Sweet 16'' playoff round in Orlando. Congratulations to all the participating teams and thanks to Honda for sponsoring such a wonderful event.      2006 Honda Campus All-Star Challenge Sweet 16 Playoff Teams       1.
