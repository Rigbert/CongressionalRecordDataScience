Speaker, as we celebrate the birth of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and reflect on his life and work, we are reminded of the challenges that democracy poses to us and the delicacy of liberty. Dr. King's life, and, unfortunately, his untimely death, remind us that we must continually work and, if necessary, fight to secure and protect our freedoms. Dr. King, in his courage to act, his willingness to meet challenges, and his ability to achieve, embodied all that is good and true in the battle for liberty.  The spirit of Dr. King lives on in the citizens of communities throughout our nation. It lives on in the people whose actions reflect the spirit of resolve and achievement that will help move our country into the future. In particular, several distinguished individuals from Indiana's First Congressional District were recognized during the 21st Annual Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial Breakfast on Monday, January 17, 2000, at the Genesis Center in Gary, Indiana. In the past year, these individuals have, in their own ways, acted with courage, met challenges, and used their abilities to reach goals and enhance their communities.  I would like to recognize Tolleston Junior High School students: Kenneth Alford; Antoinette Correa; William Gonzalez; Brian Henderson; Carl Johnson; LaTasha LeFlore; Brannon Smith; Whitney Sullivan; Amanda Bouleware; Tiffany Finch; Kyle Hargrove; Floyd Hobson; Breon Jones; Ekene Onwuka; Mason Smith; Montreca Walker; and Andrew Binder. These students are members of the Tolleston Junior High School Spell Bowl Team, which won its sixth consecutive State Spell Bowl Championship. The team's success is also a credit to the outstanding ability and leadership of its teachers. In particular, Margaret Hymes and Janice Williams should be commended for the devotion they have demonstrated as coaches for the Tolleston Junior High Spell Bowl Team. Additionally, Tolleston Principal Lucille Upshaw and Dr. Mary Guinn, Gary Superintendent of Schools, should be recognized for their support. The accomplishments of these outstanding individuals are a reflection of their hard work and dedication to scholarship. Their scholastic effort and rigorous approach to learning have made them the best in the state. They have also brought pride to themselves, their families, their school and their communities. For this great achievement, they will be honored with the 2000 ``Marcher's Award''.  Though very different in nature, the achievement of all these individuals reflect many of the same attributes that Dr. King possessed, as well as the values he advocated. Like Dr. King, these individuals saw challenges and rose to the occasion. They set goals and worked to achieve them. Mr. Speaker, I urge you and our other colleagues to join me in commending their initiative, determination and dedication.                          ____________________
