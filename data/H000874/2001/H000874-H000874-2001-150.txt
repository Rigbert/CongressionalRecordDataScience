The rotunda has witnessed the awarding of Congressional Gold Medals to 34 worthy Americans who have distinguished themselves in various ways in service to our country. I think most of us can think of no American who has brought more smiles to more faces of children and adults alike, and thus deserves to join the pantheon of distinguished gold medal honorees more than the late Charles Schulz.  In recognition of Mr. Schulz' lifetime of service, last year Congress enacted and President Clinton signed legislation authorizing this honor, which is Congress' greatest expression of national appreciation for civilians.                              {time}  1845  A gold medal, Madam Speaker, is entirely appropriate for a tireless man who drew every frame of his Peanuts comic strip for nearly half a century.  His cartoonist career followed his service in the infantry in World War II, during which he entertained his comrades with cartoons about military life. I am certain that his cartoons helped many soldiers endure the horrors and hardships that confronted them during that time.  I think all of us regret that Charles Schulz cannot be present to enjoy the honor that the Congress has bestowed. Although Mr. Schulz left us early last year, his work, of course, is timeless.  Fortunately for us and for generations yet unborn, Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Linus, Lucy, and the rest of the Peanuts gang will always be here to amuse us and, yes, to teach us. They have become, as last year's legislation noted correctly, part of the fabric of our national culture.  Madam Speaker, there could be a no more fitting use of the rotunda than to honor Charles Schulz in this way.  Madam Speaker, further reserving the right to object, I yield to the sponsor of the resolution and last year's legislation, the gentleman from California (Mr. Thompson), in whose district Mr. Schulz lived.
