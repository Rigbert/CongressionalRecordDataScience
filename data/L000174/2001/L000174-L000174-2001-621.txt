President, I rise today to add my support to promoting electronic commerce and keeping it free from discriminatory and multiple state and local taxes. I am pleased to join the senior senator from Oregon as an original cosponsor of the Internet Non-Discrimination and Sales Tax Simplification Act. I commend Senator Wyden for his continued leadership on Internet tax policy.  The Internet has changed the way we do business. Today, businesses can sell their goods and services all over the world in the blink of an eye. E-commerce has created new markets, new efficiencies and new products. In fact, retail revenues from electronic commerce grew from $13 billion in 1999 to $26 billion in 2000. Retail sales are expected to continue to grow on the Internet to $178 billion in 2005.  The growth of electronic commerce is everywhere, including my home state of Vermont. Today, hundreds of Vermont businesses are doing business on the Internet, ranging from the Vermont Teddy Bear Company to Al's Snowmobile Parts Warehouse to Ben & Jerry's Homemade Ice Cream.  Let me just give you a few examples of Cyberselling in Vermont:  The New York Times recently profiled Buch Spieler, a Montpelier music store, as a shining example of the power of the Internet to boast sales and change the way many local stores do business. According to Fred Wilber, who has been running Buch Spieler for the past 27 years, overall sales has jumped by 10 percent and its customer base has expanded by 20 percent in the 18 months since he took his business online.  Gardeners Supply Company of Burlington opened its web site five years ago to accompany its catalog of environmentally-sound products. With an average annual growth rate of about 150 percent, Gardeners now sells more than $10 million worth on products online.  Pompanoosuc Mills, a furniture company in Thetford, has been online for about two years. In its first year, the company made about $1,300 a week from Internet-related sales. By its second year, online sales had tripled to $4,000 a week.  Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, based in Waterbury, went on the web to gain more direct access to consumers since its coffee business was about 95 percent wholesale. Today, Green Mountain has doubled its retail sales through the Internet.  And Burr Morse, President of Morse Farm Sugar Works, outside Montpelier, sold so much maple syrup online that he testified before the Senate Commerce Committee on the benefits of e-commerce for small businesses nationwide.  For the past five years I have learned first-hand about this e-commerce explosion by hosting annual workshops on Internet sales. At my Doing Business On The Internet Workshops in Vermont, small business owners recounted tales of successful selling on the Web and share their tips for future success with fellow entrepreneurs. For instance, Megan Smith of The Vermont Inn in Killington attended one of the workshops and now takes reservations over the Net from customers all across the country and around the world. And Maura Malone attended our workshops for the past three years in a row to learn how to reach more customers for her fabric/quilt store, Back Country Threads, which is deep in the woods in Essex. She created her own website and won the ``Top Customer Service Award'' from Yahoo Store for the last 10 months running.  These Vermont cybersellers are of all sizes and customer bases, from Main Street merchants to boutique entrepreneurs to a couple of famous ex-hippies who sell great ice cream. But what Vermont online sellers do have in common is that Internet commerce allowsthem to erase the geographic barriers that historically have limited our access to major markets. With the power of the Internet, Vermonters can sell their products and services anywhere, anytime. Cyberselling is paying off for Vermont and the rest of the nation.  With the Internet's exciting economic opportunities come unique challenges. One of the critical challenges in our new economy is developing fair and balanced tax policy that respects the rights of states and local jurisdictions while fostering a stable environment for e-commerce to continue to grow. I believe the Internet Non-Discrimination and Sales Tax Simplification Act strikes that fair balance.  Our legislation extends the current moratorium against discriminatory and multiple taxes on goods and services sold over the Internet through 2006. The current three-year moratorium, enacted as part of the 1998 Internet Tax Freedom Act, which I was proud to cosponsor, is set to expire in October 2001. This five-year extension of the moratorium was one of the recommendations in the Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce's April 2000 report to Congress.  Electronic commerce is beginning to blossom, but it is still in its infancy. Stability is key to reaching its full potential, and creating new tax categories for the Internet is exactly the wrong thing to do. Internet commerce should not be subject to discriminatory new taxes that do not apply to other commerce.  Indeed, without the current moratorium, there are 30,000 different jurisdictions around the country that could levy discriminatory or multiple Internet taxes on e-commerce. We need to continue the moratorium to provide the stability necessary for electronic commerce to flourish. We are not asking for a tax-free zone on the Internet; if sales taxes and other taxes would apply to traditional sales and services, then those taxes would also apply to Internet sales under our legislation. But our legislation would continue the ban on any taxes applied only to Internet sales in a discriminatory manner.  Let's not allow the future of electronic commerce--with its great potential to expand the markets of Main Street businesses--to be crushed by the weight of multiple or discriminatory taxation.  While Congress should continue to prevent discriminatory e-commerce taxes, we also need a national policy to make sure that the traditional state and local sales taxes on Internet sales are applied and collected fairly and uniformly. Our bill encourages states to simplify their sales tax rules and to develop national standards on e-commerce. To help state and local governments improve their collection of sales taxes on e-commerce, our bill authorizes Congress to consider legislation under fast-track procedures to require sellers to collect sales taxes on goods and services sold over the Internet.  I commend the National Conference of State Legislatures and the National Governors Association for their efforts to create uniformity among states for the collection of remote sales taxes. I hope our legislation will further this simplification process as state legislatures and governors around the nation work together to come up with national standards for e-commerce taxation. I pledge to work with them to reach consensus on these difficult remote tax issues.  Today, there are more than a million businesses selling their sales and services on the World Wide Web around the world. This explosion in Web growth has led to thousands of new jobs and exciting opportunities for businesses from Main Street to Wall Street. A March 1999 survey of e-commerce in Vermont that I commissioned found that Vermont businesses had already created 1,404 jobs as a result of Internet commerce--with the potential to create 24,280 new jobs in my home state by the end of this year. The Internet Non-Discrimination and Sales Tax Simplification Act will insure that Vermonters continue to reap the rewards of electronic commerce.  E-Commerce is booming, our moratorium law is working, and we should keep a good thing going and growing. I am proud to cosponsor the Internet Non-Discrimination and Sales Tax Simplification Act to encourage online commerce to continue to grow with confidence. I urge my colleagues to support its swift passage into law.                          ____________________
