Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to southern California are exceptional. Our community has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent to make their communities a better place to live and work. Claudia Luppino is one of these individuals. On Friday, January 4, 2013, Claudia ended her tenure as the Area Director for the Inland Area jurisdiction of the Social Security Administration (SSA) after 37 years of service.  Claudia grew up in Erie, Pennsylvania, where she and her future husband Bud were high school sweethearts. After graduating from Erie Business College, the young military wife began her government career with the U.S. Army Computer Systems Command at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, later transferring to March Air Force Base in Riverside. In 1977, after Bud left the Air Force, she began her career with Social Security as the Administrative Aide in the Riverside District office. Since then, she has held more than a dozen positions with the Agency, including Claims Representative, Operations Analyst and Operations Supervisor.  In 1985 Claudia was selected as the Area Analyst in the Inland Area Director's Office (ADO), and in 1987 she became the District Manager in the Redlands Office, where she served for two years before being selected as the Operations Officer in San Bernardino. In 1993 Claudia rejoined the Inland ADO as the Area Administrative Assistant, and later went on to serve as the Assistant District Manager in Palm Springs, District Manager in North Las Vegas, District Manager in Victorville, Deputy Area Director in the Inland Area Director's Office and the District Manager for the Riverside District. Claudia is a graduate of the Region IX Leadership Development Program and has received numerous awards, including the Regional Commissioner's Citation.  Claudia recently concluded an assignment as the Acting Area Director in the Los Angeles Metro Area. She served for over six months as the Acting Area Director in the Inland Area, where she oversaw 540 employees in 16 offices in Riverside and San Bernardino counties, and all of Nevada. It was a responsibility she took seriously. According to her, ``There is no other government agency that provides the critical services SSA does, providing retirement, survivors and disability benefits as well as Supplemental Security Income benefits to the American public.'' What she will miss most about her job, she said, ``is that very ability to make a difference in the lives of so many people.''  In her retirement, Claudia plans to help her husband Bud with his business, Bud's Tire and Wheel, Inc. in Riverside, and a shop in Moreno Valley. They will soon begin construction on a third location in Riverside. She also looks forward to traveling more, learning Italian and spending time with her three grandsons.  In light of all Claudia has done for southern California seniors, it is only fitting that she be honored for her many years of dedicated service. Claudia's tireless passion for public service has contributed immensely to the betterment of the Inland Empire and I am proud to call her a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for her service and salute her as she retires.                          ____________________
