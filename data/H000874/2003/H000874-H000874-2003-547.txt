Leader, we do not have time to debate that issue; but I will yield back to the gentleman.  Mr. DeLAY. I think that he is ultimately fair and will treat the minority fairly as it comes to the welfare reform bill.  To be serious about it, I think the minority deserves to be heard on welfare reform, especially welfare reform, and the chairman will treat them fairly.
