 President, I rise to recognize and congratulate my good friend from Maryland, Senator Barbara Mikulski, on today becoming the longest serving female Senator in the history of the Senate. This is an achievement that takes courage and passion and commitment, three things all of us who know her so well know she has in abundance.  Even more important than honoring my friend on the length of her service today, I believe it is important to recognize what she has done with that service.
