I say to my good friend Senator Cruz, I think sometimes people like you who are living this issue 24 hours a day--literally 24 hours on this day--may assume people understand the significance of some things that they do not. Because I got these phone calls last night when I was talking about--and I quoted our leader here in the Senate, Senator Harry Reid. A couple days ago on the PBS program ``Nevada Week in Review,'' Senate majority leader Harry Reid was asked whether his goal was to move ObamaCare to a single-payer system, and his answer was: ``Yes, yes. Absolutely, yes.''  I know I said this last night. But a lot of people did not realize that because there is--and if the Senator does not mind, I am going to take a few minutes here to kind of set the question up because I think it is important.  As the Acting President pro tempore will remember, since he was in the other body when I was elected many years ago to the House of Representatives--I recall at that time nobody thought the Republicans would ever be a majority of anything, the House or the Senate. I know that would have pleased the Acting President pro tempore. It is kind of interesting because we became very good friends, and yet we are philosophically apart from each other.  But I observed four things, and I did not think about this until this morning and how this subject fits into this. At the time Republicans were totally insignificant in the House of Representatives, so I spent my time sitting on the floor, and I listened and I observed some things, and I actually wrote a paper about this. I am going from memory now, but I recall in this paper I said there are, in my opinion, four flawed premises on which Democrats' policies are based, and I listed those four flawed premises.
