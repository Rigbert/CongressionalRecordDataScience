Speaker, every one of us who serves in this House relies on the talented and hardworking staff of ours and of the House itself. We couldn't do what we do without them. They not only serve us faithfully, but serve our constituents as well, and they often do so without recognition.  Today my colleagues and I want to recognize someone who has been serving the people of Maryland's Fifth District and our country as a senior member of my staff for a decade and, indeed, before that, on the Senate side for close to a decade as well.  Many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have come to know Mary Frances Repko. If you have dealt with the environment, if you have dealt with energy, or if you have dealt with the history of the Senate and the House on energy legislation and environmental legislation over the last 20 years, you know Mary Frances Repko.  Mr. Speaker, many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle know Mary Frances well and respect her deep intellect, her professionalism, and her sage counsel. When it comes to energy policy and environmental issues, there are few on this Hill who know more of the intricacies and complexities of the issues than she does.  I am very proud of Mary Frances because the leadership staffs on both the Democratic and Republican side engage her in order to ensure that all the facts and ramifications of energy and environmental legislation are known and considered.  Mary Frances has been integrally involved in every major energy and environmental legislative debate over the past 10 years.  I know Leader Pelosi is also a great admirer of Mary Frances Repko. Her staff and Mary Frances have worked very closely together, including on the Recovery Act, the American Clean Energy and Security Act, the Energy Independence and Security Act, the EPA Act of 2005, the Renewable Fuel Standard, the BP oil spill, flood insurance, Hurricane Sandy relief, the Water Resources Development Act, the Flint water crisis, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Land and Water Conservation Fund, land conservation bills, transportation bills, and fighting partisan antienvironmental riders--an extraordinary history of deep and effective involvement on the issues.                              {time}  1545  She has also been my lead staff on Puerto Rico, working closely with the Resident Commissioner's staff to help the people of the island through a debt crisis and Zika. For the past 4 years, she has also been the lead staffer for House Democrats' Make It In America plan for investing in job creation and making opportunities more accessible to American workers.  When Mary Frances first came to the whip's office in 2007, I felt fortunate to have enticed her to leave the United States Senate, where she had served as a senior policy adviser for the Committee on the Environment and Public Works. Earlier, she had served as Senator Cantwell's legislative director, and as legislative staffer for former Senator Russ Feingold.  Now it is with a great sadness that we must wish her farewell and send her back to the Senate, where she will return to the Environment and Public Works Committee as its new deputy staff director.
