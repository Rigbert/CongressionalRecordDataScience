Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4411, the Internet Gambling Prohibition and Enforcement Act. The version we consider today merges H.R. 4777, the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act, offered by the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte), and H.R. 4411, the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 introduced by the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Leach).  I am pleased to have worked closely with Mr. Goodlatte, Mr. Leach and members of the Committee on Financial Services to draft a compromise on this important legislation which has allowed it to come to the floor today.  In recent years, illegal online gambling activities and their adverse social consequences have risen dramatically. Americans will send $6 billion to unregulated, offshore, online casinos this year, 50 percent of the $12 billion wagered on Internet gambling worldwide.  The Department of Justice has warned that Internet gambling sites are often fronts for money laundering, drug trafficking and even terrorist financing. Furthermore, these sites evade vigorous U.S.-based gambling regulations that restrict gambling by minors, protect chronic gamblers and ensure the integrity of the games.  The characteristics of Internet gambling are unique: online players can gamble 24 hours a day from home; children may play without sufficient age verification; and betting with a credit card can undercut a player's perception of the value of cash, leading to addiction, bankruptcy and crime. Young people and compulsive gamblers are particularly vulnerable.  The legislation we consider today clarifies the application of the Wire Act to the Internet, and prohibits not only sports betting, but traditional gambling such as online poker, blackjack and roulette.  It further provides Federal, State and tribal law enforcement with the tools to combat Internet gambling and cuts off revenue to those who profit from this destructive and illegal activity. The bill accomplishes this by prohibiting the use of financial instruments such as credit cards, electronic fund transfers, checks and drafts to pay for online gambling bets. It also increases the criminal penalties for violation of the Wire Act from a maximum of 2 years to a maximum of 5 years.  Legislation to address illegal online gambling is strongly supported by a broad and diverse coalition representing religious organizations, professional sports leagues, entertainment companies, the financial services industry, and State lottery commissions. Moreover, the unique national and global character of the Internet requires a clear and decisive congressional response to illegal activities that occur online.  The time to pass strong prohibitions against Internet gambling is now. I urge my colleagues to pass this vital legislation.                                         House of Representatives,                                   Committee on the Judiciary,                                    Washington, DC, July 10, 2006.     Hon. Joe Barton,     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Barton: Thank you for your recent letter      concerning the Committee on Energy and Commerce's      jurisdictional interest in H.R. 4411, the ``Unlawful Internet      Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006, as amended.'' I acknowledge      the Committee on Energy and Commerce's jurisdictional      interest in the amendment in the nature of a substitute to      H.R. 4411 and appreciate your willingness to waive further      consideration of the legislation in order to expedite its      consideration on the House floor.       I agree that by foregoing consideration of the amendment in      the nature of a substitute to H.R. 4411, the Committee on      Energy and Commerce does not waive jurisdiction over subject      matter contained in this or similar legislation. In addition,      I agree to support representation from the Committee on      Energy and Commerce for provisions of H.R. 4411 determined to      be within its jurisdiction in the event of a House-Senate      conference on the legislation.       Finally, as requested, I will include a copy of your letter      and this response in the Congressional Record during floor      consideration of this legislation.           Sincerely,                                      F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr.,     Chairman.                                  ____                                         House of Representatives,                             Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                    Washington, DC, July 10, 2006.     Hon. F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr.     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,     Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Sensenbrenner: I understand that the House      plans to consider H.R. 4411, as amended, the Unlawful      Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006, this week. The      proposed amendment in the nature of a substitute contains      provisions that fall within the jurisdiction of the Committee      on Energy and Commerce.       I recognize your desire to join Chairman Oxley and bring      this legislation before the House in an expeditious manner.      Accordingly, I will not exercise my Committee's right to a      referral. By agreeing to waive its consideration of the bill,      however, the Energy and Commerce Committee does not waive its      jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in the      amendment in the nature of a substitute to H.R. 4411. In      addition, the Energy and Commerce Committee reserves its      right to seek conferees for any provisions of the bill that      are within its jurisdiction during any House-Senate      conference that may be convened on this or similar      legislation. I ask for your commitment to support any request      by the Energy and Commerce Committee for conferees on H.R.      4411 or similar legislation.       I request that you include this letter in the Congressional      Record during consideration of H.R. 4411. Thank you for your      attention to these matters.           Sincerely,                                                       Joe Barton,                                                         Chairman.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
