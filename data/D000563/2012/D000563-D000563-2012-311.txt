What an amazing coalition.  Amazon.com, the largest retailer online in America, supports our bill. Yet the largest online retailer, in supporting this bill, still has Members of the Senate questioning whether they are going to react positively. They are on record in favor of this.  It is also supported by groups such as the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the National Association of Counties, and the National Council of State Legislators. The National Governors Association supports the Marketplace Fairness Act, because these State and local governments are losing about $23 billion a year on uncollected sales tax. In Illinois, we are losing about $1 billion a year, about 15 percent of our current deficit. It would make a difference if we could collect this. Again, the States would have to make that decision. We don't force it on them.  This has the support of eight Democratic Governors and 13 Republican Governors, including Governor Quinn of Illinois, O'Malley of Maryland, McDonnell of Virginia, Mitch Daniels of Indiana, and Haley from the State of South Carolina. Recently, Governor Chris Christie from the State of New Jersey publicly came out in support and said:       I too--along with Governors like Governor Daniels and      others--urge the federal government and Congress in      particular to get behind . . . legislation to allow states to      be able to make these choices for themselves. . . .  Governor LePage, a Republican Governor from the State of Maine, wrote a letter of support saying, ``The Marketplace Fairness Act does not raise taxes.'' The point he makes and the argument here is this is not a new tax.  So if this bill has such broad bipartisan support, why haven't we passed it? Well, we need 60 Senators. The majority leader has said to me and Senator Enzi, ``Show me the votes.'' And that is what we are trying to do--bring together a bipartisan group that will support this, that understands it is simple fairness for small businesses that create jobs and opportunities all across America. And with the sales taxes they collect, they provide for local police and firemen, for the sewers and streets, and the things in life that we come to take for granted in our cities across America. We want to make sure the online retailers are making the same contribution.  So I urge my colleagues, when this amendment comes before them, to support it on a bipartisan basis.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
