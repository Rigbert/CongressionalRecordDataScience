       The legislation increasing the fuel economy standards of      vehicles by 10 miles per gallon over 10 years does not impact      the authority to regulate tailpipe emissions of the EPA,      California, or other States, under the Clean Air Act.       The intent was to give NHTSA the ability to regulate fuel      efficiency standards of vehicles, and increase the fleetwide      average to at least 35 miles per gallon by 2020.       There was no intent in any way, shape, or form to      negatively affect, or otherwise restrain, California or any      other State's existing or future tailpipe emissions laws, or      any future EPA authority on tailpipe emissions.       The two issues are separate and distinct.       As the Supreme Court correctly observed in Massachusetts v.      EPA, the fact ``that DOT sets mileage standards in no way      licenses EPA to shirk its environmental responsibilities. EPA      has been charged with protecting the public's health and      welfare, a statutory obligation wholly independent of DOT's      mandate to promote energy efficiency. The two obligations may      overlap, but there is no reason to think the two agencies      cannot both administer their obligations and yet avoid      inconsistency.''       I agree with the Supreme Court's view of consistency. There      is no reason to think the two agencies cannot both administer      their obligations and yet avoid inconsistency.       The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of      California in Central Valley Chrysler-Jeep v. Goldstone has      reiterated this point in finding that if approved by EPA,      California's standards are not preempted by the Energy Policy      Conservation Act.       Title I of the Energy Security and Independence Act of      2007, H.R. 6, provides clear direction to the Department of      Transportation, in consultation with the Department of Energy      and the Environmental Protection Agency, to raise fuel      economy standards.       By taking this action, Congress is continuing DOT's      existing authority to set vehicle fuel economy standards.      Importantly, the separate authority and responsibility of the      U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to regulate vehicle      greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act is in no      manner affected by this legislation as plainly provided for      in section 3 of the bill addressing the relationship of H.R.      6 to other laws.       I fought for section 3. I have resisted all efforts to add      legislative language requiring ``harmonization'' of these EPA      and NHTSA standards. This language could have required that      EPA standards adopted under section 202 of the Clean Air Act      reduce only the air pollution emissions that would already      result from NHTSA fuel economy standards, effectively making      the NHTSA fuel economy standards a national ceiling for the      reduction of pollution. Our legislation does not establish a      NHTSA ceiling. It does not mention the Clean Air Act, so we      certainly do not intend to strip EPA of its wholly separate      mandate to protect the public health and welfare from air      pollution.       To be clear, Federal standards can avoid inconsistency      according to the Supreme Court, while still fulfilling their      separate mandates.                          ____________________
