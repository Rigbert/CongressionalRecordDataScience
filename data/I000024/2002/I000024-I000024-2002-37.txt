President, I would like to briefly comment on an exceptional group of students from my Stateof Oklahoma. Recently, a group of students from Tahlequah High School in Tahlequah, OK, participated in the national finals of ``We The People . . . The Citizens and the Constitution.'' These students traveled here to Washington, DC for the final competition after excelling in the preliminary stages.  This contest is held for students who have a remarkable knowledge of American history. The group includes Chris Augerhole, J.R. Baker, Chad Blish, Ryan Cannonie, Taylor Gibson, Carlton Heard, Cobin Heard, Zach Israel, Doug Kirk, Helena Loose, Lacie Newman, Tim Pace, Rebecca Walker, Derek Whaler, Brandon Zellner and their teacher Norma Boren.  These young Oklahomans demonstrated their ability to articulate the ideals of American government while taking part in a simulated congressional hearing.  I commend these students for their outstanding achievement.                          ____________________
