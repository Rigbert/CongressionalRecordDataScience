President, earlier I talked about what has happened on the Manafort and Cohen matters yesterday. I understand the great amount of consternation there is at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. Having been a prosecutor, I can understand why there is consternation.  I note for my colleagues that we passed in the Senate Judiciary Committee a bipartisan bill--Republican and Democrats voted for the bill--to protect the special prosecutor. Thereare those of us who are old enough to remember when Richard Nixon fired the special prosecutor in the Watergate matter and the great constitutional problems that followed. It was something the country suffered over for years, and we want to make sure we don't have another firing like we did in the Watergate matter. So we wrote this bill. Again, Republicans and Democrats voted for it. It could be brought up anytime by the leadership, if they wished. I am hoping that it will be brought up. I am hoping we can bring it to the floor and we can have a vote. I know we had a good debate--again, Republicans and Democrats--in the Judiciary Committee, and I would like to see it voted on.  I notice we are at the hour of 3:30, and I know the Presiding Officer has a ruling to make, so I will withhold.                          ____________________
