 President, the terrorists have had a very difficult almost 5 years since 9/11. That was clearly the high-water mark, their attack on America, the killing of over 3,000 people.  Ever since that day, they have been on defense because the President, with widespread support in the Congress, decided to go on offense. And for the last 4\1/2\ years, we have been killing terrorists, capturing terrorists. Many are hiding in their caves. We have liberated 50 million people in Afghanistan and Iraq.
