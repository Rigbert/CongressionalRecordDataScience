 President, I would like to reiterate my longstanding opposition to any amendments or modifications to the Mexico City policy, the Kemp-Kasten amendment, or any exceptions on the use of funds as authorized in Public Law 108-25, the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003. Some provisions related to these items are included in the State and Foreign Operations Appropriations bill that the Senate is prepared to pass, and I anticipate that if this language remains part of the final measure, the bill will draw a veto threat from the administration. Although I will support this bill in the spirit of moving this process forward, I look forward to working with my colleagues and Members of the House to ensure that the final version of the bill can be signed by the President and does not undermine these critical pro-life and pro-family provisions.
