 President, I rise today to honor Staff Sergeant Andrew Ramirez who has served his country with bravery and valor. For Sergeant Ramirez, a resident of East Los Angeles, public service runs in the family--his brother is a detective with the Los Angeles Police Department.  On March 31, 1999, Sergeant Ramirez was taken as a prison of war by the Yugoslavia Army while he was serving as part of a U.S. Army detachment assigned to a U.N. monitoring force patrolling Yugoslavia's southern border. Sergeant Ramirez was part of the 4th Cavalry Regiment of the 1st Infantry Division based in Wurzburg, Germany. He had arrived in Macedonia in early March to relieve another contingent.  I cannot begin to imagine the terror experienced by Sergeant Ramirez and his fellow soldiers, Christopher J. Stone and Steven M. Gonzales, when they were surrounded, and under heavy fire, taken as prisoners of war.  Just a few days later, the soldiers were shown on Serbian television, battered and bruised. It is a picture that every mother hopes she will never see. It is a picture that every American hoped was not true. But, it was true, and these three men paid a dear price of over a month in captivity. They did not know what fate would befall them and if they were ever going to see their families again.  During the past weeks, Kosovo has witnessed carnage and bloodshed unseen in Europe for almost fifty years. These events are the culmination of a decade-long campaign of terror and bloodshed in the Balkans--and it has created a refugee crisis unparalleled in recent years.  Sergeant Ramirez was in Yugoslavia because his country asked him to go. He was there to protect our promise that the civilized world will never again do nothing in the face of genocide, ethnic cleansing, mass rape and rampant violence to thousands of innocent people. If the most powerful alliance in the world fails to stop ethnic cleansing, it will send a green light to every tyrant and dictator with similar intentions that they can do the same, and that the world community will be unable or unwilling to muster the resolve to stop it.  None of these words would mean anything without individuals like Sergeant Anthony Ramirez. He is the truest of patriots--the bravest of the brave. Our country is forever indebted to him, and there are not words nor deeds that could every repay his dedicated service--or that of his family. He is a testament to the human spirit that keeps the light of peace and human freedoms alive.  Sergeant Ramirez, we thank you, we honor you, and we are so very, very glad that you are home.                          ____________________
