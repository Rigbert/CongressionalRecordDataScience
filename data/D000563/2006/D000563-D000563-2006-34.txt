President, tomorrow is an historic day in Peoria, IL. It was exactly 60 years ago tomorrow--on December 6, 1946--that George Manias opened his shoeshine business with one shoeshine chair in the corner of a downtown barber shop.  George has been shining shoes in Peoria ever since--for working folks, movie stars, famous athletes, and at least two presidents.  This evening, the Peoria City Council will honor George Manias with a special resolution in his honor. I ask unanimous consent that the text of that resolution be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                   Office of the Mayor--Proclamation 60th Anniversary, George's Shoeshine Parlor, ``World Headquarters'',                             Peoria, Illinois       Whereas, George Manias opened his shoeshine business in      1946, and he has been in the heart of Downtown for 60 years      and is recognized by the City of Peoria for his genuine      concern for people, his traditional work ethic, and his      ability to continue to operate a successful small business in      a changing environment; and       Whereas, George Manias has been locally and nationally      recognized for many years and has been featured in the U.S.A.      Today newspaper and on the Today Show on NBC; and       Whereas, George Manias has an open door to everyone from      all walks of life and has served the citizens of Peoria, as      well as local and national celebrities and elected officials,      including President Ronald Reagan and Senator Everett      Dirksen;       Now Therefore, I, Jim Ardis, Mayor of the City of Peoria,      Illinois, do hereby congratulate       George Manias in Peoria, Illinois, on the occasion of the      60th Anniversary of George's Shoeshine Parlor.
