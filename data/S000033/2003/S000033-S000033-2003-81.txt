 Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Gutknecht) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Hoekstra).  There is no question that there are people in this country who are literally dying or suffering because they cannot afford the high prices that they are forced to pay in this country. It is not acceptable that an industry which is so wealthy and so profitable can continue to force Americans to suffer in that way.  It excites me that we are coming together regardless of philosophy or party to say enough is enough. I look forward to that vote. I think we have them on the run, and I think the literature that the gentleman showed is just an indication of how desperate and panicky they must be. I would say to the American people it is a sad state of affairs when an industry has to stoop to that level. I think Congress has caught up to them, and I think we are finally going to represent effectively the American people on this issue.
