 President, on an entirely different matter, I said yesterday the Senate would thoroughly review the White House deal with Iran. I said we would hold hearings and we would call witnesses and ultimately vote to approve or disapprove the deal in accordance with the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act. That is what we have long planned to do, and once the administration fully transmits the text, that is just what we will do.  Senators are already taking a close look at what they have been able to get their hands on thus far, but the Senate eagerly awaits the full transmission of that text and the required certifications. We await the beginning of a comprehensive review process premised on a simple question: Can the agreement meet its essential test of leaving our country and our allies safer?                          ____________________
