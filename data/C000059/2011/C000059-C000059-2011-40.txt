Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to the community of Corona, California are exceptional. Corona has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent to make their communities a better place to live and work. Pat Miller is one of these individuals. On January 15, 2011, Pat will receive a prestigious honor when the Corona Chamber of Commerce names her Citizen of the Year for 2010 at the organization's 96th Annual Awards and Installation dinner at the Eagle Glen Golf Club.  Pat Miller and her late husband, Roger, owned and operated the Thomas Miller Mortuary for many years before they turned over day-to-day operations to their son Chris and his wife Rhonda. The mortuary has been an integral part of the community of Corona, and has provided care and solace to many families who have lost loved ones.  In addition to her role as a business owner in the community, Pat Miller exemplifies the word ``volunteer.'' She has spent her life donating her time and attention to various clubs, organizations and activities. In 1985, she served as the President of Soroptimist International of Corona, and remains a life member. Through Soroptimist she became involved with the Riverside County Coalition for Alternatives to Domestic Violence.  Thanks to the diligent efforts of Pat, and a group of core volunteers, the services provided by this organization have expanded tremendously. The organization is now known as the Corona Outreach office, and the facility has grown from one small shelter to a 45-bed facility. Pat also served on the Board of Directors and Advisory Board for many years. Her accomplishments did not go unnoticed, and Pat was awarded the Women Helping Women Award in 1985 and the Golden West Regional Award Program.  Additionally, Pat donated much of her time to volunteering with the school district as she raised her children, Chris and Stephanie. She has remained active member of the PTA, the Corona-Norco School District Advisory Committee, and now has a renewed interest now that her grandchildren are in school.  For many years, Pat served on the Corona Regional Medical Center Foundation Board and chaired the main fundraising black tie dinner several times. In fact, she is now in her 15th year serving on the Corona Regional Medical Center Governing Board of Directors.  Other organizations fortunate enough to have Pat's attention include the Women's Improvement Club of Corona, Navy League, Children's Home Society, Pink Ladies Hospital Auxiliary, Boys Club Auxiliary, The United Way, Catholic Daughters, Corona Chamber of Commerce and St. Matthew's Church.  In light of all Pat Miller has done for the community of Corona, the Corona Chamber of Commerce is honoring Pat as Citizen of the Year. Pat's tireless passion for community service has contributed immensely to the betterment of the community of Corona, California. She has been the heart and soul of many community organizations and events and I am proud to call her a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for her service and salute her as she receives this prestigious award.                          ____________________
