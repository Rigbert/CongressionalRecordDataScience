 President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee-reported substitute be withdrawn; that the Nelson substitute amendment be agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be read three times and passed; that the amendment to the title be agreed to; and that the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.
