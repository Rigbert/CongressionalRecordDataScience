Madam Speaker, I rise today to commend the Buckhead Coalition of Atlanta, Georgia, for its innovative program to ensure that Atlanta residents are able to access prescription medications in the event of a disaster or power outage. Buckhead Coalition is a nonprofit organization of chief executive officers, business owners and community leaders representing part of the Fifth Congressional District of Georgia. Led by its president and my good friend, former Atlanta Mayor Sam Massell, the Buckhead Coalition is advancing a plan to equip pharmacies and drug stores with backup power generators to ensure that people are able to have access to their medications in the event of a disaster, either natural or manmade.  One of the lessons learned from Hurricane Katrina's devastation of New Orleans and the Gulf Coast was the necessity for emergency generators in pharmacies. In today's business environment, pharmacies cannot operate without working computers, refrigerators and other electrical equipment. In the Buckhead area, of the twenty-two pharmacies, now only four do not have emergency generators. According to the American Pharmaceutical Association, thepharmacies of Buckhead provide prescription medications to more than 32,000 of the neighborhood's 70,000 residents. An estimated 6,500 of these medications are dispensed on a daily basis, with many of them being time-sensitive medications for senior citizens.  In order to prevent a potential disaster, the Buckhead Coalition, in conjunction with Home Depot and Georgia Power, has created a subsidy to cover up to seventy-five percent of the cost for purchasing a generator. This subsidy significantly reduces the barriers of cost, making it much easier and more affordable for these pharmacies to be equipped with these possibly life-saving generators.  I commend the Buckhead Coalition, Home Depot and Georgia Power for coming together to provide this opportunity, this safety net, for my community. I encourage other communities to emulate this plan.                          ____________________
