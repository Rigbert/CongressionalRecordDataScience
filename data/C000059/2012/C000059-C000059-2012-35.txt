Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to a good friend of mine, Frank Hall. Frank passed away June 15, 2012 in Norco, CA. A resident of Norco, CA, for 35 years, he was a pillar of the community and he will be deeply missed.  Frank was born March 2, 1938 in Los Angeles. He grew up in Newport Beach, graduating from Newport Harbor High School and Orange Coast College, with additional studies at Pacific State University and Riverside Community College. As a youth, he worked for his uncle renting boats. Frank served the County of Orange from 1959 to 1995 in the General Services and Environmental Management agencies in the field of Right-of-Way Engineering, Property Management and Facilities Planning, and served honorably in the United States Naval Air Reserve as flight crew on anti-submarine aircraft from 1961 to 1969.  After retiring from the County of Orange, he became involved with Norco city government, serving as a City Councilman for 12 years and Mayor for 8 years. Frank was a visionary in Norco; he maintained the community's rural spirit while encouraging commercial and business development in the Inland region. As a Councilman, he held several appointed positions, including Riverside Transit Agency, RTA, where he was Chairman in 2007; Riverside County Transportation Commission, RCTC, Commissioner; Western Riverside Council of Governments where he was Chairman in 2001-2; Member of the Military Affairs Committee for the Norco-Corona Area, which was successful in retaining the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Norco; and Member of the City of Norco Economic Development Advisory Council, among many others. At the time of his death, he had been appointed by Supervisor John Tavaglione as an additional alternate to Riverside Transit Agency and the RTA Transportation-NOW coalition.  It is hard to imagine that Frank would have any free time on his hands yet he always found time for his community. He was a member of many local and regional organizations, including the Citizens Advisory Group at the Norco College, the Death Valley 49er's Association, the Pacific Crest Trail Association, the Norco High School Agricultural Advisory Committee, and the California State Parks Foundation. He was active in the Corona-Norco YMCA and was President at the time of his death. Local clubs he belonged to were Norco Lions Club, Residents of Norco Urging Protection of Rural and Animal Keeping Lifestyle, RURAL, American Legion Post 328, Norco Historical Society, Norco Regional Conservancy, Saddle Sore Riders, Riverside Recreational Trails, and Norco Senior Citizens and Pet Relief Fund. A longtime horse lover, Frank belonged to a number of equestrian sports organizations. He was a life member of Equestrian Trails, Inc., the California Horseman's Association, and the Norco Horseman's Association, which he founded and served in for 18 years as President in 1991 and Treasurer from 1992 to 2012.  Frank is survived by his wife of 37 years Sharon; son Steve (Brenda) Hall, son William (Kate) Hall, and son Robert (Robin) Hall; six granddaughters, Kristin Hicks, Ashley Hall, Heather Hall, Holly Hall, Vanessa Hall and Lauren Hall, as well as two great-granddaughters Joie Lynn and Abbylynn. Frank is also survived by brother Howard (Kathleen) Hall.  On Friday, June 22, 2012, a memorial service celebrating Frank's extraordinary life will be held. Frank will always be remembered for his incredible work ethic, generosity, contributions to the community and love of family. His dedication to his family, work, and community are a testament to a life lived well and a legacy that will continue. I extend my condolences to Frank's family and friends; although Frank may be gone, the light and goodness he brought to the world remain and will never be forgotten.                          ____________________
