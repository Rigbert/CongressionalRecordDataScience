SCALISE. I will ultimately yield, but you mentioned all of these things, and so I want to clear up the things that the gentleman mentioned.  So the Trey Gowdy committee, where four Americans died and we were trying to get to the bottom of that--not to impeach anybody, but to find out how four Americans died when people should have known that there was danger over there and the proper precautions weren't taken. So he had a committee.  Do you know, I would ask the gentleman from Maryland, that Chairman Gowdy allowed the minority to call witnesses? He didn't sit there and say: Hey, I won and you lost, and so I can just roll over you and then back up the car again. That is not what Trey Gowdy did. He was the chairman, but he let the ranking member, the minority leader of the committee, call their witnesses.  That is not happening right now. Not one witness has been allowed by our side. Closed hearings to the public.  If this is something that you are so concerned about, if you are concerned about corruption, why root it out in secret, behind closed doors, with a one-sided set of rules that represents and reflects more how the Soviet Union would conduct something like this as opposed to how the United States of America has always conducted impeachment inquiries? We are talking about impeachment inquiries in secret, behind closed doors.  So, yes, the gentleman raised a lot of issues, and I wanted to go back to each of those.  So what we have asked for is the same fairness that has always been allowed, both sides--not just the winning side, both sides. This is America.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.
