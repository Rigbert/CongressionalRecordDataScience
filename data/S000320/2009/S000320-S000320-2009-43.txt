 President, I believe this is not a good proposal. This changes the law, as we understand it. It has been working a long time. It will cause all kinds of problems. Once a property is foreclosed, what do you do with it next? It delays it.  I ask my colleagues to oppose the Kerry amendment.  I ask for the yeas and nays.
