President, I introduce legislation that is designed to help the domestic oil and gas industry not only in my own State of Oklahoma, but also the multitude of energy producing States throughout the United States. We are all very much aware that a healthy and competitive oil and gas industry is critically important to the U.S. economy. The petroleum industry alone is burdened with the highest tax rates in corporate America. Changes fostered by this bill only level the playing field with businesses throughout the United States that are trying to attract capital.  Through tax incentives for new and existing marginal wells, small producers in Oklahoma, as well as throughout the United States, will be the primary benefactors of my legislation. Independents find more than half of all new oil and natural gas reserves, and they drill almost 85 percent of all domestic wells--both exploratory and development--onshore and offshore.  The U.S. oil and gas industry is one of the Nation's major economic assets and has long been recognized as a world leader in size, scope, and technology. As such a vital national industry, we cannot afford to continue down the road we have become accustomed to for so long. We need to focus our energies inward and try to help the industry restimulate its growth. As a nation we must face up to the threat posed by mounting U.S. dependency on foreign energy imports from such regions as the Middle East.                                 ______      By
