 Isakson, and Mr. Begich) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions:                              S. Res. 593       Whereas Jumpstart, a national early education organization,      is working to ensure that all children in the United States      enter school prepared to succeed;       Whereas Jumpstart recruits and trains college students and      community volunteers year-round to work with preschool      children in low-income communities, helping the children to      develop the key language and literacy skills they need to      succeed in school and in life;       Whereas, since 1993, Jumpstart has engaged more than 20,000      adults in service to more than 70,000 young children in      communities across the United States;       Whereas Jumpstart's Read for the Record, presented in      partnership with Pearson, is a world record-breaking      campaign, now in its fifth year, that harnesses the power of      reading by bringing adults and children together to read the      same book on the same day;       Whereas the goals of the campaign are to raise national      awareness of the early literacy crisis, provide books to      children in low-income households through donations and      sponsorship, celebrate the commencement of Jumpstart's      program year, and raise money to support Jumpstart's year-     long work with preschool children;       Whereas October 7, 2010, would be an appropriate date to      designate as ``Jumpstart's Read for the Record Day'' because      Jumpstart aims to set the world record for the largest shared      reading experience on that date; and       Whereas Jumpstart hopes to engage 2,500,000 children to      read Ezra Jack Keats' ``The Snowy Day'' during this record-     breaking celebration of reading, service, and fun, all in      support of the preschool children of the United States: Now,      therefore, be it       Resolved, That the Senate--       (1) supports the designation of October 7, 2010, as      ``Jumpstart's Read for the Record Day'';       (2) recognizes the fifth year of Jumpstart's Read for the      Record; and       (3) encourages adults, including grandparents, parents,      teachers, and college students, to join children in creating      the largest shared reading experience in the world and to      show their support for early literacy and Jumpstart's early      education programming for young children in low-income      communities.
