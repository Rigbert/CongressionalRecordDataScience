President, I thank the distinguished Senator from California. I am very strongly supportive of the points she has made.  I see the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee, the senior Senator from Kentucky. I think he and I totally agree that if Members have amendments, they should get them to the floor and then we can begin voting on them. Traditionally, we break at 12:30 for the Republican and Democratic caucuses. I would like to get a vote before then. I do not know what the situation is on the Feinstein amendment. I ask my friend from Kentucky whether that is something on which we might vote. There has not been a chance for someone on the other side to speak as of yet.  I think what we need to do, if we can, and before I yield the floor, is make this plea on our side of the aisle--and I suspect the same one will be made on the other side--that if Members have amendments, bring them and see either Senator McConnell or myself. If they are going to require a rollcall, we can enter into some time agreements.  Senator McConnell and I have some housekeeping amendments which we can dispose of by voice vote, but let's get these others with a time agreement.  I yield the floor.
