President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 916       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Mothers and Offspring      Mortality and Morbidity Awareness Act'' or the ``MOMMA's      Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds the following:       (1) Every year, across the United States, 4,000,000 women      give birth, about 700 women suffer fatal complications during      pregnancy, while giving birth or during the postpartum      period, and 70,000 women suffer near-fatal, partum-related      complications.       (2) The maternal mortality rate is often used as a proxy to      measure the overall health of a population. While the infant      mortality rate in the United States has reached its lowest      point, the risk of death for women in the United States      during pregnancy, childbirth, or the postpartum period is      higher than such risk in many other developed nations. The      estimated maternal mortality rate (per 100,000 live births)      for the 48 contiguous States and Washington, DC increased      from 18.8 percent in 2000 to 23.8 percent in 2014 to 26.6      percent in 2018. This estimated rate is on par with such rate      for underdeveloped nations such as Iraq and Afghanistan.       (3) International studies estimate the 2015 maternal      mortality rate in the United States as 26.4 per 100,000 live      births, which is almost twice the 2015 World Health      Organization estimation of 14 per 100,000 live births.       (4) It is estimated that more than 60 percent of maternal      deaths in the United States are preventable.       (5) According to the Centers for Disease Control and      Prevention, the maternal mortality rate varies drastically      for women by race and ethnicity. There are 12.7 deaths per      100,000 live births for White women, 43.5 deaths per 100,000      live births for African-American women, and 14.4 deaths per      100,000 live births for women of other ethnicities. While      maternal mortality disparately impacts African-American      women, this urgent public health crisis traverses race,      ethnicity, socioeconomic status, educational background, and      geography.       (6) African-American women are 3 to 4 times more likely to      die from causes related to pregnancy and childbirth compared      to non-Hispanic White women.       (7) The findings described in paragraphs (1) through (6)      are of major concern to researchers, academics, members of      the business community, and providers across the obstetrical      continuum represented by organizations such as March of      Dimes; the Preeclampsia Foundation; the American College of      Obstetricians and Gynecologists; the Society for Maternal-     Fetal Medicine; the Association of Women's Health, Obstetric,      and Neonatal Nurses; the California Maternal Quality Care      Collaborative; Black Women's Health Imperative; the National      Birth Equity Collaborative; Black Mamas Matter Alliance;      EverThrive Illinois; the National Association of Certified      Professional Midwives; PCOS Challenge: The National      Polycystic Ovary Sundrome Association; and the American      College of Nurse Midwives.       (8) Hemorrhage, cardiovascular and coronary conditions,      cardiomyopathy, infection, embolism, mental health      conditions, preeclampsia and eclampsia, polycystic ovary      syndrome, infection and sepsis, and anesthesia complications      are the predominant medical causes of maternal-related deaths      and complications. Most of these conditions are largely      preventable or manageable.       (9) Oral health is an important part of perinatal health.      Reducing bacteria in a woman's mouth during pregnancy can      significantly reduce her risk of developing oral diseases and      spreading decay-causing bacteria to her baby. Moreover, some      evidence suggests that women with periodontal disease during      pregnancy could be at greater risk for poor birth outcomes,      such as pre-eclampsia, pre-term birth, and low birth weight.      Furthermore, a woman's oral health during pregnancy is a good      predictor of her newborn's oral health, and since mothers can      unintentionally spread oral bacteria to their babies, putting      their children at higher risk for tooth decay, prevention      efforts should happen even before children are born, as a      matter of pre-pregnancy health and prenatal care during      pregnancy.       (10) The United States has not been able to submit a formal      maternal mortality rate to international data repositories      since 2007. Thus, no official maternal mortality rate exists      for the United States. There can be no maternal mortality      rate without streamlining maternal mortality-related data      from the State level and extrapolating such data to the      Federal level.       (11) In the United States, death reporting and analysis is      a State function rather than a Federal process. States report      all deaths--including maternal deaths--on a semi-voluntary      basis, without standardization across States. While the      Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has the capacity      and system for collecting death-related data based on death      certificates, these data are not sufficiently reported by      States in an organized and standard format across States such      that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is able      to identify causes of maternal death and best practices for      the prevention of such death.       (12) Vital statistics systems often underestimate maternal      mortality and are insufficient data sources from which to      derive a full scope of medical and social determinant factors      contributing to maternal deaths. While the addition of      pregnancy checkboxes on death certificates since 2003 have      likely improved States' abilities to identify pregnancy-     related deaths, they are not generally completed by      obstetrical providers or persons trained to recognize      pregnancy-related mortality. Thus, these vital forms may be      missing information or may capture inconsistent data. Due to      varying maternal mortality-related analyses, lack of      reliability, and granularity in data, current maternal      mortality informatics do not fully encapsulate the myriad      medical and socially determinant factors that contribute to      such high maternal mortality rates within the United States      compared to other developed nations. Lack of standardization      of data and data sharing across States and between Federal      entities, health networks, and research institutions keep the      Nation in the dark about ways to prevent maternal deaths.       (13) Having reliable and valid State data aggregated at the      Federal level are critical to the Nation's ability to quell      surges in maternal death and imperative for researchers to      identify long-lasting interventions.       (14) Leaders in maternal wellness highly recommend that      maternal deaths be investigated at the State level first, and      that standardized, streamlined, de-identified data regarding      maternal deaths be sent annually to the Centers for Disease      Control and Prevention. Such data standardization and      collection would be similar in operation and effect to the      National Program of Cancer Registries of the Centers for      Disease Control and Prevention and akin to the Confidential      Enquiry in Maternal Deaths Programme in the United Kingdom.      Such a maternal mortalities and morbidities registry and      surveillance system would help providers, academicians,      lawmakers, and the public to address questions concerning the      types of, causes of, and best practices to thwart, pregnancy-     related or pregnancy-associated mortality and morbidity.       (15) The United Nations' Millennium Development Goal 5a      aimed to reduce by 75 percent, between 1990 and 2015, the      maternal mortality rate, yet this metric has not been      achieved. In fact, the maternal mortality rate in the United      States has been estimated to have more than doubled between      2000 and 2014. Yet, because national data are not fully      available, the United States does not have an official      maternal mortality rate.       (16) Many States have struggled to establish or maintain      Maternal Mortality Review Committees (referred to in this      section as ``MMRC''). On the State level, MMRCs have lagged      because States have not had the resources to mount local      reviews. State-level reviews are necessary as only the State      departments of health have the authority to request medical      records, autopsy reports,     and police reports critical to the function of the MMRC.       (17) The United Kingdom regards maternal deaths as a health      systems failure and a national committee of obstetrics      experts review each maternal death or near-fatal childbirth      complication. Such committee also establishes the predominant      course of maternal-related deaths from conditions such as      preeclampsia. Consequently, the United Kingdom has been able      to reduce its incidence of preeclampsia to less than one in      10,000 women--its lowest rate since 1952.       (18) The United States has no comparable, coordinated      Federal process by which to review cases of maternal      mortality, systems failures, or best practices. Many States      have active MMRCs and leverage their work to impact maternal      wellness. For example, the State of California has worked      extensively with their State health departments, health and      hospital systems, and research collaborative organizations,      including the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative      and the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health, to      establish MMRCs, wherein such State has determined the most      prevalent causes of maternal mortality and recorded and      shared data with providers and researchers, who have      developed and implemented safety bundles and care protocols      related to preeclampsia, maternal hemorrhage, and the like.      In this way, the State of California has been able to      leverage its maternal mortality review board system, generate      data, and apply those data to effect changes in maternal      care-related protocol. To date, the State of California has      reduced its maternal mortality rate, which is now comparable      to the low rates of the United Kingdom.       (19) Hospitals and health systems across the United States      lack standardization of emergency obstetrical protocols      before, during, and after delivery. Consequently, many      providers are delayed in recognizing critical signs      indicating maternal distress that quickly escalate into fatal      or near-fatal incidences. Moreover, any attempt to address an      obstetrical emergency that does not consider both clinical      and public health approaches falls woefully under the mark of      excellent care delivery. State-based maternal quality      collaborative organizations, such as the California Maternal      Quality Care Collaborative or entities participating in the      Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health (AIM), have formed      obstetrical protocols, tool kits, and other resources to      improve system care and response as they relate to maternal      complications and warning signs for such conditions as      maternal hemorrhage, hypertension, and preeclampsia.       (20) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports      that nearly half of all maternal deaths occur in the      immediate postpartum period--the 42 days following a      pregnancy--whereas more than one-third of pregnancy-related      or pregnancy-associated deaths occur while a person is still      pregnant. Yet, for women eligible for the Medicaid program on      the basis of pregnancy, such Medicaid coverage lapses at the      end of the month on which the 60th postpartum day lands.       (21) The experience of serious traumatic events, such as      being exposed to domestic violence, substance use disorder,      or pervasive racism, can over-activate the body's stress-     response system. Known as toxic stress, the repetition of      high-doses of cortisol to the brain, can harm healthy      neurological development, which can have cascading physical      and mental health consequences, as documented in the Adverse      Childhood Experiences study of the Centers for Disease      Control and Prevention.       (22) A growing body of evidence-based research has shown      the correlation between the stress associated with one's      race--the stress of racism--and one's birthing outcomes. The      stress of sex and race discrimination and institutional      racism has been demonstrated to contribute to a higher risk      of maternal mortality, irrespective of one's gestational age,      maternal age, socioeconomic status, or individual-level      health risk factors, including poverty, limited access to      prenatal care, and poor physical and mental health (although      these are not nominal factors). African-American women remain      the most at risk for pregnancy-associated or pregnancy-     related causes of death. When it comes to preeclampsia, for      example, which is related to obesity, African-American women      of normal weight remain the most at risk of dying during the      perinatal period compared to non-African-American obese      women.       (23) The rising maternal mortality rate in the United      States is driven predominantly by the disproportionately high      rates of African-American maternal mortality.       (24) African-American women are 3 to 4 times more likely to      die from pregnancy or maternal-related distress than are      White women, yielding one of the greatest and most      disconcerting racial disparities in public health.       (25) Compared to women from other racial and ethnic      demographics, African-American women across the socioeconomic      spectrum experience prolonged, unrelenting stress related to      racial and gender discrimination, contributing to higher      rates of maternal mortality, giving birth to low-weight      babies, and experiencing pre-term birth. Racism is a risk-     factor for these aforementioned experiences. This cumulative      stress often extends across the life course and is situated      in everyday spaces where African-American women establish      livelihood. Structural barriers, lack of access to care, and      genetic predispositions to health vulnerabilities exacerbate      African-American women's likelihood to experience poor or      fatal birthing outcomes, but do not fully account for the      great disparity.       (26) African-American women are twice as likely to      experience postpartum depression, and disproportionately      higher rates of preeclampsia compared to White women.       (27) Racism is deeply ingrained in United States systems,      including in health care delivery systems between patients      and providers, often resulting in disparate treatment for      pain, irreverence for cultural norms with respect to health,      and dismissiveness. Research has demonstrated that patients      respond more warmly and adhere to medical treatment plans at      a higher degree with providers of the same race or ethnicity      or with providers with great ability to exercise empathy.      However, the provider pool is not primed with many people of      color, nor are providers (whether student-doctors in training      or licensed practitioners) consistently required to undergo      implicit bias, cultural competency, or empathy training on a      consistent, on-going basis.
