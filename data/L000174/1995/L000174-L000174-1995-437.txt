President, I support the nomination of Dr. Henry Foster to be the Surgeon General of the United States.  Over the past 4 months, Dr. Foster's entire career has been under great scrutiny. Opponents of his pro-choice stance have looked for every shred of information that could cast a shadow on the character and integrity of Dr. Foster. I believe that his opponents have failed in this effort.  I followed the nomination hearing with great interest. During the hearing, Dr. Foster conveyed a sincere vision of what he would do as Surgeon General. His top priority would be to continue his work on reducing teenage pregnancy. This is an important vision.  I am astounded by the personal attacks that have been made against Dr. Foster on the floor of the Senate today. I believe we should be focusing on the thousands of babies that Dr. Foster has delivered and the thousands of teenagers he has counseled. Instead, the focus has been on a medical procedure that is legal in all 50 States.  I believe Dr. Foster is a man of integrity who will excel as Surgeon General.  When President Bush nominated Clarence Thomas to the U.S. Supreme Court, I was the first member of the Senate to declare my opposition to his nomination. I did not believe that Clarence Thomas was qualified to serve on the Court. Even with strong reservations, I felt that Judge Thomas deserved an up-or-down vote.  I hope the opponents of Dr. Foster will let his nomination come to a vote. He deserves no less.
