President, I commend the Senator from Texas for her extraordinary leadership on this issue. She has been an advocate for girls and women in so many different ways, and she truly is committed to ensuring that young girls growing up get the very best education they deserve, and that they have every opportunity available to them. The amendment that she has proposed, which I am proud to cosponsor, is in keeping with that commitment.  I commend her for her leadership on this very important issue.  I first became very interested in the issue of having same-gender classrooms because of an experience of a high school all-girls math class in northern Maine. This math class, which is an advanced math class taught at Presque Isle High School, has been proven to be of enormous benefit to the young women who are enrolled in it. They do very advanced math. It has been shown that their SAT scores soared.  Moreover, it gives them the confidence that they can handle advanced math and science and other subjects that unfortunately women sometimes have felt uneasy about, even though obviously girls and women have every ability in the world to handle such subjects. This class has been an enormous success for the girls at Presque Isle High School.  Unfortunately, a few years ago, the Department of Education objected to this class despite the fact that it was showing such enormous results for the young women who were enrolled in it. They were taught by a very gifted teacher, Donna Lisnik, who has subsequently gone on to be the principal of a school in Aroostook County. But she was the one who originated this course.  The Department of Education objected because it was a same-sex class. They have been able to get around that. But that shouldn't require a waiver or a circumvention of the law.  The amendment of the Senator from Texas would cure this situation.  Thank you, Mr. President.
