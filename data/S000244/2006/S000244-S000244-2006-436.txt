Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Speaker, let me say that this vote will draw to a close congressional consideration of legislation that has brought together Republicans and Democrats, concerned parents, and those who are related to victims from around the country. And this has become somewhat of a crusade in order to make necessary changes to prevent more sexual predators from falling through the cracks and molesting and harming and even murdering innocent victims.                              {time}  1215  The Child Safety Act of 2006, I believe, is appropriately named after Adam Walsh. One of the things I did early in my service in Congress was to work with the Walshes to pass the first bill which put the names of missing children in the FBI's National Crime Identification File. There were problems in alerting law enforcement back in the early 1980's when a child had been abducted, and, as a result, those who did abduct the children were able to take them far away before law enforcement was able to weave the net around these people, and many tragedies occurred, including the brutal murder of the Walsh's beloved son, Adam.  I really want to commend John Walsh and his wife, because they have used the tragedy of their son's death and the grief that it caused to be able to make America a safer place for children, not only those that are here now, but those that are to be born in this country and who come to this country.  The Children's Safety Act of 2003 was a necessary start. This bill improves on the Children's Safety Act of 2003, plugs more loopholes, and America will be a safer place as a result of all of the people who have worked on behalf of this legislation. I would like to publicly thank all of them. There are too many to list by name, but in my full statement that I put into the record, I listed the names of a lot of very well-publicized victims. Let's hope that this bill makes sure that there are no more names added to that list.  Vote in favor of the bill, send it to the President.  Mr. Speaker, I include for the Record an exchange of letters between Mr. Thomas, Chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means, and myself.                                      Committee on Ways and Means,                                     House of Representatives,     Washington, DC, July 24, 2006.     Hon. F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr.,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Sensenbrenner: I am writing concerning H.R.      4472, the ``Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of      2006,'' which is scheduled for floor action on Tuesday, July      25, 2006.       As you know, the Committee on Ways and Means has      jurisdiction over matters concerning certain child welfare      programs, particularly as they pertain to foster care and      adoption. Section 152 of the bill would require States to      conduct safety checks of would-be foster and adoptive homes      as well as eliminate the ability of States to opt-out of      Federal background check requirements restricting Federal      support for children placed with foster or adoptive parents      with serious criminal histories. Section 152 also would      require States to check child abuse registries for potential      foster and adoptive parents. Thus these provisions fall      within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Ways and Means.      However, in order to expedite this bill for floor      consideration, the Committee will forgo action. This is being      done with the understanding that it does not in any way      prejudice the Committee with respect to the appointment of      conferees or its jurisdictional prerogatives on this bill or      similar legislation.       I would appreciate your response to this letter, confirming      this understanding with respect to H.R. 4472, and would ask      that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be      included in the Congressional Record during floor      consideration.           Best regards,                                                      Bill Thomas,     Chairman.                                  ____                                    Congress of the United States,                                     House of Representatives,                                    Washington, DC, July 25, 2006.     Hon. Bill Thomas,     Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, House of          Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Thomas: Thank you for your letter regarding      H.R. 4472, the ``Adam     Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006.'' I      acknowledge your jurisdictional interest in this legislation      and agree that your decision to waive consideration of this      bill shall not be construed to prejudice the jurisdiction of      the Committee on Ways and Means over this or similar      legislation.       I will include a copy of your letter and this response in      the Congressional Record during consideration of H.R. 4472 on      the House floor.       Thank you for you assistance in this matter.           Sincerely,                                      F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr.,                                                         Chairman.
