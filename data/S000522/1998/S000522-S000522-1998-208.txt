Mr. Speaker, I agree fully with the MacBride Principles, which are patterned after the Sullivan Principles, which were instrumental in eliminating, or very important in the process of eliminating, discrimination in South Africa. They are contained, as we know, in the State Department Conference Report, which will be up tomorrow as part of the fund for Africa.  So I would hope Members would be put on notice that tomorrow, when we do vote on the State Department Conference Report authored by Mr. Helms, my good friend, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Gilman), and myself, that that contains the MacBride Principles, which advance the cause of religious freedom in the north of Ireland.  So I thank the gentleman for asking that question.
