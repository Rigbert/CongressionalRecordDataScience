To that extent, the bill will come before us, but only to that extent. In other words, the budget that was passed by the House, we will take the Senate bill from the floor, substitute the House language.  The reason we need a rule, frankly, is we asked unanimous consent to do that procedure, a unanimous consent which we had given to you in 2003 and 2005. For whatever reasons, it was not your personal determination, but it was the determination of your side not to give unanimous consent for that purpose. Therefore, in order to effect that objective, we need to pass a rule to allow us to do that which is what we will do Monday night.
