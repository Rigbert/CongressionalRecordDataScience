 What is interesting from the parliamentary side is, once you have made a motion to table, it is not debatable and it all comes to an end.  I will make a few comments in closing, and Senator Gramm will have his opportunity, and the Senate will vote on whether to table the Durbin amendment.  For those who have not heard the Durbin amendment, it says if you are going to go to bankruptcy court and claim protection to try to pursue a mortgage foreclosure, you have to walk into bankruptcy court with clean hands. You cannot be an unscrupulous, illegal lender taking advantage and exploiting poor people, elderly, and widows, and walk into bankruptcy court and say I want the protection of the law.
