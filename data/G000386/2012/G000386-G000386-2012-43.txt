 President, I thank the chairman of the committee, Senator Leahy, for his courtesies.  I rise in support of the nomination of Stephanie Marie Rose to be U.S. district judge for the Southern District of Iowa. In addition, she has the support of Senator Harkin and is well regarded throughout my home State of Iowa. She was reported out of our committee on voice vote. She was previously confirmed by this Senate for her current position, U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Iowa.  Ms. Rose is a Hawkeye through and through, receiving two degrees from the University of Iowa--her B.A. in 1994 and her J.D. in 1996. Obviously, Ms. Rose was on the fast track through law school.  After graduation from law school, she wisely chose to remain in Iowa--and Iowa is fortunate for that decision. She first served as a law clerk in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Iowa. In 1997, she was hired as a full-time attorney in that same office, where she has risen through the ranks and now heads that office.  She served as a special assistant U.S. attorney from 1997 to 1999 and as an assistant U.S. attorney from 1999 to 2009. During this time, she was lead counsel in the prosecution of more than 250 cases. These cases spanned a wide range of legal issues from violent crimes and drug offense to immigration violations and money laundering. Additionally, she has handled approximately 45 Federal civil cases. These cases have included postconviction relief and asset forfeiture matters, as well as Freedom of Information Act and property return lawsuits.  In 2009, Ms. Rose was nominated by the President and then confirmed by the Senate to serve as the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Iowa. In this role, she oversees most every aspect of the office. This includes overseeing the civil and criminal work completed by office staff and making final determinations regarding charging decisions, plea offers, and civil settlements.  The American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously rated Ms. Rose as ``well qualified'' for this position of district judge.  In addition, she is supported by the legal community and judges throughout our State. Newspaper articles published in the Cedar Rapids Gazette on February 2 and February 20, 2012, captured some of that support.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record these two articles.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                    [From the Gazette, Feb. 2, 2012]                     Rose Picked for Federal Bench                          (by Trish Mehaffey)       Cedar Rapids.--President Barack Obama nominated U.S.      Attorney Stephanie Rose late Thursday as the next federal      judge in the Southern District of Iowa.       Rose, of Center Point, said she received the call from Sen.      Tom Harkin in late afternoon and then got the news release      from the White House.       ``This has been a really involved process and I'm honored      to be selected, especially with the other talented women that      were also nominated,'' she said last night. ``If the Senate      confirms me, I will be happy to serve and look forward to the      diversity of the Southern District and the new      opportunities.''       Obama said Rose and Michael Shea, whom he nominated      Thursday as a federal judge in Connecticut, have      ``demonstrated the talent, expertise, and fair-mindedness      Americans expect and deserve from their judicial system. I am      grateful for their willingness to serve and confident that      they will apply the law with the utmost impartiality and      integrity.''       In a news release, Harkin, D-Iowa, said Rose is a ``superb      attorney and among jurists, prosecutors and the defense bar      has a reputation as an extremely fair and ethical prosecutor      who possesses great legal ability, intellect, and judgment.''       ``There is no question in my mind that Stephanie Rose would      be an outstanding federal judge,'' he continued. ``. . . I      urge my Senate colleagues to confirm her for this important      position as quickly as possible.''       Rose served 12 years as an assistant U.S. attorney before      being appointed the top prosecutor in 2009. She will be the      first woman to serve as a federal judge in the Southern      District and only the second woman to serve on the federal      bench in Iowa's history.       Former Assistant U.S. Attorney Bob Teig, who retired last      year after 31 years, said Thursday that Rose will make an      ``excellent'' federal judge.       ``She has experience in the courtroom and as an      administrator,'' Teig said. ``She has a broad view of the      federal legal system and she's very intelligent. Stephanie      will make a great additional to the federal bench.''       Teig worked with Rose throughout her career with the U.S.      Attorney's Office.                                  ____                   [From the Gazette, Feb. 20, 2012]          Colleagues Call Rose a Good Choice for Federal Bench                          (By Trish Mehaffey)       The career path of a U.S. attorney and nominee for federal      judge could have taken a much different course if she had      followed her early passions for music and journalism.       When Stephanie Rose told her parents she was going into      law, they were surprised at first. She was the girl who sang      and danced, played the piano and oboe, majored in sociology      and loved to write.       Stephanie Rose of Center Point, the federal prosecutor for      the Northern District of Iowa, has been nominated by      President Barack Obama as the next federal judge in the      Southern District. (Brian Ray/The Gazette)       But Rose said she started looking at a law career because      of her childhood experience growing up with foster siblings.      Rose's mother and father were foster parents, and one of the      children in their custody had to go through a painful      parental termination because her biological mother, who was      in and out of jail, fought the proceeding.       Through the appeal process, the Iowa Supreme Court      terminated the mother's rights, changing children's rights in      Iowa and allowing the girl to be adopted into a permanent      home.       That showed Rose how the law can change people's lives.                           Acclaimed in field       ``Fairness,'' above all else, is the one word judges,      prosecutors and even defense attorneys, who have been      adversaries of Rose over the years, kept mentioning last week      to describe her. They said she is a good choice for the      federal bench because she's extremely intelligent,      hardworking, compassionate, humble, open-minded and      forthright.       President Barack Obama nominated Rose two weeks ago to      become the next federal judge in the Southern District of      Iowa when U.S. District Chief Judge Robert Pratt retires July      1.       Rose, 39, of Center Point, has worked in the U.S.      Attorney's Office since graduating from law school, one of      the youngest hired at the time. She worked her way up to the      top spot in 2009, prosecuting more than 800 felony cases. She      was lead prosecutor on 260 of those cases and has handled      another 45 civil cases and 34 appeals.       Assistant Johnson County Attorney Andy Chappell, who has      been friends with Rose since law school, said it's difficult      to ``imagine anybody more deserving.'' Rose is bright,      straightforward and incapable of pretense, he said.       Assistant U.S. Attorney C.J. Williams said Rose's ability      to quickly comprehend complex issues has helped her succeed.      She received recognition and awards for prosecuting two      complicated cases involving Internet pharmaceutical      companies, where doctors were prescribing pills online to      patients they never treated, he said.       The six-year case spanned many states and required the      review of hundreds of documents. Some may have not pursued      it, Williams said, but the challenge never deterred Rose.       Her determination paid off. The case ended with 26      convictions in this district, more than $7 million in      forfeitures and more than $4 million that went to agencies in      Dubuque, Cedar Rapids and Des Moines.       ``She is very skilled,'' said U.S. District Judge Mark      Bennett, who presided over Rose's first jury trial. ``She      learns from any mistakes and doesn't repeat them. She doesn't      have a personal agenda. She goes by the law.''       U.S. District Judge John Jarvey of the Southern District      said her prosecution record is impressive for her age because      not all federal judges have that kind of experience,      especially in criminal law.       ``Stephanie has won the respect of prosecutors and defense      lawyers,'' Jarvey said.                          Respect from defense       Steve Swift is one of the defense attorneys who say she has      earned a good reputation among the defense bar. He joined a      dozen other defense attorneys who supported Rose for her U.S.      attorney nomination. They said she was fair and went by the      law in handling the controversial prosecution of more than      380 illegal immigrants charged in the 2008 Agriprocessors      raid.       ``She's not politically connected, not active in a party .      . . this is based on merit,'' he said. ``She's a great      advocate for the government, very forthright--no      shenanigans.''       Leon Spies, a defense attorney, said Rose has always been      interested in seeing that ``justice is accomplished.'' It's      more important for her to ``get it right than to win,'' he      said.       Spies, also the president of the Academy of Trial Lawyers,      nominated Rose to the academy in 2008 because she exhibited      what the organization strives for--the ``highest quality of      trial advocacy and ethical responsibilities to clients and      the law.''       ``It's a quite an honor to be nominated,'' said David      Brown, a Des Moines attorney and secretary/treasurer of the      academy. ``There are over 8,000 lawyers in Iowa and there are      only 250 members. There are less prosecutors and less women,      but not by design.''       Rose is one of 15 women in the academy.       Sen. Tom Harkin said all those qualities are why he      recommended Rose for the U.S. attorney job and for the      federal bench.       ``I was enthralled by her at the interview,'' Harkin said.      ``She has such a presence and such eloquence without the      window dressing,'' he said laughing. ``She's genuine and      sincere.''       Harkin said he doesn't foresee any problems with her being      confirmed. More than 80 percent of President Barack Obama's      nominees have been confirmed so far.                              What's next       Carl Tobias of the University of Richmond School of Law in      Richmond, Va., who analyzes the judiciary, said it's in      Rose's favor that she has been through a previous      confirmation because it could go more quickly.       ``It's kind of murky right now with the presidential      election,'' he said. ``The confirmation process could slow      down and even stop until after the convention. It's good that      she has home state support from Sen. Chuck Grassley, who's on      the Senate Judiciary Committee, but there are 21 others      (federal judge nominees) ahead of her.''       However, Tobias didn't rule out the chance that Rose could      be confirmed in time to take the bench in July.
