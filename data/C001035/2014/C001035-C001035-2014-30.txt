President, I wish to speak in support of the Apprenticeship and Jobs Training Act, legislationthat I have introduced with my colleague Senator Cantwell. Few issues are as important to the American people as the availability of good jobs in our communities. Unemployment in Maine and across the country remains unacceptably high. We must continue working together to identify ways to improve job training initiatives to help people find jobs in fields where jobs exist.  I have met with many business owners in Maine who have jobs available but cannot find qualified and trained workers to fill these vacant positions. One way for employees to acquire the skills needed to thrive in in-demand fields is through apprenticeship programs. Apprentices get hands-on experience that is invaluable to employers and can help workers secure a good-paying job.  According to the Congressional Research Service, approximately 44,000 individuals graduated from apprenticeship programs in 2013 nearly 1,000 of those individuals were from Maine. However, that number is likely insufficient to meet tomorrow's needs. One manufacturer in Maine estimates that nearly 2.7 million manufacturing employees are expected to retire in the next decade. We must do all we can to ensure that an adequate pool of skilled workers is available to fill these good-paying jobs.  Our bill helps achieve this goal by giving tax credits to businesses that hire apprentices. To ensure that workers are given adequate time to prove their value, the apprentice must be employed for 7 months in order for a business to claim the credit. Our bill also provides incentives for experienced workers who spend at least 20 percent of their time passing their hard-earned knowledge on to the next generation. These workers would be allowed to receive some retirement income early, without facing tax penalties. Finally, our bill ensures that the brave men and women who defend our country are given credit for the skills they learn while serving. Training received while serving in the Armed Forces would count toward an apprentice's training requirement.  This bill would help better align the needs of our Nation's employers with potential employees to promote hiring and the creation of new jobs. I encourage all my colleagues to support this bill, and I am pleased to join Senator Cantwell in introducing it.                          ____________________
