We can improve this joint resolution by adopting a motion to recommit to have the continuing resolution go through the end of this fiscal year, meaning September 30th, and that will present the other body with a choice; to keep the government open by passing this continuing resolution through the end of the fiscal year, or continuing going on a bloated, earmark-laden track.  I would hope that we would get the fiscal year 2009 appropriations over with so that the Appropriations Committee can do the work on the fiscal year 2010 budget. The way to save the taxpayers a lot of money, the way to stop all of the earmarks that have been crammed into the omnibus bill that this House passed last week is to pass a continuing resolution that continues government agencies at their existing spending level through the end of this fiscal year. I would hope that we would have an opportunity to vote on that, and I would enthusiastically support it, as would most of the taxpayers of this country.
