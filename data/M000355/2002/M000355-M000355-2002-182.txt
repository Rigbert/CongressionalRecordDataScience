 He has been a stalwart, articulate supporter of the first amendment. I am grateful for his friendship and for his kind words about our work on this great cause. I assure him, as expressed, that it is not over yet. We have another day in court. I thank the Senator from Utah for his kind words.  I understand I have a minute remaining. Is that right?
