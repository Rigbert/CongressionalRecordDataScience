President, I rise today to bring to the attention of my colleagues and the public that March is National Eye Donor Month.  National recognition of Eye Donor Month dates back to the very early days of transplantation, when corneas were the only human transplants. Now, transplantations are common medical procedures by which people may give, so that others can live better, fuller, healthier lives.  National Eye Donor Month honors the thousands of Americans who, over the past 55 years, have each left behind a priceless legacy, their eyes. Since the first transplant agency was founded in New York City in 1944, sight has been restored to over half a million individuals by means of cornea transplantation.  Eye Donor Month is also about increasing public awareness of the continuing need for donors. Many people are still unaware of how easy it is to become an eye donor. All a donor needs to do is sign a card and announce to his or her family the intent to leave behind this special gift.  I am confident that if more Americans realized the true extent of the need for transplants, many more would willingly donate their corneas, once they can no longer use them. More than 46,000 Americans will need cornea transplants this year. Thousands of researchers will need donor eye tissue to explore prevention and treatment of blinding diseases.  Our Nation's eye banks, non-profit agencies operating under the umbrella of the Eye Bank Association of America, have done a heroic job of restoring sight to blind people. Today, cornea transplantation is the most common transplant procedure performed, with an extremely high success rate of nearly 90 percent.  This incredible success rate is due in part to a meticulous screening process that separates out corneas unsuitable for transplantation. These may be used for research purposes in surgical training and medical education. So, while each donated eye is put to good use, such a selective screening process must be supported by a large number of donations.  Right now, there are simply not enough donors. We must change that. I want to encourage my colleagues to celebrate National Eye Donor Month by working closely with our Nation's eye banks to educate the American public about how they can help others to see. Let us all aim to increase the number of eyes available for transplantation, so that we may illuminate the darkness for so many of our fellow citizens.                          ____________________
