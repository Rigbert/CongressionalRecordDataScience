 We don't hire labor. So whatever farm payments go with our crops, I receive 50 percent of those farm payments from the Federal farm program.  This amendment is about the family farmer. Farm programs are not just about the 2 percent of Americans who farm for a living. Farm programs are about several things, but, most importantly, they are about national security because Napoleon said ``an army marches on its belly,'' so obviously a secure food supply is very important for our national security.  Second but not often said, it is about the social stability of our Nation because any society is only nine meals away from a revolution, so a certain food supply has something to do with the stable society of any country.  The American people recognize the importance of the family farmer to our Nation and the need to provide an adequate safety net for family farmers. That is why we have had a farm program for 70 years. In recent years, however, these farm payments have come under increasing scrutiny, particularly from people who do not understand agriculture. And when you spend the taxpayers' money, there is nothing wrong with scrutiny. Critics of farm programs have argued that the largest corporate farms reap most of the benefits of these payments.
