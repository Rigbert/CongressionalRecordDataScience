 President, I am happy to be able to have some time to comment on the fact the Senate is not bringing up the stimulus package. It is to my chagrin, after all the hard work Senator Baucus and I have put into these negotiations. Albeit what we have in front of us is not a product of a conference committee, it is still a White House bipartisan compromise, a White House Centrist compromise, that would get a majority vote of the Senate if we had actually had an opportunity to vote on it.  In normal circumstances, I would not be one to say we ought to pass a House bill. These are, however, not normal times and this is not a normal process. Some will say this is a House product that needs to be amended and debated. That assertion, while technically accurate, does not capture the essence of our situation today or right now that we are in a war on terrorism.  The House bill is really the product of an agreement between the White House and Senate Centrists so I am going to call the House bill what it really is. It is a White House Centrist agreement, if you are looking for a bipartisan, bicameral product the President will sign. The President said he would sign this. This agreement is the only game in town.  To anyone opposing this agreement, including the Democrat leadership, I ask them to show me where they are being bipartisan. All I have seen from the leadership throughout this process is an iron fist cloaked in a velvet glove.  Today, we did witness, with the objection to consideration of the stimulus package, the iron fist clothed in an eloquent velvet glove, displayed once again, similar to what we have done on other issues like insurance and like a stimulus package earlier on.  Today that iron fist smashed the White House Centrist agreement. The American people will not be well served by the destruction of the White House Centrist agreement. All it means is that after 3 months of long meetings, committee action, floor debates, we, the Senate, will not deliver to the American people.  The House has delivered. The President has delivered. One has to wonder, then, why are we stuck? If we can get a bipartisan majority in the Senate, action by the House and a signature by the President, why does a partisan minority of the majority party decide to thwart the will of the people? Why, especially now?  Our Nation is in a state of war on terrorism. Our President is necessarily occupied as Commander in Chief to run that war. Why, on a matter of economic stimulus and aid to dislocated workers, did the President have to come to the Hill yesterday to try and break a logjam? Why did the Democratic leadership give his effort the back of their hand? Why did the bipartisan objectives go by the wayside? I will take a few minutes to talk about how we got here.  Shortly after September 11, we started out with meetings with Chairman Greenspan and other economic policymakers. For the most part, they were called by the good chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Baucus. In that period, right after September 11, the President took first steps and took the risk by committing to a stimulus package, fully aware we might be going in the budget ``red'' if we did.  We should not discount this leadership by the President. Certainly it took courage, and it was the right thing to do. Chairman Greenspan also took the lead and gave the ``Greenspan green light'' to pursue a stimulus package. It seemed everyone realized our responsibility was to heed the President's directive and Greenspan's advice. Both of these men said Congress should address the economic slowdown. They told us the slowdown started over 1 year ago. Subsequently, the National Board of Economic Research told us the economy might have recovered but for the September 11 attack.  The President took the lead in meeting needs of dislocated workers. He proposed extension of unemployment insurance benefits. He also proposed providing health care benefits through the National Emergency Grants.  In addition, the President proposed, as a concession to the other party, a new round of rebate collection to those who do not pay income tax.  Was there any reciprocation, any movement from the Democratic leadership? No.  President Bush, much to the consternation of many in the Republican Party, took capital gains tax off the table because it was not well received by Democrats. Was there any reciprocation on the part of the Democratic leadership? No.  This is not to say we did not agree on some things. Bonus depreciation, for instance, was agreed to by each side. Although we did not have it in our caucus position, Republicans agreed with Democrats on liberalizing the net operating loss rules and expensing for small business.  I do not also discount the ideologically based opposition to accelerating the reduction of the 27 percent bracket, but it is amazing to me that many on the other side see taxpayers in the 27 percent bracket as rich people.  A 2 percent rate cut for single folks earning between $27,000 and $65,000 is seen as a tax cut for the very wealthy by the Democrat leadership. Likewise, a married couple with incomes between $45,000 and $109,000 are considered rich. I recognize this tax cut proposal was difficult for the Democratic leadership to accept. After a series of bipartisan, bicameral talks, the House went its own way with a bill; too heavy for me on corporate AMT. It passed by just two votes.  The Senate Democratic leadership responded in kind. The result was a Democratic Caucus partisan position paper reduced to legislation they rammed through our Finance Committee on a party line vote. That bill dead ended in the Senate. The reason is the bill was designed for partisan point making. Its partisan design was its weakness in an institution like the Senate where one only gets things done on a bipartisan basis. That design guaranteed its failure.  We could have ended there, but the President forced us back into action. Frankly, the House also yielded on a very bad bill they first passed.  The result was a quasi-conference environment to work out differences. By virtue of this quasi-conference, my friends Jay Rockefeller and Max Baucus, our chairman, and I spent many long hours debating the merits of economic stimulus and aid to dislocated workers. In many ways, the discussions were vigorous exchanges of views with our House colleagues. A lot of that discussion was healthy, and some of it helped move the process along.  Little real progress was made. Once again, the President intervened and endorsed the Senate Centrist position. Eventually, the House leadership came toward the Centrist position because they wanted to find a way to get a bill through the Senate, and that can only be done if it is done on a bipartisan basis. Even with movement to the Centrist position, the quasi-conference was at an impasse. Senator Daschle's edict about 3 weeks ago that one-third of his caucus could veto a stimulus plan came into clear focus. The sentiments of the House or White House, let alone the sentiments of Joe Six-pack out thereworking every day to pay taxes, were less important than the opinion of a minority of the Democratic Senators, which would be as few as 18. The failure to obtain a super-majority in the Democratic caucus then imperiled this Centrist package, this Centrist bipartisan package.  In the end, the impasse came not from tax cuts. Republicans moved far off their priorities so that tax cuts were not the deal breaker. The impasse was not over unemployment benefits. Republicans had largely moved to the Democratic position. The impasse was not over the amount of the health care benefit package. Again, though the benefit came in the form of a tax credit, Republicans moved toward a Democratic position on the costs of health care benefits.  Bizarre as it may seem, the whole agreement broke down over some ideological position on the eligibility of people for health insurance for the unemployed through just COBRA. The impasse came down not over whether to help these workers. The White House Centrist agreement covered these workers with a tax credit. The Senate Democratic bill covers these workers with a new entitlement. Basically, a super-majority of Democrats would not agree to let laid-off workers have the choice of where they wanted to get their health care benefits. But they could still get their health care benefits with the same tax credit.  The bottom line is the White House-Centrist agreement does not meet the two-thirds litmus test set for the Democratic caucus by the leader.  One has to wonder, why leave all of these good things in the White House-Centrist agreement on the Senate cutting room floor, as just happened about an hour ago? We have before the Senate revolutionary social policies. For the first time, Members have sign-able legislation that guarantees health care benefits for laid-off workers--the biggest change in policy for dislocated workers since unemployment insurance was passed in the 1930s.  We have, in the bill that was objected to, extended unemployment benefits as we have done several times in the last 50 years. We have a robust stimulus package with 30 percent bonus depreciation. We have an extension of expiring tax provisions for 2 years. We have the victims of terrorism tax relief and tax incentives to build New York City once again.  All of these are good provisions which enjoy broad bipartisan support. They are the foundation of the White House-Centrist agreement. Yet because of this ideological fixation, all of these good things now go by the wayside until we return 1 month from now on January 23. While we are going to be enjoying Christmas, these dislocated workers who could have been guaranteed health benefits and further unemployment compensation are going to go away empty handed.  I will look at each key player in the process and see how much movement there has been. Common sense says those who want a deal will show movement. By the same token, those who do not want a deal will not move.  Start with the President. As I said, he made several key moves. He put the dollars on the table, knowing it would complicate the fiscal year 2002 budget. He took capital gains off the table. He put the payroll tax rebates on the table. He put the unemployment insurance and health care benefits on the table. Finally, he endorsed even a plan that went much further in the case of health care benefits, from $3 billion up to $19 billion. That is in the White House-Centrist agreement.  When you look at the record, it is clear to me that the President of the United States wanted a deal, an economic security package for dislocated workers and to help create jobs for those who do not have jobs.  At the House of Representatives, I agree that the first bill, as I said before, from that body was too heavy on the corporate alternative minimum tax. But the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee made many gestures to the other side. For instance, he did not pick and choose among extenders. He included the payroll tax rebate that many of his Members in the other body opposed. The chairman of the Ways and Means Committee increased the resources for unemployment compensation and health care benefits. If you doubt me on the seriousness of that movement, ask many in my caucus their opinion of those proposals. If you look at the record, the House Republicans moved and ultimately ended up as part of the White House-Centrist agreement.  Senate Republicans had a caucus position very close to the President's plan. Like the President, Senate Republicans, especially our leader, Senator Lott, constantly worked to try to get a deal. As the President moved, so did the Senate Republican caucus position move. That is in the Record.  That brings us to the last and ultimate critical player. Obviously, that is the Senate Democratic leadership. I ask, where has the Senate Democratic leadership really moved? At every stage of the process, whether it is the Finance Committee action, whether the action on the floor, or even the quasi-conference, ultimately we find this leadership position always saying ``no''. Everyone else was saying ``yes''.  Now there is a good game being talked by the other side. They say they want an agreement. That is the elegant velvet glove they are noted for, but where is the action? The action today was ``no'' on unanimous consent request. But look at the whole last 3 months on this issue. Where have they moved? If you want an agreement, you have to see movement. There has been none.  One has to ask, with so many good provisions in this White House-Centrist agreement, why should the Democratic leadership want to kill it? The President has expressed that polling data, political consultants, and union officials had a big impact on the Senate Democratic leadership strategy.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an editorial from the Wall Street Journal that states in depth what the consultants say.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                     [From the Wall Street Journal]                           President Daschle       One of the more amusing Washington themes of late has been      the alleged revival of the Imperial Presidency, with George      W. Bush said to be wielding vast, unprecedented powers. Too      bad no one seems to have let Senate Majority Leader Tom      Daschle in on this secret.       Because from where we sit Mr. Daschle is the politician      wielding by far the most Beltway clout, and in spectacularly      partisan fashion. The South Dakotan's political strategy is      obvious if cynical: He's wrapping his arms tight around a      popular President on the war and foreign policy, but on the      domestic front he's conducting his own guerrilla war against      Mr. Bush, blocking the President's agenda at every turn. And      so far he's getting away with it.       Mr. Bush has asked Congress to pass three main items before      it adjourns for the year: Trade promotion authority, and      energy and economic stimulus bills. Mr. Daschle has so far      refused to negotiate on any of them, and on two he won't even      allow votes. Instead he is moving ahead with a farm bill (see      below) the White House opposes, and a railroad retirement      bill that is vital to no one but the AFL-CIO.       Just yesterday Mr. Daschle announced that ``I don't know      that we'll have the opportunity'' to call up an energy bill      until next year. One might think that after September 11 U.S.      energy production would be a war priority. In September alone      the U.S. imported 1.2 million barrels of oil a day from Iraq,      which we soon may be fighting, the highest rate since just      before Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990.       But Mr. Daschle is blocking a vote precisely because he      knows Alaskan oil drilling has the votes to pass; earlier      this autumn he pulled the bill from Senator Jeff Bingaman's      Energy Committee when he saw it had the votes. So much for      the new spirit of Beltway cooperation.       We're not so naive as to think that war will, or should,      end partisan disagreement. But what's striking now is that      Mr. Daschle is letting his liberal Old Bulls break even the      agreements they've already made with the White House. Mr.      Bush shook hands weeks ago on an Oval Office education deal      with Teddy Kennedy, but now we hear that Mr. Kennedy wants      even more spending before he'll sign on. Mr. Daschle is      letting Ted have his way.       The same goes for the $686 billion annual spending limit      that Democrats struck with Mr. Bush after September 11.      That's a 7% increase from a year earlier (since padded by a      $40 billion bipartisan addition), and Democrats made a      public fanfare that Mr. Bush had endorsed this for fear      some Republicans might use it against them in next year's      elections. But now Mr. Daschle is using the issue against      Mr. Bush, refusing to even discuss an economic stimulus      bill unless West Virginia Democrat Bob Byrd gets his      demand for another $15 billion in domestic spending.       Mr. Byrd, a former majority leader who thinks of Mr.      Daschle as his junior partner,     may even attach his wish list to the Defense spending bill.      That would force Mr. Bush to either veto and forfeit much-     needed money for defense, or sign it and swallow Mr. Byrd's      megapork for Amtrak and Alaskan airport subsidies.       All of this adds to the suspicion that Mr. Daschle is only      too happy to see no stimulus bill at all. He knows the party      holding the White House usually gets most of the blame for a      bad economy, so his Democrats can pad their Senate majority      next year by blaming Republicans. This is the same strategy      that former Democratic leader George Mitchell pursued in      blocking a tax cut during the early 1990s and then blaming      George H.W. Bush for the recession. Mr. Mitchell's conigliere      at the time? Tom Daschle.       It is certainly true that Republicans have often helped Mr.      Daschle's guerrilla campaign. Alaska's Ted Stevens is Bob      Byrd's bosom spending buddy; he's pounded White House budget      director Mitch Daniels for daring to speak the truth about      his pork. And GPO leader Trent Lott contributed to the      airline-security rout by letting his Members run for cover.       The issue now is whether Mr. Bush will continue to let      himself get pushed around. Mr. Daschle is behaving badly      because he's assumed the President won't challenge him for      fear of losing bipartisan support on the war. But this makes      no political sense: As long as Mr. Bush's war management is      popular, Mr. Daschle isn't about to challenge him on foreign      affairs.       The greater risk to Mr. Bush's popularity and success isn't      from clashing with the Daschle Democrats over tax cuts or oil      drilling. It's from giving the impression that on everything      about the war, Tom Daschle might as well be President.
