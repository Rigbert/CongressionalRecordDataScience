President, today, the Treasury Department is unveiling a newly designed 1996 series $100 bill that incorporates many state-of-the-art anticounterfeiting features. I commend Secretary Rubin and the Treasury Department. Today's unveiling at the Treasury Department starts the process of reassuring the public, both here and abroad, of the abiding strength and integrity of our currency. That process will continue through next year when the new $100 bills in the 1996 series are circulated for the first time.  This country faces a serious challenge from new technologies that enable counterfeiters to turn out excellent reproductions. Unfortunately, U.S. currency has been among the most susceptible to counterfeiting in the world. Although updated in 1990 with a deterrent security strip, our bills have not had the watermarks or sophisticated dying and engraving techniques that other countries use to defeat counterfeiters.   In the past two Congresses, I have introduced, with Senator John Kerry, legislation to address the growing problem of hi-tech counterfeiting. I am delighted that the Treasury has adopted many of the features we have been recommending.  According to the Secret Service, which has from its inception been combatting counterfeiting, the counterfeiting of U.S. currency has increased dramatically in recent years. Over the past 5 years, the Secret Service seized an average of $58 million annually within the United States. But in the first 4 months of 1995, alone, the Service seized more than $50 million in counterfeit U.S. currency. Likewise, seizure of counterfeit U.S. currency overseas has increased fourfold to $120.7 million in 1993 and $137.7 million in 1994.  I know from personal experience the impact that counterfeiting has had on acceptance of our currency abroad. Over the summer, I took a trip with my family to Ireland. I carried with me a few $100 bills just in case some places did not accept travelers' checks. To my surprise, I found more places that refused to accept my $100 bills. Let there be no doubt, counterfeiters undermine confidence in our currency.  Senator Kerry and I first introduced our legislation in May 1994, to stop counterfeiters from using fake American currency as a free meal ticket. Our bill would have required the Secretary of the Treasury to design a new $100 bill that incorporates some of the counterfeit-resistant features, such as watermarks, multicolored dyes, and sophisticated engraving techniques.  We were encouraged last summer when then-Treasury Secretary Bentsen announced plans for modernizing U.S. currency with new deterrence features. The results of that modernization effort are reflected in the newly-designed 1996 series $100 bill.  I examined one of these new bills earlier this week. To defeat hi-tech counterfeiting technology, this bill has a watermark, and color-shifting ink, new microprinting that requires a magnifying glass to see, and concentric, fine-line moire patterns that are difficult to copy.  I congratulate Secretary Rubin and the Treasury Department for putting this country in a better position to combat counterfeiting and protect our currency. I commend the National Academy of Sciences and the Secret Service for their efforts in connection with this project and thank the talented engravers, printers, and technicians who are bringing these changes to fruition.  I also want to highlight a related development: the establishment of the Securities Technology Institute, a research facility with the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, to assess emerging technology and evaluate features and additional protections for currency and other security documents.  This is the most significant redesign of our currency in the last 70 years, since the ``Big Bill'' was replaced by the ``Small William'' in 1929. We have come a long way from the time when people could only tell a good Continental Congress note by the misspelling of Philadelphia. On the new $100 bill, the portrait of Benjamin Franklin, the father of paper currency in this country, and the familiar sight of Independence Hall remain. But they are now joined by a number of improved security features.  I am delighted that this day has come and look forward to working with Secretary Rubin to serve our mutual goals of deterring currency counterfeiting and increasing confidence in our currency and our economy in Vermont, across the country, and around the world.
