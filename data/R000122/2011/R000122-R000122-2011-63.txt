President, today I introduce with my colleagues Senators Cochran, Murray, Rockefeller, and Whitehouse, the Strengthening Kids' Interest in Learning and Libraries Act bill.  Our bipartisan legislation will reauthorize and strengthen the school library program of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. The key improvements to the program include ensuring that elementary, middle, and high school students are served; expanding professional development to include digital literacy instruction and reading and writing instruction across all grade levels; focusing on coordination and shared planning time between teachers and librarians; awarding grants for a period of three years; and ensuring that books and materials are appropriate for and gain the interest of students with special learning needs, including English learners.  The SKILLS Act will also strengthen Title I by asking state and school district plans to address the development of effective school library programs to help students develop digital literacy skills, master the knowledge and skills in the challenging academic content standards adopted by the state, and graduate from high school ready for college and careers. Additionally, the legislation will broaden the focus of training, professional development, and recruitment activities under Title II to include school librarians.  Since 1965, more than 60 education and library studies have produced clear evidence that school libraries staffed by qualified librarians have a positive impact on student academic achievement. Knowing how to find and use information are essential skills for college and careers. A good school library, staffed by a trained school librarian, is where students develop and hone these skills.  The SKILLS Act will build on the success of the Improving Literacy through School Libraries programs that was part of the No Child Left Behind Act and is the only Federal initiative solely dedicated to supporting and enhancing our Nation's school libraries. The Department of Education's January 2009 evaluation of the program found that it had been successful in improving the quality of those school libraries receiving the grants. Unfortunately, even in the face of all the evidence of the role school libraries play in boosting student achievement and the efficacy of the program itself, the Administration opted not to use its authority to provide funding for the school library program under the fiscal year 2011 continuing resolution.  This was a very short-sighted decision. Since its enactment in 2002, the Improving Literacy through School Libraries program has been making a difference for students across the country.  In Rhode Island, for instance, this program supported the Get READY, Get Ready, Empowered And Determined Youth, project of the Woonsocket school district, which encompassed a comprehensive strategy to improve the reading skills and academic achievement of 6,296 students, in grades K-12, by addressing critical elements of an effective school library program. Grant funds allowed the district to replace outdated library materials, add one to two books per student at each library, extend library hours, and add new computers to connect students to information at other libraries. The funds also increased resources for professional development in technology training for teachers and librarians.  Absent the Federal program, the libraries in many of our high poverty schools will languish with outdated materials and technology. This is a true equity issue, which is why I will continue to fight to sustain our Federal investment in this area and why renewing and strengthening the school library program is of critical importance.  I urge my colleagues to join in cosponsoring the Strengthening Kids' Interest in Learning and Libraries Act.  Mr. President I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1328       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
