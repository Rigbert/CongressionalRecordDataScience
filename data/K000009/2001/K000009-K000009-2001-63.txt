Chairman, this amendment is called the Family Farmer Cooperative Marketing Act of 2001.  For too long now, farmers in our country have been losing power in the marketplace, many times not even knowing it. Tens of thousands of family farmers produce commodities and provide services under contract arrangements with processing firms or handlers. Commodities currently produced under contract include fruits and vegetables, turkeys, chickens, hogs, popcorn, milk, and beef; and the list is likely to continue to increase. We need a fair balance of market power between the processors and the producers. That is why some States have already taken their own action and the Agricultural Marketing Service of our Department of Agriculture considers contracting and agriculture one of the most important issues of our day.  Our amendment would strengthen the Agriculture Fair Practices Act of 1967 in the following way: it would require the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture to establish a system of accreditation for voluntary, cooperative associations of agricultural producers. It would provide for good faith bargaining between processors or handlers and cooperative associations of agricultural producers. It would allow for mediation by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to resolve impasses in bargaining, and it would provide investigative and enforcement authority for the Secretary of Agriculture.  This amendment is very similar to H.R. 230 which I introduced earlier this year. The campaign for contract agriculture reform has said this bill enhances the power of producers and their cooperatives to stabilize farm income.                              {time}  2345  The bill receives specific support from the National Farmers Organization and the National Pork Producers Council. The American Farm Bureau Federation also passed policy resolutions on the importance of contracting in agriculture. I also had submitted for the Record another amendment dealing with the need to provide the Department of Agriculture with the same authority over the poultry industry in this Nation that it already has over the beef and pork industries.  There is great concentration in all of these sectors. Former Grain Inspection and Packers and Stockyard Administrator James Baker testified before our Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration and Related Agencies, that this equivalent authority is most definitely needed to make sure our poultry producers are afforded the same safeguards as are available for beef and pork.  Mr. Chairman, at this time if the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Stenholm) would engage, I understand that the committee may be willing to hold hearings on the concerns that many of us have about the needs for producers to have their rights to fairly and openly negotiate contracts with processors. If the gentleman is willing to commit that the Committee on Agriculture will hold a hearing on this issue and GIPSA's authority on poultry in the days to come, then I am prepared to withdraw my amendment with that assurance.
