President, the Appalachian National Scenic Trail is a treasure that thousands of Americans enjoy every year. From day hikers to adventures making the 2,167 mile trip from Georgia to Maine, all who travel the footpath enjoy a remarkable wilderness experience.  The National Trails System Act of 1968 designated the Appalachian Trail as one of our nation's first scenic trails and authorized the Secretary of Interior to protect the trail through the acquisition of land along the trail or by other means. Over the years, Congress has supported this important effort through appropriations that have enabled the National Park Service to acquire more than 3000 parcels of land, protecting ninety-nine percent of the trail for future generations.  Despite the success of the last thirty years, more work needs to be done to ensure that the trail is preserved in its entirety. The longest remaining unprotected segment of the Appalachian Trail crosses Saddleback Mountain, in the Rangeley Region of western Maine. The 3.1 miles that traverse the Saddleback Mountain range is one of the trail's highest stretches, offering hikers an alpine wilderness trek and extraordinary vistas. The mountain is also home to Saddleback Ski Area, which draws skiers to an area of Maine where many are employed in the tourism industry.  For nearly twenty years, the National Park Service and the owners of the ski area have sought an agreement that balances the preservation of the trail experience as it exists today and development opportunities at the mountain that would draw additional skiers to the resort and the region. Some have been inclined to suggest that skiers and hikers cannot share Saddleback Mountain, but I have always maintained that with careful planning, preservation and economic development can coexist. Consequently, I have long urged both sides to work together to find a resolution that satisfies the interests of those who cherish the Appalachian Trail, as well as those who live and work in the Rangeley Region.  Mr. President, the impasse between the National Park Service and the owners of Saddleback Mountain is drawing to a close. The agreement so many have labored to achieve has been all but finalized, and with the passage of the bill before us today, Congress will establish the framework by which this matter can be resolved. Included in the bill is a provision proposed by me and Senator Snowe directing the Secretary of Interior to acquire the land necessary to protect the Appalachian Trail as agreed to by both the Department and the owners of Saddleback Mountain. The language also directs the Secretary to convey the land to the State of Maine.  I would like to express my appreciation to Appropriations Committee Chairman Stevens and Subcommittee Chairman Specter for working with Senator Snowe and I on this matter of importance to our State. I would also like to thank Interior Subcommittee Chairman Gorton for including the Saddleback acquisition in the list of projects approved for Title VIII funds in the FY 2001 Interior Appropriations bill. Their support, along with the dedication of many others who have been involved in the negotiations, will ensure that skiers and hikers can share in the enjoyment of the natural beauty and wonders of Saddleback Mountain for generation to come.                          ____________________
