 President, in listening to our Democratic colleagues discuss the President's judicial nominees, I have often thought if I had a dollar for every time they use the words ``far right'' or ``extreme,'' I could one day retire a rich and happy man. Some have reached new heights, though, in histrionics and hyperbole in discussing the Janice Rogers Brown nomination.  For example, our very good friend from New York, Senator Schumer, actually said yesterday he could not think of any judicial nominee of President Clinton who was as far to the left as Janice Rogers Brown is to the right.  Just as an initial matter, many Senators on this side of the aisle have noted that 76 percent of Californians--that is not 76 percent of Texans, or 76 percent of Alabamians, or 76 percent of Georgians--voted to reelect Justice Brown to the highest court of our most populous State, not known as a bastion of conservatism.  That certainly belies the notion that she is too conservative for the Federal bench. And with respect to the remainder of Senator Schumer's assertion that there were no far-left Clinton nominees who should have been disqualified from judicial service in the way he would disqualify Justice Brown, it seems to me our friend is suffering from a little memory loss. I can think of a number of Clinton nominees who were very much on the far left of the political spectrum and yet who, today, wear the robe of a Federal judge. My friend from Alabama has mentioned Judge Paez, for example. Senator Sessions noted that Judge Paez once remarked that a judge ought to be an activist. Judge Paez said a judge ought to be an activist if he believed the legislature was failing to address a problem. That, as Senator Sessions points out, is the virtual definition of judicial activism.
