 President, Kentucky suffered a grievous loss last week when law enforcement officer Regina Nickles of Harrodsburg, Kentucky was shot and killed, in the line of duty, early Wednesday morning as Officer Nickles and her partner were responding to a call reporting a man sneaking around the parking lot of a Harrodsburg factory. She was 45 years old.  Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, Regina Woodward Nickles grew up in Boyle County in Central Kentucky. She went to high school in Danville and then attended Eastern Kentucky University. In 1983, at the age of 29, Officer Nickles became the first--and remains the only--woman to ever serve on the Harrodsburg Police force. When she was profiled in the local newspaper in 1983, she said, ``I want to do the best job that I can, and I still feel like I have to prove myself because I'm a woman. I don't want to let these men down who had enough confidence in me to hire me.''  In a town as small as Harrodsburg--population 8000--all the officers are well known. And Officer Nickles was particularly well regarded. She was known in the community as a peacemaker, an officer with a special talent for resolving disputes before they became violent. She is remembered as kind and caring, known for pulling over motorists, giving them a stern warning and sending them on their way. But she could also be tough when called for, and had the respect of the community and all of her fellow officers.  Reflecting the the goodwill that she had built up in Harrodsburg over her career, Officer Nickles was recently nominated as the Republican candidate for sheriff in the November elections. A remarkable reflection of the rapport she had with the community is the fact that several people who had once been arrested and jailed by Officer Nickles have said that they still intended to vote for her because of the way she had treated them.  The murder of Officer Nickles has left the Harrodsburg community in a state of shock. Much like our small Capitol Hill community was devastated by the murders of Officer J.J. Chestnut and Detective John Gibson, the residents of Harrodsburg are asking how this could happen in their small town. As we are painfully aware, no community is immune from such heinous acts.  Mr. President, Officer Regina Woodward Nickles leaves behind an extended family that must now cope with an unimaginably horrific loss. Officer Nickles will also be mourned by the tight-knit Harrodsburg community in which she was such a valued participant.  When Officer Nickles announced her candidacy for Sheriff, she elaborated on her motivation for pursuing the position. ``I want to do more than wear a badge and a gun,'' she observed. ``I want to touch people's lives.'' Officer Nickles didn't need to be elected sheriff to do that. It is abundantly clear that she had touched many people during her too-brief life, and she will be sorely missed.                          ____________________
