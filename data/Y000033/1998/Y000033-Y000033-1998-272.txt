Mr. Speaker, I submit three recent newspaper articles concerning issues surrounding the mysterious fires in Vail, CO, to be included in the Congressional Record and recommend that my colleagues read them.              [From the Salt Lake Tribune, Oct. 21, 1998]                  Romer Tabs Resort Fires As Terrorism       Vail, Colo.--Seven separate fires that destroyed a ski      lodge and other buildings at 11,000 feet were an ``act of      terrorism,'' Gov. Roy Romer said Tuesday as workers resumed      an expansion project at the Vail Mountain resort.       ``I know that mountain quite well, and it's inconceivable      some natural occurrence would cause simultaneous fires on      that ridge,'' Romer said at a news conference in Denver, 100      miles to the east of Vail.       The fires broke out early Monday and caused an estimated      $12 million in damage, destroying the luxurious Two Elk      restaurant, the Ski Patrol headquarters, a picnic spot and      four chairlifts.       The fires came after the Rocky Mountain resort on Friday      began an 885-acre expansion project that wildlife groups say      will make the area uninhabitable for endangered lynx. Cross-     country skiers say the project will limit access. The groups      have denied any involvement.       State and federal agents were investigating the fires,      which burned independent of each other. Two of the buildings      destroyed were more than a mile apart.       Vail officials said the nation's busiest ski area would      open as planned on Nov. 6.       If the fires are linked to Vail's expansion, they would      rank among the worst acts of eco-terrorism in the past      decade, said Ron Arnold, executive vice president of the      Center for the Defense of Free Enterprise, a Bellevue, Wash.,      group that tracks ecological crimes.                                       ____                [From the New York Times, Oct. 22, 1998]              Group Says Vail Fires Were in Behalf of Lynx                           (By James Brooke)       DENVER.--The Earth Liberation Front, a shadowy group that      has taken responsibility for a series of arson fires in the      Northwest, declared in an e-mail communique Wednesday that      the fires atop Vail mountain on Monday were carried out ``on      behalf of the lynx.''       ``Putting profits ahead of Colorado's wildlife will not be      tolerated,'' read the brief statement, which was sent      electronically to several Colorado news organizations. ``We      will be back if this greedy corporation continues to trespass      into wild and unroaded areas.''       The seven fires caused about $12 million worth of damage to      buildings and chair lifts along a 11,200-foot-high ridge that      overlooks a National Forest area where the Vail ski area      started clearing trees on Friday as part of a controversial      expansion. Earlier this year, environmentalists, back country      skiers and many residents of Eagle County had spoken out at      public meetings to block Vail's plan to expand into an area      seen as potential habitat for the reintroduction of the lynx      in the Colorado Rockies.       Vail, which plans to open for skiing on Nov. 6, is the      nation's busiest ski area, selling 1.6 million lift tickets      last winter.       Addressing the nation's skiers, the communique warned:      ``For your safety and convenience, we strongly advise skiers      to choose other destinations until Vail cancels its      inexcusable plans for expansion.''       Wednesday evening in Vail, the Eagle County sheriff's      office said after receiving the two-paragraph statement by      fax: ``Currently investigators are reviewing the origin and      the content for credibility and will continue its      investigation using this communique as a source for      information.''       A Vail Resorts spokesman did not return telephone calls for      comment. Although the fires here appear to be in response to      a local dispute, security was tightened this week at other      ski areas around Colorado, the nation's most popular skiing      state.       Barry Clausen, a Northern California researcher who studies      terrorist acts claimed by environmental extremists, said      Wednesday that the Earth Liberation Front has taken credit      for most of the arson fires linked to environmental protests.       He said the language in Wednesday's communique ``is almost      identical to other letters the ELF has sent to other victims      of arson fires.''       Over the last two years, Clausen said, the Earth Liberation      Front has taken credit for five arsons against federal      government buildings in Oregon and Washington state.       ``We are seeing a decline in small acts of sabotage,      against timber and mining, and an escalation of large acts of      terrorism,'' Clausen said from his office in Eureka.       Noting that an article criticizing Vail's expansion plans      appeared in the May-June issue of Earth First Journal,      Clausen said: ``It's a real pattern. Many times articles come      out in the Journal. Then, there is sabotage.''       The article, headlined ``Super Vail . . . Super Ugly!''      charged that Vail wanted to ``bring the resort lifestyle into      some of the last, best old-growth habitat for lynx in the      southern Rockies.'' But the author, Ben Doon, did not      advocate violence. Citing legal efforts to stop the      expansion, Doon urged readers to contact Ancient Forest      Rescue, an environmental group.       In interview in Vail on Tuesday, Jeff Berman, the local      representative of Ancient Forest Rescue, appeared depressed      by the fires, deserving them as a setback in his battle for      public opinion. He asked: ``Does this help us? Of course      not.''       Wednesday, Theresa Kintz, editor of the Earth First      Journal, said after reading the communique: ``It is entirely      possible that it was an ELF action.''       ``Personally, I don't have a problem with hitting people      like Vail Inc. in their pockets,'' said Ms. Kintz, who      dedicates a page of news, headlined ``Earth Night,'' to      sabotage actions claimed by the Earth Liberation Front. ``I      don't have a problem with seeing their facilities burn down.      It's a war.''       ``Monkey wrenching and eco-sabotage are strategies that      some people feel are justified in some circumstances,'' she      continued, using Earth First! jargon for sabotaging      machinery. Noting that arson was a new step, she added:      ``Classic eco-sabotage would be monkey wrenching      bulldozers.''       In its November 1990 edition, the Earth First Journal      published a photograph of a bulldozer apparently sabotaged by      militants opposed to a ski area expansion near Pagosa      Springs, Colo., the only other recent case of environmental      terrorism against a Colorado ski area.                                       ____               [From the Washington Times, Oct. 27, 1998]              Radical Environmentalists Take New Approach                           (By Robert Weller)       Vail, Colo.--Mining and logging, the industries that helped      build the West, used to     be favorite targets of environmental extremists. Now they are      taking aim at something else--tourism.       Targeting so-called ``industrial tourism,'' the Earth      Liberation Front admitted setting fires last week that caused      more than $12 million in damage at Vail, the nation's busiest      ski resort. The goal was to halt another expansion because of      fears it could harm a potential habitat for the lynx, a      threatened species of mountain cat.       The mainstream environmental movement denounced the arson,      but some are surprised such an attack didn't happen sooner.       ``I know in my heart there has been an environmental time      bomb waiting to go off in Vail and other ski areas for a long      time,'' said environmental writer J.D. Braselton.       The ski areas have also come under attack for creating a      widening economic gap between the haves and have-nots near      resort towns.       ``A classic story in Telluride is of two people who came      here to build trophy homes. And they built them on mesas      facing each other. Each then filed suit against the other      because they didn't want to see another home,'' said Peter      Spencer, a former mayor in Telluride, in southwest Colorado.       Such trophy homes ultimately lead to skyrocketing property      values, which force the working population to move to less      desirable areas and commute many miles over snow-covered      mountain passes.       ``We lose employees on a regular basis to jobs down valley,      where they live,'' said Bob McLaurin, Vail town manager.       He worries that someday there won't be anybody available to      answer police or fire calls, or serve tourists in      restaurants.       Friends say Edward Abbey, author of the book ``The Monkey      Wrench Gang,'' a fictionalized account of his guerrilla-style      attacks on mining and dam-building, would turn over in his      grave if he could see the effects of the tourism that      replaced them.       ``There will be more [negative] impact through tourism than      all the mining, logging and ranching combined,'' said Ken      Sleight, a Moab, Utah, outfitter who served as the model for      the outfitter ``Seldom Seen Smith'' in Mr. Abbey's book,      which is considered a major force in launching the      environmental movement in the Southwest.       Dan Kitchen, an Aspen environmentalist once convicted of      cutting down a fence a homeowner had built to keep out      wildlife, calls ski areas ``developmental terrorists''      because they finance much of their operations through the      sale of million-dollar monster homes.       Colorado traditionalist have another gripe. Tourism and      other service jobs pay an average of $13,000 annually,      compared with the $40,000 that miners or loggers might earn,      says Greg Walcher, president of Club 20, a western Colorado      trade promotion group.       They blame past efforts by environmentalists for helping      drive away the higher paying jobs, and now see the same      pattern surfacing again.       ``The environmental movement is at least partly responsible      for a massive shift away from our traditional industries.      Tourism is all some of these towns have left. An attack on      the ski industry is an attack on the economy of western      Colorado,'' Mr. Walcher said.       A recent economic study done for the U.S. Forest Service      found that from 65 percent to 75 percent of the jobs in the      White River National Forest, site of more ski areas than any      other national forest, are in tourism.
