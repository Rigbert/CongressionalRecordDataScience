Let's live up to that duty by voting down this partisan legislation.  And then let's come together on a balanced, bipartisan solution to reduce our deficit and pay our bills. I suggest to my friend from California that Majority Leader Reid has offered just such a plan. In fact, it incorporates exactly what Speaker Boehner suggested in his speech in New York City. Let us embrace that plan. After this fails, let the Senate send it to us.  This is a moment of great crisis for our country and for our citizens, a crisis that demands our putting aside partisanship and politics for the good of our people. We're not there yet, but it is my great hope that we as a body can live up to that challenge. Our fellow citizens expect it, our duty demands it, our oath requires it.
