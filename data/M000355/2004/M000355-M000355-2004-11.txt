 President, Senator Reid and I did not expect to be back so soon, but we are here again for a very brief session. We convene to consider two housekeeping matters that have been received from the House. The House has not yet acted on the concurrent resolution which will correct the enrollment of the consolidated or Omnibus appropriations measure. Without that House action we will be unable to transmit the conference report to the House so that they may then transmit the bill to the President. Therefore, we are here today to pass a short-term continuing resolution which is at the desk.                          ____________________
