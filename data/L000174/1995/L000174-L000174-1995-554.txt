President, I introduce a bill calling for a study by the Department of Justice, in consultation with the U.S. Department of Commerce on how we can empower parents and users of interactive telecommunications systems, such as the Internet, to control the material transmitted to them over those systems. We must find ways to do this that do not invite invasions of privacy, lead to censorship of private online communications, and undercut important constitutional protections.  Before legislating to impose Government regulation on the content of communications in this enormously complex area, I feel we need more information from law enforcement and telecommunications experts. My bill calls for just such a fast-track study of this issue.  There is no question that we are now living through a revolution in telecommunications with cheaper, easier to use, and faster ways to communicate electronically with people within our own homes and communities, and around the globe.  A byproduct of this technical revolution is that supervising our children takes on a new dimension of responsibility. Very young children are so adept with computers that they can sit at a keypad in front of a computer screen at home or at school and connect to the outside world through the Internet or some other on-line service. Many of us are, thus, justifiably concerned about the accessibility of obscene and indecent materials on-line and the ability of parents to monitor and control the materials to which their children are exposed. But Government regulation of the content of all computer and telephone communications, even private communications, in violation of the first amendment is not the answer--it is merely a knee-jerk response.  Heavy-handed efforts by the Government to regulate obscenity on interactive information services will only stifle the free flow of information, discourage the robust development of new information services, and make users avoid using the system.  The problem of policing the Internet is complex and involves many important issues. We need to protect copyrighted materials from illegal copying. We need to protect privacy. And we need to help parents protect their children. Penalties imposed after the harm is done is not enough. We need to find technical means from stopping the harm before it happens.  My bill calls for a study to address the legal and technical issues for empowering users to control the information they receive over electronic interactive services. Instead of rushing to regulate the content of information services, we should encourage the development of technology that gives parents and other consumers the ability to control the information that can be accessed over a modem.  Empowering parents to manage what their kids access over the Internet with technology under their control is far preferable to some of the bills pending in Congress that would criminalize users or deputize information services providers as smut police.  Let's see what this study reveals before we start legislating in ways that could severely damage electronic communications systems, sweep away important constitutional rights, and undercut law enforcement at the same time.  Mr. President I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 714         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives      of the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. STUDY ON MEANS OF RESTRICTING ACCESS TO UNWANTED                    MATERIAL IN INTERACTIVE TELECOMMUNICATIONS                    SYSTEMS.       (a) Study and Report.--Not later than 150 days after the      date of enactment of this Act, the Attorney General shall      complete a study and submit to the Committee on the Judiciary      of the Senate and the Committee on the Judiciary of the House      of Representatives a report containing--       (1) an evaluation of whether current criminal laws      governing the distribution of obscenity over computer      networks and the creation and distribution of child      pornography by means of computers are fully enforceable in      interactive media;       (2) an assessment of the Federal, State, and local law      enforcement resources that are currently available to enforce      those laws;       (3) an evaluation of the technical means available to--       (A) enable parents to exercise control over the information      that their children receive and enable other users to      exercise control over the commercial and noncommercial      information that they receive over interactive      telecommunications systems so that they may avoid violent,      sexually explicit, harassing, offensive, or otherwise      unwanted material; and       (B) promote the free flow of information consistent, with      Constitutional values, in interactive media; and       (4) recommendations to encourage the development and      deployment of technical means, including hardware and      software, to enable parents to exercise control over the      information that their children receive and enable other      users to exercise control over the information that they      receive over interactive telecommunications systems so that      they may avoid harassing, violent, sexually explicit,      harassing, offensive, or otherwise unwanted material.       (b) Consultation.--In conducting the study and preparing      the report under subsection (a), the Attorney General shall      consult with the National Telecommunications and Information      Administration of the Department of Commerce.      By Mr. D'AMATO (for himself, Mr. Inhofe, and Mr. Hatch):  S. 715. A bill to provide for portability of health insurance, guaranteed renewability, high risk pools, medical care savings accounts, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.      health insurance portability and guaranteed renewability act Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Health Insurance Portability and Guaranteed Renewability Act of 1995. I am pleased to be joined by Senators Inhofe and Hatch an introducing this important legislation.  President Clinton, in his 1993 joint session address, said that ``Millions of Americans are just a pink slip away from losing their health insurance, and one serious illness away from losing all their savings.''  While the President's statement was right, his prescription for reform--as the American people told us in no uncertain terms--was dead wrong. We must find a way to give Americans greater health security without turning the whole system over to the Federal Government, as the President had proposed. We must address the public's insecurities regarding their health insurance while preserving what works in the American health care system and allowing the free market to work.  That is why I am today introducing the Health Insurance Portability and Guaranteed Renewability Act of 1995. This is a bill which I am confident will go a long way toward accomplishing these goals.  First, our bill would eliminate job lock by guaranteeing that people who change jobs will be covered by their new employer's plan without regard to preexisting medical conditions.  It will expand COBRA to provide for continuation of coverage for all individuals employed by firms of two or more employees, and extends COBRA coverage from 18 to 36 months. Therefore, employees losing their jobs will have the opportunity to continue their health coverage for an additional 18 months under their current plan. Present COBRA law benefits only those employers with more than 20 employees.  It will help control health costs by changing the tax law to allow tax-free medical savings accounts. Empirical evidence demonstrates that medical saving accounts can control costs and promote wellness without jeopardizing quality of care. Money saved in such accounts by employees can be used to pay COBRA premiums, if needed.  It will provide a safety net for people who cannot qualify for health insurance by giving them access to health insurance through high-risk pools.  Finally, it will prevent insurance companies from singling out any individual or small group for rate increases or cancellation based on claims experience.  I believe this bill goes a long way toward giving the American people what they want--greater health security without a Big Government takeover of our Nation's health care system. The fact that it can be implemented without new taxes, and without adding to the deficit, is further reason that the Health Insurance Portability and Guaranteed Renewability Act of 1995 should be enacted without delay.                                 ______      By
