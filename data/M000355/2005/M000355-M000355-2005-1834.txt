 President, I ask further consent that at 3 p.m. on Monday, January 24, the Senate proceed to executive session for the consideration of Calendar No. 1, Carlos Gutierrez, to be Secretary of Commerce; provided further that there be 2 hours of debate on the nomination, 1 hour under the control of Chairman Stevens and 1 hour under the control of Senator Dorgan; further, that at the conclusion of that time, the Senate proceed to a vote on the confirmation of the nomination, with no intervening action or debate.  Finally, I ask that the President then be immediately notified of the Senate's action.
