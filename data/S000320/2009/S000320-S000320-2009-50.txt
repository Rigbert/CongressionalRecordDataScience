 President, all these economists agree that government spending is not the way to improve economic performance.  Over the past year, I have repeatedly called for an extensive examination of the origins of this economic crisis and of the potential solutions. So far, the majority has refused. In the absence of any analysis or detailed information, they have chosen time and again to solve the crisis by throwing money at it. I believe this is laying the groundwork for a much greater economic catastrophe.  It took until 1982 for our publicly held debt to cross the $1 trillion mark. In the 27 short years since, we have amassed a debt 10 times that amount. Now we are about to vote on a measure that will, in a single year, add to the national debt what it took nearly 200 years to accumulate.  I fear this is a day we will come to regret, not only because I believe the stimulus bill will not work but because it will mark the day when our generation decided we were not capable of enduring the consequences of our own actions, and therefore future generations must shoulder the burden we could not find the courage to bear ourselves.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
