President, ``Level the Playing Field.''  When I ask small business owners what they would like the Federal Government to do to help them thrive, the answer I most frequently hear is, ``level the playing field.''  It may be a cliche, but there's truth to it. Most small businesspeople don't want a government handout. They don't want special treatment. They just want to be able to compete fairly against other businesses.  That is why I am introducing the Main Street Fairness Act.  If you are a small business owner in Peoria or Springfield or Alton, you compete against neighboring businesses down the street and, increasingly, with sellers on the internet. The businesses down the street have to collect the same State sales taxes that you do. But, many internet sellers don't.  That means internet sellers have a built-in price advantage. That isn't fair, and it's not a level playing field.  The Main Street Fairness Act would address that. The bill would give Congressional endorsement to the Streamline Sales and Use Tax Agreement, which 45 States and the District of Columbia created years ago to help make it feasible for businesses selling online to collect State and local sales taxes already owed.  Why is this Agreement necessary? The Supreme Court ruled in the early '90s that the maze of current sales tax rules and rates was too complex to expect online retailers to comply. The States worked together to address that problem.  The Main Street Fairness Act says that any State that wants to do so can require online retailers to collect the same sales taxes that Main Street businesses collect, provided that small online retailers are exempt, online retailers are compensated for any startup administrative costs associated with collecting sales taxes, and all retailers are treated equally regarding sales tax collection.  Let me be as clear as I can on one point: this bill is NOT a tax increase.  It doesn't amend the Internal Revenue Code in any way. It simply provides states the option to require all retailers to collect the sales taxes that are already owed.  The Main Street Fairness Act provides two other big benefits.  First, consumers will no longer be asked to itemize the sales taxes they owe from their online purchases on their year-end tax forms. Few consumers comply with the law today--most don't know they should--but the Main Street Fairness Act would eliminate the need to do so.  Second, State and local governments would collect taxes that are already owed.  It is no secret that many States and cities, including the State of Illinois and local governments across my State, are struggling to balance their budgets.  The State of Illinois estimates that we lose as much as $153 million each year in unpaid taxes on internet sales alone.  Passing the Main Street Fairness Act would help State and local governments balance their budgets without cutting spending or raising new taxes.  The Main Street Fairness Act is supported by the National Governors' Association, National Conference on State Legislatures, Governing Board of the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement, National Retail Federation, International Council of Shopping Centers, Retail Industry Leaders Association, and the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts.  The Main Street Fairness Act will level the playing field for our small businesses. I urge its passage.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1452       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS.       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Main      Street Fairness Act''.       (b) Table of Contents.--The table of contents for this Act      is as follows:Sec. 1. Short title; table of contents.Sec. 2. Consent of Congress.Sec. 3. Findings.Sec. 4. Authorization to require collection of sales and use taxes.Sec. 5. Determinations by governing board and judicial review of such               determinations.Sec. 6. Minimum simplification requirements.Sec. 7. Limitation.Sec. 8. Expedited judicial review.Sec. 9. Definitions.Sec. 10. Severability.Sec. 11. Sense of Congress on digital goods and services.     SEC. 2. CONSENT OF CONGRESS.       Congress consents to the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax      Agreement.     SEC. 3. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) States should be encouraged to simplify their sales and      use tax systems.       (2) As a matter of economic policy and basic fairness,      similar sales transactions should be treated equally, without      regard to the manner in which sales are transacted, whether      in person, through the mail, over the telephone, on the      Internet, or by other means.       (3) Congress may facilitate such equal taxation consistent      with the United States Supreme Court's decision in Quill      Corp. v. North Dakota.       (4) States that voluntarily and adequately simplify their      tax systems should be authorized to correct the present      inequities in taxation through requiring sellers to collect      taxes on sales of goods or services delivered in-state,      without regard to the location of the seller.       (5) The States have experience, expertise, and a vital      interest in the collection of sales and use taxes, and thus      should take the lead in developing and implementing sales and      use tax collection systems that are fair, efficient, and non-     discriminatory in their application and that will simplify      the process for both sellers and buyers.       (6) Online consumer privacy is of paramount importance to      the growth of electronic commerce and must be protected.     SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION TO REQUIRE COLLECTION OF SALES AND USE                    TAXES.       (a) Grant of Authority.--       (1) In general.--Each Member State under the Streamlined      Sales and Use Tax Agreement is authorized, subject to the      requirements of this section, to require all sellers not      qualifying for the small seller exception to collect and      remit sales and use taxes with respect to remote sales      sourced to that Member State under the Agreement.

(B) The following necessary operational aspects of the      Agreement have been implemented by the Governing Board:       (i) Provider and system certification.       (ii) Setting of monetary allowance by contract with      providers.       (iii) Implementation of an online multistate registration      system.

(C) Each Member State has met the requirements to provide      and maintain the databases for sales and use taxes and the      taxability matrix described in the Agreement, pursuant to      requirements of the Governing Board.       (3) Limitation of authority.--The authorization provided      under paragraph (1)--       (A) shall be granted notwithstanding any other provision of      law; and       (B) is dependent upon the Agreement, as amended, meeting      the minimum simplification requirements of section 6.       (b) Termination of Authority.--       (1) In general.--The authorization provided under      subsection (a) shall terminate for all States if--       (A) the requirements contained in subsection (a) cease to      be satisfied; or       (B) any amendment adopted to the Agreement after the date      of the enactment of this Act is inconsistent with the      provisions of this Act.       (2) Loss of member state status.--The authorization      provided under subsection (a) shall terminate for a Member      State, if such Member State no longer meets the requirements      for Member State status under the terms of the Agreement or      the provisions of this Act.       (c) Determination of Status.--       (1) In general.--The Governing Board shall determine if      Member States are in compliance with the requirements of      subsections (a) and (b) and whether each Member State meets      the minimum simplification requirements of section 6, and      shall reevaluate such determination on an annual basis.       (2) Compliance determination.--Upon the determination of      the Governing Board that all the requirements of subsection      (a) have been satisfied, the authority to require a seller to      collect and remit sales and use taxes shall commence on the      first day of a calendar quarter at least 6 months after the      date the Governing Board makes its determination.       (3) Noncompliance determination.--Upon a final      determination by the Governing Board that a Member State is      not in compliance with the minimum simplification      requirements of section 6 or is otherwise not in compliance      with the Agreement, that Member State shall lose its remote      seller collection authority on the earlier of--       (A) the date specified by the Governing Board; or       (B) the later of--       (i) the first day of January at least 2 years after the      Governing Board finally determined the State was not      compliant; or       (ii) the first day of a calendar quarter following the end      of one full session of the State's legislature beginning      after the Governing Board finally determined the State was      not compliant.     For purposes of this section, the terms ``final      determination'' or ``finally determined'' shall mean that all      appeals processes provided for in the Agreement have been      exhausted or the time for pursuing such appeals has expired.      An action before the Federal Court of Claims pursuant to      section 5 shall not operate to stay a State's loss of      collection authority.       (4) Restoration of authority.--Any Member State that loses      its collection authority under this section must comply with      all provisions of this section to have its remote seller      collection authority restored.     SEC. 5. DETERMINATIONS BY GOVERNING BOARD AND JUDICIAL REVIEW                    OF SUCH DETERMINATIONS.       (a) Petition.--At any time after the Governing Board has      made the determinations required under section 4(c), any      person who may be affected by the Agreement may petition the      Governing Board for a determination on any issue related to      the implementation of the Agreement or on a Member State's      compliance with this Act or the Agreement.       (b) Review in Court of Federal Claims.--Any person who      submits a petition under subsection (a) may bring an action      against the Governing Board in the United States Court of      Federal Claims for judicial review of the action of the      Governing Board on that petition if--       (1) the petition relates to an issue of whether--       (A) a Member State has satisfied or continues to satisfy      the requirements for Member State status under the Agreement;       (B) the Governing Board has performed a nondiscretionary      duty of the Governing Board under the Agreement;       (C) the Agreement--       (i) continues to satisfy the minimum simplification      requirements of section 6; or       (ii) otherwise continues to be consistent with the      provisions of this Act; or       (D) any other requirement of section 4 has been satisfied;      and       (2) the petition is denied by the Governing Board in whole      or in part with respect to that issue, or the Governing Board      fails to act on the petition with respect to that issue not      later than the 6-month period beginning on the day after the      date on which the petition was submitted.       (c) Timing of Action for Review.--An action for review      under this section shall be initiated not later than 60 days      after the denial of the petition by the Governing Board, or,      if the Governing Board fails to act on the petition, not      later than 60 days after the end of the 6-month period      beginning on the day after the date on which the petition was      submitted.       (d) Standard of Review.--       (1) In general.--In any action for review under this      section, the court shall set aside the actions, findings, and      conclusions of the Governing Board found to be arbitrary,      capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in      accordance with law.       (2) Remand.--If the court sets aside any action, finding,      or conclusion of the Governing Board under paragraph (1), the      court shall remand the case to the Governing Board for      further action consistent with the decision of the court.       (3) Nonmonetary relief.--In connection with any remand      under paragraph (2), the court may not award monetary relief,      but may award declaratory and injunctive relief.       (e) Jurisdiction.--       (1) Generally.--Chapter 91 of title 28, United States Code,      is amended by adding at the end the following new section:     ``SEC. 1510. JURISDICTION REGARDING THE STREAMLINED SALES AND                    USE TAX AGREEMENT.       ``The United States Court of Federal Claims shall have      exclusive jurisdiction over actions for judicial review of      determinations of the Governing Board of the Streamlined      Sales and Use Tax Agreement under the terms and conditions      provided in section 5 of the Main Street Fairness Act.''.

Jurisdiction regarding the streamlined sales and use tax               agreement.''.     SEC. 6. MINIMUM SIMPLIFICATION REQUIREMENTS.       (a) In General.--The minimum simplification requirements      for the Agreement are as follows:       (1) A centralized, one-stop, multistate registration system      that a seller may elect to use to register with the Member      States, provided a seller may also elect to register directly      with a Member State, and further provided that privacy and      confidentiality controls shall be placed on the multistate      registration system so that it may not be used for any      purpose other than the administration of sales and use taxes.      Furthermore, no taxing authority within a Member State or a      Member State that has withdrawn or been expelled from the      Agreement may use registration with the centralized      registration system for the purpose of, or as a factor in      determining, whether a seller has a nexus with that Member      State for any tax at any time.       (2) Uniform definitions of products and product-based      exemptions from which a Member State may choose its      individual tax base, provided, however, that all local      jurisdictions in that Member State with respect to which a      tax is imposed or collected, shall have a common tax base      identical to the State tax base of that Member State. A      Member State may enact product-based exemptions without      restriction if the Agreement does not have a definition for      the product or for a term that includes the product. A Member      State shall relax the good faith requirement for acceptance      of exemption certificates in accordance with section 317 of      the Agreement, as in effect on the date of the enactment of      this Act.       (3) Uniform rules for sourcing and attributing transactions      to particular taxing jurisdictions.       (4) Uniform procedures for the certification of service      providers and software on which a seller may elect to rely in      order to determine Member State sales and use tax rates and      taxability.       (5) Uniform rules for bad debts and rounding.       (6) Uniform requirements for tax returns and remittances.       (7) Consistent electronic filing and remittance methods.       (8) Single, State-level administration of all Member State      and local sales and use taxes, including a requirement for a      State-level filing of tax returns in each Member State.       (9) A provision requiring the elimination by each Member      State of caps and thresholds on the application of sales and      use tax rates and exemptions based on value, provided that      this limitation does not apply to the items identified in      sections 308C, 322, and 323 of the Agreement, as in effect on      the date of the enactment of this Act.       (10) A provision requiring each Member State to complete a      taxability matrix, as adopted by the Governing Board. The      matrix shall include information regarding terms defined by      the Agreement in the Library of Definitions. The matrix shall      also include, pursuant to the requirements of the Governing      Board, information on use-, entity-, and product-based      exemptions.       (11) A provision requiring that each Member State relieves      a seller or service provider from liability to that Member      State and local jurisdiction for collection of the incorrect      amount of sales or use tax, and relieves the purchaser from      penalties stemming from such liability, provided that      collection of the improper amount is the result of relying on      information provided by that Member State regarding tax      rates, boundaries, or taxing jurisdiction assignments, or in      the taxability matrix regarding terms defined by the      Agreement in the Library of Definitions.       (12) Audit procedures for sellers, including an option      under which a seller not qualifying for the small business      exception may request, by notifying the Governing Board, to      be subject to a single audit on behalf of all Member States      for sales and use taxes. The Governing Board, in its      discretion, may authorize such a single audit.       (13)(A) Subject to subparagraphs (B), (C), (D), and (E), a      provision requiring that in order for a Member State to      require collection with respect to remote sales under section      4, the Member State shall provide compensation for expenses      incurred by a seller directly in administering, collecting,      and remitting sales and use taxes to that Member State. Such      compensation may vary in each Member State as provided in the      Agreement.       (B) Congress hereby finds that the compensation for      expenses incurred by sellers required of Member States under      the terms of the Agreement, as in effect on the enactment of      this Act, is the minimum compensation necessary, when      considered in connection with the simplification requirements      contained in the Agreement on the date authority to require      collection commences under section 4, to satisfy the      requirement under subparagraph (A) on such date.       (C)(i) A provision requiring that the minimum compensation      required of a Member State under subparagraph (A) may be      modified as follows:       (I) Adjusted in relationship to changes in the size of the      small business exemption adopted by the Governing Board.       (II) Decreased as additional simplifications and      improvements in technology reduce collection costs.       (III) Increased if provisions of the Agreement are adopted      that increase collection costs.       (ii) Any such modification in the minimum required      compensation must be based on an independent review of the      expenses incurred by sellers in administering, collecting,      and remitting sales and use taxes and shall consider all      changes impacting such expenses and take into account and be      proportional to the increase or decrease in the expenses      incurred by sellers in administering, collecting, and      remitting sales and use taxes.       (D) The compensation required by subparagraph (A) shall be      provided pursuant to the implementation schedule set out in      the Agreement. Nothing in this Act shall prohibit a Member      State from providing compensation greater than the amount      required by this Act or the Agreement or on a date earlier      than required by this Act or the Agreement.       (E) Compensation necessary to meet the requirement of      subparagraph (A) may be provided to a seller or a third party      service provider whom a seller has contracted with to perform      the sales and use tax responsibilities of a seller.       (14) Appropriate protections for consumer privacy.       (15) Governance procedures and mechanisms to ensure timely,      consistent, and uniform implementation and adherence to the      principles of the streamlined system and the terms of the      Agreement.       (16) A uniform rule to establish a small seller exception      to a requirement to collect authorized by this Act.       (17) Uniform rules and procedures for sales tax holidays.       (18) Uniform rules and procedures to address refunds and      credits for sales taxes relating to customer returns,      restocking fees, discounts and coupons, and rules to address      allocations of shipping and handling and discounts applied to      multiple item and multiple seller orders.       (b) Requirement to Provide Simplified Tax Systems.--       (1) In general.--The requirements of this section are      intended to ensure that each Member State provides and      maintains the necessary simplification to its sales and use      tax system to warrant the collection authority granted to      such Member State in section 4.       (2) Reduction of administrative burdens.--The requirements      of this section should be construed--       (A) to require each Member State to substantially reduce      the administrative burdens associated with sales and use      taxes; and       (B) as allowing each Member State to exercise flexibility      in how these requirements are satisfied.       (3) Exception.--In instances where exceptions to the      requirements of this section can be exercised in a manner      that does not materially increase the administrative burden      on a seller obligated to collect or pay the taxes, such      exceptions are permissible.       (c) No Requirement to Exempt From or Impose Tax.--Nothing      in this Act or the Agreement shall require any Member State      or any local taxing jurisdiction to exempt, or to impose a      tax on any product, or to adopt any particular type of tax,      or to impose the same rate of tax as any other taxing      jurisdiction.     SEC. 7. LIMITATION.       (a) In General.--Nothing in this Act shall be construed      as--       (1) subjecting a seller to franchise taxes, income taxes,      or licensing requirements of a Member State or political      subdivision thereof; or       (2) affecting the application of such taxes or requirements      or enlarging or reducing the authority of any Member State to      impose such taxes or requirements.       (b) No Effect on Nexus, etc.--       (1) In general.--No obligation imposed by virtue of the      authority granted by section 4 shall be considered in      determining whether a seller has a nexus with any Member      State for any other tax purpose.       (2) Permissible member state authority.--Except as provided      in subsection (a), and in section 4, nothing in this Act      permits or prohibits a Member State from--       (A) licensing or regulating any person;       (B) requiring any person to qualify to transact intrastate      business;       (C) subjecting any person to State taxes not related to the      sale of goods or services; or       (D) exercising authority over matters of interstate      commerce.     SEC. 8. EXPEDITED JUDICIAL REVIEW.       (a) Three-judge District Court Hearing.--Notwithstanding      any other provision of law, any civil action challenging the      constitutionality of this Act, or any provision thereof,      shall be heard by a district court of 3 judges convened      pursuant to the provisions of section 2284 of title 28,      United States Code.       (b) Appellate Review.--       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of      law, an interlocutory or final judgment, decree, or order of      the court of 3 judges in an action under subsection (a)      holding this Act, or any provision thereof, unconstitutional      shall be reviewable as a matter of right by direct appeal to      the United States Supreme Court.       (2) 30-day time limit.--Any appeal under paragraph (1)      shall be filed not more than 30 days after the date of entry      of such judgment, decree, or order.     SEC. 9. DEFINITIONS.

SEC. 11. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON DIGITAL GOODS AND SERVICES.       It is the sense of Congress that each Member State that is      a party to the Agreement should work with other Member States      that are also parties to the Agreement to prevent double      taxation in situations where a foreign country has imposed a      transaction tax on a digital good or service.      By
