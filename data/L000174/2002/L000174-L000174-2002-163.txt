President, this week marks a little more than one year after the reorganization of the Senate Judiciary Committee following the change in majority last year. The Democratic-led Judiciary Committee has had an impressive year of fairly and promptly considering President Bush's nominees. In addition to the dozens of high-ranking Justice Department officials for whom we held hearings and our work in connection with almost 200 Executive Branch nominees the Committee reported, we have had a noteworthy record year with respect to judicial nominees.  With the lifting of a Republican hold on nominations we have been able to move forward this week to confirm 15 more judicial nominees--4 circuit court nominees and 11 district court nominees. The Democratic-led Senate has now confirmed 72 of President Bush's judicial nominees. This interim total of 72 judges far outdistances any Republican total for any of the preceding six years. Moreover, this is more judges than were confirmed under Republican control during all of 1999, 2000 and the first six months of 2001 combined. Thus, in less than 13 months we have done more than the Republicans did in 30 months! And we did so while reforming the process to ensure bipartisan cooperation and greater fairness.  The Senate has now confirmed 13 of President Bush's circuit court nominees--which is almost twice as the average during the prior six and one-half years of Republican control when they averaged seven circuit court confirmations per year. This is more circuit court nominees than were confirmed in two years combined, during all of 1996 and 1997, of the prior years of Republican control.  In this, our first year, we held 23 hearings for 84 of the President's nominees to the Federal Courts of Appeals and District Courts. That is more hearings for more of this President' s district and circuit court nominees than were ever held in any of the six and one-half years that preceded the change in majority last summer. It is more hearings for more circuit and district court nominees than in 20 of the last 22 years.  In particular, we held more hearings for more of President Bush's circuit court nominees, 18, than in any of the six and one-half years in which the Republicans controlled the Committee before the change in majority last summer. For that matter, we held twice as many hearings for courts of appeals nominees than were held in the first year of the Reagan Administration when the Senate was controlled by Republicans and five times more than in the first year of the Clinton Administration when the Senate was controlled by Democrats. That total of 18 hearings for circuit court nominees is also twice what the Republican majority averaged when it was in control of the process. Those are the facts.  Under Democratic leadership, the Judiciary Committee voted on more judicial nominees, 79, than in any of the six and one-half years of Republican control that preceded the change in majority. We voted on twice as many circuit court nominees, 15, than the Republican majority averaged in the years they were in control. In fact, this last year we voted on more nominees than were voted on in 1999 and 2000 combined and on more circuit court nominees than the Republicans allowed votes on during 1996 and 1997 combined.  We have achieved what we said we would by treating President Bush's nominees more fairly and more expeditiously than President Clinton's nominees had been treated. By many measures the Committee has achieved twice as much this last year as Republicans averaged during their years in control, and, by some measures, has done so in less than half the time.  I commend and thank the Majority Leader and Assistant Majority Leader for their patience and determination in achieving movement on judicial nominees on the Senate floor. The Administration's obstructionism stalled Senate floor actions on nominations for more than two months, while the Administration failed to fulfill its responsibility to work with the Senate in the naming of members of bipartisan boards and commissions. But just last Friday we resumed voting on judicial nominations and confirmed 15 judicial nominees in the last week once Senator McCain's hold was lifted.  Four of these nominees were confirmed to the Federal Courts of Appeals, including the first nominee to the Sixth Circuit in almost five years, the first nominee to the Ninth Circuit in two years, and the first nominee to the Third Circuit in almost two and a half years and the third nominee that we have confirmed to the Eighth Circuit.  With these confirmations, we have addressed long-standing vacancies on circuit courts caused by Republican obstruction on President Clinton's nominees. We held the first hearing for a Fifth Circuit nominee in seven years, the first hearings for Sixth Circuit nominees in almost five years, the first hearing for a Tenth Circuit nominee in six years, and the first hearings for Fourth Circuit nominees in three years.  We have also now confirmed 59 of the President's district court nominees, twice as many as the Republican average for the past six and one-half years. Contrast the 59 Federal trial court judges confirmed by the Democratic Senate in just a little more than a year with the Republican average, during their past six and one-half years of control, of confirming only 31 Federal trial court judges a year. The Senate has confirmed more Federal trial court judges than were confirmed in 19 of the past 21 years and almost twice as many as the Republican average from their six and one-half years of control.  With this week's confirmations, the Democratic-led Senate has confirmed the 10th Federal judge for Pennsylvania. In addition, we confirmed our fifth judge to the District Courts in Texas, and our fifth judge to the Federal courts in the Eleventh Circuit. Our treatment of these nominees as well as a number of others, including the nominees confirmed today for the District Courts in Missouri, stands in sharp contrast to the treatment of nominees by the Republican majority.  We have reformed the process for considering judicial nominees. For example, we have ended the practice of anonymous holds that plagued the period of Republican control, when any Republican Senator could hold any nominee from his home state, his own circuit or any part of the country for any reason, or no reason, without any accountability. We have returned to the Democratic tradition of holding regular hearings, every few weeks, rather than going for period of as long as six months without a single hearing.  It would certainly have been easier and less work to retaliate for the unfair treatment of the last President's judicial nominees. We did not. We have been, and will continue to be, more fair than the Republican majority was to President Clinton's judicial nominees. More than 50 of Clinton's nominees never got a vote, many languished for months and years before their nominations were returned without a hearing or other action by the Senate. Others waited years--not just a year, but up to more than four years. Some never were accorded a hearing, some were finally confirmed after years of delay.  Those who now seek to pretend that the Democratic majority in the Senate caused a vacancy crisis in the Federal courts are ignoring the facts. Under Republicans, court vacancies rose from 63 in January 1995 to 110 in July 2001, when the Committee reorganized. During Republican control before the reorganization of the Committee, vacancieson the Courts of Appeals more than doubled, increasing from 16 to 33. That is what we inherited. But in one year of Democratic control, and despite 45 additional vacancies caused largely by the retirements of many past Republican appointees, we have reduced the number of district and circuit court vacancies.  Vacancies continue to exist on the Court of Appeals, in particular, because a Republican Senate majority was not willing to hold hearings or vote on more than half--56 percent--of President Clinton's circuit nominees in 1999 and 2000, and was not willing to confirm a single circuit judge during the entire 1996 session. Republicans caused the circuit vacancy crisis, and it has taken a tremendous effort to evaluate and have hearings for 18 circuit court nominees in our first year.  In the meantime, Republicans have been unfairly critical that not every nominee has yet had a hearing or been confirmed. Rather than commend our efforts to do twice as much as they, their criticism is that we have yet to conclude consideration of everyone simultaneously. In less than 13 months we have already confirmed 13 of President Bush's nominees to the Courts of Appeals, and one more is awaiting a vote by the full Senate. They confirmed 46 circuit court nominees in 76 months. Without the benefit of presidential consultation of the Senate before nomination--as Republicans did in recent past years, without having had the luxury of taking two, three and sometimes four years before voting on a nominee, we have already achieved a confirmation rate of over 40 percent in our first year. With some cooperation in the fall from the Administration and from the Republican minority, we can improve on that confirmation rate before the end of the year. It already tops the Republican's record in 1997 and far exceeds the Republicans' record in 1999 when their own confirmation rate for circuit court nominees was 28 percent.  It constantly amazes me that our Republican critics run away from their record on judicial nominees, without admitting any error or wrongdoing or regrets of course, and seek to hold us to a much higher standard than they achieved. For example, they seek to compare what we have been able to do in less than 13 months with what other Congresses did over two years. They seek to make comparisons without recognizing that in the current situation we have a Republican President nominating an extreme group of nominees without consulting with Senators, as opposed to other situations in which Presidents and Senate majorities of the same party consulted and worked closely together.  A good example of this double standard is the Republican critics' use of ``confirmation rates for Court of Appeals nominees.'' Remember that in 1996 the Republican majority's confirmation percentage for Court of Appeals nominees was zero--not a single confirmation of a single Court of Appeals judge all year. In 1999, President Clinton sent the Senate 25 nominations to the Courts of Appeals. Of those six were renominations of people on whom the Senate had failed to take action dating back to 1996, 1997 and 1998. Of the 25 nominations to the Courts of Appeals by President Clinton, the Republican majority in the Senate would allow only seven to be confirmed by the end of the year, for a confirmation rate of 28 percent. We have already achieved a confirmation rate of 40 percent in our first year.  No judicial nominees should be rubber-stamped by the Senate, not even a President's first few choices. All nominees for these lifetime positions merit careful review by the Senate. When a President is using ideological criterion to select nominees, it is fair for the Senate to consider it, as well. Federalist Society credentials are not a substitute for fairness, moderation or judicial temperament. When a President is intent on packing the courts and stacking the deck on outcomes, consideration of balance and how ideological and activist nominees will affect a court are valid considerations.  What the President and his advisors acknowledge they are doing is nominating ideologically conservative judicial nominees to stack the 5th, 6th, and D.C. Circuits with judicial activists of their choice. I have tried to work with the White House on judicial nominations. I have gone out of my way to encourage them to work in a bipartisan way with the Senate, like past Presidents, but in all too many instances they have chosen to bypass bipartisanship. I have encouraged them to include the ABA in the process earlier, like past Presidents, but they have refused to do so even though their decision adds to the length of time nominations must be pending before the Senate before they can be considered.  This past January, I again called on the President to stop playing politics with judicial nominations and act in a bipartisan manner. In June, I sent a detailed letter to the President on these issues. My efforts to help the White House improve the judicial nominations process have been rejected. I would like to improve the process and speed up the filling of judicial vacancies with qualified, fair-minded judges.  Advice and consent does not mean giving the President carte blanche to pack the courts. The ingenious system of checks and balances in our Constitution does not give the power to make lifetime appointments to one person alone to remake the courts along narrow ideological lines, to pack the courts with judges whose views are outside of the mainstream, and whose decisions would further divide our nation.  We have worked hard to balance these competing concerns over the past year: how to address the vacancy crisis we inherited while also not being a rubberstamp and abdicating our responsibilities to provide a democratic check on the President's choices for lifetime appointment to the federal courts. These are the only lifetime appointments in our system of government, and they matter a great deal to our future.  We have moved quickly, but responsibly, to fill judicial vacancies with qualified nominees we hope will not be activists. In our first year we confirmed 72 judges and reported 79 judicial nominees. Partisans ignore these facts. The facts are that we are reporting President Bush's nominees at a faster pace than the nominees of prior presidents, including those who worked closely with a Senate majority of the same political party. We have accomplished all this during a period of tremendous tumult and crisis.  The Judiciary Committee noticed the first hearing on judicial nominations within 10 minutes of the reorganization of the Senate, and held that hearing on the day after the Committee was assigned new members. We held unprecedented hearings during the August recess last year and proceeded with a hearing two days after the 9-11 attacks and shortly after the anthrax attack. Today, we held our 23rd hearing for judicial nominees. We are doing our best to address the vacancy crisis we inherited.  The Democratic majority in the Senate has worked hard since the change in majority last summer. We have a record of achievement and of fairness to be proud of at the recess of this session. I thank the members who have worked cooperatively with me to make progress in so many areas over the last year.                          ____________________
