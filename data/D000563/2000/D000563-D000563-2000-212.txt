President, today I am introducing the Stronger Tobacco Warning Label to Save Lives Act. This legislation would replace the current cigarette warning label on tobacco products with larger, more direct messages that will have an impact on current smokers and potential smokers who are usually children. The Stronger Tobacco Warning Label to Save Lives Act will require a new series of warning labels modeled after new, more effective warning labels in Canada.  On January 19, 2000, Canadian Health Minister Allan Rock unveiled new and larger health warning labels for tobacco products which include color graphics and images that illustrate the damage that cigarettes do to the health of smokers and those around them. These warning labels will cover 50% of the front and back panels of tobacco products--one side in English and the other in French--and provide more information on the harmful ingredients in tobacco products. These new warning labels apply to all tobacco products. They will take effect on January 1, 2001.  After the U.S. Surgeon General publicly announced the dangers of tobacco use in 1965, the U.S. became the first country to impose mandatory health warning labels on all cigarette packs. In 1984, the U.S. replaced that label with a system of four rotating warning labels. Since then, the U.S. cigarette warning labels have become stale and ineffective. Many smokers have memorized all of the current warning labels. Others never notice the warnings because they are placed inconspicuously the side of the pack.  Other countries have since taken the lead and required stronger health warning labels. These labels have been effective in reducing smoking rates. For example, in South Africa, tobacco consumption decreased by 15% between 1994 and 1997 due to a combination of radio advertising campaigns, increased excise taxes on cigarettes, and new health warning labels. Fifty-eight percent of smokers said that the cigarette warning labels made them want to quit, cut down on smoking, or at least change to a lighter cigarette. Among non-smokers, 38% said that the warnings made them glad they had never started smoking.  The tobacco industry's massive expenditures on tobacco product promotion and public relations have ensured that, over time, Americans have seen more positive than negative imagery surrounding tobacco. The Stronger Tobacco Warning Label to Save Lives Act will ensure that every time someone lights up, the first thing that comes to mind is the health consequences--not the alluring lifestyle images associated with tobacco industry marketing. Too many young people smoke because they are led to believe it's cool and glamorous, when the truth is that tobacco kills.  Because tobacco products are highly addictive for many users, and because most users start using tobacco at a very young age, the standard of warning for tobacco must be much higher than for other products. The warning labels should at least be as prominent in selling the health message as the industry's design is effective in promoting the product. This is not about banning or regulating a legal product, this is about providing the consumer with the appropriate information so they can make an informed decision.  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this important legislation to ensure that every time someone lights up, the first thing that comes to mind are the health consequences--not the alluring lifestyle images associated with tobacco industry marketing. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation be printed in the Congressional Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2889       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
