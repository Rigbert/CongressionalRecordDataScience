  Mrs. McCASKILL. I say to the Senator, it is my understanding that the essence of Mrs. DeVos's career has been an effort to impose on States programs--and now a Federal Government program--that will take money out of public schools to provide for parents and students to then go to private schools. Is it a fair characterization of the essence of her career that parents should have a choice with public money to decide whether they want to attend a public school or a private school?
