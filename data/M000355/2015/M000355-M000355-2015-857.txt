 President, the revelations we have seen from Planned Parenthood are deeply disturbing. They raise fundamental questions about what kind of society we want to be, so I want to thank Senators Ernst, Paul, Lankford, and a number of others, for accepting my invitation to lead the effort on the Senate's response.  The legislation they worked to develop is all about restoring America's commitment to care and to compassion. It would fund women's health, not Planned Parenthood, and we will take a vote to advance it tonight. Instead of subsidizing a political group, this bill would protect Federal funding for health services for women. Instead of subsidizing a political group, this bill would ensure funds continue to flow to community health centers and hospitals that provide more comprehensive health services and may have many more facilities nationwide. Instead of subsidizing a political group, this bill would help women receive health services, such as screenings, prenatal and post-natal care, well-child care, diagnostic laboratory and radiology services, immunizations, and other care they need. That is a true commitment to women's health. That is real compassion.  I know Democrats have relied on Planned Parenthood as an ally recently, but they must be moved by the horrifying images we have all seen. They must be shocked by the utter lack of compassion that has been on display. They must care about women's health as much as they care about some scandal-plagued political organization. That is why tonight I am asking them to truly reflect on what is important. I am asking them not to block this funding for women's health just to protect some political group mired in scandal. Women deserve better, and our country deserves better.                          ____________________
