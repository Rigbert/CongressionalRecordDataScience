We have a mutual friend, Congressman David Obey of Wisconsin, who has a favorite saying on the floor of the House about Members of Congress posing for ``holy pictures.'' In this situation, with the vote the Harkin amendment asked for in the Senate, Democrats and Republicans said we are against this Bush policy of cutting 8 million Americans off of overtime pay, and then the House of Representatives in instructing conferees said we are against this Bush policy, so that all of us were posing for this big group picture--holy picture--on how we are standing with American workers.  In a matter of 5 minutes, as the gavel is struck in the conference committee, the Bush White House prevailed and this rule striking overtime for 8 million American workers is signed into law by the President. Is that the final result, until your amendment comes along, I hope?
