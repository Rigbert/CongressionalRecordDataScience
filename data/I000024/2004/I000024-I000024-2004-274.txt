I only say, if your State were to devise a way to get to the 90-percent mark that they have to get to to keep from being penalized, it would have to take some reasonable period of time. They would have to establish some criteria and then try to get there.  I cannot imagine it could be done within 8 months, and these people would already be subjected to the penalties imposed in the year 2005. That would be a concern.
