President, Vermont is known for many of its great businesses and products. Among those successful companies is Darn Tough Vermont, whose brand represents the commitment to quality and excellence that defines Vermont. For nearly a decade, Darn Tough Vermont has been making the type of quality products our Nation has grown to expect from Vermonters.  Darn Tough was launched in 2004 by Ric Cabot, whose family founded Darn Tough's parent company in Vermont 35 years ago. For three generations, the Cabot family has stayed true to their roots and committed to the Northfield community. While other clothing manufacturers have outsourced their labor, the Cabots carry on where they began--manufacturing in New England, keeping faith with their customers and their 120 employees.  Darn Tough has a local feel to those who visit its factory and know its operators, but the company's name brand is known across the country and around the world wherever people appreciate a high-quality wool hiking and athletic sock, and its products are even worn overseas by our troops in combat. And as with other Vermont companies that equip and outfit our military, taxpayers can rest assured our troops are in good hands when their feet are in quality goods made by Darn Tough.  The Burlington Free Press recently paid tribute to Ric Cabot and all of the employees at Darn Tough for their hard work that continues to benefit our troops and the Vermont economy. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the recent Free Press article entitled ``Rebuilding American textiles, one sock at a time: Darn Tough measures success,'' be printed into the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:               [From Burlington Free Press, Apr. 4, 2012] Rebuilding American Textiles, One Sock at a Time: Darn Tough Measures                                 Success                          (By Dan D'Ambrosio)       In Northfield, about 50 miles north of White River Junction      where Ibex makes its home, Cabot Hosiery Mills, Inc. has been      making private label socks not only in America, but in      Vermont, since 1978. Third generation owner Ric Cabot, who      launched the company's own label--Darn Tough Vermont--in      2004, says one of the secrets to Darn Tough's success is the      deceptive difficulty of making a good sock.       ``People think socks are easy to do, it's just a pair of      socks, how hard could it be?'' Cabot said. ``I guess that      allows people to come into the market, but the staying power      of companies that don't produce their own product is very      short. There are so many people that are doing it well, it's      hard to maintain a presence.''       Perhaps the best symbol of Cabot's fastidiousness when it      comes to socks is the 18-inch ruler projecting incongruously      out of his back pocket when he greets visitors at the front      door of the plain metal building that houses Darn Tough.       Cabot sat on the ruler and broke it about 20 years ago. He      had one of Cabot's maintenance workers glue it back together,      giving it the look of a broken bone that has healed well.      There are certain things, Cabot says, you don't want to      replace.       Cabot is never without his ruler as he roams the knitting      floor and quality control departments of Darn Tough, handling      socks, and measuring them.       ``I sweat quarter-inches,'' Cabot says. ``The first thing I      do when I pick up a sock, is it the right length? If a sock      is the right length, that means a lot of people are doing      their jobs.''       Later, at a quality audit station, Cabot picks up a sock, a      men's large.       ``Socks that made it this far, there's not going to be a      huge hole, or wrong color, but the sizing should be right,''      he says. ``This should be at or on 10\3/4\ inches.''       It's dead on. Socks, Cabot explains, are a math problem,      ``like most things in life.'' Among the numbers you have to      work out are the size and gauge of the needles used to knit      the socks. The gauge of the needle is basically how many      needles you can fit in a circumference, because socks are      knit in a circle.       ``Those needles are in a cylinder,'' Cabot says. ``You have      to take into account needle size, cylinder size, what's the      right weight of wool, nylon and Lycra? How are you going to      reinforce it? How many stitches per inch? Where are you going      to put the terry, the cushioning?''       Once you answer all of these many mathematical questions,      Cabot says, you have the ``DNA'' of a Darn Tough sock. Then      that DNA has to be expanded to hiking socks, running socks,      cycling socks. Every sock has more in common, mathematically,      than they don't have in common with other Darn Tough socks.       ``That's the math of it, the durability story, the comfort      story, the fit story,'' Cabot said.       But all those stories, he said, are trumped by another      story when it comes to marketing Darn Tough socks: The      Vermont story. Darn Tough employs about 120 people in      Northfield, maintaining the New England tradition of textiles      that once included hundreds of towns.       ``You got to remind people, they know it, but you tell them      nobody ever outsourced anything for quality,'' Cabot said.      ``That's the key.''                          ____________________
