Some of the moments I am proudest of have been those when the two of us have been able to team up on health reform. Without getting into it this afternoon, let me say that millions of poor young people who use community health centers are getting services there at no extra cost to our taxpayers, because Senator Hatch was willing to work with this Senator and a group of others, including public interest groups and a wide variety of health care advocates, in order to change malpractice rules. This was done to make sure not only that those who had a legitimate claim got served but also that the bulk of the money went to patients in need. Thousands of low-income Americans get care because Senator Hatch was willing to take a stand for low-income folks. I wish to tell him I am very much looking forward to working with him and our colleagues on a bipartisan basis over the next 5 months to get this job done.
