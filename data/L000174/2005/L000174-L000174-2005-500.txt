President, I want to call attention to an important, yet often overlooked, provision of law that governs the relationship of the United States with nations that harbor individuals who have been indicted by the Special Court for Sierra Leone or the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. This provision, section 585 of the Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, which was signed into law by President Bush in January 2004 and reauthorized about a year later, makes it clear that the Unites States stands for the rule of law in Africa. This is not a partisan issue. Democrats and Republicans understand the importance of the rule of law, which is a cornerstone for peace, democracy, justice and development in Africa--and around the world. In fact, Senator Judd Gregg, a Republican from New Hampshire, co-authored this provision with me.  I see my friend from Illinois, Senator Obama, on the floor and am wondering if he agrees.
