President, I have said over and over that no one in the Senate is against crime victims. I care deeply about the rights of crime victims, just as I care about the rights of all Americans.  I established one of the first formal systems in my State to make sure crime victims are heard. It is something that is done all the time now. In fact, one of the distinguished family court judges, Judge Amy Davenport, was in town yesterday and listened to part of this debate. She said: There is nothing you talked about here that we just don't do automatically. In Vermont, we do not need a constitutional amendment to do it.  We all care about the rights of crime victims. This is not a case of for or against amending the Constitution. We establish whether we care about crime victims. We all do. I care about their rights. I also care about the rights of mothers and expectant mothers, the rights of immigrants, the rights of workers, the rights of farmers, the rights of hospital patients, the rights of the young, the rights of the old, the rights of people seeking housing, the rights of students, the rights of artists, journalists, and scientists, the rights of those people who care about the environment, and the rights of families.  I do not know anybody in this body, Democrat or Republican, who does not care about the rights of all these people.  We all care about the rights of all law-abiding Americans. We could easily pass unanimous resolutions to that effect. But Americans want practical solutions to practical problems from their Government, not just expressions of concern. They certainly do not want us to try to define every one of these rights in a separate constitutional amendment.  So the issue is not whether we care about the rights of crime victims. I point out that a couple weeks ago my dear friend Senator Feingold voted against a constitutional amendment to limit campaign contributions. Anyone who would infer from that vote that Senator Feingold is not passionate about campaign finance reform knows nothing about Senator Feingold and his attitude about campaign finance reform. In all the years I have been here, I have never seen anybody as passionate about it as he.  Recently we voted on a constitutional amendment to criminalize physical destruction of the American flag. Senators Bob Kerrey, Robert Byrd, Mitch McConnell, Bob Bennett, Daniel Inouye, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, and many others voted against that constitutional amendment. Many of them are decorated war veterans. Bob Kerrey, for example, is the only Member of this body to hold the Congressional Medal of Honor. The vote did not mean they do not respect the flag.  When Gen. Colin Powell and Senator John Glenn opposed the flag amendment, it was not because they lack devotion to this country. Anybody would be hard pressed to find two people more patriotic than they. Far from it, they are American heroes who showed their patriotism by standing up for the Bill of Rights. Frankly, that is ultimate patriotism.  There have been studies over time in which people are asked about different parts of our Bill of Rights that we all rely upon, and the study would say: Would you vote for the right of free speech today, the right of assembly, or some of these others? People say: Yes, all except this or all except that. Thank goodness people had the courage to write and vote for it earlier. Our country has it. And then others made sure we did not go back and change it because we might have some problems.  In my years in public life, I cannot think of more times that devotion to the first amendment has been tested or that any area in the Constitution has been tested more than the first amendment. We do not need the first amendment to protect popular speech; we need it to protect unpopular speech. That really is the crux of why we should care about amending our Constitution and carving exceptions or making changes in our Constitution.  We had a Member of Congress in Vermont who was prosecuted under the Alien and Sedition Act in a way that we all know would be highly unconstitutional. Why? Because he criticized the Federal Government. They locked him up. You know what? This is why I love my native State of Vermont: We do not let other people tell us what to think. While he was locked up, what did we do? We reelected him and sent him right back down to Congress. And the shame was on those who supported the Alien and Sedition Act, they were soon gone.  It was a Vermonter, I think the most outstanding Vermont U.S. Senator of the 20th century, who stood on the floor of this body--a quintessential conservative--Republican Ralph Flanders of Vermont, who introduced a motion of censure against Joseph McCarthy, the late Senator from Wisconsin. Joseph McCarthy ran roughshod for too long over the first amendment of the United States, and lives and careers were ruined because of his accusations. Ralph Flanders stood up and called a halt to that. Then other Senators came forward and joined with him. That reign was over.  I would say to anyone who visits the United States, from whatever country, if you want to guarantee a democracy, guarantee two things: Guarantee the freedom of speech, including the freedom to say things that might be unpopular at the moment because you may find within a few years they will be the popular ones; and, secondly, guarantee the right to practice any religion you want, or none, if you want. Because if you protect those two rights, you protect diversity. If you protect diversity in your country, you protect democracy.  I say that those who have opposed this constitutional amendment are not doing it because they lack concern for victims' rights. Decent and sincere people in both parties who serve in this Chamber respect victims' rights, but many of us oppose this amendment. I support crime victims' rights. I do not support a victims' rights constitutional amendment.  The issue before the Senate is whether to amend the U.S. Constitution--and almost double the length of the entire Bill of Rights--by adding a complex listing of constitutional victims' rights and limitations that may diminish the Constitution and do little to protect victims. It is not like passing a commemorative resolution.  Do we have to pass constitutional amendments to prove we care about people? We care about victims, but we also care about mothers, immigrants, workers, farmers, hospital patients, the young, the old, artists, journalists, scientists, nature lovers, and families.  We have heard complaints in this Chamber more than a few times about ``group entitlements.'' We are not going to have a constitutional amendment for every group.  Stuart Taylor recently wrote in the National Journal about this amendment. He wrote:       Most of us agree, of course, that prosecutors and judges      should be nice to crime victims (as they usually are). Most      of us also agree that parents should be nice to their      children. But would we adopt a constitutional amendment      declaring, ``Parents shall be nice to their children''? Or      ``Parents shall give their children reasonable notice and an      opportunity to be heard before deciding whether and how to      punish older children who have pushed them around''? Would we      leave it to the courts to define the meaning of terms like      ``reasonable'' and ``nice''?       A ban on spanking, perhaps? A minimum of one candy bar per      day? Would we let the courts override all state and federal      laws that conflict with their interpretations?       We don't need constitutional amendments to embody our broad      agreement on such general principles. And we should leave it      to the states (and Congress) to detail rules for applying      such principles to the messy realities of life.  There is no precedent in a national constitution for a victims' rights amendment. But there is precedent for treating constitutional provisions as group entitlements. For most of the 20th century, there was a nation that rejoiced in criticizing America for not caring about the rights of various groups of law-abiding people because we did not have such provisions in our Constitution. That nation had special constitutional provisions for mothers, immigrants, workers, farmers, hospital patients, the young, the old, artists, journalists, scientists, nature lovers, and families.  I would have brought a copy of its 1977 constitution along with me today if I could carry it. But some of our visitors today know that country is no longer here, the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Back then, I felt confident that Mr. Madison and his compatriots had done a better job of drafting a Constitution than Mr. Lenin, Mr. Stalin, or Mr. Brezhnev, and I am no less proud to be an American today. Madison, Jefferson, Washington, and the other founders understood three key lessons other countries are only learning now, 200 years later.  First, in a democracy, it is better to have a short constitution everyone can read and understand rather than a long one full of symbolic declarations, legalese, and procedural details. I hold the Constitution, including the Bill of Rights and the Declaration of Independence in this little booklet.  The distinguished senior Senator from New York mentioned a country we all respect, a democracy, France, which amended its Constitution so many times to fit in every single little thing they could possibly think of so that, as the story goes, in the libraries they do not file it under ``constitution,'' they file it under ``periodicals.'' Well, I do not want that to be the U.S. Constitution.  Secondly, in a free society, the purpose of a constitution is to constrain the government, to establish a government of limited powers, with the rest of the powers to the people, not a government of expanding responsibilities. Jefferson and Madison trusted to the States and the American people to care for the rights of victims of crime and of other misfortunes by means of the democratic process and by using the tool at hand to solve problems as they arose. They did not mandate a set of procedures for relief of every problem by calling them rights and then tacking them on to the Constitution. Instead, they reserved the Constitution for the protection of the people from the government itself.  Thirdly, in a nation of ordinary practical people, what is needed are practical responses to practical problems, not symbols of concern that at the end of the day are empty. Madison and Jefferson designed the original Bill of Rights to respond to actual government abuses such as suppression of unpopular speech or unpopular religion or unpopular newspapers, that the States and the Federal Government could not be otherwise trusted to remedy in the normal course of events.  Likewise, the Reconstruction Amendments did not enact a long litany of procedural rights without substance. Instead, they responded to a real, practical history of abuse by State governments of the rights of African-Americans. Even then our Nation was shamefully slow in implementing the anti-slavery amendments.  The proposed amendment under consideration is fundamentally misconceived. It would be the most procedurally complex provision of the entire Constitution, within just a few words of doubling the length of the entire Bill of Rights. Every school child, every senior citizen, every American can pick up this Constitution and read it and understand it. That is the beauty of it. That is the strength of it. That is why a quarter of a billion people live in such freedom.  We have referred to the last American precedent for a constitutional amendment to increase the power of government over law-abiding citizens. That was prohibition. It was well intentioned but, my word, what a disaster. It ended up staining the reputation of Senator Volstead and others who championed its cause. It was so ill suited to the framework of our Constitution that it bears the distinction of being the only constitutional amendment that had to be repealed.  I still remember the stories I was told as a child, many in Vermont, of good, upright citizens who prospered greatly during prohibition, perhaps because of the fortuitous aspect of our geographical location bordering on Canada.  If I could digress for a moment, we have a large lake in the northern part of Vermont, Lake Memphremagog. My wife was born on the shores of Lake Memphremagog, as she quickly points out, on the Vermont side. Her parents,of French Canadian descent moved there to take up life as new American citizens. She became a first-generation American.  Lake Memphremagog is a magnificent lake that is half in Vermont and half in Canada. During prohibition time, some of the farmers who had little farms, one or two cows and a falling down barn along the lake, had very expensive Chris-Craft speedboats. I mention this because the local Customs official had a slower boat with an outboard motor. Every evening about dusk, these farmers would go out with their high-powered speed boats and they would have their fishing rod and a couple worms and they would head out across the lake toward Canada to go fishing, their speedboats riding high.  About 2 o'clock in the morning, you would hear this awful roar across the lake as several of these came back, obviously the ``fishing'' having been very successful because the boats are now riding much, much lower. You can imagine the chagrin of the poor Customs agent who had to try to fulfill the prohibition provision of the Constitution, as he wondered which one of these fishing boats he should try to intercept, knowing he could not intercept any of them because he could not catch them.  Whether it was because of the ``fishing'' or not, for at least a generation thereafter, the two most popular brands of alcohol in Vermont were the two that are also the most popular in the Province of Quebec, right across the lake.  As I said, I digress. But prohibition caused such a disrespect for the law. It really made us look foolish, but it took forever to change it because it was in the Constitution. If we made the mistake of doing it as a statute, we could have amended it. We could have changed it within a year. Everybody knew it was not working. Everybody knew it was increasing the power of organized crime. Everybody knew it was bringing about corruption and bribery and everything else. But worse than that, a democracy can enforce its laws only if people respect the laws. A democracy can work only if we know that these laws are fair and these laws are just.  We do not have a police officer in everybody's house. We do not have a police officer on every corner. We expect people to obey the laws. But if they have no respect for them, then they do not. In all the years it took to repeal this, for over a decade, the laws in this country and the people's respect for the laws of this country diminished every single year. Nobody could do anything about it because it takes so long to repeal a constitutional amendment.  So let us look at statutes when we can. Let us think of article V of the Constitution, which says you amend only when necessary.  Last, but by no means least, the proposed amendment is not a practical response to a practical problem. Many States are ahead of the Federal Government in protecting victims' rights. Recent years have seen huge advances in protection of victims' rights in State constitutions and State legislation, in the provision of restitution or other compensation where practical, and in improvement of law enforcement resources and techniques to ensure proper regard for victims.  While Congress has been focusing its attention on more than 60 drafts of a constitutional amendment on victims' rights, it has actually slowed us down from doing real improvement to the way crime victims are treated in Federal courts and by Federal prosecutors. Our legislative achievements of the period from 1994 through 1997 have not been matched in the last several years. I fear this debate on the proposed constitutional amendment will be in lieu of consideration of scores of significant legislative proposals introduced by Senators on both sides of the aisle to help victims.  Violent crime is a serious practical problem in our society--far more than it was even when I was a prosecutor. As a parent, as a grandparent, that troubles me greatly. But there is not a fundamental problem--certainly not one requiring a rigid, one-size-fits-all set of constitutionally mandated procedures--in how the States treat victims of violent crimes today.  We have visitors in the gallery today from Russia, the successor to the former Soviet Union. The old Soviet Constitution demanded the obedience of Russians. It really was not very subtle about it. Article 59 declared that every citizen was ``obliged to observe the Constitution and comply with the standards of socialist conduct.''  Well, the U.S. Constitution does not command; instead, it counsels humility. It is humbling to consider the great minds that drafted it, its clarity and simplicity in laying down a framework to protect law-abiding people by ensuring limited, democratic government. It is also humbling to think how it has stood the test of time. It remains extraordinary what was achieved in 4 short months in Philadelphia in 1787, when communication meant walking from one building to another to talk to somebody, or sending a letter by horseback. In 4 short months, look at what they wrote.  By contrast, we have been waiting twice that long for the House-Senate conference on the juvenile crime legislation to meet and complete its work--something that could really help victims of crime in this country, something that could be done now and something that could be sent down to the President and signed into law and it would be the law of the land immediately. But we do not meet because the gun lobby said do not meet.  We ought to be very slow in this Chamber to presume that we know better than the founders how to balance the power of government and the rights of the accused. We should be reluctant to presume that we can draft a one-size-fits-all set of detailed procedural rules that will work to protect different people who are victims of different crimes in cases in different States--the kind of constitutional micromanagement of the judicial process the framers were too wise to attempt. These 400-odd words of the 63rd draft of this proposed amendment do not fit with the size and style, the limited Government vision, or the practical approach of the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights.  I hope when we finish this debate all Senators will join in efforts to improve victims' rights through the States and through Federal legislation.  I see the distinguished Senator from Delaware on the floor. As chairman and as the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Biden has worked very hard on legislation to help victims of all kinds of crime. The distinguished Senator from Delaware has helped write laws that can take effect and have money and teeth in them to help victims. I have done some, as have others. Usually, we join in bipartisan efforts to do it. But they have been pieces of legislation that, once signed into law, we could watch. We could see if they were working, and if they did, fine, we could expand them and give them more money. If they did not work, we could change them. We cannot do that with a constitutional amendment.  I ask those who are for victims' rights to support congressional action on S. 934, the Crime Victims Assistance Act.  Mr. President, we have editorials in opposition to this constitutional amendment from the Asheville Citizen-Times, the Baltimore Sun, the Chicago Tribune, the Herald, the Philadelphia Inquirer, the Richmond Times-Dispatch, the San Francisco Chronicle, the San Francisco Examiner, the San Jose Mercury News, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, the St. Petersburg Times, the Washington Times, the Collegiate Times, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette; and the South Bend Tribune.  I ask unanimous consent that several of these articles be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Times, Feb. 15, 2000]                      An Uncluttered Constitution                            (By Bruce Fein)       What keeps our Constitution sacred and accessible to the      ordinary citizen is majestic brevity and a confinement to      essentials.       Amendments should thus be limited to issues of great and      enduring moment that cannot be safely entrusted to popular      majorities. The pending Victims' Rights Amendment, under      active consideration by the House and Senate and lukewarmly      supported by the Clinton administration, falls short of that      historically exacting standard.       The amendment, House Joint Resolution 64, would dictate an      array of victims' rights in federal or state criminal or      auxiliary proceedings. The motivation is irreproachable:     to guarantee crime victims a minimum opportunity to be heard      or to be otherwise involved when the disposition of their      predators in question. But good motivation, without more,      does not justify a constitutional coronation. If it did, the      1964 Civil Rights Act, the 1965 Voting Rights Act, the 1968      Fair Housing Act, Title IX of the Higher Education Act, the      American With Disabilities Act, and an endless list of      companion federal laws would be elevated to constitutional      status and the document would smack more of Edward Gibbon's      ``Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'' than of Lincoln's      Gettysburg Address.       VRA crusaders have cobbled together an assortment of      unpersuasive reasons for their constitutional cause, as      though adding zero to zero repetitively may eventually equal      something. It is said criminal defendants and prisoners enjoy      constitutional rights that trump victims' rights enumerated      in scores of statutes and state constitutions. But nothing in      the constitutional text or United States Supreme Court      precedents even hints at a conflict with victims' rights      that command lower statutory status: the right to notice      and to have views considered in prosecutorial, sentencing,      parade, or commutation decisions and to attend criminal      trials. Amendment proponents have searched in vain for a      single court decision that supports their fretting.       Crime victims have demonstrated stunning success in      majoritarian politics who need no constitutional protection      from potentially hostile legislation. As a chief sponsor of      the Amendment, Rep. Steve Chabot, Ohio Republican, testified      last Thursday before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the      Constitution, ``In 1982, California became the first state to      pass a Victims' Rights Amendment to its constitution. Since      that time, 32 states, including my home state of Ohio, have      passed similar amendments . . . ratified [by an average of]      79 percent of the vote in state-wide referendums.''       That is no surprise. Crime victims evoke almost universal      sympathy, and no one campaigns boasting, ``I will vote      against victims' rights.''       Amendment apostles also urge that state laws are      disrespected by state judges or prosecutors. But that is      unvariably true of new laws during their childhoods. Legal      training and habits are customarily backward-looking, and      legal bureaucracies lie midpoint between sclerosis and rigor      mortis. But troglodyte judges, prosecutors, and clerks will      die or retire; their replacements will be victims' rights      enthusiasts indoctrinated in the new gospel. The problem of      inattention to state or victims' rights laws will solve      itself, in the same way that unionization rights flowered in      the legal system in the 1930s after decades of crabbed      interpretations and applications of statutes.       Amendment champions retort that victims' rights would      command more prosecutorial and judicial respect if enshrined      in the Constitution. But prosecutors and judges take oaths to      defend state laws every bit as much as they vow to enforce      the Constitution. If they would honor the first more in the      breach than in the observance, the second would fare no      better. History also speaks volumes. The 1866 Civil Rights      Act protecting freedom leaped into the Constitution with the      1868 14th Amendment, but the civil rights of blacks were      routinely ignored by courts, including the United States      Supreme Court, for almost a century during the ugly era of      Jim Crow. Similarly, did the Roman Catholic creed induce      greater compliance with the proclamation of Papal      infallibility in 1870?       Victims' rights paladins wrongly equate their cause with      the constitutional protections of persons accused of crime.      But criminal defendants, unlike crime victims, are generally      pariahs who need safeguards against an infuriated public      clamoring for instant justice. Further, what is at stake for      the accused is his life or liberty, the most precious of our      natural rights.                           *   *   *   *   *       Every constitutional amendment dents our system of      federalism. It removes an issue from the agendas of state      governments that can more closely tailor solutions that      satisfy constituents and serve as laboratories for sister      states and the federal government without risk to the entire      nation. Errors can be corrected by simple legislation, which      is nimble compared to overcoming a constitutional misstep,      like the Prohibition Amendment. Deference to stale choice      additionally offers citizens greater opportunities to      participate directly in the responsibilities of self-     government, indispensable to sustaining a robust democratic      culture.       In sum, the Victims' Rights Amendment has nothing to      commend and much to deplore.                                  ____           [From the San Francisco Chronicle, April 25, 2000]             A Victims' Rights Plan That Goes Much Too Far       Victims of crime deserve consideration and compassion, but      a constitutional amendment giving them a new category of      ``rights'' goes too far.       The U.S. Senate will attempt this week to alter the      Constitution again, this time with a Victims' Rights      Amendment drafted on the premise that victims should have      more say about the trials and dispositions of defendants.       Specifically, it would give victims the right to attend all      proceedings, to make their views known about sentencing and      plea arrangements, to be notified whenever an offender is      released from custody, to demand a speedy trial and to get      restitution from the offending party.       Considering the often deep pain they suffer, victims      deserve to be heard and protected by the criminal justice      system, but tinkering with the Constitution is no way to do      it. Many of these concerns can and have been addressed      through legislation, which can be amended as problems and      unintended consequences are identified.       One of the problems with this amendment is that its      definition of ``victim'' is too vague, creating a financially      onerous and otherwise impossible mandate. For example, in the      Oklahoma City bombing, who would the victims be? The office      workers who survived the bombing, the family members and      friends of the hundreds killed or maimed, or anybody in town      still suffering the horrifying aftermath?       As such, all would have to be notified about trial      proceedings, have the right to speak and to push for specific      prosecution. And if they didn't agree on sentencing or the      way the case was adjudicated, what would the court do then?       Meanwhile, advocates for battered women dread what would      happen if a women is arrested for responding to domestic      abuse--namely that the abuser could become the victim with      rights to oppose her bail and seek restitution. Perhaps      that's why a slew of victims' rights groups is among those      most opposed to the amendment.       Although a grand gesture, this proposed constitutional      change is clumsy and cumbersome, destroying the very core of      our justice system--the right to a speedy trial and the      presumption of innocence. Both Congress and state      legislatures have the ability to strengthen victims' rights      without trying to alter the principles of justice set forth      in the U.S. Constitution.                                  ____           [From the San Francisco Examiner, April 14, 2000]                     No Victims in the Constitution       Dianne Feinstein is wrong on this one. The usually astute      Democratic U.S. senator from California is leading a campaign      to get a victims' rights amendment added to the federal      Constitution.       Along with Sen. John Kyl, R-Ariz., and 40 other senators,      she is sponsoring legislation that would allow the states to      vote on ratification of the 28th amendment. The votes of 67      senators are needed for passage. Three-quarters of the states      must ratify the amendment before it goes into effect.       Victims' rights is an idea that's seductive by its very      simplicity. Of course victims should have rights. Who can      deny that? But enshrining them in the Constitution is a feel-     good exercise of dubious value that carries potential harm.       ``The Constitution,'' argues Feinstein, ``gives 15 specific      rights to the accused, but victims have no basic rights under      the Constitution.''       That misses the point of what the Constitution and the Bill      of Rights are about. The rights enumerated are protections      for individuals against the awesome power of the government.      They are not intended to referee fights between citizens or      redress the grievances of victims of private action, no      matter how terrible the consequences.       Littering the Constitution with other matters cheapens it      and opens the door to inclusion of the flotsam and jetsam of      some citizens' oddball desires. If you think this overstates      the case, just look at the junk foisted on the California      Constitution by an overactive initiative process.       This is not to say there shouldn't be a law. In fact,      legislation is exactly where victims' rights belongs.       As a bill in Congress, the planks of victims' rights would      be unobjectionable. Consider the constituent parts of the      amendment. Among other features, it would give some 9 million      victims of violent crimes and their families the right to      notice of criminal proceedings in their cases and the right      to attend them; the right to testify or submit statements at      trials, parole hearings and other proceedings; the right of      notice if the felon escapes or is released, and the right of      restitution from the perpetrator of the crime.       So far, 32 states have passed legislation or constitutional      amendments specifying victims' rights. But Feinstein      complains that until the U.S. Constitution is changed, a      defendant's rights trump a victim's rights when there's a      conflict between the two.       We're glad she's not also proposing to change the standard      of criminal guilt from ``beyond a reasonable doubt'' to a      ``preponderance of the evidence.'' Presumably that would also      make trials more fair for victims. But the American system of      criminal justice is built on the sane principle that letting      a possibly guilty defendant go free is a thousand times      preferable to convicting an innocent person.       The 13 men released from death row in Illinois after new      exonerating evidence was uncovered would be glad to tell Sen.      Feinstein why legal protections for the accused are splendid      ideas. Anyway, the guts of a sensible victims' rights program      wouldn't conflict with legal protections for defendants.       Victims and their families sometimes do get poor treatment      from prosecutors and courts. Trying to remedy that by      amending the Constitution is a grandstand play that generates      a lot of publicity. But it is unnecessary and wrong. It would      dilute the time-     tested and trusted document that defines relations in this      nation between citizens and their government.       Don't make us all victims of an ill-considered crusade.                                  ____            [From the San Jose Mercury News, April 20, 2000]     Victims of Crime Don't Need Congress' Constitutional Meddling                           (By Joanne Jacobs)       You have the right to remain silent, when accused of a      crime.       You have the right to speak up, when victimized by a      criminal. California and 31 other states have passed victims'      rights amendments to their constitutions; all the rest have      statutes.       So why do we need to amend the Constitution of the United      States of America to include a Crime Victims' Rights      Amendment?       Because it's an election year.       Next week, on April 25, the Senate will debate the victims'      amendment, sponsored by California Senator Dianne Feinstein,      a Democrat, and Arizona Senator John Kyl, a Republican. The      vote may be April 27 or 28.       Some 46 senators have signed on to the bill, but it will      take a two-thirds majority (67) and two-thirds of the House      (291) for passage, plus three-fourths of state legislatures      to ratify.       The Constitution shields Americans--especially the      unpopular--from governmental power.       The amendment grants rights to a politically popular and      sympathetic group, victims. But no legislation can guarantee      sensitivity by prosecutors and judges or competence by clerks      assigned to notify victims about changing court dates. No      amendment or law can give Americans what we really want:      freedom from killers, rapists and robbers.       Instead, the amendment would federalize rights already      offered by the states: Victims must be notified about bail,      plea bargains, trials, sentencing and parole hearings, and      about a prisoners' release or escape. They're entitled to a      restitution order, which is usually uncollectible.       Feinstein-Kyl also includes ``consideration of the interest      of the victim that any trial be free from unreasonable      delay,'' which means the victim could ask for a speedy trial      but the judge wouldn't have to grant it.       Victims would have a right to attend the entire trial, even      if they're going to be called as witnesses and might tailor      their testimony to fit an earlier witness's statement.       However, the judge could decide the defendant's      constitutional right to a fair trial outweighs the victim's      constitutional right to attend.       Other than adding a symbolic statement--``Pols (hurt)      Victims''--to the U.S. Constitution, this wouldn't change      much. Except to provide more ways to file lawsuits, which      isn't going to make justice any swifter.       Both presidential candidates are pro-victim.       ``I will lead the fight to pass a Victims' Rights Amendment      to the United States Constitution--so our justice system puts      victims and their families first again,'' Al Gore said in a      Boston speech last July.       Apparently, he hasn't started yet. Gore's ``Fighting      Crime'' agenda on his www.gore2000.org site doesn't mention      victims rights, and the vice president hasn't endorsed the      Feinstein-Kyl amendment.       The Clinton administration is wavering on the amendment,      worried about interfering with prosecutors, denying      defendants' rights and impinging on the president's power to      grant executive clemency. (If President Gore wanted to pardon      ex-President Clinton's perjury, who'd be the victim: Paula      Jones? Ken Starr? 275 million Americans?)       George W. Bush ``strongly supports'' the Feinstein-Kyl      amendment. It's not on his Website, www.georgewbush.com      however; there's no issue statement on crime.       Most victim's groups are for it, but not all.       Bud Welch, whose daughter was killed in the 1995 Oklahoma      City bombing, chairs Citizens for the Fair Treatment of      Victims, which opposes the amendment. Emotional relatives      might hamper prosecutors, Welch argues. Many relatives of      victims objected to a plea bargain made to secure testimony      of an accomplice of Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, Welch      Writes. ``Had this amendment been in place, the judge may      have refused the plea agreement, making it significantly more      difficult for the government to convict McVeigh and      Nichols.''       Furthermore, consulting all the family members of all the      victims--168 were killed and many more injured--would have      created chaos, delaying the trial.       Feinstein cites the Oklahoma City bombing as proving the      need for the amendment. The judge told victims' families they      couldn't sit through the trial if they wanted to testify at      the sentencing hearing. When Congress passed a law allowing      it, the judge said the Constitution, guaranteeing a fair      trial to the defendants, trumped the law.       This is Feinstein's only example of a conflict that would      require a constitutional amendment.       The amendment also gives victims rights before a court has      determined they're really victims, noted Robert P. Mosteller,      a Duke law professor, in testimony before the House Judiciary      Committee.       Imagine the Rodney King case, with no videotape, Mosteller      said. The police officers charge King attacked them. As      victims, the officers could ``sit in the courtroom during the      testimony of all other witnesses as a matter of federal      constitutional right. This provision would permit the true      perpetrators of the crime to coordinate their false version      of the facts'' and convict the real victim.       A judge could weigh witness-victims' right to attend and      the defendant's right to a fair trial, Feinstein argues. The      defendant might win.       Or be convicted by tainted testimony, leading to more      appeals.       It's not worth it.       My bottom line is simple: Don't mess with the U.S.      Constitution. Since the Bill of Rights was added 209 years      ago, only 17 amendments have been added to the Constitution.      It should not be changed unless absolutely necessary. It's      not necessary in this case, not even close. Leave the      Constitution alone.                                  ____               [From the Chicago Tribune, April 25, 2000]                    The Wrong Way on Victims' Rights       Some national issues of grave importance can be dealt with      adequately only by amending the United States Constitution.      That was true of slavery, women's suffrage, and the income      tax. But the same can't be said about the treatment of crime      victims.       Their needs are real and worthy of concern. The Victims'      Rights Amendment due for a Senate vote this week, however, is      overdoing a good thing.       Every state has a law or constitutional provision assuring      that crime victims may attend judicial proceedings that      concern them, be notified of the impending release of their      attackers, sue the offender for restitution, and the like.      Many of these measures are relatively young and, according to      victims' rights advocates, have not fulfilled the hopes      lodged in them.       That's an argument for better funding and more meticulous      implementation. It's grounds for electing prosecutors and      judges who will take them seriously. It's also grounds for      realistic expectations: Some goals are not likely to be      realized no matter what. Restitution, for example, is largely      a vain hope simply because most criminals are poor and thus      lack the money to pay it.       The proposed constitutional amendment, however, threatens      to do more harm than good. Its guarantees could sometimes      conflict with the rights of defendants, as when it gives      victims the right to demand a speedy trial. In such      instances, the suspect's right to defend himself could be      compromised, increasing the risk that innocent people will go      to jail. Or the defendant's right could trump--in which case      the new amendment would amount to little more than empty      symbolism.       In either case, the decision will be made by judges, not      legislators or voters. The advantage of protecting victims'      rights by law is that different states can experiment with      different approaches to see which are most effective and      affordable. Once this amendment is entrenched in the federal      Constitution, though, the entire nation will have to live      with a ``one size fits all'' approach--and we may find that      one size fits none.       Someone once said that a vice is often just a virtue taken      too far. The Senate shouldn't make that mistake on victims'      rights.
