If he has questions about Mr. Cole, let him argue them, debate them, set a time, and then vote yes or vote no. Particular issues come up in the Senate, such as nominees, and Republicans hold them up so they never come to a vote. Then the Senators can take any position they want to back home.  All I am saying is that we must vote yes or no and not maybe. We have too many issues in the Senate, whether it is tax matters, don't ask, don't tell, or nomination, where we continue to delay a vote.  I know the distinguished Senator from Alabama has never hesitated to vote yes or no in committee, and I commend him on that. Many times we agree, and a number of times we disagree, but he states his position as a yes or no. He and I have voted on this issue in committee and stated a position. I just hope everybody else can as well.  I yield the floor.
