Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4429) to require the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology to assist small and medium-sized manufacturers and other such businesses to successfully integrate and utilize electronic commerce technologies and business practices, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                               H.R. 4429       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Electronic Commerce      Enhancement Act of 2000''.                      TITLE I--ELECTRONIC COMMERCE     SEC. 101. FINDINGS.       The Congress finds the following:       (1) Commercial transactions on the Internet, whether retail      business-to-customer or business-to-business, are commonly      called electronic commerce.       (2) In the United States, business-to-business transactions      between small and medium-sized manufacturers and other such      businesses and their suppliers is rapidly growing, as many of      these businesses begin to use Internet connections for      supply-chain management, after-sales support, and payments.       (3) Small and medium-sized manufacturers and other such      businesses play a critical role in the United States economy.       (4) Electronic commerce can help small and medium-sized      manufacturers and other such businesses develop new products      and markets, interact more quickly and efficiently with      suppliers and customers, and improve productivity by      increasing efficiency and reducing transaction costs and      paperwork. Small and medium-sized manufacturers and other      such businesses who fully exploit the potential of electronic      commerce activities can use it to interact with customers,      suppliers, and the public, and for external support functions      such as personnel services and employee training.       (5) The National Institute of Standards and Technology's      Manufacturing Extension Partnership program has a successful      record of assisting small and medium-sized manufacturers and      other such businesses. In addition, the Manufacturing      Extension Partnership program, working with the Small      Business Administration, successfully assisted United States      small enterprises in remediating their Y2K computer problems.       (6) A critical element of electronic commerce is the      ability of different electronic commerce systems to exchange      information. The continued growth of electronic commerce will      be enhanced by the development of private voluntary      interoperability standards and testbeds to ensure the      compatibility of different systems.
