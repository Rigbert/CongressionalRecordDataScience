DORGAN. The Senator describes it exactly. It is the difference between one approach that is toothless and an approach that has some teeth to it that says we are going to make this work; we are going to offer some basic protections to patients.  I have a poster I was going to show today. I will show it later in the day. It is a poster of a young boy in a wheelchair named Ethan who was denied treatment by the HMO. He was born with very difficult problems that impaired the use of his limbs. He was denied treatment because a doctor who had never seen this young patient decided that the patient had a 50-percent chance of being able to walk by age 5, and a 50-percent chance of being able to walk if he gets the appropriate therapy is ``not significant.'' This is from a doctor who did not see the patient. It is not significant that this person might have a 50-percent chance of being able to walk, therefore we deny coverage.  That is the kind of thing that is happening time and time again. I say to the Senator from Illinois, I have talked about this woman who falls off a cliff, drops 40 feet, fractures her bones in three places, is knocked unconscious, taken by medevac helicopter out to a hospital, is brought into the emergency room unconscious, survives, and later is told: We will not pay the emergency room bill because you didn't have prior approval for emergency room treatment. This is a woman unconscious, brought into the emergency room for help. That is the kind of thing that ought to stop. Does she have a right through her health care coverage to emergency room treatment when she is knocked unconscious from a fall in the mountains? The answer is yes, of course. We demand that right be given that patient in this Patients' Bill of Rights.
