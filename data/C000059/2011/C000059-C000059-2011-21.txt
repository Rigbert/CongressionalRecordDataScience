Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to a group of individuals--heroes--who are receiving the recognition and honor they deserve for their service to our country. Operation Recognition is operated by the Riverside County Office of Education with assistance from the Riverside County Department of Veterans' Services. The program awards high school diplomas to veterans who missed completing high school due to military service in World War II, the Korean War, or the Vietnam War, or due to internment in WWII Japanese-American relocation camps.  A recognition ceremony will be held on November 9, 2011, for the following individuals who received their high school diplomas through Operation Recognition:  Juan Abarca, Alfred Aguilar; Virgil Edward Archer; George Van Ashley; Clayton M. Babbitt; Thomas Jones Barber; Webster W. Brahams, Jr.; Claude Chastain, Jr.; Lonny Ross Ciinklaw; Willie B. Exson; Rick Farrell; Michael J. Federico; Jack Garvin Gale; Dwayne L. Gallo; Raul P. Garcia; Daniel Keith Gibson; William Onicten Gutierrez; Clarence Weldon Hart; Harley James Henson; Drexal Q. Jackson; Joseph F. Laturno; Gordon Peter Martens; Charles E. Murphy; Johnnie D. Riley; Lold B. LeRoy Sadler; Eric Schlitz; Mark D. Switzer; Larry Joe Wade; William Franklin Williams; and Otis Lee Wilson.  Our country owes a debt of gratitude to all the above recipients for their service and sacrifice. I salute all the above individuals and congratulate them on receiving their high school diploma.                          ____________________
