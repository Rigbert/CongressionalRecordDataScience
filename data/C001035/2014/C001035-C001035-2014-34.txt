President. I wish to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Roosevelt Campobello International Park. This beautiful and historic park preserves the summer home that Franklin Delano Roosevelt enjoyed both as a boy and as president. It was established by treaty between the United States and Canada and is the only memorial to an American president on Canadian soil.  The 2,800-acre park on Campobello Island, New Brunswick, was opened on August 20, 1964, by Canadian Prime Minister Lester Pearson and American President Lyndon Johnson. It is jointly owned and managed by both countries and is a beautiful and historic testament to a legacy of friendship. Like all true friendships, the friendship commemorated at Roosevelt Campobello International Park is based not upon expedience or self-interest, but upon shared values.  It is a legacy of friendship between two men: one of America's greatest presidents and one of Canada's greatest prime ministers. Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Mackenzie King could not have been more dissimilar in personality--one gregarious and outgoing, the other reticent and intensely private--yet they saw beyond the superficial traits and into the depths of character. Together, they led their nations out of the Great Depression. Together, they led their nations through the Second World War and made North America the arsenal of democracy so crucial to victory. Although only one lived to see the peace, together they forged an alliance that has allowed that peace to endure.  It is a legacy of friendship between two communities. By land, Campobello Island is accessible only from Lubec, ME, our Nation's easternmost town, via the FDR Memorial Bridge, itself a stunning example of international cooperation and friendship. The people of eastern Maine and western New Brunswick share a past, a present, and the future. They are bound together by a rugged yet rewarding way of life, by personal and family ties, by commerce and by mutual assistance. They earn their livelihoods from the land and from the sea, and they care for this special place so that those livelihoods may continue for generations to come.  It was at Campobello, his ``beloved island,'' that young Franklin Roosevelt learned to guide a sailboat through the challenging Lubec Narrows and developed the inner strength and self-reliance that enabled him to meet any challenge. Among the proud and determined people on both shores of the narrows, he felt the power of committed individuals working together in common cause.  In 1933, during his first return visit as President, with First Lady Eleanor at his side, FDR recalled his happy childhood memories and again thanked the islanders who taught him to sail. Then, in words that still ring true today, he described the region as, ``The finest example of friendship between Nations--permanent friendship between nations--that we can possibly have.''  The United States and Canada share the world's longest undefended border, a common history and culture. In trade, we are each other's best customers. We are, as one of the park's permanent exhibits declares, ``Good Neighbours--Best Friends.''  George Washington wrote that, ``True friendship is a plant of slow growth, and must undergo and withstand the shocks of adversity.'' The friendship between the United States and Canada is the hardiest of plants with the deepest of roots. The adversities are but minor shocks; they are no match for the values of freedom, human rights and the rule of law that bind us together.  Those values are the foundation of this legacy, and they are our guarantee that this friendship will endure. They are what make the 50th anniversary of Roosevelt Campobello International Park an event so worthy of celebration.                          ____________________
