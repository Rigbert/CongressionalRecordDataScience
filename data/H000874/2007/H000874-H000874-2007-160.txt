Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his question. I know it's a very important one for his Members and ours.  We had hoped, as you know, when I inherited or succeeded, however one looks at it, to the scheduling authority from Mr. Boehner, Mr. Boehner had scheduled October 3, I believe, it may have been the 6th, October 3 or 6 as the ending date. I would have hoped Mr. Boehner was accurate in that assessment, but I thought it was not realistic at that point in time. So I was more pessimistic but apparently not pessimistic enough.  I scheduled October 26 as our target date for adjournment. It seems that we are not going to make that. I am very hopeful, and I'm not going to bet on it, but I'm going to plan on November 16 being our last day.  Senator Reid, the leader of the Senate, has indicated that they will be out the last 2 weeks of November. From my experience serving here, it doesn't get better just because you get into December, that we would be able to adjourn sine die until the second session of the Congress, probably to begin the 3rd week in January, although the Speaker and I need to discuss that, and I want to discuss it also with you and Mr. Boehner. But my thought would be that we would come back the 3rd week in January.  In addition to that, because we are not going to adjourn sine die on the 26th of October, which I had hoped but which is not realistic at this point in time, I had scheduled the four Fridays of October to meet. I want all the Members to know, and I discussed this with the whip earlier in the week, that we will not be meeting on the 5th of October, that Friday, nor will we be meeting on the 19th so that, because of Columbus Day, the Members will have from Thursday late afternoon, and I don't commit to any particular time on Thursday, the 4th, until Tuesday the 9th at 6:30 p.m. before we come back.
