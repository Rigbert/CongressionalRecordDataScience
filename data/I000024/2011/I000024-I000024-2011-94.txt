President, I have introduced a bill, S. 1085. I have some cosponsors, including Senator Snowe from Maine. The bill addresses something that has become very controversial. It is certainly not partisan in any way. It is more geographical; that is, I have been one who has been opposed to the corn ethanol mandates ever since they first came out. I opposed the 2007 Energy bill because it doubled the corn-based ethanol mandates, despite the mounting questions surrounding ethanol's compatibility with existing engines, its environmental sustainment, as well as transportational infrastructure needs. I can remember back when they first did it, all the environmentalists were saying corn ethanol will be the answer. They were all for it, but they are against it now. They all recognize that corn ethanol is bad for the environment.  Now, the three areas I personally have a problem with are, No. 1, the environment; No. 2, you have a compatibility situation. You talk to any of the farmers, any of the marine people, they will tell you it is very destructive to the small engines. Thirdly, everyone is concerned with the high price of fuel, with the fact that corn ethanol is not good for your mileage. Kris Kiser of the Outdoor Power Equipment Manufacturers testified before the Environment and Public Works Committee on ethanol's compatibility or lack of compatibility with more than 200 million legacy engines across America which are not designed to run on certain blends of ethanol. I will quote her testimony before our committee. She said:       In the marine industry, if your machine fails or your      engine fails and you are 30 miles offshore, this is a serious      problem. If you are in a snow machine and it fails in the      wilderness this is a serious problem.  Consumers complain about the decreasing fuel efficiency around corn ethanol, containing 67 percent of the Btu of gasoline. We call it clear gas. This is a good time to say we are not talking about biomass. We are only talking about corn ethanol. Another problem I have in my State of Oklahoma is we are a big cattle State and that has driven up the cost of feedstock to a level that is not acceptable. According to the EPA, vehicles operating on E85 ethanol experience a 20-percent to 30-percent drop in miles per gallon due to ethanol's lower energy content. Consumer reports found that E85 resulted in a 27-percent drop in fuel.  As a result, you drive around Oklahoma--first of all, we are in Washington. It is my understanding there is no choice in Washington or Virginia or in Maryland and those areas. In my State of Oklahoma, we still have a choice, and the choice is very clear. The problem is the way this is set up, we will run into a barrier where they will no longer have clear gas available under the current formulas. For that reason, we have people who--at almost every station you see, the majority of the stations you see in Oklahoma, you have signs such as this: Ethanol free. 100 percent gasoline. This is all over the State of Oklahoma.  There is a solution to this problem, and it is one I have introduced in this bill. Before describing that, I think the most pressing issue of this so-called blend wall is that EISA mandated 15 billion gallons of corn-based ethanol by 2015, but today it is readily apparent that the country cannot physically absorb this much corn ethanol. It is too much, too fast. In Oklahoma, ethanol's blend wall has nearly eliminated consumer choice. The fuel blenders and gas station owners have little option but to sell ethanol-blended gasoline, despite strong consumer demand for clear gas. There is the consumer demand all over the State of Oklahoma.  What is the solution? I introduced a very simple, five-page bill. The bill would allow individual States to opt out of the mandate. It would require their State legislature wants this and they pass a resolution, it is signed by the governor, and they would be able to opt out. The State would pass a bill. It is signed by the Governor, stating its election to exercise this option. The Administrator of the EPA would then reduce the amount of the national corn ethanol mandate by the percentage amount of the gasoline consumed by this State.  This option nonparticipation would only apply to the corn portion of the RFS and would not affect any of the volumetric requirements of advanced biofuels. We are big in advanced biofuels in my State of Oklahoma, the various foundations, Oklahoma State University. We have switchgrass we are working on, and it is something we are all for. The bill actually redefines cellulosic biofuels as next generation biofuel. The previously defined cellulosic biofuel carveout is expanded to include algae and any nonethanol renewable fuel derived from renewable biomass. So this is something that is not going to be incompatible. It is going to be very compatible with our interest here. So for those people who say: We demand to have corn-based ethanol, you can have it. All this is is choice, and if we and the people of my State of Oklahoma want a choice of clear gas or corn ethanol, they should be able to do it. I honestly don't think there is a legitimate argument against that. I plan to try to get some cosponsors. I think my good friend from Florida might be interested in cosponsoring something such as this because this gives choice to the people of his State as well as my State.                                 ______                                       By
