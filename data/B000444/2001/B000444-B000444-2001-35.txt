 President, among the images of September 11th that we will never forget, are the pictures of the firefighters rushing into the buildings to help, as everyone else who was able was trying to get out to safety. At that moment, without discussion or explanation, an appreciation for the extraordinary service and leading citizenship of firefighters became a prominent and, I hope, permanent feature of our collective consciousness.  In my State of Delaware, we have a rich heritage of local fire companies serving our communities, a tradition of neighbors helping neighbors. And I rise today to honor one of those local departments, the Carlisle Fire Company, which serves the City of Milford, Delaware and which will celebrate its 200th anniversary in 2002.  Originally founded under charter from the State Legislature, as, simply, a ``Fire Fighting Organization,'' the company began its service in the spring of 1802, a full 90 years before the first water mains and fire hydrants were installed in Milford. A hand drawn hook-and-ladder was acquired, and was stored along with other equipment at a building owned by Mrs. Angeline Marshall, appropriately, on Water Street.  In 1915, the department reincorporated as the Milford Fire Company, and that same year, there was a 10-day fund drive which raised money to purchase a triple combination fire truck Milford's Truck No. 1. A second name change followed in 1918, to honor Paris T. Carlisle, a Milford resident and member and officer of the Fire Company, who was killed in France during World War I. In 1921, the Company broke ground to build its first fire station, and in 1923, after another successful fundraising drive, Truck No. 2 was purchased and Truck No. 1 refitted to better serve the community. Ground was broken for the current fire hall on Northwest Front Street in 1977, and as the folks in Milford will tell you with well-earned pride, they paid off and burned the mortgage in 1990. At about the same time, ambulance service was added.  From that hall on Front Street, the Carlisle Fire Company responds to more than 1,800 calls per year. With an active Ladies Auxiliary, founded in 1963 with Peggy Jester as its first president, and a Junior Member program, created by then-Chief Marvin Hitch in 1973, the Company is truly a center of community life in Milford. And it also has a special place in our statewide firefighting community; the Delaware Volunteer Firemen's Association (DVFA) was organized in Milford in February of 1921, and the first president was Charles E. Varney, who was also president of the Carlisle Fire Company. The Company has continued its leadership in statewide programs ever since.  It is my privilege to share some of the history and hopefully some of the spirit of the Carlisle Fire Company with my colleagues and with our fellow citizens today. We honor the Company's 200th anniversary, and the extraordinary commitment and service that it represents, with gratitude to local firefighters, our neighbors who are there when we need them most. Congratulations to President Francis Morris and Fire Chief Kevin Twilley, and to all the officers, members and friends of the Carlisle Fire Company again, with great respect and with thanks.                          ____________________
