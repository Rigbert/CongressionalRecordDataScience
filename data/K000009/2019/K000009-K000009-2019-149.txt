 Keystone Tailored Manufacturing will close by March. Approximately 150 employees will lose their jobs.  Keystone has made men's suits at the site since 2015. Before that, it was a Hugo Boss men's suit plant. Since 2010, workers fought to keep the facility from closing twice. There won't be a third time.  As Mark Milko, the area director for the Workers United union put it: ``It doesn't look like there is anything to fight to save.''  Madam Speaker, this company plans to shift these jobs to Canada. There they can save $15 a suit on imported buttons, zippers, shoulder supports, and tariffs--because Canada isn't involved in a trade war with China that the President has started. Under NAFTA, they can then turn those suits right back around to sell here in America for nothing.  This President's trade strategy is a disaster. American workers suffer the ultimate sacrifice. Our Nation must put someone in charge who knows what they are doing.                          ____________________
