Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to James Pitts, who passed away on Thursday, June 19, 2014. As one of the key researchers in understanding the dangers and repercussions of air pollution, his contribution to the state of California, and the world, will not be forgotten. James will be truly missed, as a dynamic and passionate advocate, educator, mentor and friend.  Six months after James was born in Salt Lake City on January 10, 1921 to Ester and James N. Pitts, the family moved to Los Angeles. It was not until James' studies in high school at Manual Arts High School that he found his passion for chemistry. He took this enthusiasm for science to the University of California, Los Angeles, where he graduated with a bachelor's in chemistry in 1945 and a doctorate in chemistry in 1949. Following his graduation, James' passion for teaching began to take shape. In 1954, James began as a founding professor at the University of California, Riverside, focusing his research on fundamental photochemistry. James led the efforts to establish the Statewide Air Pollution Research Center at the University of California, Riverside and served successfully as its director for eighteen years.  James began his air pollution research in the 1950s during a time when the nature and dangers of smog were still unknown. Through James' findings, he was able to influence groundbreaking Southern California air policy and clean air regulations that drastically improved the state's environmental health, and the health of California residents. The research carried out by his team provided much of the scientific basis of California's forward-thinking policies and regulations which have been widely adopted both nationally and internationally. Throughout his tenure, James also managed to find time to co-author nearly four hundred scientific works, and became such an authority in the scientific world that he was constantly visited by scientists, politicians and international leaders from around the globe. His extensive work in this field earned him numerous accolades from the United States Congress, the California State Assembly, the South Coast Air Quality Management District, the State Air Resources Board, and the Coalition for Clean Air.  James Pitts was an energetic advocate who made a true difference in the state of California and through his efforts, he ultimately impacted the world for the better. As an educator at both University of California, Riverside and University of California, Irvine, his enthusiasm for chemistry was contagious. James instilled many of his students with an unrelenting desire to improve the environment and prepared these future generations of scientists to better the world for many years to come.  James will always be remembered for his incredible work ethic, generosity, contributions to the community, and love of family. James will also be remembered for his love of the outdoors. James took advantage of everything the environment had to offer, which was clearly reflected in his life's work. James is survived by his second wife, Barbara Finlayson-Pitts and his three daughters from a previous marriage, Linda Lee, Christie Hoffman, and Beckie St. George as well as his former wife, Nancy, six grandchildren and their families. I extend my condolences to James' family and friends; although James may be gone, the light and goodness he brought to the world remain and will never be forgotten.                          ____________________
