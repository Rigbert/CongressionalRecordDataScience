President, one of the advantages of growing up in Montpelier, VT, is that I still see friends of mine and my family when I am back home. Glen and Esther Goodall were dear friends of my parents, Howard and Alba Leahy, and it is always nice to catch up with them, especially at the farmers' market in Montpelier in the summer.  Recently, Glen Goodall wrote a superb article for the Times Argus newspaper, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record. In the article, he tells what happened when the USS President Coolidge struck antisubmarine mines and sank. Glen is one of those unsung heroes of World War II, and it is an honor to know him.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                    From the Big Swim to Main Street               Veteran recounts fights in Pacific Theater       Sixty-six years ago, at the age of 23, I was headed for      Camp Blanding in Florida with the Vermont National Guard      172nd Infantry regiment of the 43rd Division. Our division      was inducted into federal service on Feb. 24, 1941. After 18      months of training at Camp Blanding in Florida and Camp      Shelby in Mississippi, plus maneuvers in Louisiana and North      Carolina, we received orders to Fort Ord, Calif., where we      were to embark shortly for the Pacific Theater.       The 172nd Combat team set sail on the U.S.S. President      Coolidge. As we arrived at Espiritu Santo, an island of the      New Hebrides group, on Oct. 26, 1942, the Coolidge      accidentally struck and detonated friendly anti-submarine      mines and sank. About 95 percent of the men on ship swam the      800 to 1,000 yards to shore through heavy oil, as lifeboats      milled about to take others to shore. Brigadier Gen. Rose,      the island commander, simply stated: ``Without discipline of      a superior kind, the feat of abandoning a rapidly sinking      ship by some 4,000 men in less than an hour could never have      been accomplished. Coolness which forestalled panic, trust in      their leader, considering the safety of others, agility in      scrambling down nets and ropes, all revealed the quality of      their training and what soldiers call `what it takes'.''       After five months on Espiritu Santo, our supply ship from      the states arrived to re-equip the regiment with all the      supplies we lost when the Coolidge went down. We left then      for Guadalcanal for a mopping-up operation and jungle      training to help us for our drive toward the homeland of      Japan. Those orders arrived in May 1943 to invade the New      Georgia group of islands. We landed on Rendova Island, from      there to Munda, fighting along the Munda Trail to Arundel      along the Diamond Narrows.       On Aug. 2, 1943, Brigadier Gen. Leonard F. Wing of Rutland      became the commanding general of the 43rd Division. Because      of his red hair, he became known as ``Red Wing'' and his      division known as the famous Red Wing Victory Division.       We landed in Luzon on the Philippine Islands on Jan. 9,      1945. The battle lasted 175 days. During that time we lost      965 men, 2,988 wounded and 11 missing. In the rest area in      Luzon we trained to invade the homeland of Japan, and while      we were training the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima and      Nagasaki on Aug. 7, 1945, and the Japanese surrendered. We      left for Japan as occupational troops and saw the horrific      devastation of the atomic bombs as well as the earlier fire      bombing of Tokyo and Yokohama.       Two weeks later, we were relieved and headed back to the      states, arriving on Oct. 6, 1945 where three years earlier we      had embarked for combat on Oct. 6, 1941. Peace at last had      cost us 1,561 killed, 6,049 wounded, a total of 7,610. A lot      of soldiers were returning to 3-year-old children they had      never seen.       I left for duty with the 172nd Infantry Regiment on Feb.      14, 1941 as a supply sergeant and ended my military career as      a warrant officer on Jan. 6, 1946. I returned to Vermont and      my wife on Oct. 6, 1945. I was in fairly good health but      continued to have malaria for a few years.       Major Gen. Wing was the only National Guard commander to      stay with the same division from the beginning to the end of      the war. The 43rd Infantry (Winged Victory) Division was the      only division privileged to participate in the South Pacific,      Southwest Pacific and the Philippines Campaign and continue      on to the Japanese homeland.       As I reflect back on my World War II memories it was always      meaningful to me to be a member of the Vermont 172nd Infantry      Regiment of the 43rd Division. I was born in Vermont and it      has been my home for 89\1/2\ years. Some of the other      Montpelier National Guard friends were Harry Seivwright,      Olisse Melada, Tom Guare, Francis Carey and Ernest Gibson,      who later became governor of Vermont. Some of these friends,     Harry Seivwright and Tom Guare, went into the European      theater and left us after training. Ernest Gibson was wounded      on one of the islands we invaded in the Pacific.       My wife and new bride, Esther, anxiously waited three years      for my safe return, and we were writing and exchanging      letters daily. Our local post service was super and a      blessing when even on a Sunday afternoon a letter from the      Pacific would be delivered to her personally sometimes by the      Postmaster Ed Henry or our local carrier, Stan Fournier.      Esther worked for the war effort the first year I was away,      making her home with her sister in Connecticut. She worked      for an industry that made fine glassware but had converted to      making bomb site lenses for planes and she rode a victory      bike to work daily. The last two years she returned to      Montpelier and worked in the state Education Department and      after working hours rolled and knitted bandages, sold war      bonds, mixed the coloring in the margarine, grocery shopped      with meat coupons, continued her daily letter to me and      bonded with other Army wives and friends.       Vermont celebrated the victory of World War II in November      and the celebration and parade were held in Montpelier      marching down Main and State Street. Col. Jim Walsh of St.      Albans from my outfit and I were asked to lead the parade.      For Esther and me, the memories and the celebration of that      day are the fondest, most emotional, happiest and proudest      moments of our lives. War is a bittersweet experience.                          ____________________
