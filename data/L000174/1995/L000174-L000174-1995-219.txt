President, I thank the chairman for his gracious words, and I was also glad--I mentioned a number of these folks earlier--but I was also glad to have my chief of staff, Luke Albee, to join us also on this bill, as well as John P. Dowd, my legislative director.  Tim Rieser, I think all of us on our side will agree, was a dynamo. Tim handled just about everything for everybody.  I do appreciate all of them.  Mr. President, before we voted earlier, the Senator from Wisconsin was going to speak in relation to this matter on this bill. As a courtesy to the other 99 Senators, he withheld for the vote on the assurance that he could be heard. I hope that it might be possible for the Senator from Wisconsin to be heard.  I assume we will appoint conferees. I wonder if we could yield for that.
