President, with this new session of Congress and the President's new term we are presented with new opportunities for change. Congress and the President have embraced these opportunities on many issues--new cabinet officials have been confirmed and a renewed effort is underway by the administration to repair strained international relationships. Unfortunately, on one important front there has been no change: The administration continues to stonewall on the prisoner abuse scandal and Congress continues to abdicate its oversight responsibility on this issue.  Ignoring this problem will not make it go away. Even without a comprehensive, independent investigation into the abuse of detainees, we continue to learn more about this scandal from press reports and the court-ordered release of Government documents in response to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) litigation.  The latest set of documents made public through the FOIA case reveal not only more incidents of abuse, but also indicate that soldiers in Afghanistan destroyed evidence of detainee mistreatment. One file documents the Army's investigation into the discovery of a compact disk during an office clean-up in Afghanistan in July 2004. The disk contained photos of U.S. soldiers pointing their handguns and rifles at the heads of bound and hooded detainees. Many of the soldiers questioned about these photos said they were ``joking around'' and that they wanted to have some good pictures to show their friends back home. If the roles were reversed and it was American POWs being used as photo props with weapons pointed at their heads, we would be rightly outraged by this conduct.  While the photos on this disk are disturbing in their own right, the circumstances surrounding this investigation are even more troubling. Unlike the photos from Abu Ghraib, these photos were not investigated because of an American soldier, in an act of conscious, gave the photos to a superior officer. These new photos were discovered by accident. The subsequent investigation into the photos revealed that soldiers in the unit were told by their superiors to delete similar photos of abuse to prevent their disclosure.  New details have also emerged about one of the infamous Abu Ghraib photos. Many will remember the photo of Manadel al-Jimadi's corpse packed in ice with Specialist Charles Graner posing over the body and giving the ``thumbs-up'' sign. We have known for months that this was a homicide, but a recent news report provides additional details about al-Jimadi's death. Al-Jimadi, one of the CIA's ghost detainees at Abu Ghraib, was secretly held at the prison. The International Committee of the Red Cross was denied access to him in violation of the Geneva Conventions. Now, press reports indicate that he died in a position known as ``Palestinian hanging.'' This barbaric practice entails cuffing the detainee's hands behind his back and suspending him from the wrists.  President Bush condemned Saddam Hussein for similar practices; the President should be as outraged when these acts are committed by American personnel.  Meanwhile, the media continues to reveal details about the administration's use of extraordinary rendition to transfer terrorism suspects in U.S. custody to the custody of countries where they are likely to be tortured. A recent article in The New Yorker, titled ``Outsourcing Torture,'' provides disturbing details about how the administration embraced the use of renditions after the attacks on September 11. The article cites three instances where the U.S. transferred suspected militants from Afghanistan to Uzbekistan. Although the fate of these men is not known, Uzbekistan is known to use interrogation methods such as partially boiling a detainee's hand or arm.  The State Department recently released its annual human rights report. The report criticized several countries for employing interrogation techniques that the State Department considered to be torture, yet are similar to techniques approved in 2002 by Secretary Rumsfeld. How can we criticize these countries for using techniques that our own Defense Secretary approved? How can our State Department denounce countries for engaging in torture while the CIA secretly transfers detainees to the very same countries? President Bush said that U.S. personnel do not engage in torture, but transferring detainees to other countries where they will be tortured does not absolve our government of responsibility. By outsourcing torture to these countries, we diminish our own values as a nation and lose our credibility as an advocate of human rights around the world.  Even without further government action, this scandal is not going to go away. It is time for us to lead the investigation, rather than wait to read about the latest discovery of abuse in the newspaper. As I have said before, there needs to be a thorough, independent investigation of the actions of those involved, from the people who committed abuses to the officials who set these policies in motion. The investigations completed thus far provide additional insight into how the prison abuses occurred, but their narrow mandates prevented them from addressing critical issues.  For example, an executive summary of the long-expected report on interrogation policy by Admiral Albert T. Church was released today. The full report, which is classified, reportedly criticizes the Pentagon for a failure of oversight, yet finds no direct evidence that high level officials ordered the mistreatment of detainees. The executive summary contains only a brief reference to the role of contractors in interrogations, and affirms that numerous contracts have been awarded in an ad hoc fashion and without central coordination. The role of contractors is an area sorely in need of a comprehensive investigation.  Similarly, the unclassified summary leaves many questions unanswered about Department of Defense (DOD) interaction with the CIA. It confirms that approximately 30 detainees were kept ``off the books'' in Iraq. The summary admits that DOD assisted the intelligence agencies with detainee transfers and supported interrogations by ``other government agencies''--which is government-speak for the CIA--at DOD facilities. What is missing from the Church report, however, isa full exploration of the role of the CIA in detention, rendition, and interrogation. The Agency apparently cooperated with the Church investigation, but provided information on activities only in Iraq, and not on any of the other nations or facilities where the CIA is holding and interrogating detainees.  A very important piece of information came out of today's hearing on the Church report, however. In his testimony before the Armed Services Committee, Admiral Church was asked by Senator Kennedy about unclassified paragraphs of the full report that discuss early meetings of the DOD working group on interrogations. That working group produced a memo that tracked very closely the infamous August 2002 Justice Department torture memo. The Justice memo claimed that for an action to rise to the level of torture it must result in pain equivalent to the type associated with organ failure or even death.  Apparently, the working group was briefed by Justice Department lawyers who presented the Justice memo's legal analysis as controlling. According to Senator Kennedy's exchange with Admiral Church, members of the working group protested. They believed that interrogation policy should follow the Geneva Conventions. Admiral Church confirmed that the working group was overruled by the Pentagon's Office of General Counsel, which insisted on using the torture memo as the legal foundation for interrogation techniques. Specifically, Admiral Church admitted, the working group was overruled by William J. Haynes, General Counsel of the Department of Defense, whom the President has nominated to a lifetime appointment as a Federal Circuit Court judge. And still, given all of this information, the Pentagon claims that abuses did not stem from policies generated from the highest levels of this administration.  Only a truly independent entity can comprehensively investigate the policy decisions that were made at the top and the abuses that followed in the field. There will always be scandals and tragedies in a nation's history. What makes America unique is that we do not hide from these issues; we investigate them, learn from our mistakes, and make sure they do not happen again. I have no doubt that an independent investigation into the abuse of detainees will be painful, but it is also a necessary step to moving forward.                          ____________________
