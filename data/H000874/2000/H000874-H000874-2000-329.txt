Speaker, I rise in support of H. Con. Res. 310, supporting a National Charter Schools Week. I commend my distinguished colleague from Indiana, Mr. Roemer, for highlighting the charter school movement and urging the Congress and the Administration to demonstrate support for our nation's charter schools.  Mr. Speaker, from 1989 to 1999, the number of students enrolled in public schools increased by 6.7 million, and the U.S. Census projects that our nation's school-age population will continue to grow throughout the century. In fact, many states have seen double-digit increases in school-age population. Asthis population continues to grow, our commitment to finding new and innovative ways to meet the changing needs of educating our youth needs to grow as well.  Charter schools offer our communities the ability to enroll their children in schools that enjoy autonomy over its operation and freedom from regulations that other public schools must follow, but also are held accountable for improving student achievement. Nearly two-thirds of newly created charter schools seek to realize an alternative vision of schooling, and one-fourth were founded primarily to serve a special target population. Many charter schools also serve a large number of lower income students, minority populations and students with disabilities.  Not only does this resolution acknowledge the charter school movement's progress and future promise, but it also encourages the President to issue a proclamation to demonstrate support for charter schools and establishes a National Charter Schools Week. Our nation's 1700 charter schools and the 350,000 students who attend them deserve our support and recognition. I want to thank Mr. Roemer for his continued leadership on this important education issue and your dedication to providing flexibility to our nation's schools.                          ____________________
