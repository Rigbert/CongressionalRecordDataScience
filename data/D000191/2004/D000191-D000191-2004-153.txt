Speaker, as Congress looks for innovative solutions to educate our Nation's children--our next generation of leaders--I'd like to call attention to a nonprofit reading program called SMART: Start Making A Reader Today. SMART is making a measurable difference for Oregon children who are falling behind. It has tremendous potential as a model for the Nation.  SMART's mission is to hook children on reading at an early age. By connecting children with community volunteers for weekly one-on-one reading sessions--and giving each student free books to take home and keep--SMART cultivates a supportive environment where reading skills build quickly and confidence grows just as fast.  Perhaps most importantly, SMART delivers proven results. Independent research shows that children who participate in SMART develop key reading skills faster than their peers, and maintain these gains after leaving the program. In fact, fifth graders who have been in SMART are 60 percent more likely than their peers to reach the state benchmark in reading.  SMART began 12 years ago in eight schools and has since grown to serve more than 11,000 children annually in 31 of Oregon's 36 counties. About 9,000 adults each year volunteer with SMART in more than 260 public elementary schools.  SMART's unique track record of mobilizing whole communities to invest in their local schools has been pivotal to the program's ongoing success. By engaging so many people to make community literacy a priority, SMART is helping to create an educated workforce for the next generation. It is helping Oregon build a solid economic future.  Please join me in making SMART and other proven early reading programs a funding priority this year.                          ____________________
