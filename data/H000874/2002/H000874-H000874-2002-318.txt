Speaker, I rise today to give recognition to Mr. Jeff Ludwig, senior vice president of Nai Michael Cos. As a result of his personal initiative to become a community emergency response team member, Mr. Ludwig was able to assist the community of La Plata, Maryland in constructing a new Town Center after it was hit by a powerful tornado in April 2002. After President Bush's State of the Union Address in January, Mr. Ludwig responded to the President's call to volunteerism by signing up for the Citizen Corps to become a member of the new emergency response group. He took advantage of online training manuals and completed his course, despite the fact that the Homeland Security Program had not yet begun to train citizen volunteers. This motivation prepared him to assist his community on April 28. It also makes him one of the first citizens corps community emergency response team leaders to take actions in the Nation's history.  When the tornado struck La Plata, Mr. Ludwig teamed up with the Facchina Group tocreate a plan to build a temporary Town Center. Not only did he help initiate this plan, he put in 18 hour days on the construction site, attacking problems, maintaining worker morale, and even buying dinner for the crew. The project was completed in eight days under his strong leadership. Mr. Ludwig's votunteerism is a strong symbol of the impact dedicated Americans can have on their communities in times of crisis.  Mr. Speaker, and colleagues, please join me in thanking Jeff Ludwig for his commitment to his community and congratulating him on his tremendous successes.                          ____________________
