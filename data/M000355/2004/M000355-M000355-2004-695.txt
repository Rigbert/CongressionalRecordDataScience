 This agreement, which is quite complex, allows us to accommodate various interests on both sides of the aisle but then move to final passage on the underlying bill, which, of course, was the goal of the majority leader in bringing it up at this time. I particularly commend Senator Craig, who has done a marvelous job of managing this issue on our side, and I thank him for his important contribution in reaching this agreement that will allow the Senate to achieve final passage on a bill that he is the principal sponsor of and that we believe a substantial majority of Senators on a bipartisan basis would like to see ultimately become law.
