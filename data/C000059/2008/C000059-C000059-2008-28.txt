The Inland Empire has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Maurice Calderon is one of these individuals. On June 27, 2008, there will be a ceremony for Maurice as he retires from the position of vice president of minority development at Arrowhead Credit Union in San Bernardino, California.  Born and raised in Banning, California, Maurice learned the rich traditions and values of his Hispanic heritage and has used those lessons throughout his professional life. This treasured background guided Mr. Calderon in his unwavering commitment of professional and public service to the people of the Inland Empire. An elected school board member for 9 years in Banning, followed by an elective seat as a Mount San Jacinto Community College district trustee for another 9 years, Mr. Calderon was in the wonderful position of public service.  Maurice is an active member of numerous business, education, and community groups. He is a member of both the Inland Empire Hispanic, and African American, Chambers of Commerce. He is a member of the board of trustees of the University of California, Riverside Foundation, and the San Bernardino Valley College Foundation. Maurice is also a director for the Inland Empire Economic Partnership, president of Sinfonia Mexicana and chairman of the Inland Empire Hispanic Leadership Council.  Maurice has been honored to receive many awards from community and service groups over the years including ``Father of the Year'' from the city of Banning. He has also received ``Citizen of the Year'' from the city of Beaumont and Phi Delta Kappa, Riverside. Maurice was named the inaugural ``Hispanic of the Year'' and ``Influential Latino of the Year'' in 1998 by the Inland Empire Hispanic Chamber, and Hispanic Lifestyle Magazine, respectively. Mr. Calderon was also named ``Influential Latino of the Year'' and was a distinguished medal recipient for the Northside Impact Committee of Redlands in 1996. Maurice was also the inaugural recipient of the California Credit Union League Diversity Award, and was named to the Southern California Native American and Latino Hall of Fame. In April of 2004, Maurice was honored as the recipient of the 2004 Reconocimiento Ohtli Award, an award given by the Mexican Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which recognizes those who have proven their excellence, are role models for the society, and have contributed most successfully to the well-being of the communities of Mexican origin in the United States. Maurice was awarded the Black Rose Award for 2004 from the San Bernardino Black Culture Foundation for his dedication and service to the community. On September 1, 2005, the city of Banning acknowledged Maurice Calderon and the entire Calderon family for over 100 years of community service by naming a street Calderon Way in their honor. In November of 2005, Maurice received the California Credit Union League PAC 2005 Advocate of the Year Award during the League's annual meeting in Anaheim, California. In 2008 Maurice received the Sinfonia Mexicana Award for Service for serving as president from 2001 to 2008. In May of 2008 Maurice received the Esperanza Award from the California Chicano News Media Association.  Mr. Calderon has received certificates from the University of Georgia and Indiana University in savings and loan graduate programs. He also received an associate of arts degree from Mount San Jacinto College with honors. Married to Dorothy Calderon for 47 wonderful years, Maurice has two children and four grandchildren. Maurice's tireless passion for community service has contributed immensely to the betterment of the Inland Empire. I am proud to call Maurice a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for his service and salute him as he retires.                          ____________________
