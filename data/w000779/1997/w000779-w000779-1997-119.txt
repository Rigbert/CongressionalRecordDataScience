President, a few weeks ago, I met with a group of small business folks at an Internet cafe in Portland. We talked about the promise electronic commerce holds for businesses and consumers. The Internet can give a small businessperson in Astoria, OR access to the entire global marketplace. It can give consumers, especially in rural areas, entry to a supernational shopping mall.  For governments, the Internet offers a different type of promise--the chance to be a new cash cow. As Federal funds decrease, States and local governments are looking to the Internet as a new source of revenue. Some have already begun building tollbooths on the information superhighway. For sales taxes alone, there are nearly 6,500 different taxing authorities in this country. One businessman at the Internet cafe told me he is wary of getting into electronic commerce because of the prospect of as many as 30,000 different pairs of hands reaching into his pockets to collect taxes. If current trends continue, State and local levies will transform the Internet from a bright and exciting new frontier for commerce into a dark jungle of foreboding taxes.  Under today's mishmash of State and local Internet taxes, everyone is puzzled. Take a customer at his home computer who purchases an item from a virtual catalogue. With the click of his mouse, the purchase is logged, his account billed and payment made by wire transfer and the order sent. The vendor is in another State, or even another country. His bank is in a third State and the purchase is a gift being sent to a relative in another State. Where did this transaction take place? Where was there nexus for tax purposes--the vendor State? The customer's State? The bank's location? Or the State where the gift is being sent? Is the answer all of the above, some of the above, or none of the above?  The enormity of the problem is underscored by the fact that the hottest selling software today is software to help entrepreneurs and companies figure out various State tax policies.  When a consumer in Corvallis, OR uses an Internet search engine in California, is that search a taxable service? When a housewife in Houston uses Virginia-based America Online to make a virtual purchase from a furniture company in North Carolina, what gets taxed where? Is an Internet service provider a public utility, as one State has ruled? Even if a State has enacted an online tax law, collection and enforcement are often haphazard. This system rewards ignorance and punishes the boy scout businesses that play by the rules.  The purpose of the bill I am introducing today with Congressman Chris Cox is to allow everyone to step back and take a deep breath. It says let's suspend this crazy tax quilting bee so that everyone can come together in a rational way to figure out what policy makes the most sense.  The Internet Tax Freedom Act has three parts. First, it would impose an indefinite moratorium on subnational taxes on electronic commerce. Where States and local governments have already imposed taxes on electronic commerce, their taxes would be grand fathered to the extent that they are net income taxes, fairly apportioned business license taxes or where the tax is collected in an identical way for mail or telephone orders. This will assure uniformity and fairness, while targeting inequitable technology taxes. Our intent is that the new tax moratorium apply to all Internet and interactive computer services, regardless of the technology--such as cable systems and wireless networks--being used to deliver those services. It will give us a functionally equivalent and technologically equitable tax policy. It will assure equity and fairness among all business entities and across technologies.  Second, the bill would call upon the administration to bring together State and local governments, businesses and consumers, and any others with a stake in the Internet and online commerce to develop policy recommendations on taxation of the Internet and use of the Internet to deliver products and services. The Executive would have 2 years in which to prepare policy recommendations on taxation of the Internet.  Third, the bill directs the executive branch to seek an international agreement making the Internet a duty-free zone. Just as we seek a rational policy on electronic commerce taxation here in the United States, our businesses cannot be expected to compete overseas if they faced more than 160 different foreign tariff policies covering global electronic commerce. Although about 75 percent of Web users live in North America, most electronic commerce is between companies, rather than companies and consumers. Forrester Research of Massachusetts predicts business-to-business commerce will soon be worth $67 billion a year.  Trying to find out exactly which States and local authorities are imposing taxes on electronic commerce and what types of taxes they are imposing is a daunting--if not outright impossible--task in itself. The Vice President for a good-sized Internet service provider in California said he would need a whole department to untangle the various Internet tax laws around the country, ``It's in my nightmare pile,'' he observed. If this has stumped some of the best accounting firms in the country, how in the world can a small business that wants to sell over the Internet figure out its various tax liabilities? The difference between States in electronic commerce tax policy is mind-numbing.  Twenty States and the District of Columbia impose one or more taxes on electronic commerce. New York levies taxes on gross receipts on the ``furnishing of information,'' but not on personal or individual information. Ohio taxes electronic transmissions and real estate data bases because they provide objective data but exempts news services because they provide analysis. Texas taxes the transmission of electronic information and software in whatever form, but does not tax software sent out of State on a disk. Alabama's Revenue Department ruled last fall that a utility tax applies to Internet service providers, forcing them to pay a 4-percent public utilities tax.  Last year in Florida a small Internet service provider asked the State's Department of Revenue whether he should add a sales tax to his customers' monthly bills. He was certain he wouldn't have to since all net surfers there already pay 10 percent or more in taxes for the telephone service they use to link to the Internet. To his surprise, the Revenue Department said his customers should have been paying a 7-percent service tax under a decade-old telecommunications law. Then, adding shock to surprise, the Department told him his company was subject to an additional 2.5-percent tax on its gross annual receipts. The uproar from users and providers led the Governor to suspend the taxes until a panel could study the implications.  The legislation is constructed in such a way as to set up a dynamic and productive tension. It gives those that seek revenue from electronic commerce--the States and local governments--an incentive to work with the administration in developing policy recommendations on Internet taxation. Indeed, the National Conference of State Legislatures wrote me on February 21 that they have been ``working with a number of other State organizations as well as the impacted private sector industries to find the common ground which will lead to the coordination and uniformity of State tax structures which the draft legislation desires.'' And an official with the Federal of Tax Administrators observed last summer that ``States need to figure out how to tax it [the Internet] and to make it a level playing field with other services.'' I will also continue to work with the Multistate Tax Commission to assure their efforts move forward.  But the question remains: Will the simple imperative for good public policy outweigh the desire of cash-strapped States to tap a new source of revenue? Without a moratorium, as proposed in this legislation, I fear those State and local governments hungry for new sources of revenue have little, if any, incentive to work for a fair and equitable Internet tax policy.  I want to thank a number of groups that have helped us craft this legislation, and which have indicated their support for this bill: the American Electronics Association, the Software Publishers Association, the Association of Online Professionals, the Committee on State Taxation, the Direct Marketing Association, the Business Software Alliance, the Information Technology Association of America, the U.S. Telephone Association, the California State Board of Taxation, the Massachusetts High Tech Council, CommerceNet, the Silicon Valley Software Industry Coalition, IBM, AT, and other companies.  I view the legislation being introduced today as the beginning of a process, not the end. It remains a work in progress and will hopefully continue to be refined throughout the congressional hearing process.  There is a great deal to learn in these unchartered waters. All of us--Congress, State and local governments, businesses and consumers--must educate each other about how this new electronic medium works. We must all work together to help it achieve its full potential as a marketplace of ideas, products, and services.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a section-by-section analysis be printed in the Record.  Thee being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 442       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Internet Tax Freedom Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       The Congress finds the following:       (1) As a massive global network spanning not only State but      international borders, the Internet is inherently a matter of      interstate and foreign commerce within the jurisdiction of      the United States Congress under Article I, Section 8 of the      United States Constitution.       (2) Even within the United States, the Internet does not      respect State lines and operates independently of State      boundaries. Addresses on the Internet are designed to be      geographically indifferent. Internet transmissions are      insensitive to physical distance and can have multiple      geographical addresses.       (3) Because transmissions over the Internet are made      through packet-switching it is impossible to determine with      any degree of certainty the precise geographic route or      endpoints of specific Internet transmissions and infeasible      to separate intrastate from interstate, and domestic from      foreign, Internet transmissions.       (4) Inconsistent and inadministrable taxes imposed on      Internet activity by State and local governments threaten not      only to subject consumers, businesses, and other users      engaged in interstate and foreign commerce to multiply,      confusing, and burdensome taxation, but also to restrict the      growth and continued technological maturation of the Internet      itself, and to call into question the continued viability of      this dynamic medium.       (5) Because the tax laws and regulations of so many      jurisdictions were established before the Internet or      interactive computer services, their application to this new      medium in unintended and unpredictable ways threatens every      Internet user, access provider, vendor, and interactive      computer service provider.       (6) The electronic marketplace of services, products, and      ideas available through the Internet or interactive computer      services can be especially beneficial to senior citizens, the      physically challenged, citizens in rural areas, and small      businesses. It also offers a variety of uses and benefits for      educational institutions and charitable organizations.       (7) Consumers, businesses, and others engaging in      interstate and foreign commerce through the Internet or      interactive computer services could become subject to more      than 30,000 separate taxing jurisdictions in the United      States alone.       (8) The consistent and coherent national policy regarding      taxation of Internet activity, and the concomitant      uniformity, simplicity, and fairness that is needed to avoid      burdening this evolving form of interstate and foreign      commerce can best be achieved by the United States exercising      its authority under Article I, Section 8, Clause 3 of the      United States Constitution.     SEC. 3. MORATORIUM ON IMPOSITION OF TAXES ON INTERNET OR                    INTERACTIVE COMPUTER SERVICES.       (a) Moratorium.--Except as otherwise provided in this      section, no State or political subdivision thereof may      impose, assess, or attempt to collect a tax directly or      indirectly on--       (1) the Internet or interactive computer services; or       (2) the use of the Internet or interactive computer      services.       (b) Preservation of State and Local Taxing Authority.--     Subsection (a)--       (1) does not apply to taxes imposed on or measured by net      income derived from the Internet or interactive computer      services;       (2) does not apply to fairly apportioned business license      taxes applied to businesses having a business location in the      taxing jurisdiction; and       (3) does not affect a State or political subdivision      thereof of authority to impose a sales or use tax on sales or      other transactions effected by the use of the Internet or      interactive computer services if--       (A) the tax is the same as the tax generally imposed and      collected by that State or political subdivision thereof on      interstate sales or transactions effected by mail order,      telephone, or other remote means within its taxing      jurisdiction; and       (B) the obligation to collect the tax from sales or other      transactions effected by the use of the Internet or      interactive computer services is imposed on the same person      or entity as in the case of sales or transactions effected by      mail order, telephone, or other remote means.     SEC. 4. ADMINISTRATION POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS TO CONGRESS.       (a) Consultative Group.--The Secretaries of the Treasury,      Commerce, and State, in consultation with appropriate      committees of the Congress, consumer and business groups,      States and political subdivisions thereof, and other      appropriate groups, shall--       (1) undertake an examination of United States and      international taxation of the Internet and interactive      computer services, as well as commerce conducted thereon; and       (2) jointly submit appropriate policy recommendations      concerning United States domestic and foreign policies toward      taxation of the Internet and interactive computer services,      if any, to the President within 18 months after the date of      enactment of this Act.       (b) President.--Not later than 2 years after the date of      enactment of this Act, the President shall transmit to the      appropriate committees of Congress policy recommendations on      the taxation of sales and other transactions affected on the      Internet or through interactive computer services.       (c) Recommendations To Be Consistent With      Telecommunications Act of 1996 Policy Statement.--The      Secretaries and the President shall take care to ensure that      any policy recommendations are fully consistent with the      policy set forth in paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 230(b)      of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 230(b)).     SEC. 5. DECLARATION THAT THE INTERNET BE FREE OF FOREIGN                    TARIFFS, TRADE BARRIERS, AND OTHER                    RESTRICTIONS.       It is the sense of the Congress that the President should      seek bilateral and multilateral agreements through the World      Trade Organization, the Organization for Economic Cooperation      Council, or other appropriate international fora to establish      that activity on the Internet and interactive computer      services is free from tariff and taxation.     SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS.       For purposes of this Act--       (1) Internet; interactive computer service.--The terms      ``Internet'' and ``interactive computer service'' have the      meaning given such terms by paragraphs (1) and (2),      respectively, of section 230(e) of the Communications Act of      1934 (47 U.S.C. 230(e)).       (2) Tax.--The term ``tax'' includes any tax, license, or      fee that is imposed by any governmental entity, and includes      the imposition of the seller of an obligation to collect and      remit a tax imposed on the buyer.                                                                    ____       The Internet Tax Freedom Act--Section-by-Section Analysis       Section 1: Short title: ``The Internet Tax Freedom Act''       Section 2: Findings. Sets forth a series of findings,      including that the Internet is inherently a matter of      interstate commerce; that the Internet operates independently      of State lines; that inconsistent and unadministrable taxes      imposed on Internet activity by State and local governments      subject consumers and businesses to multiple, confusing and      burdensome taxation and are creating compliance problems for      Internet access providers, vendors and interactive computer      service providers; that consumers, businesses and others      engaging in interstate commerce through the Internet or      interactive computer services could become subject to some      30,000 separate taxing jurisdictions in the United States;      and that uniformity, simplicity and fairness are needed      regarding taxation of Internet activity to avoid burdening      this evolving form of interstate commerce.       Section 3: Moratorium on Imposition of Taxes on Internet or      Interactive Computer Services--       Subsection (a), establishes a moratorium on direct and      indirect state or local taxes on the Internet or interactive      computer services or the use of those services.       Subsection (b), preserves state and local authority for      taxes for the following types of taxes:       (1) taxes on or measured by net income derived from these      services,       (2) fairly apportioned business license taxes, and       (3) sales and use taxes on interstate electronic      transactions that are consistent with taxes on mail order and      telephone transactions.       Section 4: Administration Policy Recommendations to      Congress.       Subsection (a), Establishes a consultative group of the      Secretaries of the Treasury, Commerce and State that will      work with State and local governments, consumer and business      groups and others to examine U.S. and international taxation      of Internet and interactive computer services and submit      policy recommendations to the President within 18 months of      enactment.       Subsection (b), directs the President to transmit to      Congress any policy recommendations within two years of      enactment.       Subsection (c), seeks to ensure that any policy      recommendations are consistent with the 1996      Telecommunications Act policy statement regarding promotion      of the Internet and interactive computer services.       Section 5: Declaration that the Internet Be Free of Foreign      Tariffs, Trade Barriers, and Other Restrictions       Sets forth the sense of the Congress that the President      should seek bilateral and multinational agreements through      various international trade organizations to keep the      Internet and interactive computer services free from tariffs      and taxation.       Section 6: Definitions       (1) Internet and interactive computer service terms are      defined as they are in the Communications Act of 1934, as      amended by the 1996 Telecommunications Act.       (2) Defines tax to include any tax, license or fee imposed      by any governmental entity and includes the imposition on the      seller of an obligation to collect and remit a tax imposed on      the buyer.                          ____________________
