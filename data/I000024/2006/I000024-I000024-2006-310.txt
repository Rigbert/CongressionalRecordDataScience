I think it is important to understand that virtually every President throughout the history of America has made statements to that effect. Teddy Roosevelt said in a speech:       We must also learn one language and that language is      English.  President Clinton said in his speech in 1999, in talking about immigrants:       New immigrants have a responsibility to enter the      mainstream of American life. That means learning English and      learning about our democratic system of government.  We heard just the other day in a speech given by our President that it is necessary in order to unify us and to leave all the obstacles that are out there.  I thank not just the obvious ones who have been speaking already, but Senator McCain and Senator Graham have been a very important part in making changes, along with Senator Alexander and the occupant of the chair, the junior Senator from Florida.  At this time, I would like to hear from Senator Graham. I yield to him whatever time he desires.
