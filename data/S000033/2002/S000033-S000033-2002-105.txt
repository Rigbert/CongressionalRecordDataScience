 Speaker, today I recognize the outstanding work done by participants in my Student Congressional Town Meeting held this spring at the University of Vermont. These participants were part of a group of high school students from around Vermont who testified about the concerns they have as teenagers, and about what they would like to see government do regarding these concerns.On Behalf of Andrea Shahan, Danielle Harvey, Reid Garrow, Troy Ault and                              Stefanie Gray                         Regarding CHILD LABOR                            (April 8, 2002)       REID GARROW: On the western edge of Dacca, Bangladesh, on a      man-made ridge constructed to prevent flooding, dust is      everywhere. The air is full of a single-sound sequence: The      sharp sing of hammers hitting stone anvils. The sun beats      bright as the children with their naked dust-covered bodies      hammer away with tiny hammers in imitation of their mothers.       Many mothers work here. Hundreds, even thousands, are      employed in breaking bricks for the foundations of the      buildings. And by many mothers' sides, living in horrible      conditions, are their children, laboring away. There are many      places such as the factory described in Dacca, Bangladesh,      all over the world. Children are forced to work in horrible      conditions, with extremely low wages, and with no rights      whatsoever.       We are the beneficiaries of child labor. Many of us here      today are wearing clothing made overseas, and a significant      percentage of it is made by small children. The United States      has the world's largest economy, and with just a little      effort, our government could drastically reduce child labor,      and maybe even someday eliminate it.       DANIELLE HARVEY: A common way for children to become      exploited in the system of child labor is to be sold by their      parents to a bondsman in order to pay off a debt. The debt is      usually very small, ranging from 500 to 7,500 rupees, which,      when converted to U.S. currency, mounts to about $14 to $200.      Destitute families are offered these loans, and most families      accept them, because they need to pay for the cost of an      illness, to provide a dowry for a married child, or perhaps      just to keep food on the table.       A significant job in the workforce is the manufacturing of      domestic and export products. Some of these products include      silk, bee, which are hand-rolled cigarettes, silver jewelry,      synthetic gemstones, leather products, including footwear and      sporting goods, handwoven wool carpets, and precious      gemstones and diamonds. Some services that bondsmen force      bonded children to perform include prostitution, small-     restaurant work, truck-stop work, tea-shop services, and      domestic servitude.       STEFANIE GRAY: Child labor prevents children from receiving      a good education. Without an education, they are unable to      receive jobs at reasonable pay as an adult. Children want a      good education, and they believe that the only way their      beliefs will be fulfilled is if they are willing to work.       With the lack of support from their parents and their      employers, it is hard to be a student and an employee. There      are some companies in Nepal, Pakistan, that give classes to      employers and parents to recognize the students' education      rights.       Child domestic workers cannot join a normal school. A      little twelve-year-old boy cleans utensils, washes clothes,      and sweeps the house. He rarely sees outside the small four-     walled house where he works. He wants to go to school and      study, and is unable because of his housework. Children work      in the hope they will make enough money to go to school, and,      in the end, they realize they won't every make enough money.      And it is hard for them to get out of work once they enter.      They become disappointed that they won't get the education      that they had hoped for.       TROY AULT: Child debt servitude has been illegal since 1933      in India, when the Children Pledging Labor Act was enacted      under British rule. There are specific laws which were meant      to govern child labor in factories, in commercial      establishments, on plantations, and in apprenticeships. There      are also laws about the use of migrant labor and contract      labor. A recent law established in 1986 was set in place by      the Child Labor Prohibition and Regulation Act, and      designates a child as a person who has not completed their      14th year of age.'' It purports to regulate the hours and      conditions of some child workers, and to prohibit the use of      child labor in certain enumerated hazardous industries. Most      importantly, there is a law that was established in 1976 by      the Bonded Labor System Abolition Act, which strictly outlaws      all forms of debt bondage and forced labor.       Why these laws have not been enforced. The governing      systems in Asia feel that child labor is inevitable. They      think that it is caused by poverty, and cannot be changed by      force, that it must evolve slowly towards eradication.It has      been discovered, though, that some governments fund child      labor in their country, which isn't making the population of      child workers any smaller.       Many feel that the systems are concerned only with      maintaining a lead in the global marketplace, rather than the      condition of their nation's youth. The problem at hand is      really that, with the laws formed by these nations against      having child labor in their countries are not being enforced      harshly enough, and that an involvement with the American      government, which has much more power, would make much more      of an impact on child labor.       ANDREA SHAHAN: Rosy, from the Philippines, who is 14 years      old, has to take care of the household as well as her      employer's 14 breeding dogs. She says, The dogs are so big.      I'm afraid to go near them. Every day, I prepare kilos of dog      food, wash out their pens, and take care of the mother dogs      with newly born puppies. Sometimes I can't sleep properly for      three nights or the puppies may die.       All dogs are made in heaven, they say, but some domestics      live in hell. My employer doesn't allow me to have any of the      leftover food from their table, and I can't just help myself.      I'm always hungry. One day, I couldn't tighten my belt      anymore, so I ate the food of the dogs.       Saneena, from Nepal, who is twelve years old, in an      interview, says: I have been a domestic worker for the last      two years, and recently started going to school. At first, my      stepmother didn't allow me to attend, but I used to go to the      class anyway, without telling her. A few days later, she      caught me, scolded me, and gave me a slap.       The teacher visited our house and tried to convince her to      send me back. To begin with, she was not ready even to talk,      but later she agreed, on the condition that I should take my      younger brother with me. So I bring my baby brother to      school. He can't really understand the class because he is      only one and a half years old, but I'm glad at least to have      a chance to go to school again.       Fatima, from Bangladesh, is 14 years old. Fatima came to      Dacca to work as a domestic worker. Her employer used to beat      her up often. After four months, when her employer beat her      up severely, she ran away, and took shelter in another home.      Seeing the bruises on her body, the owner of her house took      her to the police station when she was a bit better.       The police brought her back to her old employer's house for      investigation. The employers bribed the police and give them      a written statement saying that she would be sent back to her      village. But after the police left, she was locked in the      toilet. She started screaming, and upon hearing her cries for      help, the neighbors phoned ASK. ASK Lawyers rescued her and      tried to file suit against the employer. While this was going      on, the employer offered Fatima's family about 230 U.S.      dollars. Fatima's mother took the money and refused to file      charges. At present, Fatima is working in a garment factory.       Johoya has to get up at 5 a.m., wash the utensils, sweep      the compound, wash the cloths, attend to the demands of the      mistress in the kitchen, attend to the old lady in the house,      and also look after the pet dog. One day, Johoya was on the      road, crying, holding a dog chain in her hand. When      approached, she burst out crying, saying, ``the dog has run      away. I am afraid. Tomorrow the master will be returning to      the house, and he will kill me for losing the dog. My      mistress has not given me food for two days because I have      lost the dog. Have you seen my dog anywhere?''       The next day the house owner arrived, and Johoya was beaten      for her carelessness and told she was not to be given any      food until the dog was found. Some days later, the dog was      found in the house of a neighbor, and money was paid to them      for finding and keeping the dog safely. Johoya was happy the      dog was returned, but her salary for the previous month was      not given to her mother, when she came, as usual, to collect.      She was told it had been paid to the neighbor who found and      looked after the dog.       When you look into a child's eyes, you expect to see hope,      trust and innocence, but when you see these signs of      childhood are replaced by the trail of hunger, fear and      suspicion, we need to take serious stock in ourselves and the      society we have created.                               ____________________
