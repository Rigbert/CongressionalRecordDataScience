 Let me say to my friend, if he heard what I had said--I know he was listening, and I thank him for that--he and I both know revenue bills must initiate in this House. So if the Senate is to effect what those 42 Members suggested they wanted to see, then it must have a vehicle from this House on which to act. What I suggested and what I believe is that when you say this bill is dead, I think I am not sure I agree with you, because in my view it will be this bill on which they will ultimately reach whatever compromise is available in the United States Senate.  So, in fact, I think this is an important vehicle to reach perhaps the compromise that we all know is ultimately going to be necessary, while at the same time expressing the views of I think the overwhelming numbers of us that certainly the first 250--we may not agree on further, or another level or something, but certainly would the gentleman disagree with me that we all agree on the first 250 ought not to receive an increase?
