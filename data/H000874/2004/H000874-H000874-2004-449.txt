Speaker, today I rise to recognize the life of a dear friend and a great American. Blair Cross was a loving family man, a patriotic veteran, and a dedicated activist.  I was fortunate to have the opportunity to work closely with Blair and witnessed his tireless advocacy on behalf of Korean War veterans across the country. Specifically, Blair and I have been working on legislation that would grant the Korean War Veterans Association a Federal Charter, enabling the Association to expand its mission and further its charitable and benevolent causes.  Blair was the Korean War Veterans Association's top advocate for this issue, and I am grateful for his activism, and the activism he encouraged among his fellow Korean War veterans.  Mr. Cross's distinguished service did not go unnoticed. The Joint Veterans Committee of Maryland selected Blair to receive the honor of Veteran of the Year and he was to be recognized this April. Blair was chosen to receive this award from over 10,000 veterans throughout the State.  Mr. Cross also helped in founding the Maryland Center for Veterans Education and Training. The Baltimore homeless shelter has aided thousands of veterans over the years.  The community, the State, and the country have incurred a tremendous loss with Blair's passing. His advocacy and leadership on behalf of veterans in our State will long be remembered and I send my deepest sympathies to his wife Jane, daughter Sharon and Blair's family and friends.                          ____________________
