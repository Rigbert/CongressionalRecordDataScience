President, I am introducing legislation today with Senator Tester to lessen the burdens for small commercial filming on public lands. Specifically, this legislation provides special permitting to small film crews, defined in the bill as 5 persons or fewer, to simply pay a reasonable annual fee to be able to film on public lands.  Our Nation's public lands are an incredible natural resource, and the professional outdoor media industry is a valuable way to bring awareness to our Nation's resources and bring about awareness of the value of conservation of our Nation's land and resources through documentaries, sporting programs, and other productions. Small filming crews can be negatively affected by the current permitting and fee schedule because the business of wildlife filming is done on a speculative basis and often relies on unpredictable factors requiring much patience and time. Last Congress, Chairman Rahall held a Natural Resources Committee hearing on the fees for filming and photography on public lands. At that hearing, Steve Scott, an independent television producer from Norman, OK, and Chairman of the Professional Outdoor Media Association, probably best described the work of small outdoor filming operations. He testified, ``By its very nature, wildlife photography is extremely time consuming, often done in the harshest conditions. . . . While large film and television production crews need relatively little time on public lands to complete their project, our nation's professional outdoor media may spend weeks or months in the field in order to capture a few magic seconds of unstaged Nature in its pristine state. And when outdoor media members spend time in the field, under the current fee structure, we also spend money, and lots of it.'' The small professional outdoor filming industry has enough natural barriers; The Federal Government should not impose itself as another through daily fees adding to the expense.  Last Congress, my colleague from Oklahoma, Congressman Dan Boren, and Don Young, introduced H.R. 5502 toaccomplish the same aim of the legislation Senator Tester and I are introducing today. That legislation was supported by nearly 30 outdoors and sportsmen's organizations.  Those organizations supporting last Congress' legislation include the American Fisheries Society, the American Sportfishing Association, the Archery Trade Association, Bass Pro Shops, the Berkley Conservation Institute, Boone and Crockett Club, Bowhunting Preservation Alliance, Campfire Club of America, Catch-A-Dream Foundation, the Congressional Sportsmen's Foundation, Conservation Force, Dallas Safari Club, Mule Deer Foundation, the National Assembly of Sportsmen's Caucuses, the National Rifle Association, the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the National Wild Turkey Federation, the North American Bear Foundation, the North American Grouse Partnership, Pheasants Forever, Pure Fishing, Quality Deer Management Association, Quail Forever, the Ruffed Grouse Society, Safari Club International, the Texas Wildlife Association, the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership, the U.S. Sportsmen's Alliance, the Wild Sheep Foundation, and Wildlife Forever.  This Congress, Congressmen Boren, Ryan, Courtney, Miller, Putnam, and Ross introduced H.R. 2031 on April 22, 2009, which is identical legislation to the legislation Senator Tester and I are introducing today. I am sure it will enjoy the same support from our outdoor and sportsmen's organizations, and I look forward to its consideration in the Senate.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1241       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
