President, I have often spoken about the horrifying effects of antipersonnel landmines. There are 100 million of these hidden killers in over 60 countries.  Here in the relative security of the United States, we can only guess what it is like to live in places like Cambodia, Bosnia, or Angola, in constant fear of losing an arm or a leg or your life, or your child's life, from a landmine. That is a daily, terrifying reality for millions and millions of people around the world.  A recent article by David Remnick in the New Yorker magazine entitled ``A Letter From Chechnya--In Stalin's Wake,'' illustrates what I am talking about. The Russians have dropped thousands and thousands of landmines from helicopters over Chechnya. I want to read the opening paragraphs of that article:       ``If you pick the flowers, you could explode,'' Mayerbek      said.       ``What?"       ``If you go off the road and into the field, there are      mines. Russian birthday presents. Step on one, you might      explode.''       Twenty miles by mountain road from Grozny, the Chechen      capital, it had seemed safe enough to get out of the Zhiguli,      a banged-up tuna can of a car, and take a short walk.      Apparently not. I backed out of the field of lilies and high      grass, one soft step at a time.       ``Better,'' Mayerbek said. ``Much better. Now maybe let's      get back in the car and get going.''  Mr. President, if you pick the flowers, you could explode. A horrifying thought. But not really a thought at all. It is happening every 22 minutes of every day of every year. The overwhelming majority of the victims of these indiscriminate, inhumane weapons are innocent civilians.  My legislation, the Landmine Use Moratorium Act, which I plan to offer as an amendment in the coming weeks, aims to exert U.S. leadership to begin to put an end to this scourge. It would impose a 1-year moratorium on the use of most antipersonnel landmines. It has 45 cosponsors.                          ____________________
