President, public and private institutions all across the United States have invested enormous amounts of time and money to educate Americans about the dangers from smoking, and to curb tobacco advertising especially that targets minors. Nationwide campaigns have raised awareness about the health and economic costs of cigarettes. Lawmakers have focused on holding the tobacco companies responsible for the incalculable harm their products, and their decades of lies, have done to our society. Parents, schools and local governments have joined together to keep children from starting to use tobacco.  The attention has paid off, although their is much more that needs to be done. Laws that seek to protect children from tobacco advertising have become stricter, warning labels on cigarette packaging contain stronger language, the price of cigarettes has gone up, and regulations on second-hand smoke have become broader and more inclusive. The number of stories in the media about the tobacco industry and the horrors of lung cancer and emphysema are an indication of how far we have come.  What has been sorely lacking, however, is the same kind of attention on the effects of tobacco use in developing nations where an estimated 800 million people smoke and the consumption of cigarettes is rising steadily. As the market for tobacco products in the US declines, tobacco companies are aggressively pursuing these lucrative foreign markets. It is projected that adult consumption of cigarettes in the developing countries will exceed that in the industrialized countries within the next decade. These figures do not even take into account that in many developing countries the number of people under eighteen--those most susceptible to tobacco advertising and most inclined to start smoking--is more than fifty percent of the population. In a matter of years, tobacco will be a leading cause of death in countries whose poor healthcare systems cannot possibly care for them.  Why should this matter to us? Each year, we provide billions of dollars in foreign aid to improve the lives of people overseas. We spend tens of millions of dollars to support foreign health programs. It is absurd that in the same countries where we are spending precious American tax dollars to try to save lives, American tobacco companies are pushing their deadly products.  Until recently, it was even worse than that. According to a February 16, 1998 ``New York Times'' article, there has been a long history of collaboration between the US Government and tobacco companies to introduce American cigarettes into foreign markets and to fight anti-smoking regulations overseas. It is reported that in 1992 the US Government and the tobacco companies worked hand-in-hand against an effort by Thai authorities to require tobacco companies to disclose the ingredients in their cigarettes.  Fortunately, the US Government is finally catching up with the times. In February, the State Department directed our embassies and foreign commercial offices to stop promoting the sale or export of American tobacco products. They were also told to stop trying to block restrictions from being placed on these products.  Mr. President, the dangers of smoking have been established and Americans are responding by taking steps to curb their tobacco consumption. As our efforts against tobacco in the US pay off, we must also help the developing countries curb their own consumption. One step in the right direction is the Healthy Kids Act, of which I am a cosponsor. Introduced by Senator Conrad on February 12, 1998, the Act contains a provision to establish the ``American Center on Global Health and Tobacco'' to assist other countries curb tobacco use.  In addition, on July 23, 1997 Senator Lautenberg introduced the Worldwide Tobacco Disclosure Act. It would subject exported cigarettes to the same restrictions on labeling that apply to the sale and distribution of cigarettes in the United States and prevent U.S. Government officials from working against other countries' restrictions on tobacco. We should do everything we can to try to protect the people in those countries from the dangers of tobacco, as we are protecting ourselves. Hundreds of millions of lives, and billions of dollars that could otherwise be used to educate, house and employ people, are at stake.                          ____________________
