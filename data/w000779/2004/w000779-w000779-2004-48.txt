President, I have come to the Senate floor this morning to state, in accord with my policy of publicly announcing any hold that Iplace on a nominee or a piece of legislation, that I will object to any unanimous consent request for the Senate to take up the President's nominee, Deborah Majoras, to head the Federal Trade Commission.  Gasoline pricing is, of course, one of the most important consumer protection issues that the Federal Trade Commission is responsible for overseeing. The prices for gasoline, of course, are soaring. For years now, the Federal Trade Commission has been waging a campaign of inaction. In three specific areas--increased oil company mergers, refinery shutdowns, and anti-competitive practices--the Federal Trade Commission has simply been AWOL.  Yesterday, after writing to Ms. Majoras, to make sure she knew specifically of my concerns, I met with the nominee to head the Federal Trade Commission. I asked repeatedly if there was even one area--even one area--where she would change existing Federal Trade Commission policy with respect to these practices that are sucking the competitive juices out of gasoline markets across the country. During that conversation not even one example was given of an area that the nominee to head the Federal Trade Commission would change in the gasoline pricing area. It is for that reason that I publicly state today that I am placing a hold on this nominee.  To me, it is absolutely unacceptable for a nominee to chair the Federal Trade Commission to not want to make one specific change in gasoline pricing policy. It is certainly unacceptable to me as a Senator from a State where the average price of gas is now $2.25 a gallon, but it ought to be unacceptable to Senators from every area of the country.  Here are three examples of the record at the Federal Trade Commission that I wish to change:  First, since taking office, the Bush administration has allowed 33 oil industry mergers, totaling $19.5 billion to go through. Not only has the administration not tried to block any of these mergers, they simply have taken a pass in every respect. To be fair, the Clinton Administration also sat on its hands allowing 21 oil mergers to go through while challenging only one.  The Bloomberg News service recently reported on this issue. It is my own view that unchecked oil company mergers are a significant factor in the rising price of gasoline in the country. But the Federal Trade Commission, in the face of this huge wave of mergers, has simply been sitting on their hands, and yesterday, the nominee to head the Federal Trade Commission gave me no indication there would be a change in the policy of the Federal Trade Commission on the merger issue.  Second, a handful of refiners now control most of the gasoline in our markets. The concentration is especially serious on the west and east coasts. Mr. President, 67 percent of the west coast market and 77 percent of the east coast market is controlled by a handful of refiners--just four companies. Along with this increased concentration of refiners, we have seen a drop in the number of refineries at a critical time when clearly we need more refinery capacity, not less.  Now, I have documented evidence--it is up on my Web site--that refinery shutdowns have been implemented not because of competition but to boost profit. Certainly, in my view, the nominee to head the Federal Trade Commission ought to be looking at this issue of refinery capacity. But yet again, the nominee that I met with yesterday was unwilling to state what, if anything, would change with respect to refinery practices.  Third, the Federal Trade Commission has been unwilling to move against anti-competitive practices that the agency has even documented. Here I am talking about redlining, a tool that is used to wall off a community from competition. So, again, as we have seen in the case of oil company mergers, as we have seen in the case of refinery shutdowns, in this third area, anti-competitive practices such as redlining, the Federal Trade Commission is going to stay on the sidelines, apparently, with a new chair.  Most recently, the Federal Trade Commission, through their general counsel, has essentially said that oil companies can price gouge with impunity. It is an extraordinary statement. It was made in the Bloomberg News service, again. But the general counsel of the Federal Trade Commission has basically said oil companies can do whatever they want. They can move unilaterally, raise prices to essentially any level they would want in certain markets.  So this is what I am concerned about: these questions that are specifically under the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission with respect to mergers, with respect to refinery shutdowns, with respect to anti-competitive practices, such as redlining.  I had hoped that the nominee to chair the agency would be willing to make changes. I provided the nominee in advance--in advance of our meeting--the key questions that I went through with her. Yet, despite that, and despite the fact that I asked for even one example of a policy she would change at the Federal Trade Commission, I was given nothing to indicate that the nominee to head the Federal Trade Commission would buck the pernicious trend across this country that is draining the competition out of gasoline markets across America.  For example, I asked Ms. Majoras about the Federal Trade Commission's lack of response to letters I have sent to the Chair requesting the Federal Trade Commission to investigate Shell Oil's plan to close a 70,000-barrel-per-day refinery in Bakersfield, CA. The Federal Trade Commission sent me a two-paragraph response saying they would seriously consider it.  This is an enormously important issue for those of us on the west coast. I see my friend from Nevada on the Senate floor, who has been eloquent with respect to trying to stand up for the consumer on the gasoline issue. The Presiding Officer, who I have the privilege of serving with, has been long concerned about gasoline prices. This Bakersfield shutdown will have enormous and negative ramifications for the people on the west coast.  But while I have heard repeatedly from the agency--and I heard yesterday from the nominee that this ``sounds like a serious issue''--there was no commitment, none, just like the current FTC Chair, to take any specific action. In addition, the nominee pointed out there may even be a potential conflict of interest with respect to the Bakersfield shutdown because of her current law firm responsibilities and the fact that her current firm represents Chevron.  So, Mr. President, I will say, as I have done in the past, that I am going to keep my door open. I am hopeful, in the course of hearings and debates about the future direction of the Federal Trade Commission, that the nominee will shift course from what I heard yesterday. But I will tell you, it is not enough for the agency to continue to say they are ``seriously concerned'' or they are ``monitoring the situation'' or ``they are troubled by the high prices our constituents are paying.'' That is not enough.  When people up and down the west coast of the United States and across the country are getting shellacked by these gasoline prices, in effect, we are seeing consumers clobbered at the pump with dollars from their own pockets, and then taxpayer dollars are used to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at record prices when it is essentially filled.  We need some changes, and we need changes at the top with respect to gasoline pricing policy in this country. That means the Federal Trade Commission has to get off the sidelines. They have to zero in on the three specific areas I mentioned this morning: oil company mergers; refinery shutdowns; and anti-competitive practices, such as redlining.  For far too many years, Federal Trade Commission political appointees have sat on their hands while the anti-competitive practices of the oil industry gouge American consumers at the gas pump. I have given Ms. Majoras a number of opportunities to explain to me what she plans to do differently as a Commissioner, and she has made it abundantly clear that she has no specific plan to energize the FTC to begin fighting for consumers. I don't intend to allow yet another FTC Commissioner collect a $145,00 salary to do nothing while unnaturally high gas prices jeopardize American jobs and American families.  It is my intention to continue to object to Senate consideration of thenominee to head the Federal Trade Commission until that agency is willing to tell the people of our State and the people of this country that there are going to be some changes and there is going to be some competition again in the gasoline markets of our country.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.                          ____________________
