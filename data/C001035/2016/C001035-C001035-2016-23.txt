President, today I wish to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the town of Georgetown, ME. One of Maine's oldest and most historic communities, Georgetown was built with a spirit of determination and resiliency that still guides the community today, and this tricentennial is a time to celebrate the generations of hard-working and caring people who have made it such a wonderful place to live, work, and raise families.  The year of Georgetown's incorporation, 1716, was but one milestone in a long journey of progress. For thousands of years, the region where the mighty Kennebec River meets the sea served as fishing grounds for the Etchemin Tribe, and the extensive shell middens and other archeological sites are today a treasure trove of this ancient history.  In 1607, the English established Popham Colony on the opposite shore of the Kennebec. This was an event of profound importance to Maine and to our Nation, as the rugged pioneers of the short-lived colony crafted the first oceangoing sailing vessel built in North America and created an industry that remains vital to the Maine economy and to our national security.  Drawn by one of the finest natural harbors in New England, English settlers arrived within a few years of the Pilgrims landing at Plymouth in 1620. The early English influence is underscored by the fact that the first deeds granted to the settlers were signed by the Etchemin Sagamore, who was called Chief Robinhood by the newcomers and whose name lives on at many points of interest throughout the community. By 1716, Georgetown was a growing town with an economy driven by fishing, shipbuilding, and lumber and grain mills. The wealth produced by the sea and by hard work was invested in schools and churches to create a true community.  Today the people of Georgetown continue to build on those traditions. Fishing and boatbuilding are mainstays of the economy. Fine inns and restaurants support a thriving tourism industry. Reid State Park, a gift to the people of Maine from Georgetown businessman and civic leader Walter Reid, offers spectacular scenery and abundant wildlife that makes Georgetown a haven for outdoor enthusiasts and artists. An active historical society, library, and volunteer fire department demonstrate the spirit of this remarkable town.  This landmark anniversary is not just about something that is measured in calendar years. It is an occasion to celebrate the people who for more than three centuries have pulled together, cared for one another, and built a community. Thanks to those who came before, Georgetown has a wonderful history. Thanks to those who are there today, it has a bright future.                          ____________________
