 Again I want to commend him on an outstanding amendment. I have been able to pick up part of the debate, and I might ask my friend from Alabama if one of the arguments being made by those who oppose his amendment is that somehow these lawsuits are not likely to be brought if a lawyer could only bill $250 an hour? Is that, I gather from my friend from Alabama, one of the suggestions being made by the opponents of his amendment, that somehow being restricted to a mere $250 an hour is going to deter the lawyers of America?
