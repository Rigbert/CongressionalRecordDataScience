Speaker, as the price of health care continues to rise, spending on prescription drugs becomes an ever-increasing burden for millions of Americans. A recent study by the PRIME Institute at the University of Minnesota College of Pharmacy shows that producer list prices for the 500 most prescribed drugs climbed an average of 4.6 percent in 1995. This 4.6 percent increase exceeds the 2.6 percent increase in Social Security benefits over the past year. Furthermore, the increase in prescription drug prices is more than twice the increase in the 1995 producer price index. As the prices of prescription drugs continue to outpace the general cost of living for seniors, these Americans on fixed incomes often face the choice between food and medicine.  Consumers and their doctors need comparative information about prescription drug prices to help them reduce spending on prescription drugs without compromising quality. But comparative information is not readily available. Prescription drugs do not sit on grocery shelves with separate price tags under each item. Even doctors often do not know the prices of medications and whether a less expensive but equally effective alternative is available.  The Prescription Drug Consumer Information Act of 1996 will make this essential information more available by directing the Secretary of Health and Human Services [HHS] to publish annually an easy-to-understand consumer guide to prescription drug prices that presents price and cost-effectiveness information by therapeutic category for easy comparison to other drugs and to other therapies.  The guide will provide consumers with the information they need to intelligently discuss the cost effectiveness of various prescription drug options with their doctors and pharmacists. The guide will also provide doctors with information that will help them determine the most cost-effective therapies for their patients. This information is not available anywhere else at this time. The increased availability of price information could also unleash free market forces to help reduce the cost of medications that are excessively priced.  This legislation directs the Secretary of HHS to publish a consumer guide to prescription drug prices annually, beginning no later than 2 years after the legislation is enacted. The guide will be made available electronically--that is, through computer networks--and in print. The Secretary may publish periodic bulletins that reflect changes in the prices in the consumer guide between the dates of annualpublication of the guide. The consumer guide will be provided to public libraries free of charge. The Secretary will also provide the guide to individuals and other organizations for a reasonable fee which is not to exceed the cost of printing and distributing the guide. Organizations representing consumers, seniors, and health professionals will be encouraged to make the consumers guide widely available.  This legislation offers consumers a new tool to help them manage their prescription drug costs. Armed with price information, they will be in a better position to save money without cutting corners on their health care.  I strongly urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in cosponsoring this legislation to help Americans fight the rising cost of health care.                          ____________________
