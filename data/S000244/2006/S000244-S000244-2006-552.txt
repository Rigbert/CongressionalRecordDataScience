Chairman, I yield myself the balance of the time.  Mr. Chairman, I think those of you who have gotten to know me in the time I have been honored to serve here realize that the liberal law professors that instructed me at the University of Wisconsin law school about 40 years ago did not make very much impact then.  And maybe we should not listen to the group of liberal law professors that Mr. Westmoreland cites in support of his amendment today.  The fact is that this amendment turns the Voting Rights Act on its head, because in every one of the 900 jurisdictions, if the Westmoreland amendment is adopted, there is an army of Federal agents, if we fund them, that will come on down, look at everything that has gone on there relative to elections every year.  And of course this is an unfunded mandate, because the local officials that they have to talk are going to have to spend all their time talking to the army of Federal inspectors.  There are a number of other things that are wrong with this amendment as well, because it unconstitutionally requires by statute that the Department of Justice assume a litigation position. That is a violation of separation of powers.  The DOJ lawyers represent the United States of America Government and its people, and they should not have their hands tied, being told that they have to adopt a position even though the position might be contrary to the law that has been passed by the Congress and signed by the President of the United States.  This amendment expands Federal authority by people who have been complaining about Federal authority since the Voting Rights Act was passed 41 years ago. Let's not turn the VRA on its head. Let's reject this amendment. Let's reject all of the amendments  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
