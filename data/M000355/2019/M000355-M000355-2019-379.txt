 I further ask unanimous consent that the confirmation vote on the Hunsaker nomination occur at 4 p.m. on Wednesday, November 6, and that following the disposition of the Hunsaker nomination, the Senate vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the Nardini nomination. Finally, I ask unanimous consent that if cloture is invoked on the Rudofsky, Wilson, and Nardini nominations, that the confirmation votes occur at a time to be determined by the majority leader in consultation with the Democratic leader on Thursday, November 7.
