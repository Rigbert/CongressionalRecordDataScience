President, today I am introducing the Clean Cruise Ship Act of 2009. This bill would address a serious and growing threat to U.S. waters by placing limits on the dumping of wastewater by cruise ships. Cruise ships generate millions of gallons of wastewater every day--much of it vile sewage. These ships can directly dump their waste into the oceans with minimal oversight.  This bill would require cruise ships to obtain permits through EPA's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System in order to discharge sewage, graywater, and bilge water. It also would require cruise ships to upgrade their wastewater treatment systems to meet the standards of today's best available technology. This technology significantly reduces the pollutants that ships discharge and is already being used successfully on cruise ships in Alaska, thanks to that state's forward-thinking regulations.  The problem is real. The number of cruise ship passengers has been growing nearly twice as fast as any other mode of travel. In the U.S. alone the numbers are approaching ten million passengers a year, with some ships carrying 3,000 or more passengers. These ships produce massive amounts of waste: one ship can produce over 200,000 gallons of sewage each week; a million gallons of graywater from kitchens, laundry, and showers; and over 25,000 gallons of oily bilge water that collects in ship bottoms.  I have nothing against cruise vacations. They can be a wonderful way to visit beautiful places. What my bill proposes to do is change the way the cruise ships manage the removal of waste. Here is the unpleasant reality. Within three miles of shore, vessels can discharge human body wastes and other toilet waste provided that a ``marine sanitation device'' is installed. The Environmental Protection Agency released a report in December of 2008, however, that concluded that these systems simply don't work. These sewage treatment devices leave discharges that consistently exceed national effluent standards for fecal coliform and other pathogens and pollutants. In fact, fecal coliform levels in effluent are typically 20 to 200 times greater than in untreated domestic wastewater.  Beyond three miles from shore there are no restrictions on sewage discharge. Cruise ships can directly dump raw sewage into U.S. waters.  The situation with cruise ship graywater also requires attention. While cruise ships must obtain permits to discharge graywater within three miles of the coast, there is still a pollution issue. Graywater from sinks, tubs, and kitchens contains large amounts of pathogens and pollutants. Fecal coliform concentrations, for example, are 10 to 1000 times greater than those in untreated domestic wastewater. These pollutants sicken our marine ecosystems, wash up onto our beaches, and contaminate food and shellfish that end up on our dinner plates.  Beyond 3 miles from shore there are no restrictions on graywater discharge. Cruise ships can directly dump graywater into U.S. waters.  Following the lead of Alaska, the Clean Cruise Ship Act seeks to address these oversights. No discharges would be allowed within twelve miles of shore. Beyond twelve miles, discharges of sewage, graywater, and bilge water would be allowed, provided that they meet national effluent limits consistent with the best available technology. That technology works and is commercially available now. The recent Environmental Protection Agency study found that these ``advanced wastewater treatment'' systems effectively remove pathogens, suspended solids, metals, and oil and grease.  Under this legislation, the release of raw, untreated sewage would be banned. No dumping of sewage sludge and incinerator ash would be allowed in U.S. waters. All cruise ships calling on U.S. ports would have to dispose of hazardous waste in accordance with the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. The bill would establish inspection and enforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance.  The protection of U.S. waters is vital to our Nation's health and economy. The oceans not only support the life of nearly 50 percent of all species on Earth, but they also provide 20 percent of the animal protein and 5 percent of the total protein in the human diet.  Some cruise ship companies already are trying to improve their environmental footprint. They also want to preserve the environment that attracts their passengers. But the efforts between cruise ship companies are not uniform. A Federal standard would apply one set of requirements to all companies.  It is time to bring the cruise ship industry into the 21st century. It is time to update the laws that protect our oceans, and urge adoption of the best available wastewater treatment technology at sea.  Working together, we can support the industry while protecting the natural treasures that are our oceans. I think the approach taken in the Clean Cruise Ship Act will achieve that goal. I encourage my colleagues here in the Senate to work with me to pass legislation that will put a stop to the dumping of hazardous pollutants along our coasts. Together we can clean up this major source of pollution that is harming our waters.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1820       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Clean Cruise Ship Act of      2009''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--       (1) cruise ships carry millions of passengers through North      American waters each year, showcase some of the most      beautiful ocean and coastal environments in the United      States, and provide opportunities for passengers to relax and      enjoy oceans and marine ecosystems;       (2) the number of cruise passengers continues to grow,      making the cruise industry one of the fastest growing tourism      sectors in the world;       (3) in 2007, more than 10,000,000 passengers departed from      North America on thousands of cruise ships;       (4) during the 2 decades preceding the date of enactment of      this Act, the average cruise ship size has increased at a      rate of approximately 90 feet every 5 years;       (5) an average-sized cruise vessel generates millions of      gallons of liquid waste and many tons of solid waste;       (6) in just 1 week, a 3000-passenger cruise ship generates      approximately 210,000 gallons of human sewage, 1,000,000      gallons of water from showers and sinks and dishwashing water      (commonly known as ``graywater''), 37,000 gallons of oily      bilge water, more than 8 tons of solid waste, and toxic      wastes from dry cleaning and photo-processing laboratories;       (7) in an Environmental Protection Agency survey of 29      ships traveling in Alaskan waters, reported sewage generation      rates ranged from 1,000 to 74,000 gallons per day per vessel,      with the average volume of sewage generated being 21,000      gallons per day per vessel;       (8) those frequently untreated cruise ship discharges      deliver nutrients, hazardous substances, pharmaceuticals, and      human pathogens, including viruses and bacteria, directly      into the marine environment;       (9) in the final report of the United States Commission on      Ocean Policy, that Commission found that cruise ship      discharges, if not treated and disposed of properly, and the      cumulative impacts caused when cruise ships repeatedly visit      the same environmentally sensitive areas, ``can be a      significant source of pathogens and nutrients with the      potential to threaten human health and damage shellfish beds,      coral reefs, and other aquatic life'';       (10) pollution from cruise ships not only has the potential      to threaten marine life and human health through consumption      of contaminated seafood, but also poses a health risk for      recreational swimmers, surfers, and other beachgoers;       (11) according to the Environmental Protection Agency,      ``Sewage may host many pathogens of concern to human health,      including Salmonella, Shigella, Hepatitis A and E, and      gastro-intestinal viruses. Sewage contamination in swimming      areas and shellfish beds poses potential risks to human      health and the environment by increasing the rate of      waterborne illnesses'';       (12) the nutrient pollution from human sewage discharges      from cruise ships can contribute to the incidence of harmful      algal blooms;       (13) algal blooms have been implicated in the deaths of      marine life, including the deaths of more than 150 manatees      off the coast of Florida;       (14) in a 2005 report requested by the International      Council of Cruise Lines, the Science Panel of the Ocean      Conservation and Tourism Alliance recommended that--       (A) ``[a]ll blackwater should be treated'';       (B) treated blackwater should be ``avoided in ports, close      to bathing beaches or water bodies with restricted      circulation, flushing or inflow''; and       (C) blackwater should not be discharged within 4 nautical      miles of shellfish beds, coral reefs, or other sensitive      habitats;       (15) that Science Panel further recommended that graywater      be treated in the same manner as blackwater and that sewage      sludge be off-loaded to approved land-based facilities;       (16) in a summary of recommendations for addressing      unabated point sources of pollution, the Pew Oceans      Commission states that, ``Congress should enact legislation      that regulates wastewater discharges from cruise ships under      the Clean Water Act by establishing uniform minimum standards      for discharges in all State waters and prohibiting discharges      within the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone that do not meet      effluent standards.''; and       (17) a comprehensive statutory regime for managing      pollution discharges from cruise vessels, applicable      throughout the United States, is needed--       (A) to protect coastal and ocean areas from pollution      generated by cruise vessels;       (B) to reduce and better regulate discharges from cruise      vessels; and       (C) to improve monitoring, reporting, and enforcement of      standards regarding discharges.       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to amend the      Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.)      to establish national standards and prohibitions for      discharges from cruise vessels.
