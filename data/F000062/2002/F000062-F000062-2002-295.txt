 Our intent in drafting the amendment was that the sugar that comes in is within the program, not outside the program. But only 40 countries now covered by the program are eligible to participate. If there is an inadvertent error, we will be happy to correct it.  The intent is that it be within the program. Then, from a country that is in the program but is not using its allocation, and sold on a first-come-first-served basis, so if the price is going to be changed, there will not be a buyer for the sugar.
