 President, I rise to introduce the Adoptive Family Relief Act, which would provide support and relief to American families seeking to bring their adoptive children from the Democratic Republic of Congo home to the U.S. It would also provide relief to similarly situated adoptive families should barriers arise in other countries in the future. I thank my colleagues, Senators Ron Johnson, Chuck Grassley, Mitch McConnell, Amy Klobuchar, Barbara Boxer, and Bob Corker for joining me as original cosponsors.  Within the past few years, over 350 American families have successfully adopted children from the Democratic Republic of Congo. However, since September 25, 2013, they have not been able to bring their adoptive children home to the United States because the Democratic Republic of Congo suspended the issuance of ``exit permits'' for these children until its parliament passes new laws regarding international adoption. These exit permits are necessary for adopted children to leave the Democratic Republic of Congo and be united with their American families in the U.S. As the permit suspension drags on, however, American families are repeatedly paying visa renewal and related fees, while also continuing to be separated from their adopted kids.  The Adoptive Families Relief Act would grant flexibility to the United States Department of State to waive immigrant visa renewal fees for adoptive American parents in extraordinary circumstances like this, where the cause of delay is due to factors not in the control of the child or parents. The Department of State is fully supportive of this legislation and is eager to provide some relief to the many families who are affected.  Under current law, adopted children from abroad must secure U.S. immigrant visas in order to travel to the United States to unite with their adoptive parents. However, these visas expire after 6 months. Ordinarily, such visas are used within the allotted 6 months. However, in rare circumstances, such as the suspension of exit permits in the Democratic Republic of Congo, adopted children are prohibited from leaving their country of birth and cannot use their U.S.-issued visas within the prescribed timeframe.  Adoptive parents consequently pay $325 in visa renewal fees every 6 months if they want to preserve the validity of their adopted child's visa to travel to the U.S. To renew the visa, the child must also complete another medical exam, which costs the child's adoptive family approximately $200. Many families from across the country have already paid for at least three visas, which amounts to $975 per child, plus costs for medical exams. Additionally, many families are also paying monthly childcare or foster care fees, and some families have adopted more than one child. So, in addition to the emotional stress of being separated from their adoptive children, American parents face a financial burden while the situation goes unresolved.  This bill would not change any of the substantive requirements for issuance of a renewed visa, such as necessary medical exams and background checks. It simply allows the Department of State to waive the visa renewal fee to alleviate the financial burden imposed on American families to renew their child's visa, and reimburses those who have already renewed their child's visa since the exit permit suspension.  The Department of State does not anticipate this waiver authority to be used broadly based on its past experiences and its other adoption programs abroad. The bill would not be a financial burden on the United States. According to the State Department, once the initial visa, which the parents must pay for, is issued, the subsequent work for consular officers involved with renewing a visa is relatively quick and simple. The work involved to renew the visa therefore does not amount to the full cost of the visa renewal fee, so the State Department maintains it would not impact its consular resources.  This legislation builds on the efforts of other members who have tried to resolve the Democratic Republic of Congo's exit permit suspension in various ways. Last April, 171 Members of Congress sent a letter to Democratic Republic of Congo President Joseph Kabila asking for his intervention. In June of 2014, 167 Members of Congress also sent a letter to President Obama requesting his outreach to President Kabila to resolve this situation. Members of Congress sent a letter to the Democratic Republic of Congo Parliament offering technical assistance on October 28, 2014, and the Senate passed S. Res. 502 in the 113th Congress, concerning the Democratic Republic of Congo's suspension of exit permits for Congolese adopted children. This year, the Senate passed an amendment to promote the return of legally adopted children from the Democratic Republic of Congo. My Senate colleagues and our staff have met with our constituents directly affected by the Democratic Republic of Congo's exit permit suspension, and heard their call for help. Furthermore, I, and other Senators, have also had individual meetings with Congolese Ambassador to the U.S., Faida Mitifu.  However, since the exit permit suspension continues despite these efforts, it is imperative to bring some relief to our American adoptive parents. While we continue to urge the Democratic Republic of Congo to lift its exit permit suspension, I urge my colleagues to pass the Adoptive Family Relief Act to provide some relief to American families caught powerless in this difficult situation. Should other adoptive parents face similar obstacles in the future with their adoption process in other countries, this bill will also serve as a source of relief to them.                          ____________________
