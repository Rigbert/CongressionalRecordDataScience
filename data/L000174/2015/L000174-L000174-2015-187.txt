President, additionally, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from the major technology industry companies and trade associations in support of the USA FREEDOM Act.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                     May 11, 2015.     Hon. John Boehner,     The Capitol, Washington, DC.     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,     The Capitol, Washington, DC.       Dear Speaker Boehner and Democratic Leader Pelosi: We, the      undersigned technology associations and groups, write to      express our strong support for H.R 2048, the USA Freedom Act,      as reported by the House Judiciary Committee on April 30th by      a vote of 25 to two.       Public trust in the technology sector is critical, and that      trust has declined measurably among both U.S. citizens and      citizens of our foreign allies since the revelations      regarding the U.S. surveillance programs began 2 years ago.      As a result of increasing concern about the level of access      the U.S. government has to user-generated data held by      technology companies, many domestic and foreign users have      turned to foreign technology providers while, simultaneously,      foreign jurisdictions have implemented reactionary policies      that threaten the fabric of the borderless internet.       The USA Freedom Act as introduced in the House and Senate      on April 28th offers an effective balance that both protects      privacy and provides the necessary tools for national      security, and we congratulate those who participated in the      bipartisan, bicameral effort that produced the legislative      text. Critically, the bill ends the indiscriminate collection      of bulk data, avoids data retention mandates, and creates a      strong transparency framework for both government and private      companies to report national security requests.       Meaningful surveillance reform is vital to rebuilding the      essential element of trust not only in the technology sector      but also in the U.S. government. With 21 days remaining until      the sunset of certain national security authorities, we urge      you to swiftly move to consider and pass the USA Freedom Act      without harmful amendments.
