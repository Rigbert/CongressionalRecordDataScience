President, a few weeks ago I had the opportunity to visit with one of my true heroes, Benjamin Netanyahu, who was here and graced us with his presence this week. Last March, I was in Jerusalem, had some quality time with him, and we kind of relived the experiences we have had in the past when he was Prime Minister before. That was back in the middle 1990s. I had a chance to talk to him. As I recall, his concern at that time--what he said at that time--two major concerns. One is, what is happening in Iran, and then, of course, making sure that the land in Israel right now will stay there.  Recently, I had a chance to visit with him again. I was quite surprised when he came here and he was met with this suggestion that things are going to change and that maybe we would encourage Israel to go back to their 1967 borders.  I can assure you that we will do everything we can to keep that from happening. I want to make sure we get the message out there, that this may be President Obama talking, it is not the majority of people in America, as was witnessed by the 30 standing ovations that Prime Minister Netanyahu got in his joint speech.  It sounded familiar when we are talking about this, about the land. I remembered that it was 10 years ago--10 years ago right now, 2001--that I made a speech, and it jogged my memory when I heard the President talking about going back to the 1967 borders. So I dug up that speech. I found it, and I found that it is so appropriate today.  This was a speech, by the way--the research done for this speech was done by a guy named Willie George. He was a preacher, a pastor, but a historian. I want to put the same perspective on this we did 10 years ago and see how that applies today.  First of all, I am going to do something that is unusual on the floor of the Senate; that is, I am going quote Ephesians 6. Listen carefully. It says: For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of darkness of this world, against spirit wickedness in high places.  It is significant that we look at that, because make no mistake about it, the war that was started 10 years ago and the war we are in right now, that we are fighting now, is first and foremost a spiritual war, not a political war--never has been a political war. It is not about politics. It is a spiritual war. It has its roots in spiritual conflict. It is a war to destroy the very fabric of our society and the very things for which we stand.  Many of the wars in history are wars where people are trying to take over something another country has. That is not what this is about. Not about getting mineral deposits, not about getting land from other countries. This is a different war.  It is not simple greed that motivates these people to kill. One may ask, what is it about our Nation that makesthem--here I am talking about some of the Hamas, Hezbollah, the terrorists--hate us so much? I suggest there are three things. First, in our country we have the freedom and the right to choose the kind of worship we want. I happen to be a Jesus guy, a born-again Christian, all that. I believe the way to the Lord God is through his Son.  While I believe that, I believe every American has the right to choose whether he or she wants to believe that. Some people have the notion that if you are a Christian who believes in the Bible, you are totally intolerant, you do not allow other people to have a choice. Nothing can be further from the truth.  The nations of this world where Christianity is the dominant way of worship, we also find Jewish synagogues, we find Islamic mosques, we find freedom of worship. You will not find the same kind of things in the militant Islamic nations of this world. They do not allow Christian churches. They do not allow synagogues to open freely. They do not allow people the freedom. They persecute people. So one of the reasons America is hated so much is that we have allowed people through the years to choose what they are going to do. It is their choice.  The second reason we are hated so much is we have opened the door for people to achieve their God-given place on this Earth. We have not restrained people. We have allowed people freedom of expression, the freedom to pursue dreams, the freedom to pursue goals. This is not true in other places in the world. These freedoms are not found in every nation. America is great because we have magnified the rights of individuals, protected the rights of individuals in our culture. We are careful to allow people to have expressions in our society, and we are hated for it.  The third reason we are hated by these people is because we are a nation of laws. We are a people ruled by laws. Lest one think that is common, go around the world and look at these other countries in the world. Most of the world's countries do not have a 200-year-old Constitution. They are ruled by dictators. They are ruled by the whims of those leaders or by political parties as they change. The rule of law is what makes civilization possible. The rule of law is what makes an orderly society work. If there is no rule of law, the strongest, toughest bully on the block is the one who is running the country. America is a country of law and order. Because of this philosophy of the people who founded our Nation, they believed in the rule of law because of what they knew from the Bible. Our Constitution and the constitutions of most governments around the world, similar to ours, are, indeed, based on the Ten Commandments. Our fathers knew the Ten Commandments and the laws of God should be a basis for all laws. They understood the concept of absolute right and absolute wrong. There were not many who believed in what we call today situational ethics or where things change according to our needs. They believed in absolute right and absolute wrong. That is the reason we are hated so much as a nation.  We are hated because we are a beacon of light, a beacon of freedom all the way around the world. We know contemporarily what that means. One of the greatest speeches of all time that I remember is a speech that was made by Ronald Reagan. It is called a Rendezvous with Destiny. In this speech he talked about--this was back when Castro had first taken over Cuba. He talked about the atrocities in Communist Cuba, and people were trying to escape. One man escaped in a small boat, as many others did. He lived and reached the coast of Florida. As his boat floated up on the coast, he started telling the people who were there about the atrocities in Communist Cuba. A lady responded and said: Well, I guess we in this country do not know how lucky we are. He said: No. It is how lucky we are, because we had a place to escape to.  What he was saying is we were that beacon of freedom. And we are hated because we are a beacon of freedom. That is the third reason for the rest of the world. We are hated because in America we have the freedom of choice, the freedom of worship; we have freedom of expression; we are a nation of laws.  Why was America attacked on September 11? Why did they single us out? America was attacked because of our system of values. It is a spiritual war, not just because we are Israel's best friend. We are Israel's best friend in the world because of the character we have as a nation. One of the reasons God has blessed our country is because we have honored His people.  Right up on there on your desk, Mr. President, you have a Bible. Look up Genesis 12:3. It says, ``I will bless them that bless you and curse him that curses you.''  He was talking about Israel. One of the reasons America has been blessed abundantly over the years is because we as a society have opened our doors to the Jewish people. The Jewish people have been blessed in the United States of America.  When the tiny state of Israel was founded in 1948, we stood in beginning with Israel. We were the first country to stand for Israel. And because we took a stand, other nations in the world took a stand. They followed quickly. The United States made it possible for there to be an Israel. We stood with Israel again and again in its fight to survive. Make no mistake about it, it is not just because of our support of Israel, it is what we believe as a nation that caused us to come under attack.  Israel is under attack in the Middle East because it is the only true democracy that exists in the Middle East. There are more than 20 Arab countries that are in northern Africa and in the Middle East, and nearly every one of those is run by a dictator. Israel is the only true democracy that exists in the Middle East.  Did you know, if you are an Arab in Israel, and you are an Israeli citizen as an Arab, you can vote in the elections? In fact, in the Knesset--that is their Congress--they have a political party that is for Arabs. They have their own party in the Knesset.  Israel is the only true democracy that exists in the Middle East. It has a Western form of government based on the laws we see in the Bible. The laws of God our country is based on are the same laws from which Israel gets its laws--it represents the laws of God. That is the reason it is under attack.  We ought to be Israel's best friend. If we cannot stand for Israel today, can we ever again be counted on as a beacon, a beacon of freedom for the oppressed nations? You may ask, what does this have to do with the attack on America that happened 10 years ago. We are under attack because of our character, and because we have supported the tiny little nation in the Middle East. That is why we are under attack. If we do not stand for this tiny country today, when do we start standing for tiny little countries in the world?  Many years ago, Yasser Arafat and others did not recognize Israel's right to the land, very much like our President Obama. Even today, many do not recognize Israel's right to exist. There are seven reasons I consider to be indisputable and incontrovertible evidence and grounds to Israel's right to the land. You have heard this before, because you heard it from me 10 years ago. It was similar. It is in the Record now. I kept it.  Most know this, that they are going to be hit by skeptics who are going to say we are being attacked all because of our support for Israel, and if we get out of the Middle East, all of the problems will go away. That is not so. It is not true. We all know in our hearts it is not true. If we withdraw, it would come to our door. It would not go away.  I have some observations to make about that in a minute. But first, I am going to tell you the seven reasons that Israel has the right to the land. I am saying this because I am still in shock over what happened this last week. But I am relieved from the response we got from this great man, Prime Minister Netanyahu.  Israel has the right to the land--reason No. 1--because of all of the archeological evidence. This is reason No. 1. It supports it. Every time there is a dig in Israel, it does nothing but support the fact that Israelis have had a presence there in that land for over 3,000 years, the coins, the cities, the pottery, the culture. There are other people and other groups there, but there is no mistaking the fact that the Israelis have been present for 3,000 years. It predatesany claim any other people in the region might have. Ancient Philistines are extinct. They are not around anymore. Many other ancient people are extinct. They do not have an unbroken line to this day that the Israelis have.  Even the Egyptians of today are not racial Egyptians of 2,000 years ago. They are primarily an Arab people. The land is called Egypt, but they are not the same racial and ethnic stock as old Egyptians of the ancient world. The Israelis are, in fact, descended from the original Israelites. The first proof then is the archeological proof.  The second proof of Israel's right to the land is the historic one. History supports it totally, completely. We know there has been an Israel up until the time of the Roman Empire. The Romans conquered the land. Israel had no homeland. Although Jews were allowed to live there, they were driven from the land and dispersed in 70 AD and 135 AD. But there was always a Jewish presence in the land. The Turks who took over about 700 years ago and ruled the land up until about World War I had control. Then the land was conquered by the British. The Turks entered World War I on the side of Germany. The British knew they had to do something to punish the Turks and also to break up the empire that was going to be a part of the whole effort of Germany in World War I. So the British sent troops against the Turks in the Holy Land. This is a good one.  Of the generals who led the British into the Holy Land was a guy named Allenby. He was a general. He was a Bible-believing Christian. He carried a Bible with him everywhere he went. He knew the significance of Jerusalem. The flight before the attack against Jerusalem, to drive out the Turks, Allenby prayed that God would allow him to capture the city without doing damage to the holy places.  That day Allenby--this is World War I now, keep in mind. He sent a bunch of biplanes into the Holy Land as a reconnaissance mission. You have to understand, these Turks had never seen a biplane. They had never seen any kind of airplane. They looked up and they saw these cute little machines flying around. They are terrified.  Then they were told that they were being opposed by a man named Allenby. This is a true story. History supports it. Allenby--in their language--means ``man sent from God'' or ``prophet from God.'' They dared not fight against a prophet from God. So the next morning, when Allenby went into Jerusalem, he went in, he captured it without firing a shot. And that is history. That is actually what happened. That is the history we are talking about.  Out of gratitude to the Jews, and out of gratitude to the Jewish bankers and the financiers and others who lent the financial help on the homeland, the Jewish people--the homeland that is now Israel, and all of what was then the nation of Jordan, was given to the Jewish people.  The homeland that Britain said it would set aside consisted of what is now Israel and what then was Jordan, the whole thing. That was what the British promised the Jews in 1917. In the beginning, there was some Arab population there and some Arab support for this gift. There was not a huge Arab population in the land at the time. There was a reason for that. The land wasn't able to sustain any kind of a large population. The people didn't have the development needed to handle any kind of population of the land. It wasn't wanted by anyone at that time. Can you believe it wasn't wanted at that time by anyone?  You remember Mark Twain--Samuel Clemens--who wrote ``Huckleberry Finn'' and ``Tom Sawyer.'' He took a tour of the Holy Land in 1867. This is what he said about Israel:       A desolate country whose soil is rich enough but is given      over wholly to weeds, a silent mournful expanse. We never saw      a human being on the whole route. There was hardly a tree or      a shrub anywhere. Even the olive and the cactus, those fast      friends of worthless soil, had almost deserted the country.  Where was this great Palestine at that time? It wasn't there. The Palestinians weren't there. Palestine didn't exist. Palestine was a region named by the Romans, but at the time it was under the control of the Turks. There was no population there because the land would not support it. There was the Palestinian Royal Commission that was created by the British. It quotes an account of the conditions on the coastal plain along with the Mediterranean Sea in 1913. This is what they said about Israel at that time:       The road leading from Gaza to the north was only a summer      track, suitable for transport by camels or carts. No orange      groves, orchards, or vineyards were to be seen until one      reached the Yavnev village. Houses were mud. Schools did not      exist. The western part toward the sea was almost desert. The      villages were few and thinly populated. Many villages were      deserted by their inhabitants.  The French author Voltaire described Palestine as ``a hopeless, dreary place.''  In short, under the Turks, the land suffered from neglect and low population. It is a historical fact. The nation became populated with both Jews and Arabs. The land came to prosper when Jews came back and began to reclaim it. Historically, they began to reclaim it. Even if there had never been any archeological evidence to support the rights of the Israelis to the territory, it is important to recognize that other nations in the area have no longstanding claim to the country either.  This may surprise you. I will say that Saudi Arabia was not created until 1913, Lebanon, in 1920, and Iraq didn't exist as a nation until 1932, Syria until 1941. The borders of Jordan were established in 1946 and Kuwait in 1961.  Any of these nations that would say Israel is only a recent arrival would have to deny their own rights, as they were recent arrivals as well. They didn't exist as countries. They were all under the control of the Turks. Historically, the land was given to the Israelis in 1917, and then, of course, we know Israel gained its independence in 1948.  So we have the archeological reasons. We have seven reasons. Here is the third reason. The third reason the land belongs to Israel is because of the practical value of the Israelis being there. Israel today is a modern marvel of agriculture. Israel is able to bring more food out of a desert environment than any other country in the world. The Arab nations ought to make Israel their friend and import technology from Israel that would allow all the Middle East, not just Israel, to be exporters of food. So Israel, unarguably, has success in agriculture. They have been able to develop when nobody else has.  The fourth reason I believe Israel has a right to the land is on the grounds of humanitarian concerns. There were 6 million Jews slaughtered in Europe in World War II. The persecution against the Jews was very strong in Russia since the advent of communism. Persecution was against the Jews even before that time under the czars.  These people have a right to their homeland. If we are not going to allow them a homeland in the Middle East, then where? What other nation on Earth is going to cede territory? They are not asking for a great deal. The whole nation of Israel fits into my State of Oklahoma seven times. So on humanitarian grounds alone, Israel ought to have the land.  The fifth reason I disagree with President Obama and think Israel should have the right to the land, without any changes and not going back to 1967, is because it is a strategic ally to the United States. Whether we realize it, Israel is a detriment, an impediment to certain groups hostile to democracies and to those things we believe in, hostile to the very things that make us the greatest Nation in the history of the world. Israel has kept them from taking complete control of the Middle East. If it were not for Israel, they would overrun the region. Israel is our only strategic ally.  It is good to know we have a friend in the Middle East we can count on. They vote with us in the U.N. more than England, Germany, Canada, and France--more than any other country in the world. So they have been our consistent ally for strategic reasons.  The sixth reason Israel should be entitled to the land is that Israel is a roadblock to terrorism. The war we are now facing is not a war against a sovereign nation, it is a fluid group of terrorists moving from one country to another. They are almost invisible. That is whom we are fighting against. We need every ally we can get. If we do not stop terrorism in the Middle East, it will be on our shores. I have said this and said this and said this.  One of the reasons I believe that spiritual door was opened for an attack against the United States is becausethe policy of our government has been to ask the Israelis, and demand with pressure, that they not retaliate against the terrorist attacks that have been launched against them.  Since its independence in 1948, Israel has fought four wars, and they were not the aggressor in any of them. Some people may argue that they were the first ones there with Egypt. Everybody knew what was going to happen in Egypt. Israel was attacked in all four cases. Israel won all four wars against the impossible odds. They are great warriors. I have spent some time over there. They consider it a level playing field when they are outnumbered 2 to 1. They are great people.  There were 39 Scud missiles that landed on Israeli soil during the gulf war. Our President asked Israel not to respond. Our policy was trying to get them not to respond. We asked them not to respond. In order to have the Arab nations on board, we asked Israel not even to participate in the war. They showed incredible restraint, and they did not. We asked them to stand back and not do anything over these attacks.  We have criticized them. They have been criticized in our media, local people in television and radio offer criticisms of Israel not knowing the true issues. We need to be informed.  Years ago, I was so thrilled when I heard a reporter pose a question to our former Secretary of State, Colin Powell, during the gulf war. He said:       Mr. Powell, the United States has advocated a policy of      restraint in the Middle East. We have discouraged Israel from      retaliation again and again and again, because we have said      that it leads to continued escalation--that it escalates the      violence.  He said:       Are we [the United States] going to follow that preaching      ourselves?  Mr. Powell indicated we would strike back. In other words, we can tell Israel not to do it, but when it hits us, we are going to do it. That is one of the reasons I believe the door was opened--because we held back our tiny little friend. We have not allowed them to go to the heart of the problem. This was a mistake.  Terrorism is not going to go away. If Israel were driven into the sea tomorrow, if every Jew in the Middle East were killed, terrorism would not end. You know that in your heart. Terrorism would continue.  It is not just a matter of Israel in the Middle East; it is the heart of the very people who are perpetuating this stuff. Should they be successful in overrunning Israel--they will not be--but should they be, it would not be enough. They would never be satisfied. We learned that at Camp David.  The seventh reason--and this will upset some people, but I have to say it, and it is printed up there--that Israel has a right to the land--and this is the most important reason--because God said so. As I said a minute ago, look it up in the book of Genesis. In Genesis 13, verse 14, 15 and 17, the Bible says:       The Lord said to Abram, ``Lift up now your eyes, and look      from the place where you are northward, and southward,      eastward, and westward: for all the land which you see, to      you will I give it, and to your seed forever. . . . Arise,      walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth      of it; for I will give it to thee.  That is God talking about Israel.  The Bible says that Abram removed his tent and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which is what we call the Hebron, and built there an altar before the Lord. Hebron is in the West Bank, right here on the map. It is this place where God appeared to Abram and said: ``I am giving you this land,'' the West Bank.  Everybody will yell and scream because I am quoting the Bible, but that is their problem, not mine.  This is not a political battle at all; it is a contest over whether the Word of God is true.  The seven reasons, I am convinced, clearly establish that Israel has a right to the land.  Years ago on the lawn of the White House, Yitzhak Rabin shook hands with PLO Chairman Yasir Arafat. It was a historic occasion. It was a tragic occasion.  At the time, the official policy of the government of Israel began to be ``let us appease the terrorists. Let us begin to trade the land for peace.'' They tried. This process continued unabated. Here in our own Nation, at Camp David in the summer of 2000--I remember it so well--then-Prime Minister Ehud Barak offered the most generous concessions to Yasir Arafat that had ever been laid on the table.  He offered him more than 90 percent of all of the West Bank territory, sovereign control of it. There were some parts he didn't want to offer, but in exchange for that, he said he would give up land in Israel proper that the PLO was not even asking for. He also did the unthinkable--we cannot imagine it today. He even talked about dividing Jerusalem and allowing the Palestinians to have their capital in the east. Arafat stormed out of the meeting. Why would he do that? Everything he asked for was offered to him.  A couple months later, there began to be riots and terrorism. The riots began when Ariel Sharon went to the Temple Mount--and we remember this. This was used as the thing that lit the fire and caused the explosion. This is the excuse the terrorists used.  Did you know Sharon did not go to the Temple Mount unannounced? He contacted the Islamic authorities before he went. He secured their permission. He had permission to be there. It was no surprise. Their response was carefully calculated. They knew they would not pay attention to the details. So they would portray this in the Arab world as an attack on the holy mosque. They would portray it as an attack on that mosque and use it as an excuse to riot. We know what happened since that time. Over the following years, during the time of the peace process, where the Israeli public has pressured its leaders to give up land for peace because they are tired of fighting, there has been increased terror.  It hasn't helped, hasn't worked. Nothing worked. It has been greater than at any other time in Israel's history. Showing restraint and giving in hasn't produced any kind of peace. It is so much so that the leftist peace movement in Israel didn't exist because the people felt they were deceived.  They did offer a hand of peace, and it was not taken. That is why the politics of Israel have changed drastically. The Israelis have come to see that ``no matter what we do, these people do not want to deal with us. They want to destroy us.'' That is why even yet today the stationery of the PLO has upon it a map of the entire State of Israel, not just the tiny part they call the West Bank. They want it all.  The unwavering loyalty we have received from our only consistent friend in the Middle East has to be respected and appreciated by us. No longer should foreign policy in the Middle East be one of appeasement. As Hiram Mann said:       No man survives when freedom falls. The best men rot in      filthy jails and those who cried ``appease, appease'' are      hanged by those they tried to please.  Islamic fundamentalist terrorism came to America on 9/11. We have to use all our friends and assets, all our resources, to defeat the satanic evil.  Patrick Henry said:       We will not fight our battles alone. There is a just God      who reigns over the destiny of nations who will raise up      friends who will fight our battles with us.  He said:       We are not weak if we make a proper use of those means      which the God of nature hath placed in our power. The      millions of people, armed in the holy cause of liberty, and      in such a country as that which we possess, are invincible by      any force which our enemy can send against us.  Listen to this:       We will not fight our battles alone. There is a just God      who reigns over the destiny of nations who will raise up      friends who will fight our battles with us.  He was talking about all of our friends, including Israel. That is what is happening. I thank God Israel is in the battle by our side. It is time for our policy of appeasement in the Middle East and appeasement to the terrorists to be over. With our partners, our victory must and will be absolute.  I mentioned that a few weeks ago I was with Prime Minister Netanyahu in Israel. At that time, he had this growing concern for the land. We did not know what was coming. We did not know what was going to happen. We did not know that which did happen just a week ago was going to happen. I quote from the Associated Press. I am so proud of him. Think of the courage it took for Prime Minister Netanyahu to stand next to the most powerful man in the world and make a statement like this. He said:       [He] sat alongside President Barack Obama on Friday and      declared that Israel would not withdraw to the 1967 borders      to help make way for an adjacent Palestinian state. Obama had      called on Israel to be willing to do just that thing a day      earlier.       Prime Minister Netanyahu said his Nation could not      negotiate with a newly constituted Palestinian unity      government that includes the radical Hamas movement, which      refuses to recognize Israel's right to exist.  And its commitment to Israel's destruction.  Those are the seven reasons I believe the land belongs to Israel. We need to respect that, and we need to declare: God bless Israel.                          ____________________
