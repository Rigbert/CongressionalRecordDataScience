 Let me just indicate that there will be a number of amendments. I think our colleagues ought to stay relatively close to the floor when we get into a series of amendments. I share the majority leader's view that hopefully we will finish that bill tonight. But I do think it would be a good idea for people to stay close to the Chamber when we get into the so-called vote-o-rama.  With regard to the consent agreement, I have no objection.
