Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer my full support for House Concurrent Resolution 128, authorizing the use of the Capitol Grounds for the 2003 DC Special Olympics Law Enforcement Torch Run.  This event occurs in over 35 countries, but was founded by the Chief of Police in Wichita, Kansas, who saw a unique opportunity to raise funds and increase awareness about the Special Olympics. The event was then adopted by the International Association of Police Chiefs.  This is the 18th year the event has been held on the Capitol Grounds, and each year it is the largest single grass-roots fundraising event for the Special Olympics.  Every two years, law enforcement officers representing their State or Nation's Torch Run program comprise a final leg team which carries the ``Flame of Hope'' into the opening ceremonies of the Special Olympics World Games.  I am proud to support this resolution, and encourage my colleagues to do the same.
