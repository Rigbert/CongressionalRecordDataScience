 President, I am introducing today the Landfill Technical Improvement Act of 1995. This legislation will allow us to maximize technical advances of the last decade in carrying out our Nation's environmental protection strategy. It will also promote small business and entrepreneurship and help our Nation complete in the global market for new, environment driven technologies.  By passing the 1984 Hazardous and Solid Waste amendments, Congress required the Environmental Protection Agency [EPA] to issue regulations restricting the disposal of organic absorbents in hazardous waste landfills. In the past decade, however, developments in natural absorbent technologies show more efficiency than traditional sorbents produced for fossil fuels.  For example, a company in Bellingham, WA, manufactures organic sorbents from a local paper mill's sludge. Sludge recycled into productive use is kept out of landfills. This small company employs 20 to 30 Washingtonians and, with other similar companies across the country, seeks to expand in the marketplace with this new, recycled product.  Normal landfill conditions are anaerobic, and studies have shown that no biodegradtion takes place in the anaerobic environment of landfills. Thus, in this anaerobic environment of RCRA landfills, these sorbents will not degrade. These organic absorbents, made totally from reclaimed materials, may actually outperform current chemical absorbents. However, because of the 1984 amendments and subsequent EPA regulations, these absorbents have been effectively shut out from disposition in landfills.  This disposition issue threatens to undermine the existence of these new technologies, since that which cannot be disposed economically will not be [[Page S5422]] used. Moreover, innovative and environmentally conscious technologies, such as those developed by this small company in my State, are discriminated against.  The administration has clearly stated its preference for such recycled/reclaimed materials, but this flawed regulation has prejudiced the widespread availability and use of these products. This is to the detriment of our national environmental goals.  This bill remedies this situation, allowing the fullest use of environmentally sound landfill technologies.                                 ______      By
