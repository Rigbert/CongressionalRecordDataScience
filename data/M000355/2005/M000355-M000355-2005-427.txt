 President, I ask the Senate to pause for a moment today in loving memory and honor of Sergeant Michael Duane Acklin II.  Sergeant Acklin of Louisville, KY, served with the First Battalion, 320th Field Artillery, 101st Airborne Division. Nearly 2 years ago, he gave his life in defense of our country in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul. He was 25 years old and had served in the Army for 5 years.  On November 15, 2003, Sergeant Acklin was on an evening patrol over Mosul in a Blackhawk helicopter, and his team was responding to an ambush of a squad of American soldiers on the ground. As the helicopter hovered above the fight, a second helicopter, which had also come to help, was struck by a rocket-propelled grenade.  That helicopter lost control and hit Sergeant Acklin's aircraft, cutting off the tail rotor of Sergeant Acklin's helicopter. Both helicopters lost control and crashed, killing 17 soldiers. Sergeant Acklin was one of them. It was the largest loss of American lives during a single incident in Iraq at the time.  Sergeant Acklin was buried in Louisville at the Zachary Taylor National Cemetery, named for America's 12th President who is also laid to rest there. For his valor, Sergeant Acklin was awarded the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart. During his service, he also received the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal and the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal.  Michael attended Butler High School and then Western High School, where he graduated in 1996. After graduation, he worked as a bus boy, a cook, and at several other temporary jobs, but none gave Michael the challenge or the fulfillment that he was looking for. Then he began to see the Army as a way to focus his life and spirit.  Michael's family has a long and distinguished career of military service. His grandfather, Eugene Acklin, his great-grandfather, Fred Bible, and three of his cousins have all served in either the Army or Air Force. In fact, before making his decision to enlist, Michael spoke with one of those cousins, Curtis Luckett Jr., an Army veteran. Michael also sought the advice of his father's cousin, LTC Charles Mitchell, Jr., a career military officer who gave him a personal perspective on Army life. However, Michael made his decision to join the Army in his own way.  A devout Christian, Michael enlisted in the Army in the summer of 1998, after hearing, according to what he told his family later, what he could describe only as the voice of God. In hopes of following God's calling, Michael had a friend drive him to a nearby Army recruiting station, and he signed up. He felt this was to be his path into adulthood. His father applauded his decision, and his mother hoped it would provide him the direction he was seeking.  While he found basic training tough, Michael embraced the discipline the Army provided him, and he successfully completed his training and emerged with a greater awareness of his strengths and talents. Early-morning wake-up calls at 4:30 and ceaseless drills gave Michael a new sense of commitment and confidence. He was made a recruit leader, and after training to use large artillery pieces, he was assigned to the 101st Airborne Division based in Fort Campbell, KY, not too far from his home back in Louisville.  Sergeant Acklin was a part of the initial wave of forces sent to liberate Iraq in March 2003. The 101st Airborne took the lead, as it always does whenever our country calls, and Michael and his unit were charged with providing cover fire in support of our troops.  After the fall of Saddam Hussein's tyrannical regime, Michael's unit built schools, cleared streets, and tracked down suspected terrorists. He commanded five other men, and made sure they wrote their families back home often.  Michael Acklin, or ``Mikey'' as his mother Dorothy calls him, grew up as a bright young boy who enjoyed playing football or video games with the neighborhood kids, many of whom would remain lifelong friends. He played basketball with his dad, who first taught him how to dunk. He was a good kid with a big smile who was known at school to be a prankster, but also a good student.  ``My son always had a jolly outlook everyday,'' said Sergeant Acklin's father, Michael Acklin Sr. ``He was just always filled with joy.''  Growing up, Mrs. Acklin recalls her son playing the drums, writing poems, and helping younger children at church, bringing a quiet thoughtfulness to everything he did. Michael listened to people, that was his style.  While stationed at Fort Campbell, Michael drove to the base everyday from his rented room in a servicemen's church. When not on duty, he taught Sunday school, attended Bible studies, and helped out around the church by cooking meals or cutting the grass. His fellow soldiers began calling him ``Preacher'' for his frequent praying before missions. Michael talked to his father about going to a Bible college and becoming a minister when he got back. He was able to find a direction for his life, before he was tragically taken from us.  We thank Michael's parents, Dorothy Acklin and Michael Acklin Sr., for sharing Michael's story with us. As Michael's father said, ``I know my son has gone to be with the Lord. I do know my son certainly will be honored.''  It is my hope that we have done our part to help honor Michael today, even if only a small part. Words cannot erase the grief and despair that hang over Michael's parents, family and beloved friends. But they can declare boldly to all that Michael was a hero. He gave his life to defend us, and our freedoms. His mission was to spread that freedom, like a light, into places that had only known darkness. Michael may have been taken from us. But the light he planted in people's hearts will never be extinguished.  I ask my colleagues to keep the family of SGT Michael Acklin II in their thoughts and prayers. I know they will be in mine.  I yield the floor.                      Staff Sergeant Matt Kimmell
