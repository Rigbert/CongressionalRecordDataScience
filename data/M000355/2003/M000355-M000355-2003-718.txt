 President, I ask unanimous consent that immediately following Senator Kennedy's comments I be recognized to offer an amendment regarding cancer. I further ask unanimous consent that this morning the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the McConnell amendment, to be followed immediately by a vote in relation to the Boxer amendment numbered 1036, to be followed immediately by a vote in relation to the Bingaman amendment numbered 1065, with no second degrees in order to the three above amendments prior to the vote, with 2 minutes equally divided prior to the vote, and with 10 minutes equally divided before the first vote.
