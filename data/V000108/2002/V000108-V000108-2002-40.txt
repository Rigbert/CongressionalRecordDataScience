Speaker, it is my distinct pleasure to announce that the Silver Bell Club, Lodge 2365 of the Polish National Alliance of the United States, will be hosting the 29th Annual Hank Stram-Tony Zale Sports Award Banquet on May 20, 2002, at the Radisson Hotel in Merrillville, Indiana. Fourteen outstanding Northwest Indiana High School athletes will be honored at this notable event for their dedication and hard work. These exceptional students were chosen to receive the award by their respective schools on the basis of academic and athletic achievement. All proceeds from this event will go toward a scholarship fund to be awarded to local students.  This year's Hank Stram-Tony Zale Award recipients include Sandra Bolles of Lake Station Edison High School, Michael Cieslak of Highland High School, Meredith Cusic of Lowell High School, Adam Itczak of Hanover Central High School, Jeremy Krzekotowski of Bishop Noll High School, Lisa Matie of Hobart High School, Katie Mosca of Hammond Morton High School, Rebecca Nelson of Lake Central High School, Craig Olis of Merrillville High School, Ryan Orzechowicz of Crown Point High School, Brandon Powell of Griffith High School, Francis Raycroft of Whiting High School, Kristy Siminski of Portage High School, and Anne Wirtz of Andrean High School.  The featured speaker at this gala event will be Mr. Mike Adamle. A Chicago NFL star turned broadcaster, Adamle serves as Sports Director for CBS 2 News. He joined the station in the fall of 2001 and covers sports for the evening newscasts. Adamle's Chicago roots date back to 1968, when he came to the ``Windy City'' to play football for Northwestern University. After Adamle graduated in 1971, he went on to play for the Kansas City Chiefs (1971-72) and the New York Jets (1973-74), before returning home to play for the Chicago Bears (1975-77). Adamle has been recognized for excellence in journalism throughout his career. His many honors include the Illinois Associated Press Award for ``Best Feature'' (2001), a Peter Lisagor Award for outstanding sports coverage (2001), and two local Emmy Awards for his coverage of the Chicago Auto Show (2001, 2000).  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my distinguished colleagues to join me in commending the Silver Bell Club, Lodge 2365 of the Polish National Alliance of the United States, for hosting this celebration of success in sports and academics. The effort of all those involved in planning this worthwhile event is indicative of their devotion to the very gifted young people in Indiana's First Congressional District.                          ____________________
