President, reserving the right to object, I am going to make a counteroffer to the Senator from Missouri which is even better. It is going to open the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control, and all of the medical research at the Department of Defense. We are going to make sure all of the medical research and medical services of the Federal Government in every agency at every level are open for business immediately, and the Senator from Missouri, by agreeing to this modification, will go way beyond the National Institutes of Health. He is going to be opening all of these medical services.
