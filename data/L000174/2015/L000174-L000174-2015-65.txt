President, each year, it is with great pride that I participate in a reception here on Capitol Hill to showcase some of the best products conceived, developed, and produced in Vermont. One such company featured at the annual Taste of Vermont event is King Arthur Flour, where, for 225 years, generation after generation has produced quality cooking and baking ingredients.  A firm that was born in Boston more than two centuries ago, in 1984 then-owners Frank and Brinna Sands moved King Arthur Flour to Norwich,Vermont, and the company has become a staple in Vermont's business community. In the 1990s, the Sands made the decision to sell their company to their employees. The returns have been considerable, and the company has seen growth ever since.  In ways that are typical of Vermont businesses, King Arthur Flour has evolved into a quality company offering quality products to its customers. The company's business model reflects one that is committed to its customers, its employees, the environment, and its community, even offering employees 40 hours of paid volunteer time to give back. Those commitments are backed up in its status as a certified B Corporation, a designation that independently recognizes the company's social sustainability and environmental performance standards.  From breads to cakes, cookies to pies, King Arthur Flour's products have become staples in bakers' kitchens across the country, including in the Leahy kitchen, where Marcelle regularly shares her recipes with our grandchildren. In fact, many of our visits to the Upper Valley include a detour to King Arthur's terrific cafe where all of their superb products are available. It is yet another example of a tried and true Vermont-based company, revolutionizing and enticing the market with its quality products.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an August 28, 2015, article from the Burlington Free Press recognizing King Arthur Flour's ``225 years of baking history.''  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:            [From the Burlington Free Press, Aug. 28, 2015]             King Arthur Flour: 225 Years of Baking History                            (By Susan Reid)       Some 225 years ago George Washington delivered the first      State of the Union address in January. In February, the U.S.      Supreme Court met for the first time. Vermont itself wasn't      yet a state. According to King George, it belonged to New      York, despite also being known as the New Hampshire Grants.       In this world, miles away in Boston, a man named Henry Wood      started a company that imported flour from England. The brand      new United States of America numbered fewer than four million      souls. Wood correctly assumed this growing country was going      to need flour for baking, and his commitment to pure, high-     quality flour fueled a successful business.                          Enter John Low Sands       One of the early employees was John Low Sands, who joined      the firm in 1820. It was the beginning of generations of      Sands family association with, and eventual ownership of the      company. Also a clue to how the company came to be based in      Vermont, as you'll soon see. By 1853, the company was doing      well enough to buy a large building on the Long Wharf in      Boston. There, in the middle of one of the world's busiest      ports, the business continued to grow, taking on partners as      it expanded. In less than 10 years the city of Boston had      filled in the harbor around the wharf, and the company became      landlocked without ever having moved. It stayed in the same      spot, with the revised address of 172 State St. until 1904,      when the company moved up the street to the Custom House.       By 1895, the company was named Sands, Taylor, & Wood. The      third generation of the Sands family to be part of the      company, Orrin Sands, was its president. During this decade,      roller milling was developed in Hungary. As a result, it was      now possible to grind large quantities of wheat into flour      very quickly. This led to a boom in flour production, as well      as wild fluctuations in the quality of flour being produced.       At the same time, George Wood and his business partners      attended a musical play based on the story of King Arthur and      his knights. They left the theater inspired by the      realization that the values portrayed in the play exemplified      what their company stood for: quality, integrity, purity,      loyalty, strength, and dedication to a higher purpose. They      resolved to rename their new flagship product, their all-     purpose flour, after King Arthur. It was introduced at the      Boston Food Fair in September 1896, and became an immediate      success. The distinctive image of the medieval knight on his      horse adorned the tops of 196 pound barrels of flour for the      next four decades, until he started being printed on      newfangled paper bags.       In the 1920s King Arthur on his steed appeared on the back      of a flatbed calliope truck that roamed the streets of Boston      and New York. In later decades the company gave scholarships      to promising young professional bakers, inserted collectible      picture cards of American military ships, airplanes, and      weapons in its flour bags during World War II, and after the      war sponsored radio shows where ``New England's Food Expert''      Marjorie Mills endorsed King Arthur Flour on the air.                          The move to Vermont       The Sands family became the sole owners of the company in      1932, and in 1984, Frank (a Dartmouth alum) and his wife      Brinna Sands moved the company to Vermont. Tired of lugging      bags of flour to the post office to mail to retirees in      Florida who couldn't buy King Arthur outside of New England,      Brinna started The Baker's Catalogue in 1990.       She also published the ``200th Anniversary Cookbook,''      which has sold well over 100,000 copies to date.       In a pivotal move, Frank and Brinna decided to sell the      company to their employees, launching King Arthurs Employee      Stock Ownership plan. The company has seen steady growth      since then.       By 1999, the company officially changed its name to King      Arthur Flour, and the Baker's Catalogue was mailing six      million catalogues per year. Distribution of the flour to      grocery stores up and down the East Coast was well      established, and expanding steadily westward. In 2000,      Vermont Gov. Howard Dean was on hand to break an oversized      baguette in two to celebrate the opening of the bakery and      school in Norwich. In 2004 the company became 100 percent      employee-owned.       With all of these changes, the principles that the company      began with survived and thrived. In 2007, King Arthur Flour      was a founding and certified B Corp. Its bylaws reflect a      commitment to all stakeholders, including the community and      the environment, as well as shareholders and business      partners.       Now a national brand known for its quality, customer      service, and expertise in all things baking, King Arthur has      grown both the brand and its service programs. Bake for Good:      Kids teaches 8- to 12-year olds how to bake bread in a      curriculum-based program that provides a community service      component of giving a loaf back to someone in need. King      Arthur has long had a policy of giving 40 paid hours of      volunteer time to all employees, full- and part-time.       King Arthur's mission and personality is to be a resource      for all bakers. It maintains a robust social media presence      on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and on its blog, Flourish.      The website has thousands of tested recipes, and there's a      crew of baking experts on the Baker's Hotline ready to answer      any baking question, either by phone or via online chat.       King Arthur is poised to further the quest for honest,      homemade, local food, by providing everything one needs to      bake. Lucky for the company, and Vermont, that appetite is      timeless, and a good apple pie is never going to go out of      style.
