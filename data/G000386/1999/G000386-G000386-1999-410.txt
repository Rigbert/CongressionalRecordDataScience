 President, on behalf of the leader, I ask unanimous consent that on Tuesday, June 15, the Senate proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 80, S. 331, at a time to be determined by the majority leader, after consultation with the Democratic leader. I further ask unanimous consent that immediately upon reporting of the bill, a substitute amendment offered by Senator Roth, which will be at the desk, be agreed to; that the bill then be read a third time, with no intervening action or debate; and that the Senate proceed to a vote on passage at a time to be determined by the majority leader and the Democratic leader. I finally ask unanimous consent that it not be in order for the Senate to consider any conference report or House amendments to S. 331, or its House companion, if it contains a net increase in direct spending in fiscal year 2000, the period fiscal year 2000 through 2004, or the period fiscal year 2005 through 2009, as estimated by the Congressional Budget Office.
