At the conclusion of my remarks, I will ask unanimous consent to enter into the Record a news release from the U.S. Department of Labor that is dated Thursday, August 30, 1990, a release from then-Secretary of Labor, Elizabeth Dole, that says as follows in the opening paragraphs:       Secretary of Labor, Elizabeth Dole----  The same person who is now a Republican candidate for President, I might add----     * * * today launched a major initiative to reduce repetitive      motion trauma, one of the Nation's most debilitating across-     the-board worker safety and health illnesses of the 1990s.  She goes on with a quote that says:       These painful and sometimes crippling illnesses now make up      48 percent of all recordable industrial workplace illnesses.      We must do our utmost to protect workers from these hazards,      not only in the red meat industry, but all U.S. industries.  That was Secretary Elizabeth Dole, Republican administration, 1990.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record this news release in its entirety from the Department of Labor.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:Secretary Dole Announces Ergonomics Guidelines to Protect Workers from            Repetitive Motion Illnesses/Carpal Tunnel Syndrome       Secretary of Labor Elizabeth Dole today launched a major      initiative to reduce repetitive motion trauma, once of the      nation's most debilitating across-the-board worker safety and      health illnesses of the 1990's.       ``These painful and sometime crippling illnesses now make      up 48 percent of all recordable industrial workplace      illnesses. We must do our utmost to protect workers from      these hazards, not only in the red meat industry but all U.S.      industries,'' Secretary Dole said.       ``We are publishing these guidelines now because we want to      eliminate as many illnesses as possible, as quickly as      possible.       ``The Department is committed to taking the most effective      steps necessary to address the problem of ergonomic hazards      on an industry-wide basis. Thus, I intend to begin the      rulemaking process by asking the public for information about      ergonomic hazards across all industry. This could be      accomplished through a Request for Information or an Advanced      Notice of Proposed Rulemaking consistent with the      Administration's Regulatory Program.       ``We are emphasizing the need for employers to fit the job      to the employee rather than the employee to the job,''      Secretary Dole said. ``This involves such measures as      designing flexible work stations which can be adjusted to      suit individuals and relying on tools developed to minimize      physical stress and eliminate crippling injuries. It begins      with organizing work processes with the physical needs of the      workers in mind.''       Repetitive motion trauma, also referred to as cumulative      trauma disorders (CTD's), are disorders of the      musculoskeletal and nervous systems resulting from the      repeated exertion, or awkward positioning, of the hand, arm,      back, leg or other muscles over extended periods daily.       They include lower back injuries, carpal tunnel syndrome,      (a nerve disorder of the hand and wrist), and various tendon      disorders, among others.       ``We are initially focussing on the red meat industry      because its problems are well-documented and very severe,''      Secretary dole said.       The guidelines for the red meat industry, being issued in      the form of a booklet by the Labor Department's Occupational      Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), were developed to      assist employers in the industry in developing ergonomic      hazard abatement programs.       ``The message in the guidelines is simple: repetitive      motion illnesses can be minimized through proper workplace      engineering and job design and by effective employee training      and education,'' Secretary Dole said. ``The guidelines list      the keys for success: commitment by top management, a written      ergonomics program, employee involvement and regular program      review and evaluation.       ``We will be closely monitoring and assessing the success      of the Red Meat Guidelines in addressing ergonomic hazards to      give us more information on which to proceed as we deal with      these issues on an industry-wide basis.       ``We owe a debt of thanks to the United Food and Commercial      Workers, AFL-CIO; the American Meat Institute, and the      National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health for      their expert assistance in developing these guidelines. Their      willingness to join with us in finding and implementing      solutions to ergonomic problems has been most encouraging.''       Assistant Secretary of Labor Gerard F. Scannel, who heads      OSHA, said his agency would begin an inspection program early      next year in the red meat industry as another phase of the      special emphasis program initiated by the issuance of the      guidelines.       He said the special emphasis program for the meat industry      has been designed to ensure that the well-recognized      ergonomic hazards in the industry are being adequately      addressed and that ergonomic programs are in place in all      major meatpacking plants.       Each red meat plant in the U.S. will be sent a copy of the      meatpacking guidelines. As part of the special emphasis      program, employers will be offered the opportunity to enter      into agreements with OSHA to abate their ergonomic hazards.       Though those who sign such an agreement will be subject to      monitoring visits and OSHA inspections in response to      complaints, they will not be cited or penalized on ergonomic      issues if the monitoring visits show a comprehensive effort      and satisfactory progress in abating such hazards.       Scannell said that while the guidelines are advisory,      ``compliance with them could demonstrate to an OSHA      inspection team that an employer is committed to addressing      ergonomic hazards.''       Scannell said the guidelines include a list of questions      and answers about common problems to provide more specific      assistance to small businesses.       ``Ergonomics Program Management Guidelines for Meatpacking      Plants,'' the official title of the booklet, builds on the      cooperative approach of OSHA's safety and health program      management guidelines issued in January 1989. Although strict      adherence to today's guidelines is not mandatory, OSHA      believes following them can produce significant reductions in      repetitive motion illnesses.       The recommended program begins with analysis of the      worksite to identify potential ergonomic problems. Ergonomic      solutions may include: engineering controls such as proper      work stations, work methods and tool designs, work practice      controls such as proper cutting techniques, new employee      training, monitoring adjustments and modifications, personal      protective equipment such as assuring proper fit of gloves      and appropriate protection against cold and administrative      controls such as reducing the duration, frequency and      severity of motions; slowing production rates; limiting      overtime; providing adequate rest pauses; increasing the      number of workers assigned to a particular task; rotating      workers among jobs with different stressors; ensuring      availability of relief workers; and maintaining equipment and      tools in top condition.       Further, meatpackers need to develop an effective training      program to explain to employees the importance of working in      ways that limit stress and strain, and the need to report      symptoms of CTDs early so that preventive treatment can      forestall permanent damage.       Employers must also instruct employees in the proper      techniques for their individual jobs. Annual retraining is      necessary to assure that employees continue to do their jobs      correctly.       An effective ergonomics program also includes medical      management with trained health care providers to work with      those implementing the ergonomics program and to treat      employees. The guidelines describe helpful steps including      periodic workplace walkthroughs, symptoms surveys and lists      of light-duty jobs for employees recovering from repetitive      motion injuries.       They stress the importance of a good health surveillance      program; the need to encourage early reporting of symptoms;      appropriate protocols for health care providers; and      evaluation, treatment and follow-up for repetitive motion      illnesses.       Finally, the booklet offers suggestions for recordkeeping      and monitoring injury and illness trends.       The guidelines also include a glossary of terms and a list      of references. Employers may contact OSHA regional offices      with questions about ergonomics, recordkeeping or other      safety and health issues by consulting the directory at the      end of the booklet.       Single copies of ``Ergonomics Program Management Guidelines      for Meatpacking Plants'' are available free from OSHA      Publications, Room N3101, Frances Perkins Building, 200      Constitution Ave., NW, Washington, D.C. 20210 by sending a      self-addressed mailing label.
