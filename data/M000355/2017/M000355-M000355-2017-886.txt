 President, I ask unanimous consent that at 5 p.m. on Tuesday, September 5, the Senate proceed to executive session for consideration of Calendar No. 171, the nomination of Timothy Kelly to be U.S. district judge for the District of Columbia. I further ask that there be 30 minutes of debate on the nomination, equally divided in the usual form; that following the use or yielding back of time, the Senate vote on confirmation with no intervening action or debate; and that if confirmed, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.
