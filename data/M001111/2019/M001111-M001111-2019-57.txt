  Joel Courreges was a man who never stopped serving his community, his State, and his country. Joel served our Nation as a marine in the Vietnam war, returning with disabilities both visible and invisible. Having seen firsthand how difficult the transition home can be, he made it his mission to smooth the path for his fellow veterans as they returned from service. Joel became the commander of the Disabled American Veterans, Chapter 5, in Bremerton, WA. In this role, he not only dedicated countless hours to helping veterans file claims with the VA and making sure they could make their appointments, he even drove them himself if they couldn't get there on their own.  But that wasn't all. As Joel saw what more and more veterans were going through, he realized the system wasn't working. Too many veterans, especially those with PTSD and other wounds of war beneath the surface, were getting caught up in courts that didn't understand their unique needs and weren't prepared or designed to help them get back on their feet. Because of Joel's drive and vision, the Kitsap County Veterans Court was created, with the goal of helping the men and women who sacrificed to defend our freedoms get a hand up when they were most in need.  Having seen Joel's efforts firsthand, I know without a doubt that his dedication to public service lifted countless others, especially veterans who have given our country so much, and helped them lead the fulfilling lives they deserve. I will always be grateful to Joel for his kindness, his generosity of spirit, and his determination to make a difference. My thoughts are with his family and all those who loved him.                          ____________________
