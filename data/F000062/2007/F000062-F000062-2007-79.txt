 This proposal would require all organizations that filed ethics complaints to publicly disclose any individual or entity that has donated $5,000 or more to that organization. If the good Senator from Nevada would be willing, I would be very willing to have this proposal considered in the Rules Committee in a prompt way. I would not like to hold up passing this commonsense simple filing bill, and I don't want to debate the merits at this time. This bill Senator Ensign is proposing is not germane to the basic bill before us. It would quite likely be a poison pill that would kill any chance of us getting the electronically filed bill enacted into law at this time.  I reiterate the offer to hear it in a prompt manner in the Rules Committee, but I must object to it at this time. I do so object.
