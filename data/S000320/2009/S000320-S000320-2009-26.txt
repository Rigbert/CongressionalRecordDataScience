 President, today I pay tribute to William Utsey, who passed away on July 18, 2009. A highly successful attorney, William Utsey was a personal friend and along, with his friends and family, I mourn his passing.  William was born on October 28, 1939, in Gilbertown, AL. He graduated from the University of Southern Mississippi in 1962 and received his J.D. from the University of Alabama School of Law. In 1965, William was admitted to the Alabama State Bar. He began his legal career serving as a clerk and later as an attorney with the firm of Clement, Rosen, Hubbard, and Waldrop in Tuscaloosa.  After practicing law for 5 years in Huntsville, William returned to his home in Choctaw County to embark as a solo practitioner. At the time of his death, William was the senior partner of Utsey and Utsey where he practiced with his son. William's fondness of the legal profession extended well past his private practice. He served as president of the Choctaw County Bar Association and the Alabama Association for Justice. In addition, William held memberships to the Alabama State Bar Association, the First Judicial Circuit Bar Association, and the Alabama Trial Lawyers Association.  Most people in west Alabama know William for his many contributions to the Democratic Party in west Alabama. For 20 years, William served as chairman of the Choctaw County Democratic Executive Committee. I knew William to be honest, hard-working, and committed to his family and to the people of Choctaw County.  William is loved and will be missed by his wife Treobye Britton Utsey; his sons William Jacob Utsey and John Jefferson Utsey; his daughter Elizabeth Utsey Sadler; and nine grandchildren. I ask the entire Senate to join me in recognizing and honoring the life of William Utsey.                          ____________________
