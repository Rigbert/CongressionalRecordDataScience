 President, one of the great privileges of my career has been the time I have spent working alongside Senator Bob Dole and his wife, Senator Elizabeth Dole. I feel a special kinship to the Doles. Not only are they both dear friends to Elaine and me, but in my position as Republican Leader I often think back on Bob's superb stewardship of the office. Bob Dole was in many ways a model and a mentor to me. I was humbled and honored to assume a role that he filled for so long with such dignity and skill. And today I am honored to submit for the Record a letter of tribute from my old friend to his remarkable wife at the conclusion of her Senate career. Elizabeth Dole has graced this chamber in the same way that she has graced every other institution of which she has been a part in a long and distinguished career of public service. We will miss Senator Dole's kindness, her warmth, and her unyielding belief in the greatness of her country. Senator Dole is one of the great public servants of our day. It is my great pleasure to ask that this letter from one dear friend to another be printed in the Record.  The letter follows.                                                December 12, 2008.       Dear Mitch: I wish I could be a Senator again just long      enough to speak of Senator Elizabeth Dole's accomplishments      which have spanned a period of nearly a half century.       Elizabeth correctly chose to focus her farewell remarks on      those who helped and counseled her along the way. She spoke      about those who were most important in her life's journey      such as her mother, her father, her teachers, co-workers, and      her dear brother, John, who passed away on April 8, 2008.      John was her mentor, her confidant, and a proud naval officer      in World War II. Elizabeth's speech was all about others      rather than herself, which, in itself, says a lot about      Elizabeth as a caring human being.       So in an indirect way, I want to share her many areas of      service with all those thinking about their future and the      path they will follow. Believe me when I say they will not      find a better example than the Senator Dole from North      Carolina. Senator Dole, in many respects, was a pioneer for      American women, as many of her early opportunities came      before women were in the forefront of public or private      sectors of meaningful service activity.       Elizabeth has never stopped looking for ways to make a      difference. It would be impossible to determine the number of      good people in North Carolina and across America that      Elizabeth's efforts have had an impact upon, myself included.      She assisted me three times in campaigning full-time for the      presidency, taking a one year leave of absence from the Red      Cross, but more importantly were the countless times she      assisted me personally because of my disabilities.       Let me recount some of the highlights of Senator Dole's      career so that those who may be looking for a role model may      fully understand the differences she has made for others,      irregardless of party, race, religion or status.  Public Service Career and Selected Accomplishments of Elizabeth Dole      Early 1960's: Summer jobs during graduate school       Office of Senator B. Everett Jordan (D-NC)       United Nations Guide       United Nations Intern Program     1966-1967: Assistant at the U.S. Department of Health,          Education and Welfare       After completing her Master of Arts in Teaching and her      graduation from Harvard Law School, Elizabeth Hanford was      hired by the U.S. Department of Health, Education and      Welfare. Her assignments there included planning the first-     ever United States government sponsored conference on      education of the deaf. This conference, which spawned a      career-long dedication to the rights of the disabled, was      held in Colorado Springs in     1967. During this time, she took cases for indigents, those      who could not afford an attorney.     1967-1968: Deputy Assistant for Legislative Affairs, White          House Office of Consumer Affairs       In April 1968, Elizabeth Hanford joined the Lyndon Johnson      Administration at the White House Office of Consumer Affairs,      working for Betty Furness. As Deputy Assistant for      Legislative Affairs, she traveled frequently to Capitol Hill      to advocate for policies protecting American consumers.     1969-1973: Deputy Director, President's Committee on Consumer          Interests       Upon taking office in January 1969, President Richard Nixon      renamed the White House Office of Consumer Affairs the      ``President's Committee on Consumer Interests.'' Virginia      Knauer was appointed Special Assistant to the President for      Consumer Affairs and promoted Elizabeth Hanford to serve as      her deputy. Hanford would serve with Knauer for five years as      a tireless advocate for American consumers, developing      consumer education curriculum for America's schools, reaching      voluntary agreements with industry to undertake nutritional      labeling and unit pricing, and helping to create the Consumer      Information Center in Pueblo, Colorado. They were guided by      the philosophy that for consumers to make wise decisions,      they must have access to all relevant information.     1973-1979: Commissioner, United States Federal Trade          Commission       In 1973, Elizabeth Hanford was nominated by President      Richard Nixon and confirmed by the United States Senate to      serve as a member of the United States Federal Trade      Commission. Established in 1915, the Federal Trade      Commission's duties include promoting fair competition      through the enforcement of antitrust laws, preventing the      dissemination of false and deceptive advertising of goods,      and investigating unfair business practices.       Seeing the commission as an opportunity to bring about      lower prices for consumers, to ensure better quality goods      and services, and to expand the choices available in a free,      competitive marketplace, Commissioner Hanford's (married      Senator Bob Dole in 1975) priorities included consumer      protections for women and the elderly. She held seminars for      women in business, and as the FTC enforced the Equal Credit      Opportunity Act, worked with Women in Radio and TV on ads      explaining how women, for the first time, could get credit in      their own name. Dole's work also included a comprehensive      investigation of nursing homes and a number of antitrust and      consumer protection investigations and enforcement actions.     1981-1983: Assistant to the President for Public Liaison       In January 1981, President Ronald Reagan named Dole      Assistant to the President, to head the White House Office of      Public Liaison. In that position, Dole played a key role in      advancing the Reagan agenda to a wide number of constituent      groups (for example, women, business, labor, religious      community, Hispanics and other ethics organizations) and to      the American people. Dole was instrumental in the passage of      the Prompt Pay Act of 1982, which required the government to      pay vendors on time or pay an interest penalty.       Dole also headed the White House Coordinating Council on      Women, charged with reviewing government regulations to      eliminate vestiges of discrimination, thereby increasing      opportunities for women in government and in the country at      large. The Council advocated legislation that would make it      easier for women to collect court ordered child support      payments, and to equalize Social Security benefits for widows      and widowers.     1983-1987: Secretary, United States Secretary of          Transportation       In 1983, President Reagan nominated Dole to serve as      Secretary of Transportation--the first women in history to      lead that cabinet department. The United States Senate      unanimously confirmed her.       Dole's many accomplishments as Secretary of Transportation      included:       Presiding over what, up to date, were the safest years in      the history of American transportation--highways, railways,      and airlines.       Initiating widespread efforts to eliminate drunk driving,      particularly among the nation's youth. These efforts led to      the passage of legislation raising the drinking age to 21 to      eliminate ``blood borders'' between states with differing age      requirements.       Instituting random drug testing of safety and security-     related employees--the first civilian department to do so.       Crafting a rule that resolved a twenty year controversy      over automatic crash protection in cars. This rule totally      changed the climate for auto safety in America, leading to      the adoption of mandatory safety belt use laws in 49 American      states and providing incentives for auto manufacturers to      develop, test, and offer air bags in automobiles.       Mandating high-mounted brake lights on cars. These ``Dole      lights'' cost less than $20 per vehicle, and have been      estimated to eliminate 900,000 crashes annually.       Implementing rules that improved safety in aircraft cabins      by making aircraft seats less flammable, improving aircraft      cabin evacuation with low-level lights, and reducing the      danger of fire in aircraft lavatories.       Leading successful effort to pass legislation authorizing      the transfer of two federally owned airports, Washington      National and Dulles, to a regional authority, accomplishing a      de-federalization move that had been proposed eight times      since 1948 and had never been voted out of committee in      either the House or the Senate. The new Reagan National      Airport and doubling the size of Dulles International were      thereby accomplished through revenue bonds, not federal      taxpayer dollars.       Leading effort for the reopening and redevelopment of      Washington D.C.'s Union Station, which had been closed for      over five years. Historic Union Station re-opened in 1988,      and now houses dozens of shops, restaurants, and theaters,      while also serving as a major transportation center.       Selling government's freight railroad, Conrail, in the      largest public offering of its kind to that date.       Overseeing a 10% increase in the number of women in the      Department of Transportation workforce, which had only 19%      women in its 100,000 workforce when Elizabeth became      Secretary.       10-point initiative including rotational assignments and      career development programs to assist talented women in      moving up the ladder.       First woman to serve as departmental head of a branch of      the armed forces, U.S. Coast Guard.     1989-1990: Secretary, United States Department of Labor       In January 1981, President George H.W. Bush nominated and      the Senate unanimously confirmed Dole to serve as Secretary      of the United States Department of Labor--the first woman in      history to serve in the cabinet of two presidents.       Dole's priorities and accomplishments as Secretary of Labor      included the following:       Improving the skills of individuals entering the American      workforce. This focus included the appointment of a blue-     ribbon commission charged with developing national competency      guidelines that reflected work readiness and which could be      used by the schools for curriculum development; sponsorship      of a first-ever national conference on the ``school-to-work''      population; expansion of work-based training along the      principles of apprenticeship; and ensuring that the Job      Training Partnership Act provided basic skills, literacy, and      remedial education along with job training.       Instigating a ``glass ceiling initiative,'' which revealed      the barriers preventing women and minorities from reaching      the top levels of corporate America.       Traveling twice to Poland to assist that country in its      transition from communism to democracy. DOL programs included      the creation of construction training centers in Warsaw and      Gdansk.       Crafting a strategy that led to the successful conclusion      of a bitter eleven month United Mine Workers strike against      the Pittston Coal Company. Elizabeth visited the strike scene      and traveled through a coal mine.       Special focus on improving lives of youth at risk in our      society.     1991-1999; President, American Red Cross       (The first woman president since Clara Barton, who founded      the Red Cross in 1881; Out of respect for the thousands of      volunteers, she served her first year without pay.)       During her eight years at the helm of the American Red      Cross, Dole led a $287 million project that totally      modernized and transformed the Red Cross blood operations      begun in World War II. ``Blood Transformation'' integrated 28      different computer systems into a single centralized network;      replaced 53 non-standardized testing facilities with 8 state-     of-the-art labs to test for infectious diseases; standardized      manufacturing processes across each of its 38 blood regions;      and established a Quality Assurance Program that became a      model for the blood banking industry.       Dole also led a massive four-year revitalization of Red      Cross disaster relief services, establishing a National      Disaster Operations Center open 24 hours a day, 365 days a      year to monitor ongoing disasters and impending threats;      increasing to twenty-one thousand the number of those trained      to handle national catastrophic disasters; and warehousing      equipment in areas likely to get hardest hit.       Dole restructured and strengthened Armed Forces Emergency      Services, which provided an average of 4,000 emergency      communications a day and other assistance to members of the      Armed forces and their families. Her 3-year modernization of      AFES included the establishment of two centralized Case      Management Centers utilizing the latest technology to replace      145 stations on military installations.       For the first time in its history, Red Cross chapters had      to defend their charters, meeting high standards. Henceforth,      they were required to meet those high standards every five      years in order to keep their charters.       10-point initiative to help qualified women and minorities      move up the ladder, such as apprentices assigned to all      senior managers.       Throughout her tenure, Dole ensured that 91 cents of every      dollar donated to the American Red Cross was spent on      programs and services.       Dole led humanitarian visits to disaster sites and war      zones around the world, e.g. Kuwait; Somalia; Goma, Congo.     2003-2009; United States Senator from the State of North          Carolina       In November 2002, Dole was elected by the voters of North      Carolina to serve in the     United States Senate. Upon taking office in January 2003,      Dole became the first woman in history to represent North      Carolina in the Senate.       In her six years in the Senate, Dole's accomplishments      included:       Leading a successful effort to protect North Carolina's      military bases from closure and adding additional jobs, for      example 9000 at Fort Bragg.       Working to ensure a fair process that resulted in the      basing of two F/A-18E/F Squadrons at Marine Corps Air Station      Cherry Point, which brings more than 1,200 jobs and an annual      infusion of $40 million to the local economy.       Securing nearly $4 billion in funding for rural North      Carolina and preventing thousands of farm families from      bankruptcy by achieving a tobacco quota buyout with no tax      implications.       Leading a bipartisan effort to extend family and medical      leave coverage to military families.       Successfully working for a law that protects service      members and their families from predatory lenders.       Successfully advocating since 2003 for a strong world class      regulator for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.       Securing $57 million for hiring customs agents focused      solely on keeping illegal textiles out of the country.       Securing $350 million in federal funding for North Carolina      transportation infrastructure projects.       Authoring legislation that provided increased grant funding      to community colleges through the Higher Education Act.       Working with federal officials and sheriffs across North      Carolina's 100 counties to deliver the first in the nation      statewide partnership to apprehend, identify and remove      undocumented aliens who commit crimes.       Helping to lead the effort to raise fuel economy standards      for cars and light trucks in the 2007 energy bill to 35 miles      per gallon by model year 2020, thereby saving 800,000 barrels      of oil per day in 2020 and nearly one million barrels per day      by 2021.       Becoming a national leader in the fight against hunger,      through the adoption of a farm bill that expanded funding for      federal anti-hunger programs, and helping to secure more than      $400 million for the McGovern-Dole International Food for      Education and Child Nutrition Program.       Convincing the Office of National Drug Control Policy to      designate five counties in North Carolina as part of its High      Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA) program.       Helping to lead the effort to reauthorize the President's      Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief at $48 billion, and $9 billion      for prevention of malaria and tuberculosis, thereby      preventing 12 million new HIV infections, treating 3 million      people living with HIV/AIDS, and supporting care for 12      million people living with HIV/AIDS.       Handling 40,000 cases for North Carolina constituents who      needed assistance with a federal agency.       These are just the highlights and while she did not always      reach her goals, most of her life has been filled with      successes because of her hard work, her faith, integrity and      determination. Mitch, I'm proud of her record, as you are of      Elaine's remarkable achievements, which included their work      together at the Department of Transportation. I believe those      who read this will be inspired to set higher goals for      themselves and will accomplish a great deal more in their      lifetimes.           God Bless America,                                                      Bob.
