I was on a flight for a number of hours and heard the horrific news of the tragedy at Virginia Tech. We had scheduled tomorrow morning before the Senate Judiciary Committee a hearing with Attorney General Gonzales. I have discussed this with the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, my friend Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, and I called the Attorney General and spoke to him. All three of us agree--and they agree with my proposal--that we will postpone that hearing.  The hearing with the Attorney General will not be held tomorrow. We will postpone it until Thursday. The exact time we are working out. The Attorney General certainly was agreeable to that. I am sure he would want to be dealing with the matters of the shooting. Both Senator Specter and I felt this is a matter where our whole Nation is going to be grieving tomorrow and many individual Members in both bodies will be joining in that grieving and that concern for the families, for the victims of this horrible, horrible tragedy.  So the Judiciary Committee, I have decided, will not hold its hearing. It will be held Thursday.  I thank my friend from West Virginia for yielding to me so I could make that announcement.
