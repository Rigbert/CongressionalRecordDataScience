President, tucked away in the mountains, hills, and valleys of Vermont is a widely recognized, vibrant college campus that also happens to be my alma mater--Saint Michael's College. To students, faculty, staff, and alumni alike, the Saint Michael's community is almost like a family: once you become a part of it, it becomes part of your life. Later this year, one of our campus's family members--Marilyn Cormier--will leave the grounds of Saint Michael's, retiring after nearly 33 years of dedicated service to the college. Marilyn is known to many, and all who have worked with her have admired her tenacity, her love for Saint Michael's, and her commitment to the institution she has called home for over three decades. I will miss her.  In 1982, Marilyn traveled halfway around the world from her home in SriLanka and landed at Saint Michael's. She started working in the Office of Academic Affairs, ultimately becoming the director of government and community relations and the secretary of the board of trustees, the position from which she will retire. Marilyn's passion for connecting the academic community of Saint Michael's with surrounding Vermont communities and communities across the country and abroad has made her a valued mentor to students and faculty alike. St. Mike's could not have had a more effective ambassador, champion, and problem-solver than Marilyn has been in this crucial role. Her energy is only matched by her creativity and her clear, sharp focus on what matters.  Marilyn's considerable talents also benefited the Vermont Council on World Affairs, an organization headquartered at Saint Michael's College. As a member of the board of directors, Marilyn has connected students with cross-cultural opportunities throughout Vermont and across the globe. In 2012, Marilyn helped to organize a delegation of representatives visiting the French city of Honfleur. It was a treat for both Marcelle and me to be a part of that special visit.  Over the years, I have crossed paths with many people connected to Saint Michael's, from public figures in the Nation's Capital, Vermont and across the country, to visitors in my office, to members of my own staff. One constant in each of these encounters is the praise they have for Marilyn for her work in helping so many students achieve their goals. She has empowered students to become leaders in their communities. I know these are commitments that will continue, even as Marilyn prepares for this exciting next chapter in her life.  Saint Michael's is a special place that many visit and come to call home. So it has been for Marilyn Cormier. Marcelle and I wish our dear friend all the very best.                          ____________________
