President, the Senate's Republican leadership is refusing to take action to end the judicial emergency in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.  On March 25, the five continuing vacancies on the 13-member court caused Chief Judge Ralph Winter to certify a Circuit emergency, to begin canceling hearings and to take the unprecedented step of having 3-judge panels convened that include only one Second Circuit judge. On April 23, Chief Judge Winter was forced to issue additional emergency orders. For two months and into the foreseeable future the Senate has neglected its responsibility to the people of the Second Circuit.  I have been urging favorable Senate action on the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the Second Circuit to fill a longstanding vacancy for many months. That nomination remains stalled on the Senate calendar. Two weeks ago the nomination of Chester J. Straub to the Second Circuit was favorably reported by the Judiciary Committee. That nomination is now also on the Senate calendar awaiting action. Today, the Senate Judiciary Committee is favorably reporting two additional nominees to the Second Circuit, Judge Rosemary Pooler and Robert Sack. That makes four nominees to the Second Circuit awaiting confirmation, four nominees who can end the judicial vacancies crisis that plagues the Second Circuit. But for the inaction of the Majority Leader in calling for votes by the Senate on this qualified nominees, the crisis could end this week. I, again, urge that action.  Before the last recess I introduced legislation calling upon the Senate to address this kind of judicial emergency before it takes another extended recess. The Senate has pending before it four outstanding nominees to the Second Circuit whose confirmations would end this crisis.  Unfortunately Republican Senate leadership has not taken the judicial vacancies crisis seriously and has failed to take the concerted action needed to end it. They continue to perpetuate vacancies in almost one in 10 federal judgeships.  With 11 nominees on the Senate calendar and 32 pending in Committee, we could be making a difference if we would take our responsibilities to the federal courts seriously and devote the time necessary to consider these nominations and confirm them. Instead, we are having hearings at a rate on one a month, barely keeping up with attrition and hardly making a dent in the vacancies crisis that the Chief Justice of the United States has called the most serious problem confronting the judiciary.  By a vote of 16 to 2, the Judiciary Committee reported the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the Senate. That was on March 5, 1998, over two months ago. No action has been taken or scheduled on that nomination and no explanation for the delay has been forthcoming. This is the oldest judicial nomination pending on the Senate Executive Calendar. In spite of an April 8 letter to the Senate Republican Leader signed by all six Senators from the three States forming the Second Circuit urging prompt action, this nomination continues to be stalled by anonymous objections. Our bipartisan letter to the Majority Leader asked that he call up for prompt consideration by the Senate the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor. That was over one month ago.  Judge Sonia Sotomayor is a qualified nominee who was confirmed to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in 1992 after being nominated by President Bush. She attended Princeton University and Yale Law School. She worked for over four years in the New York District Attorney's Office as an Assistant District Attorney and was in private practice with Pavia & Harcourt in New York. She is strongly support by Senator Moynihan and Senator D'Amato.  She is a source of pride to Puerto Rican and other Hispanic supporters and to women. When confirmed she will be only the second woman and second judge of Puerto Rican descent to serve on the Second Circuit.  Judge Rosemary Pooler was nominated back on November 6, 1997, as was Robert Sack, a partner in the law firm of Gibson Dunn & Crutcher. They participated in a confirmation hearing on May 14 and were reported to the Senate by the Judiciary Committee today.  Since May 7 the fourth pending nomination to the Second Circuit, that of Chester J. Straub, has also been on theSenate calendar. Mr. Straub is a partner in the law firm of Willkie Farr & Gallagher.  Judge Sotomayor, Judge Pooler, Robert Sack and Chester Straub can and should all be confirmed to the Second Circuit before the Senate adjourns for its Memorial Day recess.  In his most recent Report on the Judiciary the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court warned that persisting vacancies would harm the administration of justice. The Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court pointedly declared: ``Vacancies cannot remain at such high levels indefinitely without eroding the quality of justice that traditionally has been associated with the federal judiciary.''  The people and businesses in the Second Circuit need additional federal judges confirmed by the Senate. Indeed, the Judicial Conference of the United States recommends that in addition to the 5 vacancies, the Second Circuit be allocated an additional 2 judgeships to handle its workload. The Second Circuit is suffering harm from Senate inaction. That is why the Chief Judge of the Second Circuit had to declare the Circuit in a state of emergency.  Must we wait for the administration of justice to disintegrate further before the Senate will take this crisis seriously and act on the nominees pending before it? I pray not.                          ____________________
