Americans are speaking loud and clear--they want an Internet that is a platform for free expression and innovation, where the best ideas and services can reach consumers based on merit rather than based on a financial relationship with a broadband provider. I agree, which is why today I am proud to join my friend in the House, Representative Doris Matsui of California, to introduce bicameral legislation requiring the Federal Communications Commission FCC, to ban pay-to-play deals on the Internet.  Since FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler began a proceeding to consider new open Internet rules, nearly 300,000 Americans have commented on his proposal. They are concerned that the Internet will become a place where broadband providers charge tolls to websites or applications in order to reach end users. This would represent a fundamental departure from the way in which consumers and entrepreneurs interact with the Internet. A two-tiered Internet based on ability to pay would harm the innovative and competitive environment we have all come to expect in the online world.  A pay-to-play Internet would allow larger companies to squeeze out their competitors. A small web company in Vermont that develops an idea to rival the largest Silicon Valley titans should not have to worry that its access toconsumers could be blocked because its competitors have a paid arrangement with broadband providers. The next generation of Internet companies should have the same protections that allowed a company like Vermont's Dealer.com to become a thriving success.  Such arrangements would also harm consumers, who would not have the assurance that the service they are paying for will provide the speed that they want. Too many Americans currently lack real choice in broadband providers, particularly those in rural areas. If the FCC clears the way for pay-to-play deals, whole swaths of the Internet could become functionally inaccessible to the customers of certain Internet providers. This is not the Internet we know today and we must act to ensure that it does not come to pass.  The Online Competition and Consumer Choice Act, which I am introducing with Congresswoman Matsui today, is straightforward. It requires the FCC to establish rules preventing providers from charging websites for priority access. It also requires rules to prevent providers from prioritizing their own affiliated content or services. This legislation should not be used by opponents of meaningful open Internet rules as an excuse for the FCC to not take any action that will protect consumers and innovators. The FCC should act now to ban these deals. I appreciate that Chairman Wheeler is asking whether they should be banned outright in the current open Internet proceeding. The overwhelming response from the American people is that they should be.  The importance of an open Internet is an issue that resonates outside of the Beltway, and with good reason--most Americans interact with the Internet as part of their daily lives. The issue of how we protect and promote an open Internet is crucial to our culture and our economy. I want to make sure that stakeholders from outside of Washington have an opportunity to show policymakers and regulators here that their decisions will have a significant impact throughout the country. That is why I am holding a Judiciary Committee field hearing on July 1 at the University of Vermont.  There should be widespread agreement to prevent special deals that harm consumers and dampen online innovation. The FCC and Congress should rightly focus on this timely and significant issue. I urge the Senate to pass this constructive legislative response.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2476       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Online Competition and      Consumer Choice Act of 2014''.     SEC. 2.
