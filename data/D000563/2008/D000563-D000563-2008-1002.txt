President, as this economy continues to deteriorate and we see these wild gyrations in the stock market, there are a lot of people concerned. Yesterday, the stock market went down over 300 points. I know it has its good days and bad days, but it has had more bad days than good days for a long time.  A lot of people in days gone by paid little or no attention to the stock market. My mom and dad did not own a share of stock during their married life.
