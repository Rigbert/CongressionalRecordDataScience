President, later today we are going to consider an effort under the Congressional Review Act to change America's background check system when it comes to the purchase of firearms.  For months, I have been listening to President Trump and the Republicans talk about gun violence in the city of Chicago. It is a heartbreaking reality. More than 4,300 people were shot in Chicago last year and over 400 so far this year. It is not just Chicago. The American Medical Association has declared that gun violence is a public health crisis in our Nation.  So what is Congress doing to save lives in Chicago and across the Nation from gun violence? What is the Senate doing to protect people from being shot? Nothing.  Instead, the Republican Congress is trying to weaken one of the gun laws on the books--the NICS Improvement Amendments Act. This is the law passed unanimously by Congress after the Virginia Tech massacre and signed into law in 2008 by President George W. Bush.  This law says that every Federal agency needs to let the FBI NICS background check system know when the agency has information about people who fall within the legal prohibitions on gun possession. Everyone agreed we needed to get these records into the NICS system, especially records about those who are seriously mentally unstable, such as the Virginia Tech shooter. That man had a history of mental illness, but he was able to buy guns and kill 32 people because his records were not in the background check system known as NICS.  There is a longstanding Federal prohibition on gun possession by those who are suffering from mental illness. This prohibition is so well established that the late Justice Antonin Scalia cited it in the Supreme Court's Heller decision as an example of a restriction that is presumptively lawful and consistent with the Second Amendment.  There have been tragic cases where people with serious mental illnesses have used guns to cause great harm. The Newtown, CT, shooter showed signs of severe mental health problems that went untreated before he killed 20 students and 6 educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School. The Tucson, AZ, shooter, who shot Congresswoman Gabby Giffords and killed six others, was diagnosed after the shooting with schizophrenia. And it was 9 years ago today when a gunman who had been diagnosed and treated for mental illness killed 5 people and injured 17 in a classroom building at Northern Illinois University in DeKalb.  About two-thirds of shooting deaths each year are suicides. Last year, there were more than 21,000 suicides by gun. The National Alliance on Mental Illness reports that ``about 90% of individuals who die by suicide experience mental illness.''  Mental illness is a challenging issue for our society. I have worked to expand treatment and coverage for mental illness, including through the Affordable Care Act, one of the most important single laws we have ever passed to address mental illness. I wish those who are trying to repeal this commonsense gun safety regulation would drop that effort and join us in stopping this repeal of the Affordable Care Act. We need more and better services for people with mental illness.  The reality is that the gun laws on the books are narrowly drawn when it comes to mental illness and so is the rule we are being asked to repeal today. Current Federal law says that a person who has been ``adjudicated as a mental defective'' is prohibited from gun possession. The phrase ``adjudicated as a mental defective'' is defined in the law as a determination by ``a court, board, commission, or other lawful authority that a person, as a result of marked subnormal intelligence, or mental illness, incompetency, condition, or disease: (1) is a danger to himself or others; or (2) lacks the mental capacity to contract or manage his own affairs.''  The 2008 NICS Improvement law, signed into law by President George W. Bush, directed Federal agencies to send their relevant records to the NICS system. Last year, the Social Security Administration issued a rule to implement this law after concluding that certain determinations by the Social Security Administration qualify as an adjudication of mental defectiveness.  Let me explain what the SSA rule says. Under this rule, starting in December of this year, the Social Security Administration will begin sending to NICS--the body which gathers information and records for background checks before the possession of firearms--the name, date of birth, and Social Security number of people who meet each of the five threshold criteria. The person must be between the ages of 18 and 65, have filed a claim with SSA for benefits based on disability, have been diagnosed with a serious, long-term mental disorder, have been determined by SSA to be disabled and unable to perform substantial work because of the mental disorder, and have been subject to determination by the Social Security Administration that the mental disorder is so serious that the person needs to have a representative appointed to manage the person's benefits.  This is not a situation where the Social Security Administration would notify NICS just because a person can't balance his checkbook. There must be a seriously debilitating, medically diagnosed mental illness involved.  The rule is prospective only. Current Social Security disability beneficiaries are not subject to it. The rule is predicted to cover about 75,000 Americans, once it takes effect, out of the estimated 10 million suffering from a serious mental illness.  I might add here for the record, I do not suggest that every person who has any form of mental illness is a danger. In fact, exactly the opposite is true. But we do know that those who suffer from serious mental conditions many times are engaged in violent conduct and many times with horrible results when they have firearms.  The rule we are being asked to repeal on the floor of the Senate provides for advance notice of the Social Security Administration determination and the right to appeal through an administrative process and in court. A person canobtain relief from the firearms prohibition by having healthcare providers and character witnesses submit statements that the person is not a danger to himself or others.  Every politician claims they want to keep deadly firearms out of the hands of those who are seriously mentally unstable. A statement made by a Republican Senator from Texas, Senator Cornyn, the senior Senator from Texas and my counterpart on the Republican side; he said in March 2013:       If there was a common thread in the Virginia Tech, Tucson,      Aurora, and Newtown massacres, it was the mental illness of      the shooter. . . . We should refocus our effort to make sure      the current background check system works to screen out the      dangerously mentally-ill.  Reasonable people can disagree over whether the SSA's rule gets it exactly right. There are mental health groups that have concerns about it, and I respect that. But using the Congressional Review Act is a blunt tool. Instead of fixing the rule, the Congressional Review Act would repeal the rule and--listen to this--permanently bar the Social Security Administration from adopting any substantially similar rule. So it likely would bar the Social Security Administration from ever implementing a rule to submit mental health records to NICS in the future.  If there are problems with this rule, they can be addressed by fixing it. But the Republican response is always repeal first. This time, they want to repeal a rule that doesn't start until December and its repeal would preclude the Social Security Administration from even fixing or positively changing it.  We also had disputes over the process the Department of Veterans Affairs used to submit names of people with mental illness to the same NICS background check system. Last December, we fixed it on a bipartisan basis. We passed language in the 21st Century Cures Act to ensure that a person can have his own doctor and lawyer involved in the process. If the Social Security Administration rule needs fixing, we can fix it too. But this Congressional Review Act is a sledgehammer, not a tool to fix it.  We are being asked to vote today to ban an agency permanently from complying with the NICS law that we enacted in 2008. We are being asked to undermine the gun laws that are on the books.  I urge my colleagues to listen to the opposition of this resolution of disapproval. Read the letter from the U.S. Conference of Mayors, who say that the Social Security Administration rule ``is critically important to the fabric of our nation's background check system.'' Read the editorials in newspapers across the country that oppose repealing this rule.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the editorial from the Chicago Tribune be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Chicago Tribune, Feb. 10, 2017]       Editorial: Guns and Mental Illness: Don't Scrap This Rule                          (By Editorial Board)       If someone has a mental illness severe enough that he      cannot work or manage his own money, should he be allowed to      own a gun?       In the waning weeks of his presidency, Barack Obama      answered that question. Motivated by Adam Lanza's bloody      rampage at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., that      killed 20 children and six educators in 2012, Obama imposed a      rule that barred gun ownership for people who qualify for      Social Security disability insurance because their mental      illness keeps them from working, and who cannot manage their      benefits. That pool is small--just 75,000 Americans.       The GOP-led U.S. House just voted to scrap that rule. Bad      move. The Senate now decides whether to back that bad move.      If it does, President Trump would decide whether to go along      or disagree.       Republican lawmakers hang their case on the argument that      the rule stigmatizes people with disabilities as dangerous.      ``There are people who need help and seek help, but that is      not a criteria for taking away one's constitutional right''      to own a gun, Texas Rep. Pete Sessions said.       Sessions implicitly exaggerates the impact of the rule. As      gun control measures go, the scope of this one is narrow. Its      goal is to keep guns out of the hands of people on record as      having a disabling mental disorder. The standard for taking      that gun away is steep--they have to be on Social Security      because their psychiatric disorder keeps them from working,      and they cannot manage their own affairs. Both conditions      must be met. Even if the rule keeps someone from owning a      gun, that person can pursue an appeal.       America has seen what can happen when someone with severe      psychiatric issues has access to firearms. Their names and      crimes live in infamy:       In 2007, Seung Hui Cho shot to death 32 people at Virginia      Tech University before killing himself. Two years earlier, a      judge had deemed Cho an ``imminent danger'' because of mental      illness and ordered him to seek treatment. But because he was      never committed, that assessment never got recorded in the      federal database of people ineligible to buy guns. Cho passed      the background check and bought the guns he would wield at      Virginia Tech.       In 2011, Jared Loughner shot U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords      in the head and murdered six other people in Tucson, Ark.       In 2012, James Holmes strode into a packed movie theater in      Aurora, Colo., and opened fire, killing 12 people.       And there's Lanza, who went through months of hysterical      crying, stretches of lethargy and self-imposed isolation from      his family before unleashing terror at Sandy Hook Elementary      School. ``I didn't understand that Adam was drifting away,''      his father, Peter Lanza, told The New Yorker in 2014.       These crimes showcase the dangers in allowing severely      troubled individuals to buy firearms. The rule the House      voted to scrap doesn't cast so wide a net that it applies to      anyone seeking psychiatric treatment. It's specific in scope,      and anchored by a common-sense premise that many House      Republicans ignored: If a person's psychiatric disorder is      disabling enough that the individual cannot work or deal with      money-managing, bright red flags are being raised about his      or her capacity for sound judgment.       To us, that's a logical, well-grounded reason why he or she      shouldn't own a gun.
