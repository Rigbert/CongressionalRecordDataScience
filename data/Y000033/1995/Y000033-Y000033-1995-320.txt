Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I could only echo what the gentleman just said. There is a way we can work on many of these issues and solve the problem if we seek to do so.  The gentleman from Hawaii has always been able to work with me on his issues especially in his great State. We have a great deal in common. We hope to solve some of his problems with the Hawaiian natives which we have also solved in Alaska. I do compliment him.  I may suggest to the gentleman from California [Mr. Miller], the ranking member, we ought to let the gentleman from Hawaii [Mr. Abercrombie] manage these bills more often.  Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.
