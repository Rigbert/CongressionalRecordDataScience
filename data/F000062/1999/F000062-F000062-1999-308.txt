 President, today, I am introducing a bill to require health insurance plans to cover medically necessary reconstructive surgery for congenital defects, developmental abnormalities, trauma, infection, tumors, or disease.  This bill is modeled on a new California law and responds to the growing incidence of denials of coverage by insurance, often managed care. Despite physicians' judgment that surgery is often medically necessary, too many plans are labeling it ``cosmetic surgery.''
