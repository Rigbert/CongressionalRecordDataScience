 President, I rise today to pay tribute to the thousands of workers, both past and present, at the Gaseous Diffusion Plants in Paducah, Portsmouth, and Oak Ridge for their patience and persistence through what has been, and continues to be, a challenging time.  When the reports of contamination broke in the August 8, 1999 edition of the Washington Post, my first thoughts were of the individuals and families who had suffered because of DOE's mistakes. I thought of the pain those workers must have endured from the illnesses and continue to endure in many cases, and the sense of loss families must have felt for those whose loved ones did not survive the harsh effects of contamination.  The story of the Harding Family, of Paducah, still haunts me. To think that a man suffered and died a painful death because of the carelessness of officials at the Department of Energy is incomprehensible. My heart goes out to the Harding Family for the loss of Mr. Joe Harding, and I hope that this dear family can take some solace in the knowledge that it was because of Joe's persistence that this story came to light. Because of Joe's willingness to speak in the face of high-powered opposition, at least 120 other workers who suffer effects of contamination will now be treated and compensated by the United States government. Joe paid the ultimate price in his death, and for that he deserves our sympathy, our respect, and our gratitude.  From that very first moment the story broke, I have been determined to make sure all current and former employees are tested for contamination and that sick employees receive the treatment they need and deserve. Of course, nothing can take the place of good health or life, but every effort should be made to provide compensation for DOE's wrongs.  I want the workers in Paducah, Portsmouth, and Oak Ridge to know that I am working here in the Senate to ensure that they are adequately tested and treated for any problems they experience as a result of contamination at the plant. I have continually sought funding, as a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, and am pleased to have played a role in providing the funding to make health testing equipment, such as the vital lung screening van for Paducah, available to all of the dedicated workers who have served at the each of the Gaseous Diffusion Plants.  The mobile lung screening unit should serve as a symbol to each of the workers and their families that we will keep fighting for your health and safety, for your economic livelihood, and for the cleanup of the plant sites and surrounding neighborhoods.  On behalf of my colleagues in the Senate, I want to say thank you to the employees at the plants for their service to the United States. Your sacrifice to help us win the Cold War will never be forgotten.                          ____________________
