Speaker, I would like to tell those who happen to be mortgage holders across America they have a surprise in store. It is the Republican Christmas tax.  Here is what it is all about: In order to force the President's hand on this budget negotiation, Speaker Gingrich has suggested he would close down the Government.  Major economists know if that occurs interest rates go up. People who have adjusted rate mortgages, where the interest rates vary as those interest rates go up, will have to pay more on their monthly mortgage payment.  So Merry Christmas, America. What Speaker Gingrich would like to do is close down the Government, raise the interest rates, force higher payments on people's home mortgages.  We just read in the paper this morning working families are finding it tougher than ever to get by. They do not need to receive this sort of Christmas gift from Speaker Gingrich, this kind of hidden tax, that imposes a greater burden on families in America. It is unfair.  What we need is a bipartisan, commonsense approach that does not cut Medicare, that does not provide a tax break for the wealthiest of Americans. That is what people sent us to Washington to do.                          ____________________
