President, this Inhofe amendment is one I am opposing, and I urge my colleagues to oppose it. There is already a waiver provision in the bill that offers protection to consumers if corn prices or availability become unsustainable.  Unfortunately, the language of the Inhofe amendment could trigger a dramatic decrease in income of farmers and a dramatic increase in Government costs. As a result, I raise a point of order that the pending amendment violates section 201 of Senate Concurrent Resolution 21, the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2008.
