Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the House overwhelmingly passed H.R. 1892, The Family Sponsor Immigration Act, a bill that will help keep the American Dream alive for immigrants whose hopes have been crushed by the sudden or unexpected death of their American sponsors.  We know that hundreds of thousands of immigrants throughout the world go through the immigration process each year for the chance to share in the promise of America. And what a wonderful promise it is--the opportunity to share in the freedom and blessings of a nation born out of ideals.  In many ways, our immigration process is unique. President Reagan often remarked, ``You can go to Turkey and live there your whole life, but never really become a Turk. You can go to Japan and live there, but never really become Japanese. You can go to Germany, but never become German. But, you can come from any place in the world and become an American.''  This process is often lengthy and many times even tedious. But our laws are designed to provide for the fairest and most just system possible, a system that will not only allow others access to our society, but that will also help foster their success. Integral to the success of immigrants are their American sponsors--proven citizens with established roots and financial security. American sponsors provide the support necessary to help an immigrant begin their journey in America.  We know, however, that under current law, in the rare case that an immigrant's American sponsor passes away, so too dies the promise of America for the immigrant. Imagine the case of an immigrant who applies to become a permanent resident, who plays by all the rules and waits patiently in hope, perhaps to be united with a long separated loved one, but who at the last minute is hit by the death of this loved one. Not only is the loss of this person a tragedy to be overcome, but the hopes and dreams of the immigrant are thwarted as well.  According to reports from INS, this scenario became part of the September 11 tragedy. As the towers crumbled and thousands of lives were lost, so too was lost the chance for immigrants in-waiting to continue on the road to become Americans. Thankfully, the Patriot Act which the President signed last fall included important provisions to extend visas and filing deadlines for the alien relatives of those killed in the World Trade Center already involved with the immigration process. However, more needs to be done to accommodate future scenarios.  HR 1892 will help correct this glitch in our immigration law. It says if a qualifying relative of the deceased sponsor exists, they can act as a replacement. As an immigrant you don't have to start the whole process over again.  Remember, we want to reward those who have played by the rules--those who attempt to go through the process we have designed, seeking justice and fair treatment. Let's correct this unfair technicality in our immigration law to help keep the American Dream a reality for those who lose their sponsors. The hope of freedom should not die because of the untimely death of a sponsor. I thank my colleagues for supporting HR 1892.                          ____________________
