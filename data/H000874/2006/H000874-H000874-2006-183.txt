And I appreciate what you are saying about Friday. That will be dependent upon how quickly we get the work that is before us done. I understand that.  Mr. Leader, we have had some discussions, and we still have pending, as you know, one appropriation bill, the Labor-Health bill which is pending. It has, as you know, attached to it an amendment adopted in a bipartisan fashion on the minimum wage, taking the minimum wage to $7.25 in three increments.  Can you tell me the status of the Labor-Health bill? I know it is not on the calendar, but can you tell me its status?  I yield to my friend.
