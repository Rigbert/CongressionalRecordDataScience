President, today I express my sincere congratulations and best wishes to Nina Thomas on her retirement as registrar at Vermont Law School. Since 1976, Nina has served that institution with dedication and a devotion to its students. As Ms. Thomas ends her many years of exceptional service to Vermont Law School and its students, I wish her the very best as she enters this new chapter of her life. I thank her for her service, and I know her commitment over the years has helped to make the school the special, unique place it is today.  Nina Thomas is a native of Vermont, having attended grade school in the same building that is now part of the Vermont Law School campus in South Royalton, VT. In 1976 she returned to be part of a fledgling institution where her care, her counsel, and her wisdom have made a difference in the lives of many law students who have passed through her office. Her dedication helped the school grow into a successful institution for legal education that is a source of pride for Vermont and Vermonters. Her career spanned from the early days of the school's beginnings to the present, where it stands as a national leader in environmental legal thinking and learning.  As Nina Thomas enters her retirement, I hope she will take great comfort in knowing that the mark she left at Vermont Law School will be a lasting one and that her contributions are part of the school's strong foundation. I know she will be dearly missed by faculty and staff and most especially the students to whom she has given so much.                          ____________________
