 President, Senator DeWine and I have introduced a bill to address the atrocities and human rights abuses inflicted by the Government of Sudan upon its citizens living in the western region of Darfur.  By now you are aware of the terrible violence being perpetrated against civilians by the Government of Sudan and its allied militias in Darfur, Sudan. As many as 30,000 black Africans have been killed. Rape has routinely been used as a weapon of war by the Sudanese Government's janjaweed militia proxies. The Government of Sudan has obstructed the delivery of humanitarian assistance--as a result, over 300,000 people are expected to die of disease and malnutrution. Entire villages have been razed to the ground. Crimes against humanity have and are taking place with frightening regularity. Any reasonable person would agree that at the very least, we are witnessing ethnic cleansing. However, I believe that what we are actually seeing is genocide, and that the burden of proof should be on those who deny that such is the case.  Secretary of State Powell visited Darfur at the end of June. I applaud him for going. His visit as well as that of United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan served to shine a much needed international spotlight on Khartoum's brutal actions.  However, I am disappointed in the actions taken by the administration in the wake of the Secretary's visit.  The administration is circulating a draft United Nations Security Council resolution which puts sanctions on the janjaweed. I do not think pursuing a resolution which would impose an arms and travel embargo on the janjaweed will improve the security situation in Darfur. I am sure there must be a strategy behind this resolution, but on its face, it is hard to see. The janjaweed is not a state actor. It is not even an independent actor. It certainly is not accepting arms shipments from foreign governments. The janjaweed is armed and supplied by the Government of Sudan. And last I heard the only place the janjaweed has traveled is across the border into Chad to further harass its victims. I was not aware that militia members applied for visas to do so. So I would like to know what exactly the thought process behind pursuing such sanctions is.  I would also like to know just why the administration does not believe the Genocide Convention has been triggered. Article II of the Convention defines genocide as any of the following acts committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or substantial part, a national ethnic, racial or religious group: killing members of the group; causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; or forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.  Let's consider what we know to be the case in Darfur and compare it to the criteria set out in the Convention.  Is there an intent to destroy a national ethnic racial or religious group? A U.N. interagency fact finding team found in April that while villages populated by black Africans were destroyed, villages in the same area populated by Arabs were undisturbed. In some cases the villages that were left undisturbed were less than 500 meters away from those that were bombed and burned to the ground, its residents murdered, raped or tortured, its wells poisoned, its food stores and crops destroyed. This seems to me to be a pretty profound indicator that black Africans are being deliberately targeted. The scorched earth policy of the janjaweed makes it virtually impossible for those who live through the attacks to survive. One can reasonably assume that they were not meant to.  We know that the Government of Sudan, through it janjaweed proxies, has murdered an unknown number of people--perhaps 30,000--because of their ethnicity.  We also know that the militia has caused serious bodily and mental harm to black Africans in Darfur. According to the Convention only one or the other is necessary to qualify as genocide, but the janjaweed and the Sudanese military have done both. As a recent Washington Post article points out, the text of which I ask unanimous consent be printed in the Record, the janjaweed have engaged in widespread systematic rape in an effort to populate Darfur with Arab babies.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, June 30, 2004] `We Want to Make a Light Baby'; Arab Militiamen in Sudan Said To Use                    Rape as Weapon of Ethnic Cleansing                             (By Emily Wax)       Geneina, Sudan, June 29.--At first light on Sunday, three      young women walked into a scrubby field just outside their      refugee camp in West Darfur. They had gone out to collect      straw for their family's donkeys. They recalled thinking that      the Arab militiamen who were attacking African tribes at      night would still be asleep. But six men grabbed them,      yelling Arabic slurs such as ``zurga'' and ``abid,'' meaning      ``black'' and ``slave.'' Then the men raped them, beat them      and left them on the ground, they said.       ``They grabbed my donkey and my straw and said, `Black      girl, you are too dark. You are like a dog. We want to make a      light baby,' '' said Sawela Suliman, 22, showing slashes from      where a whip had struck, her thighs as her father held up a      police and health report with details of the attack. ``They      said, `You get out of this area and leave the child when it's      made.' ''       Suliman's father, a tall, proud man dressed in a flowing      white robe, cried as she described the rape. It was not an      isolated incident, according to human rights officials and      aid workers in this region of western Sudan, where 1.2      million Africans have been driven from their lands by      government-backed Arab militias, tribal fighters known as      Janjaweed.       Interviews with two dozen women at camps, schools and      health centers in two provincial capitals in Darfur yielded      consistent reports that the Janjaweed were carrying out waves      of attacks targeting African women. The victims and others      said the rapes seemed to be a systematic campaign to      humiliate the women, their husbands and fathers, and to      weaken tribal ethnic lines. In Sudan, as in many Arab      cultures, a child's ethnicity is attached to the ethnicity of      the father.       ``The pattern is so clear because they are doing it in such      a massive way and always saying the same thing,'' said an      international aid worker who is involved in health care. She      and other international aid officials spoke on condition of      anonymity, saying they feared reprisals or delays of permits      that might hamper their operations.       She showed a list of victims from Rokero, a town outside of      Jebel Marra in central Darfur where 400 women said they were      raped by the Janjaweed. ``It's systematic,'' the aid worker      said. ``Everyone knows how the father carries the lineage in      the culture. They want more Arab babies to take the land. The      scary thing is that I don't think we realize the extent of      how widespread this is yet.''       Another international aid worker, a high-ranking official,      said: ``These rapes are built on tribal tensions and      orchestrated to create a dynamic where the African tribal      groups are destroyed. It's hard to believe that they tell      them they want to make Arab babies, but it's true. It's      systematic, and these cases are what made me believe that it      is part of ethnic cleansing and that they are doing it in a      massive way.''       Secretary of State Colin L. Powell flew to the capital,      Khartoum, on Tuesday to pressure the government to take steps      to ease the humanitarian crisis in Darfur. U.S. officials      said Powell may threaten to seek action by the United Nations      if the Sudanese government blocks aid and continues      supporting the Janjaweed. U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan      is due to arrive on Khartoum this week.       The crisis in Darfur is a result of long-simmering ethnic      tensions between nomadic cattle and camel herders, who view      themselves as Arabs, and the more sedentary farmers, who see      their ancestry as African. In February 2003, activists from      three of Darfur's African tribes started a rebellion against      the government, which is dominated by an Arab elite.       Riding on horseback and camel, the Janjaweed, many of them      teenagers or young adults, burned villages, stole and      destroyed grain supplies and animals and raped women,      according to refugees and U.N. and human rights      investigators. The government used helicopter gunships and      aging Russian planes to bomb the area, the U.N. and human      rights representatives said. The U.S. government has said it      is investigating the killings of an estimated 30,000 people      in Darfur and the displacement of the more than 1 million      people from their tribal lands to determine whether the      violence should be classified as genocide.       The New York-based organization Human Rights Watch said in      a June 22 report that it investigated ``the use of rape by      both Janjaweed and Sudanese soldiers against women from the      three African ethnic groups targeted in the `ethnic      cleansing' campaign in Darfur.'' It added, ``The rapes are      often accompanied by dehumanizing epithets, stressing the      ethnic nature of the joint government-Janjaweed campaign. The      rapists use the terms `slaves' and `black slaves' to refer to      the women, who are mostly from the Fur, Masalit and Zaghawa      ethnic groups.''       Despite a stigma among tribal groups in Sudan against      talking about rape, Darfur elders have been allowing and even      encouraging their daughters to speak out because of the      frequency of the attacks. The women consented to be named in      this article.       In El Fasher, the capital of North Darfur, about 200 miles      east of Geneina, Aisha Arzak Mohammad Adam, 22, described a      rape by militiamen. ``They said, `Dog, you have sex with me,'      '' she said. Adam, who was receiving medical treatment at the      Abu Shouk camp, said through a female interpreter that she      was raped 10 days ago and has been suffering from stomach      cramps and bleeding. ``They said, `The government gave me      permission to rape you. This is not your land anymore, abid,      go.' ''       Nearby, Ramadan Adam Ali, 18, a frail woman, was being      examined at the health clinic. She was pregnant from a rape      she said took place four months ago. She is a member of      the Fur tribe and has African features.       ``The man said, `Give me your money, slave,''' she said,      starting to cry. ``Then I must tell you very frankly, he      raped me. He had a gun to my head. He called me dirty abid.      He said I was very ugly because my skin is so dark. What will      I do now?''       In Tawilah, a village southeast of El Fasher, women and      children are living in a musty school building. They said it      was too dangerous to leave and plant food.       Fatima Aisha Mohammad, once a schoolteacher, stood in a      dank classroom describing what happened to her three weeks      ago, when she left the school to collect firewood.       ``Very frankly, they selected us ladies and had what they      wanted with us, like you would a wife,'' said Mohammad, 46,      who has five children. ``I am humiliated. Always they said,      `You are nothing. You are abid. You are too black.' It was      disgusting.''       During a recent visit, government minders warned people at      the school to stop talking about the rapes or face beatings      or death. Minders also were seen handing out bribes to keep      women from speaking to foreign visitors. But those at the      school spoke anyway. A group of people handed a journalist      two letters in Arabic that listed 40 names of rape victims,      and wanted the list to be sent to Sen. Sam Brownback of      Kansas and Rep. Frank R. Wolf of Virginia, Republicans who      were touring the region and pressing the government to disarm      the Janjaweed.       ``I was sad. I am now very angry. Now they are trying to      silence us. And they can't,'' Mohammad said. ``What will      people think of all of us out here? That we did this to      ourselves? People will know the truth about what is happening      in Darfur.''       Later that day in Tawilah's town center, Kalutum Kharm, a      midwife, gathered a crowd under a tree to talk about the      rapes. Everyone was concerned about the children who would be      born as a result.       ``What will happen? We don't know how to deal with this,''      Kharm lamented. ``We are Muslims. Islam says to love children      no matter what. The real problem is we need security. We      don't trust the government. We need this raping to stop.''       Aid workers and refugees in Geneina said that despite an      announcement last week by Sudan's president, Lt. Gen. Omar      Hassan Bashir, that the Janjaweed would be disarmed, security      had not improved. Janjaweed dressed in military uniforms and      clutching satellite phones roamed the markets and the fields,      guns slung over their shoulders. Last week, the Janjaweed      staged a jailbreak and freed 13 people, aid workers said.      They also killed a watermelon salesman and his brother      because they did not like their prices, family members of the      men said.       A government official, speaking with a reporter, described      the rapes as an inevitable part of war and dismissed      accusations by human rights organizations that the attacks      were ethnically based.       In Geneina, two women told their stories while sitting in      front of their makeshift straw shelter. One of the women, a      thin 19-year-old with dead eyes, moved forward.       ``I am feeling so shy but I wanted to tell you, I was raped      too that day,'' whispered Aisha Adam, the tears rushing out      of her eyes as she covered her face with her head scarf.      ``They left me without my clothing by the dry riverbed. I had      to walk back naked. They said, `You slave. This is not your      area. I will make an Arab baby who can have this land.' I am      hurting now so much, because no one will marry me if they      find out.''       Sitting on mats outside the shelter, Sawela Suliman's      father talked with village elders about what to do if his      daughter became pregnant.       ``If the color is like the mother, fine,'' he said as a      crowd gathered to listen. ``If it is like the father, then we      will have problems. People will think the child is an Arab.''       Then his daughter looked up.       ``I will love the child,'' she said, as other women in the      crowd agreed. ``But I will always hate the father.''       Then the rains came. They pounded onto the family's frail      shelter, turning their roof into a soggy and dripping clump      of straw. Suliman started to shiver as the weather shifted      from steaming hot to a breezy rain. She will no longer leave      the area of her hut to collect straw. She will stay here,      hiding as if in prison, she said, and praying that she is not      pregnant.
