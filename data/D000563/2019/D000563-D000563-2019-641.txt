President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 894       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Domestic Terrorism      Prevention Act of 2019''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds the following:       (1) White supremacists and other far-right-wing extremists      are the most significant domestic terrorism threat facing the      United States.       (2) On February 22, 2019, a Trump Administration United      States Department of Justice official wrote in a New York      Times op-ed that ``white supremacy and far-right extremism      are among the greatest domestic-security threats facing the      United States. Regrettably, over the past 25 years, law      enforcement, at both the Federal and State levels, has been      slow to respond. . . .Killings committed by individuals and      groups associated with far-right extremist groups have risen      significantly.''.       (3) An April 2017 Government Accountability Office report      on the significant, lethal threat posed by domestic violent      extremists explained that ``[s]ince September 12, 2001, the      number of fatalities caused by domestic violent extremists      has ranged from 1 to 49 in a given year.'' The report noted:      ``[F]atalities resulting from attacks by far right wing      violent extremists have exceeded those caused by radical      Islamist violent extremists in 10 of the 15 years, and were      the same in 3 of the years since September 12, 2001. Of the      85 violent extremist incidents that resulted in death since      September 12, 2001, far right wing violent extremist groups      were responsible for 62 (73 percent) while radical Islamist      violent extremists were responsible for 23 (27 percent).''.       (4) An unclassified May 2017 joint intelligence bulletin      from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department      of Homeland Security found that ``white supremacist extremism      poses [a] persistent threat of lethal violence,'' and that      White supremacists ``were responsible for 49 homicides in 26      attacks from 2000 to 2016 . . . more than any other domestic      extremist movement''.       (5) Fatal terrorist attacks by far-right-wing extremists      include--       (A) the August 5, 2012, mass shooting at a Sikh gurdwara in      Oak Creek, Wisconsin, in which a White supremacist shot and      killed 6 members of the gurdwara;       (B) the April 13, 2014, mass shooting at a Jewish community      center and a Jewish assisted living facility in Overland      Park, Kansas, in which a neo-Nazi shot and killed 3      civilians, including a 14-year-old teenager;       (C) the June 8, 2014, ambush in Las Vegas, Nevada, in which      2 supporters of the far-right-wing ``patriot'' movement shot      and killed 2 police officers and a civilian;       (D) the June 17, 2015, mass shooting at the Emanuel AME      Church in Charleston, South Carolina, in which a White      supremacist shot and killed 9 members of the church;       (E) the November 27, 2015, mass shooting at a Planned      Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs, Colorado, in which an      anti-abortion extremist shot and killed a police officer and      2 civilians;       (F) the March 20, 2017, murder of an African-American man      in New York City, allegedly committed by a White supremacist      who reportedly traveled to New York ``for the purpose of      killing black men'';       (G) the May 26, 2017, attack in Portland, Oregon, in which      a White supremacist allegedly murdered 2 men and injured a      third after the men defended 2 young women whom the      individual had targeted with anti-Muslim hate speech;       (H) the August 12, 2017, attack in Charlottesville,      Virginia, in which a White supremacist killed one and injured      nineteen after driving his car through a crowd of individuals      protesting a neo-Nazi rally, and of which former Attorney      General Jeff Sessions said, ``It does meet the definition of      domestic terrorism in our statute.'';       (I) the July 2018 murder of an African-American woman from      Kansas City, Missouri, allegedly committed by a White      supremacist who reportedly bragged about being a member of      the Ku Klux Klan;       (J) the October 24, 2018, shooting in Jeffersontown,      Kentucky, in which a White man allegedly murdered 2 African      Americans at a grocery store after first attempting to enter      a church with a predominantly African-American congregation      during a service; and       (K) the October 27, 2018, mass shooting at the Tree of Life      Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in which a White      nationalist allegedly shot and killed 11 members of the      congregation.       (6) In November 2018, the Federal Bureau of Investigation      released its annual hate crime incident report, which found      that in 2017, hate crimes increased by approximately 17      percent, including a 23-percent increase in religion-based      hate crimes, an 18-percent increase in race-based crimes, and      a 5-percent increase in crimes directed against LGBT      individuals. The total number of reported hate crimes rose      for the third consecutive year. The previous year's report      found that in 2016, hate crimes increased by almost 5      percent, including a 19-percent rise in hate crimes against      American Muslims; additionally, of the hate crimes motivated      by religious bias in 2016, 53 percent were anti-Semitic.      Similarly, the report analyzing 2015 data found that hate      crimes increased by 6 percent that year. Much of the 2015      increase came from a 66-percent rise in attacks on American      Muslims and a 9-percent rise in attacks on American Jews. In      all three reports, race-based crimes were most numerous, and      those crimes most often targeted African Americans.       (7) On March 15, 2019, a White nationalist was arrested and      charged with murder after allegedly killing 50 Muslim      worshippers and injuring more than 40 in a massacre at the Al      Noor Mosque and Linwood Mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand.      The alleged shooter posted a hate-filled, xenophobic      manifesto that detailed his White nationalist ideology before      the massacre. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern labeled the      massacre a terrorist attack.       (8) In January 2017, a right-wing extremist who had      expressed anti-Muslim views was charged with murder for      allegedly killing 6 people and injuring 19 in a shooting      rampage at a mosque in Quebec City, Canada. It was the first-     ever mass shooting at a mosque in North America, and Prime      Minister Trudeau labeled it a terrorist attack.       (9) On February 15, 2019, Federal authorities arrested U.S.      Coast Guard Lieutenant Christopher Paul Hasson, who was      allegedly planning to kill a number of prominent journalists,      professors, judges, and ``leftists in general''. In court      filings, prosecutors described Lieutenant Hasson as a      ``domestic terrorist'' who in an email ``identified himself      as a White Nationalist for over 30 years and advocated for      `focused violence' in order to establish a white homeland.''.
