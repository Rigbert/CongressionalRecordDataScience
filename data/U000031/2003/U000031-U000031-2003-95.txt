Speaker, I rise today to recognize the accomplishments of Pat Moody, host of the popular radio show, ``Moody in the Morning.'' Born in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Pat has enjoyed a thirty year storied career in broadcast media informing and entertaining the residents of Southwest Michigan with his communication skills and talents. Behind the scenes, Pat has been extremely active within the communities of Southwest Michigan, filling such prominent roles as Executive Vice President of the Cornerstone Chamber of Commerce, Vice-Chairman of the Lake Michigan College Board of Trustees, and Member of the Berrien County Cancer Service Board of Directors, just to name a few of his volunteer activities. In fact, Pat Moody has also been honored with the Volunteer of the Year award that identifies him as one of the most dedicated servants in all of Southwest Michigan. Constantly working to contribute to his community, Pat has truly earned my admiration and the respect of the entire Southwest Michigan Community. Happy anniversary, Pat! We wish you continued success!                          ____________________
