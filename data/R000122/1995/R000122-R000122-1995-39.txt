Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Meyers-LaFalce amendment to restore funding for the Office of Advocacy at the Small Business Administration.  The Office of Advocacy successfully served as an independent voice for small business in testifying before Congress and in representing the small business sector before Federal departments and agencies.  The Office of Advocacy has been one of the parts of the SBA that has consistently received strong small business support over the years. Indeed, the delegates to the recent White House Conference on Small Business affirmed their support for the Office of Advocacy, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Federation of Independent Business, and other small business advocacy groups wholeheartedly endorse the Office of Advocacy and support this amendment.  Efforts to make the SBA more effective and efficient should continue to be explored, as they should be in programs throughout our Government. But to eliminate the Office of Advocacy makes no sense.  I urge my colleagues to reject this proposal and to support the Meyers/LaFalce amendment.
