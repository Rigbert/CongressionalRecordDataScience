 President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee amendment be agreed to, the bill be considered read a third time, and the Veterans' Affairs Committee then be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 4110, and that the Senate then proceed to its consideration. I further ask unanimous consent that all after the enacting clause be stricken and the text of S. 2273, as amended, be inserted in lieu thereof, the bill be read a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statement relating to the bill be printed in the Record.  I finally ask that S. 2273 be placed back on the calendar.
