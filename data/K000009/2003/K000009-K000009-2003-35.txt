You have only given me 2 minutes under your limited rule, as millions of people in this country lose their jobs and lose their futures. There is so much suffering we can lay to your hands as one of those who voted for NAFTA in 1993. I want you to meet the people who have lost their jobs all over this country, over 3 million people just in the last 3 years alone.  Look at NAFTA and these trade deficits. You told us in 1993 that this template for trade, which you now want to extend to Singapore and to Chile, would work, that it would give us jobs. It has been just the reverse. Our jobs have been cashed out, and Mexico has turned into an export platform to the United States, and the wages of Mexico's people have been cut by half. By half! You have hurt people in both countries due to those who voted for NAFTA. So we now have lost jobs and growing trade deficits. You told us our trade accounts would be better. We now have half a trillion dollars of trade debt in this country. One million lost jobs alone this year are related to that half a trillion in deficit and every year in the last 10 years, deeper and deeper deficit, more lost jobs. Your plan is not working. We have trade deficits, not surpluses, and we have job losses not jobs created. In my home community of Toledo, unemployment now is 10 percent. Every year it gets worse and the Fed has invented a new term, ``jobless recovery.'' What is that?  And, finally, on China after PNTR, we experienced huge trade deficits with more lost jobs. Your record is indefensible. Vote no on this Singapore and Chile expansion of the NAFTA trade template. It has not worked before, and it surely will not work now.
