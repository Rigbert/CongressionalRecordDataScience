Speaker, I was unable to cast rollcall votes on May 23rd. Had I been present, I would have cast the following votes:  On rollcall 180, I would have voted ``no;'' on rollcall 181, I would have voted ``no;'' on rollcall 182, I would have voted ``yes;'' on rollcall 183, I would have voted ``no.''                          ____________________
