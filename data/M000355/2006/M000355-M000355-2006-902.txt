 We will be starting early tomorrow. We have Senator Kennedy's and Senator Inhofe's amendments lined up, next up in the queue. Members can expect early voteson those two amendments. The managers have outlined an order for the next several amendments. We hope to get short time agreements on each of these and have votes throughout the day. We also expect there likely to be votes into the evening tomorrow. We have a lot of amendments to process for this bill, in fairness to Members on both sides of the aisle who feel strongly about this measure and want to process a very significant number of amendments. With the cooperation of Members on both sides of the aisle, we should be able to accomplish that. Tomorrow will be, as I said earlier, a busy day and potentially a busy evening as well.                          ____________________[Pages S4725-S4726]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                                PROGRAM  Mr. McCONNELL.
