Speaker, James B. Hunt--the four-term Governor of North Carolina, is not only a model public servant, a proud democrat and a long-time dear friend, he is the rare visionary who actually knows how to implement his vision and get demonstrable results.  The ``No Child Left Behind Act'' was an historic bipartisan achievement for our Nation. And it was a signal accomplishment for President Bush and Members on both sides of the aisle in Congress.  But the fact is, governor Hunt was in the vanguard of the movement for education reform in the States and his hard work helped inspire the enactment of this important Federal law.  When it comes to education, Jim Hunt not only put North Carolina on the map, he has helped move the Tarheel State toward the top of the heap.  His smart start program--a public-private partnership in each of North Carolina's 100 counties--helps provide quality child care, health care and family support for each child who needs it.  The ``Judy Centers'' in Maryland--named for my late wife, who was a strong advocate of early childhood education--provide many of the same services.  Jim Hunt helped set up North Carolina's primary reading program. He helped reduce class size, and create a dropout prevention program.  And, he established the State's school of science and mathematics, the Microelectronics Center of North Carolina, and the North Carolina Biotechnology Center.  He also helped put in place one of the most rigorous, approaches to measuring student performance, requiring mastery before promotion and graduation and providing assistance to turn around failing schools.  When it comes to education reform that gets results, no one in America has had a more profound impact than Jim Hunt.  He didn't just claim victory after signing these initiatives into law. He demanded--and received--results.  For example, The Rand Corporation reported that North Carolina Public Schools improved test scores more than any other State in the 1990s.  And, the 1997 national education goals report showed that North Carolina had the most impressive improvements toward reaching educational goals outlined by the panel, and made significant progress in science and math.  But Governor Hunt's contributions have been felt far beyond the borders of North Carolina.  They have been felt throughout the Nation.  As the founding chair of the national board for professional teaching standards, Jim Hunt has been a driving force in improving student achievement by raising teaching standards.  Quite simply, the national board helps teachers improve their skills, so that they can better serve their students.  Governor Hunt has always recognized that the key to a first-rate education is first-rate teaching.  And, through the national board he has helped raise the bar, striving to give professional educators the respect and training that they deserve.  Finally, let me say that Jim Hunt has always understood and focused on the nexus between educational achievement and economic success.  Today, figures from across the political spectrum--Bill Clinton, Newt Gingrich, Bill Gates and the U.S. Chamber--recognize and are talking about that nexus.  ``We are living in a world,'' said President Clinton, ``Where what you can earn is a function of what you can learn.''  This issue, the centrality of education and knowledge in today's global economy, unites all of us.  And Jim Hunt has recognized that for more than 25 years.  A few years ago, the Raleigh News and Observer stated that, ``Jim Hunt served his State with practical accomplishment and with forceful leadership in times of crisis. Of that, he, and we, can be proud.''  Governor Hunt is a trailblazer who has lit the path to personal fulfillment and professional accomplishment for literally thousands of North Carolinians and men and women all across this Nation.  His insight has been invaluable. His determination has been essential. And his leadership has been practical, productive and profound.                          ____________________
