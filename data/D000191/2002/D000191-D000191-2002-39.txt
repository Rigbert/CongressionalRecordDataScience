Speaker, on April 15, not that long ago, more than 88 million Americans dutifully filed their individual income taxes. But now we find out that a growing number of United States corporations have developed a new tax dodge, a new sort of Bermuda Triangle to disappear their tax obligations to the Federal Government and the United States of America.  That is not too surprising, given the attitude of the Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. O'Neill. He said that absolutely he backs the abolition of taxes on corporations. ``The clear economic truth is that businesses and corporations don't pay taxes, they just collect them for the government,'' he told the Financial Times. He is part right. Many corporations do not pay taxes anymore. The burden is growing on individual Americans. Thirty years ago when our corporations were the envy of the world and we were the manufacturing capital of the world, 25 percent of the taxes of the United States were paid by corporations. Today, it is less than 10. Of course, most of our manufacturing has fled overseas and now those companies that have remained here are hoping to move their tax obligations offshore to places where they do not pay taxes. They say, as Stanley Works did in defending this practice when they held a recent vote of stockholders, it is all about the stockholders.  From today's New York Times, it is not about the stockholders. It is about the CEOs. It is all about the CEOs. According to the New York Times, the CEO of Stanley Works will get 58 percent of the $30 million they expect to not pay in Federal income taxes by moving the corporation to Barbados and Bermuda. So we screw the American taxpayers. We screw the stockholders, too, because they are going to have to pay capital gains taxes. But the gentleman who runs the company will get a huge bonus. He might still have to pay some U.S. income taxes, but he probably has some smart accountants who will figure out how he can get around that, too.  What is the reaction of the United States Congress to this scandal? We had hoped here in the United States House of Representatives, the people's House, that there would be some outrage about this shift of taxes from large, profitable corporations and their CEOs on to individual Americans and small businesses. But instead, on the Republican side, the reaction is protect these tax dodges at any cost.  We were going to take up a bill on the marriage penalty, which is a real problem for American families. But on the Democratic side we were going to offer an amendment, an amendment to close this tax loophole, to break up the new Bermuda Triangle, to not allow companies that are based in, manufacture in, employ people in the United States of America to pretend that they are in Barbados and pretend that they are in Bermuda in order to avoid their tax obligations.  It should not be very controversial, should it? This is a time, as we heard so eloquently from the gentleman before me, of great threat to our Nation where people should not be asking questions about who knew what, when, where and how. But this is something we know, and we should be asking, why should we allow these corporations to avoid their tax obligations? Why should they not join in the great patriotic need to raise funds to fight the threat of terrorism? Why should they enjoy all the privileges of American citizenship and pay not a whit for it? But the reaction of the House leadership was to cancel the consideration of the marriage penalty on another day as a regular bill and bring it up instead as a suspension tomorrow with no amendments allowed. God forbid that the United States House of Representatives should break up this little scam. I mean, after all, this CEO of Stanley Works will probably send a good part of his little take there, his $17.8 million to one of their fund-raisers in gratitude, maybe 10 percent, maybe 20. Who knows what the share will be.  This is absolutely outrageous. The American people are paying their taxes. The country is under attack. We are in a huge deficit. We are spending the Social Security trust fund. The lockbox for Social Security is long gone. We are piling up a huge and growing deficit. We have enough controversy over the proposals by the Republicans to make permanent the tax cuts for the largest estates and the wealthiest Americans, but to allow this outrage, companies based in the United States of America, in all reality, to rent a post office box in Bermuda and a filing cabinet in Barbados and pretend they are not U.S. corporations anymore and not pay any taxes.  I am ashamed of the Republican leadership.                          ____________________
