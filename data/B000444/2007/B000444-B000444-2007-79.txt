 President, I wish to take a moment to recognize the people of the Republic of Greece who have demonstrated great bravery in the midst of terrible tragedy this summer. More than 5 people have died in the fires ravaging Greece during the past month. The scope of these fires is shocking. The flames showed no mercy to the elderly, young children, or the treasures of antiquity. Our sympathy and condolences go out to the families of the dozens of people who have died as a result of this tragedy and to the many people driven from their homes by the disaster.  As in New Orleans after Katrina, or in the wake of any terrible disaster, emergency aid is critical, but focus on the long-term needs of the victims is essential. The Greek people have responded bravely to the crisis. I understand that the Government of the United States has provided assistance and is in the process of working with the Greek Government, Greek-American organizations, and the Greek Orthodox Church to determine what those needs are. I urge the administration to continue to demonstrate our commitment to our Greek allies in the wake of these horrific events. Our allies can and should rightly judge us by our concern and commitment for them in times of adversity. Greece has been there for us; America must be there for Greece.                          ____________________
