First:       Franks' Central Command did have an extensive plan to      restore order and begin rebuilding the country, called      Operation Desert Crossing, said retired Marine Gen. Anthony      Zinni, who drew up the plan and updated it continuously when      he led Centcom until 2000. It was never used.  Further in the story:       Central Command originally proposed a force of 380,000 to      attack and occupy Iraq. Rumsfeld's opening bid was about      40,000, ``a division-plus,'' said three senior military      officials who participated in the discussions. Bush and his      top advisers finally approved the 250,000 troops the      commanders requested to launch the invasion. But the      additional troops that the military wanted to secure Iraq      after Hussein's regime fell were either delayed or never      sent.  I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:            [From the Philadelphia Inquirer, Oct. 17, 2004]                The Iraq War: Miscalculation and Misstep       Washington.--In March 2003, days before the start of the      U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, American war planners and      intelligence officials met at Shaw Air Force Base in South      Carolina to review the Bush administration's plans to oust      Saddam Hussein and implant democracy in Iraq.       Near the end of his presentation, an Army lieutenant      colonel who was giving a briefing showed a slide describing      the Pentagon's plans for rebuilding Iraq after the war, known      in the planners' parlance as Phase     4-C. He was uncomfortable with his material--and for good      reason. The slide said: ``To Be Provided.''       An Inquirer Washington Bureau review of the Iraq policy and      decisions of the administration has found that it invaded      Iraq without a comprehensive plan in place to secure and      rebuild the country. The administration also failed to      provide about 100,000 additional U.S. troops that American      military commanders originally wanted to help restore order      and reconstruct a country shattered by war, a brutal      dictatorship, and economic sanctions.       In fact, some senior Pentagon officials had thought they      could bring most American soldiers home from Iraq by      September 2003. Instead, more than a year later, 138,000 U.S.      troops are still fighting insurgents who slip easily across      Iraq's long borders, diehards from the old regime, and Iraqis      angered by their country's widespread crime and unemployment      and the United States' sometimes heavy boots.       ``We didn't go in with a plan. We went in with a theory,''      said a veteran State Department officer who was directly      involved in Iraq policy.       The military's plan to defeat Hussein's army worked      brilliantly and U.S. troops have distinguished themselves on      the battlefield.       However, the review found that the President and many of      his advisers ignored repeated warnings that rebuilding Iraq      would be harder than ousting Saddam Hussein, and they tossed      out years of planning about how to rebuild Iraq, in part      because they thought pro-American Iraqi exiles and Iraqi      ``patriots'' would quickly pick up the pieces.       The CIA predicted up until the war's opening days that the      Iraqi army would turn against Hussein, which never happened.       This report is based on official documents and on      interviews with more than three dozen current and former      civilian and military officials who participated directly in      planning for the war and its aftermath. Most still support      the decision to go to war but say many of the subsequent      problems could have been avoided.       Every effort was made to get those who were interviewed to      speak for the record, but many officials requested anonymity      because they didn't want to criticize the administration      publicly or because they feared retaliation.       President Bush and top officials in Secretary of Defense      Donald H. Rumsfeld's office did not respond to repeated      requests for interviews. They have publicly defended their      plans for the invasion and its aftermath, and now some top      officials are blaming the CIA for failing to predict the      messy aftermath of Hussein's fall.       The United States and interim Iraqi Prime Minister Ayad      Allawi are now taking steps to defeat the Iraqi insurgency      and will have national elections in January. They have      negotiated an agreement to disarm some of the militia led by      radical Shiite Muslim cleric Muqtada al-Sadr and are pressing      an offensive against Sunni rebels. After more than a year of      internal squabbling, U.S. military commanders, intelligence      officers, and diplomats in Baghdad are acting as a team.       But the hole created by the absence of an adequate plan to      rebuild Iraq, the failure to provide enough troops to secure      the country, the misplaced faith in Iraqi exiles, and other      mistakes made after Baghdad fell is a deep one.       ``We've finally got our act together, but we're all afraid      it may be too late,'' said one senior official who is engaged      daily in Iraq policy.       The Bush administration's failure to plan to win the peace      in Iraq was the product of many of the same problems that      plagued the administration's case for war, including wishful      thinking, bad information from Iraqi exiles who said Iraqis      would welcome U.S. troops as liberators, and contempt for      dissenting opinions.       However, the administration's planning for postwar Iraq      differed in one crucial respect from its erroneous prewar      claims about Iraq's nuclear, chemical and biological weapons      programs and links to al-Qaeda.       The U.S. intelligence community had been divided about the      state of Hussein's weapons programs, but there was little      disagreement among experts throughout the government that      winning the peace in Iraq could be much harder than      winning a war.       ``The possibility of the United States winning the war and      losing the peace in Iraq is real and serious,'' warned an      Army War College report that was completed in February 2003,      a month before the invasion.       Without an ``overwhelming'' effort to prepare for the U.S.      occupation of Iraq, the report warned, ``The United States      may find itself in a radically different world over the next      few years, a world in which the threat of Saddam Hussein      seems like a pale shadow of new problems of America's own      making.''       A half-dozen intelligence reports also warned that U.S.      troops could face significant postwar resistance. This foot-     high stack of material was distributed at White House      meetings of Bush's top foreign policy advisers, but there's      no evidence that anyone ever acted on it.       ``It was disseminated. And ignored,'' said a former senior      intelligence official.       The Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency was particularly      aggressive in its forecasts, officials said. One briefing      occurred in January 2003. Another, in April 2003, weeks after      the war began, discussed Hussein's plans for attacking U.S.      forces after his troops had been defeated on the battlefield.       Similar warnings came from the Pentagon's Joint Staff, the      State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research, and      the CIA's National Intelligence Council. The council produced      reports in January 2003 titled ``Principal Challenges in      Post-Saddam Iraq'' and ``Regional Consequences of Regime      Change in Iraq.''       Unlike the 1991 Persian Gulf War, in which Iraqi troops      were trying to maintain their grip on Kuwait, ``they are now      defending their country,'' said a senior defense official,      summarizing the Joint Staff's warnings. ``You are going to      get serious resistance. This idea that everyone will join you      is baloney. But it was dismissed.''       Retired Army Lt. Gen. Jay Garner wasn't named to lead      Iraq's reconstruction until January 2003 and didn't oversee      the first major interagency conference on postwar Iraq until      Feb. 21, less than a month before the invasion.       At the Pentagon, the director of the Joint Staff, Army Gen.      George Casey, repeatedly pressed Gen. Tommy Franks, the head      of the Central Command, for a ``Phase 4,'' or postwar, plan,      the senior defense official said.       ``Casey was screaming. `Where is our Phase 4 plan?' '' the      official said. It never arrived. Casey is now the commander      of U.S.-led coalition forces in Iraq.       Franks' Central Command did have an extensive plan to      restore order and begin rebuilding the country, called      Operation Desert Crossing, said retired Marine Gen. Anthony      Zinni, who drew up the plan and updated it continuously when      he led Centcom until 2000. It was never used.       The same officials who saw no need for a plan to secure and      rebuild a defeated Iraq also saw no need to position      thousands of U.S. soldiers, including military police,      engineers, ordnance disposal teams, and civil affairs      specialists, to begin taking control in Iraq even before the      war against Hussein was over.       Long-standing Army doctrine calls for beginning      reconstruction in freed areas of a country while fighting      rages elsewhere. It also calls for a shift in military forces      from combat troops to civil affairs, military police and the      like.       ``Unfortunately, this did not occur despite clear guidance      to the contrary,'' Army Col. Paul F. Dicker wrote in an      assessment.       Bush, Rumsfeld, and other top officials insist that their      military commanders were given everything they requested, and      Franks wrote in his book, American Soldier, that Rumsfeld      supported his war plan.       Technically, that's accurate. However, three top officials      who served with Franks at the time said the plan was the      product of a lengthy and sometimes heated negotiation between      the Central Command and the Pentagon, in which Rumsfeld      constantly pressed Franks and other senior officers to commit      fewer troops to Operation Iraqi Freedom.       At one point, Secretary of State Colin Powell, a former      chairman of the joint chiefs, weighed in on Franks' side and      helped persuade Rumsfeld to commit more troops, a senior      administration official said.       Rumsfeld and his aides wisely wanted to keep the U.S.      footprint in Iraq as small as possible, realizing that more      troops would likely breed more Iraqi resentment, and they      wanted a smaller, faster force that could overwhelm the Iraqi      military before it could torch the country's oil fields,      retreat into the cities and create a humanitarian disaster.       ``There were different motivations by different people in      this administration for going after Iraq, but they all came      together . . . in a way that blotted out prudence and      caution,'' said a senior intelligence official.       Central Command originally proposed a force of 380,000 to      attack and occupy Iraq. Rumsfeld's opening bid was about      40,000, ``a division-plus,'' said three senior military      officials who participated in the discussions. Bush and his      top advisers finally approved the 250,000 troops the      commanders requested to launch the invasion. But the      additional troops that the military wanted to secure Iraq      after Hussein's regime fell were either delayed or never      sent.       As a result, the two Army divisions that Centcom wanted to      help secure the country weren't on hand when Baghdad fell and      the country lapsed into anarchy, and a third, the First      Cavalry from Fort Hood, Texas, fell so far behind schedule      that on April 21 Franks and Rumsfeld dropped it from the      plan.       Moreover, one senior military official said, there was a      realization that fresh troops would eventually be needed to      replace worn-out units in Iraq.       ``We could not burn the candle on the Cav prematurely,'' he      said.       Others said that civilian officials in the Pentagon were so      convinced that these ``follow-on forces'' wouldn't be needed      in Iraq that they thought they could withdraw 50,000 troops      from Iraq in June 2003; 50,000 more in July; and a final      50,000 in August. By September 2003, Rumsfeld and his aides      thought, there would be very few American troops left in      Iraq.       Instead of providing a plan and enough troops to take      control of Iraq, officials, advisers and consultants in and      around the Pentagon and Vice President Dick Cheney's office      bet on Iraqi exiles such as Ahmed Chalabi of the Iraqi      National Congress, who assured them that Iraqis would welcome      U.S. troops as liberators.       Gen. John Keane, the vice chief of the Army staff during      the war, said some defense officials believed the exiles'      promises.       ``We did not see it [the insurgency] coming. And we were      not properly prepared and organized to deal with it. . . .      Many of us got seduced by the Iraqi exiles in terms of what      the outcome would be,'' Keane told a House committee in July.       Rumsfeld's office ``was utterly, arrogantly, ignorantly and      negligently unprepared'' for the aftermath of the war,      said Larry Diamond, who was a political adviser in Baghdad      from January to March of this year.       Douglas Feith, the Defense Department's number-three      official, and former Pentagon consultant Richard Perle both      acknowledged that their vision for post-Hussein Iraq included      putting pro-Western exiles in power.       ``We had a theme in our minds, a strategic idea, of      liberation rather than occupation, giving them [Iraqis] more      authority even at the expense of having things done with      greater efficiency'' by coalition military forces, Feith told      The Philadelphia Inquirer last month.       Perle, in an interview, said he and others had for years      advocated ``helping the Iraqis liberate themselves--which was      a completely different approach than we settled on.''       ``We'll never now how it would have come out if we did it      the way we wanted to do it,'' he said.       The CIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency, and the State      Department all warned that Chalabi was a charlatan, and the      uniformed military dragged its heels in training exiles to      join the fight against Hussein.       The battle over Chalabi was one of numerous bitter      interagency fights about Iraq that Bush and his national      security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, never resolved.       ``I'm not going to put my thumb on the scale,'' Bush said      at a White House meeting in which Chalabi's bona fides were      hotly debated, according to an official who was present.       That left Pentagon officials to plow ahead with their      attempt to position Chalabi and his militia, the Free Iraqi      Fighting Forces, to take power after Saddam's fall.       Within 48 hours of their arrival in Baghdad in April, some      of Chalabi's men, including members of his personal bodyguard      force, began taking cars, bank accounts and real estate, said      a senior military officer who received reports of the events.      It became evident almost as quickly that Chalabi and other      exiles had a larger political following in the Pentagon than      they did in Iraq.       Intelligence officials now charge that Chalabi or some of      his senior aides were paid agents of Iran's intelligence      service, and that Chalabi or his security chief provided      classified U.S. military information to Iran. Chalabi has      denied the allegation.
