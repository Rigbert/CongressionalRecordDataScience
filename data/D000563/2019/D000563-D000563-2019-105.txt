It is quite simple and straightforward: ``I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion, and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God''--defend the Constitution and faithfully discharge the duties of this sacred office. Notably, the oath does not say defend the President over the rule of law or our constitutional duties.  And yet President Trump has made crude and inexcusable attacks against our professional diplomats and military officials who bravely and patriotically tried to abide by this same oath by upholding these values of honor and the rule of law. Career professionals testifying as part of the ongoing impeachment inquiry are facing partisan attacks and even efforts that threaten their lives and careers. President Trump has made no secret of his long-held suspicion of government workers, which he and his allies have perpetually accused of trying to bring down his Presidency.  That former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch told House Members that she felt ``threatened'' by our own President who called her ``bad news'' is despicable. In fact, Trump even attacked Yovanovitch on Twitter last week during her powerful public testimony before the House Intelligence Committee.  There have also been countless baseless attacks and insulting questions of loyalty faced by witnesses such as LTC Alexander Vindman. Vindman, who was born in Kiev, immigrated to the U.S. and spent 20 years as an Army officer, an officer who has shed blood for our country, as recognized by his Purple Heart.  Twenty-five years ago, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was another longtime Army officer who was born behind the Iron Curtain. GEN John Shalikashvili was born in Poland and moved to Peoria, IL, when he was 16. Thank goodness he served our country in a time where his career was not derailed by such degrading attacks.  I commend Defense Secretary Esper for promising that Lieutenant Colonel Vindman ``shouldn't have any fear of retaliation,'' which only begs the question: Why can't Secretary Pompeo make the same promise for State Department officials? U.S. diplomats and military officials put their lives at risk every day at embassies and conflict zones around the world. To be attacked by their own government--and at the highest levels--defies belief and is beneath the offices they hold.  That President Trump and Republicans deride and bully these American patriots for telling the truth while Secretary Pompeo sits silently on his hands is simply beyond the pale. It is the opposite of what we teach our children. These career professionals--thesepatriots--are models of courage and respect for our democratic system that the President and his circle of enablers should look to emulate rather than belittle.                          ____________________
