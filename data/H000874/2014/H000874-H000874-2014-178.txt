Speaker, it is my honor this morning to express the gratitude of the House for this morning's opening prayer by one of Maryland's most dynamic and inspirational faith leaders, my dear friend, Pastor Jonathan Leslie Weaver.  Pastor Weaver likes to share with visitors to his church this verse from Psalms 68: ``Blessed be the Lord, who daily loads us with benefits.''  For the past 25 years, Mr. Speaker, Reverend Weaver has been sharing the benefits of his care and his wisdom with his flock at Greater Mt. Nebo African Methodist Episcopal Church in Bowie, Maryland.  Pastor Weaver has overseen its growth from 100 members in 1988 to more than 1,600 today. It now has more than 50 ministries serving the church and our wider community.  Under the pastor's leadership, the church is engaged in numerous charitable works, including reentry programs, community-based violence prevention, and antihunger projects.  In addition, Mr. Speaker, Pastor Weaver has been at the center of an economic empowerment effort which has advantaged literally tens of thousands of people in our area and now has five chapters throughout our country.  I thank Pastor Weaver, along with his wife, Pamela, for their many yearsof service. They are a blessing to our community.                          ____________________
