 President, I thank the distinguished assistant minority leader for his approval of going ahead on this issue. I thank every Senator on the other side because any Senator on the other side or, for that matter, this side can object to any legislation coming up. Trade legislation is a little more controversial than it used to be. We have had great cooperation from the Democrats in the bipartisan manner it takes to get business done in the Senate on three very important trade agreements, including now this one, the United States-Morocco Free Trade Agreement. Last week we did the United States-Australia Free Trade Agreement, and prior to that the extension and reauthorization of the African Growth and Opportunity Act, which was passed just prior to our previous recess for the Fourth of July.  So often in this body the antagonism gets highlighted between Republican and Democrats. I wish to thank all the minority Members for allowing me to move ahead with this legislation.  Obviously, since I presented this legislation, I support this bill, S. 2677. It is legislation that implements the United States-Morocco Free Trade Agreement. I happen to believe this agreement marks a solid win for America, and when it comes to trade legislation, when we talk about a solid win, that is in economic terms and that creates jobs in America because America produces, in most instances, more than we can consume, particularly in agriculture but in other areas as well.
