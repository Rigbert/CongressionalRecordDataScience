 President, if the Senator will yield for a moment before he turns to the second amendment, I can't emphasize how important I think the change is that the Senator suggests and the enthusiasm with which we accept the amendment.  I happen to like the Senator's second amendment that he is going to withdraw. I hope that will happen in the remainder of this year. If we can't get it done this year, I hope we can next year. I hope the committee will take a look at the entire functioning of the inspector general's office. Quite frankly, a similar thing came up in my other committee, the Judiciary Committee.  Quite frankly, I think we initiated reforms that were needed a decade or more ago to provide for these inspector generals, and they are throughout the Government, which is a good thing. It is not a bad thing. But what we haven't done, in my opinion, is we haven't given the same kind of scrutiny and oversight into how the offices function as we have, for example, the Attorney General's office, or the overall functioning of the State Department.  I hope this is the beginning of not any kind of witch hunt but just a serious, thoughtful oversight about whether or not the inspector general's authority puts it in a position where it has sort of incrementally involved itself in a way that the rights of individuals who are being looked at or who are caught up in a net are, quite frankly, not treated the way we would expect, for example, the U.S. Attorney's Office to proceed.  I thank the Senator. As I said, I like the second amendment which he is going to be withdrawing. Hopefully, we will have an opportunity, with his leadership, to revisit that on another piece of legislation, or on the floor independently.
