President, I rise today to introduce a small but important bill that seeks to improve the quality of the air we breathe and increase the level of public involvement under the Clean Air Act.  The senior Senator from Rhode Island joined me in sponsoring an identical version of this bill as an amendment to the energy bill. Unfortunately, there was an objection to clearing that amendment for unknown reasons.  The objection was a surprise, particularly given the widespread support across a variety of industries and advocacy groups. In fact, the Natural Resources Defense Council and AmericanLung Association sent Senator Reed and me a letter of support.  Under current law, the Clean Air Act allows a petition for a new renewable fuel or renewable fuel additive, including mid-level ethanol blends, to be approved without EPA taking any action whatsoever, not asking for public comment, not conducting studies on the safety or emissions impacts and not reviewing existing emissions or safety studies. In fact, current law provides that a petition is deemed approved even if EPA fails to act or make a determination one way or another.  Environmental law and the Clean Air Act specifically, is premised upon public input and involvement. It is critical that this section of the Act, as elsewhere, provide for adequate stakeholder involvement. My bill would force EPA to give public notice and seek public comment from all interested persons on any petition for a new renewable fuel or renewable fuel additive.  Safeguarding air quality is critical, but guaranteeing that the engines that consumers rely on is important as well. Studies done by Australia's EPA found that mid-level ethanol blends can cause the following problems with motor vehicle and small, off-road engines: failure of exhaust components, for example catalyst, due to heat/durability, engine damage and seizure, engine stalling and stopping, failure of engine cut-off switches, unexpected engagement of cutting blades/chains, and fuel leaks and blockage of fuel lines. My bill directs EPA, with DOE's and USDA's assistance, to study whether the use of higher ethanol blends pose safety, air quality, or engine operability concerns in motor vehicle and nonroad engines, and equipment.  Ethanol proponents should support this bill. The ethanol industry cannot afford to have consumers turn against their product if higher levels of ethanol blends cause their snowmobile, chainsaw, or boat engine to shut down. If EPA's study shows that these higher blends are safe for all engines, then the ethanol industry will benefit from the study.  This bill is about good Government and transparent Government. EPA should not be permitted to approve these petitions ``in the dark of night,'' without public participation.  The bill that I am introducing today, like the amendment that Senator Reed and I offered during the energy bill, will simply make sure that EPA carries out its duty to protect human health and the environment, increase the public's role under the Clean Air Act, and shed light on a currently private process.                                 ______
