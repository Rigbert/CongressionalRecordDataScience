 Chairman, let me explain what happened.  As I understand it, last night a unanimous consent was agreed to by which the Legal Services amendment would be called up first after the five rollcall votes which we voted upon earlier today, and that was confirmed to me by everybody. I was here on the floor of the House ready to go, and I was told, no, Legal Services is coming up. I went up to my office.  For some reason which I do not understand, and I expect it was inadvertent, the Clerk read the first 2 or 3 pages of title 2 of the Justice--Commerce--State appropriation bill before the Legal Services debate began, and the place in the text in which I had an amendment cosponsored by Republicans and Democrats alike was therefore passed.  Given that reality and my belief that this error was inadvertent, that everyone here believed that Legal Services was going to be debated first, I have asked for and am asking now for unanimous consent so that we can debate this very, very important issue which concerns millions of Americans who are deeply concerned about our trade policy.
