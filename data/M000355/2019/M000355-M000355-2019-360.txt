 President, this week, the Senate will continue to confirm President Trump's well-qualified judicial nominees. This President and this Senate have prioritized confirming impressive men and women to these lifetime appointments--talented individuals who believe in the quaint notion that the job of a judge is to apply our Nation's laws and Constitution as they were actually written, not as they might wish they were written.  At the close of business today, it so happens, one in every four judges on the Federal courts of appeals will have been nominated by President Trump and confirmed by us here in the Senate.  There is nothing about this that ought to be viewed as a partisan accomplishment or an accomplishment only for this President or only for one side. That is the wrong way to look at it. Every American should be proud of this. Citizens deserve a judiciary of fairminded men and women who don't confuse their jobs with the job of a legislator. Every Member of this body should be proud to confirm Federal judges who understand that our job is to make the laws, and their job is to apply them fairly.  If the concept of faithful judges fulfilling their proper role strikes anyone as a partisan development or a threat to their political agenda, I would suggest it is their agenda that needs modifying and not the judicial branch that our Founders intended.                          ____________________
