I yield myself such time as I may consume.  First, I want to thank the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Moran) and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Manzullo) for providing us with this opportunity to recognize the contributions of the National Council for International Visitors, particularly on its 50th anniversary, and the importance of the citizen diplomacy of the United States.  Madam Speaker, the person-to-person contacts that occur when international visitors have the opportunity to live and work alongside ordinary Americans are often more than opinion-changing; they can be life-changing. To experience up-close the diversity, generosity, and industry of our people can shatter stereotypes and prejudices far more effectively than press statements and media campaigns. For these reasons, citizen diplomacy is an important tool for increasing the global understanding of American values.  One significant component of our public diplomacy activities has been the International Visitor Leadership Program, a State Department program that brings thousands of current and emerging professional leaders to the U.S. every year for carefully designed short-term visits. Having met with many of those who have come in from abroad, they are very, very useful visits, and they get to see a broad array of America and Americans when they do visit. Numerous International Visitor alumni have gone on to become heads of state, key officials, and industry leaders in their home countries.  For the past 50 years, the National Council for International Visitors has been a critical partner in the success of that program. As a nonprofit professional association, the NCIV helps to coordinate the exchange-related activities of community-based groups throughout the country, drawing on the energy of nearly 80,000 American volunteers every year.                              {time}  1520  During its first 50 years, NCIV has organized professional programs, cultural activities and home visits for more than 190,000 foreign visitors. To that we say thank you.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
