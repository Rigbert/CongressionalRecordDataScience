President, if I could respond to the Senator from Virginia, the chairman of the committee, we have been working for many weeks. We do have a draft. We have had come forth from the other side of the aisle some additional suggestions we are looking at and eager to incorporate. I personally think it would be good to add something to this bill because I think it would be good for the Senate to go on record with its own version which differs from what was done in the House.  So I think it strengthens the position of the Senate in conference for us to put forth our own proposal since, as the Senator points out, this issue is going to arise in conference given the House provisions. So it is not as if it is going to be left to another day. We have legislative language drafted. We have been meeting extensively during the last few weeks. On Friday we received some additional suggestions which we are looking at right now. I cannot predict for certain--I realize time is short--whether there will be bipartisan support for the final version, but there will be a version I am happy with. I do not know if that will be sufficient, however.
