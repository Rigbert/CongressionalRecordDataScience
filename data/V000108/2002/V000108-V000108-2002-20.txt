Speaker, as a member of the Hellenic Caucus since its inception in 1995, I rise today to mark the 28th anniversary of Turkey's invasion, and subsequent occupation of, Cyprus.  In 1960, Cyprus gained its political independence from the British Empire. Fourteen short years later, however, this independence was shattered when 6,000 Turkish troops and 40 tanks invaded the north coast of Cyprus and proceeded to occupy nearly 40 percent of the island. The ensuing fighting killed thousands of Cypriots and forced hundreds of thousands from their homes. Today, there are 1,619 people still missing, five of whom are United States citizens.  Twenty-eight years after the invasion, we are gathering to remember those who died and to ensure that the world never forgets that Cyprus is a land divided. More than 35,000 Turkish troops continue to occupy Cyprus in violation of international law. A barbed wire fence cuts across the island, separating families from their property and splitting this once beautiful country in half.  Over the course of the 107th Congress, I have petitioned the Bush Administration to take positive steps to help end the occupation of Cyprus, requesting that both President Bush and Secretary of State Powell make the reunification of Cyprus a top priority.  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to join with my colleagues in standing up against Turkish oppression in Cyprus. I would especially like to extend my sincere thanks to the dedicated co-chairs of the Hellenic Caucus, Rep. Bilirakis and Rep. Maloney, for their tireless work to ensure that the people of Cyprus are not forgotten. Twenty-eight years is a long time to wait, but it is my sincere hope that our actions will help persuade Turkey to end its unlawful occupation of Cyprus.
