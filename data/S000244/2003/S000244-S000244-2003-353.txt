Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, this vote is going to be the end of a long period where the provisions of this legislation were carefully considered in the Committee on the Judiciary in the House and in the other body. The compromise that was reached by the conferees is a good compromise. It will make a difference to protect children. It will give parents of abducted children the comfort of knowing that those who have harmed their children are going to be dealt with seriously, as well as setting up the machinery to alert the public and the news media as well as the police to try to find an abducted child and return that child home to his or her parents.  This is legislation that deserves all of our support. I ask for an ``aye'' vote on this conference report. I hope that the other body will act quickly and that the President of the United States can sign this legislation very promptly because our children will be better protected as a result.
