 I wish to raise an issue. And it is my intention at the appropriate time to offer an amendment which I hope we can get a vote on because this is an amendment of huge consequence; that is, with the price of heating fuel soaring, if we do not significantly expand LIHEAP funding, there are going to be people who will go cold, people who will die this winter.  We have heard about a number of national emergencies out there. I am certainly sensitive to the crisis taking place in Iowa and as to the remnants of Hurricane Katrina in Louisiana. But I want Members of this body to understand that if we do not substantiallyincrease LIHEAP funding, there will be people in the northern tier of this country who will go cold this winter because they cannot afford to pay the outrageously high prices of home heating fuels that they are going to be asked to pay.  At the appropriate time, I will bring forth an amendment to increase funding by $2.53 billion for fiscal year 2008. Madam President, the Northeast Coalition of Governors has made that request and that is the number I am going to be bringing forth.  I wish to have printed in the Record the letter that was written by the Coalition of Northeastern Governors which is demanding that we have at least $5.1 billion--which is what, as I understand, the authorized level is--that that be, in fact, appropriated.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                      Coalition of                                       Northeastern Governors,                                    Washington, DC, June 18, 2008.     Hon. David Obey,     Chairman, Committee on Appropriations,     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.     Hon. Jerry Lewis     Ranking Member, Committee on Appropriations,     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.     Hon. James Walsh,     Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human          Services, and Education, Longworth House Office Building,          Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Obey, Ranking Member Lewis and Ranking Member      Walsh: As the Subcommittee begins consideration of the FY2009      Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education      appropriations bill, the Coalition of Northeastern Governors      (CONEG) urges you to support funding the Low-Income Home      Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) at the $5.1 billion level      authorized by the Energy Policy Act of 2005. We recognize the      considerable fiscal challenges that face the Appropriations      Committee this year and we deeply appreciate the      Subcommittee's continued, strong support for the LIHEAP      program. However, increased LIHEAP funds are urgently needed      in the face of continually rising energy prices (particularly      for delivered fuels) and the increasing number of households      in arrears to energy utilities. Funding the LIHEAP block      grant program at the $5.1 billion level, and providing it in      a manner that will ensure additional funding to all states,      will help restore some of the purchasing power of the program      and enable states across the nation to provide meaningful      assistance to citizens struggling to pay unaffordable home      energy bills.       The low-income households targeted by the LIHEAP program      are hit particularly hard by soaring energy prices,      especially home energy prices. An increasing number of      households are in arrears to energy utilities. For the      households who depend upon delivered fuels such as heating      oil and propane, the outlook is particularly troubling since      they lack the benefit any utility assistance program. These      households are concentrated in the Northeast, where almost 32      percent of LIHEAP recipient households rely upon delivered      fuels, compared to 12 percent nationally or approximately 4      percent in many warm weather states. Even before the price of      crude oil reached its recent record level, EIA estimated hat      households heating primarily with home heating oil will pay      approximately $2,000 to heat their homes this year. Without      an adequate LIHEAP benefit that can meet the minimum livery      requirement, these households face the prospect that a dealer      will not make a delivery or will require a surcharge, further      reducing the purchasing power of LIHEAP assistance.       The demand for this highly effective program continues to      increase even as the purchasing power of the LIHEAP dollar      plummets, and the average LIHEAP benefit decreases. If      federal funding remains level or declines as home energy      prices continue to rise, states face the difficult decision      of serving fewer households or reducing the level of already      stretched benefits. States in the Northeast have already      incorporated various administrative cost-savings to deliver      the maximum program dollars to households in need. In spite      of these efforts to stretch federal and state LIHEAP funds,      the need for the program is far too great.       Increased, predictable and timely federal funding is vital      for LIHEAP to assist the nation's vulnerable, low-income      households faced with exorbitant home energy bills. With an      appropriation at the $5.1 billion authorized level,      distributed to ensure that additional funding is provided to      all states, the program can offer meaningful assistance to      more households in need, lessen the need for emergency crisis      relief, and make optimum use of leveraging and other cost-     effective programs.       On behalf of all the CONEG Governors, we urge you to      support funding for LIHEAP at the $5.1 billion level in the      FY2009 Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education      appropriations bill.           Regards,     Jim Douglas,       Chair, Governor of Vermont.     David A. Paterson,       Vice-Chair, Governor of New York.     John Lynch,       Lead Governor for LIHEAP, Governor of New Hampshire.
