 Durbin, and Mrs. Feinstein) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.                              S. Res. 263       Whereas over-the-counter and prescription medicines are      extremely safe, effective, and potentially lifesaving when      used properly;       Whereas the abuse and recreational use of over-the-counter      and prescription medicines can be extremely dangerous and      produce serious side effects;       Whereas during a recently sampled month, approximately      7,000,000 individuals 12 years of age and older reported      using prescription psychotherapeutic medicines for non-     medical purposes;       Whereas prescription medications such as pain relievers,      tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives are second only to      marijuana as the most abused drug in the United States;       Whereas recent studies indicate that 2,500,000 children      between 12 and 17 years of age, or 1 out of every 10      children, have intentionally abused cough medicine to get      high from the ingredient dextromethorphan;       Whereas 4,700,000 young adults, or 1 out of every 5 young      men and women, have used prescription medicines for non-     medical purposes;       Whereas in 2008, the National Institute on Drug Abuse      estimated that the rates for intentional abuse of cough      medicine among eighth, tenth, and twelfth graders stood at      3.6 percent, 5.3 percent, and 5.5 percent, respectively;       Whereas according to research from the Partnership for a      Drug-Free America, more than \1/3\rd of teenagers mistakenly      believe that taking prescription drugs, even if not      prescribed by a doctor, is much safer than using street      drugs;       Whereas the lack of understanding by teenagers and parents      of the potential harms of these powerful medicines makes it      more critical than ever to raise public awareness about the      dangers of their abuse;       Whereas when prescription drugs are abused, they are most      often obtained through friends and relatives, but can also be      obtained through rogue internet pharmacies;       Whereas parents should be aware that the Internet gives      teenagers access to websites that promote abuse of medicines;       Whereas National Medicine Abuse Awareness Month promotes      the message that over-the-counter and prescription medicines      should be taken only as labeled or prescribed, and that      taking over-the-counter and prescription medicines for      recreational use or in large doses can have serious and life-     threatening consequences;       Whereas National Medicine Abuse Awareness Month will      encourage parents to educate themselves about this problem      and talk to their children about all types of substance      abuse;       Whereas observance of National Medicine Abuse Awareness      Month should be encouraged at the national, State, and local      levels to increase awareness of the rising abuse of      medicines;       Whereas educational toolkits and training methods have been      developed on how to best engage and educate parents and      grandparents, teachers, law enforcement officials, doctors      and health care professionals, and retailers about the      potential harms of cough medicine abuse; and       Whereas educating the public on the dangers of medicine      abuse and promoting prevention is a critical component of      what must be a multi-pronged effort to curb the disturbing      rise in medicine abuse: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That the Senate--       (1) designates October 2009 as ``National Medicine Abuse      Awareness Month''; and       (2) urges communities to carry out appropriate programs and      activities to educate parents and youth of the potential      dangers associated with medicine abuse.
