Sure, we are going to be drilling oil in America--we need to, for exploration and for production--but we know we only have 3 percent of the world's supply of oil--3 percent--and we use 25 percent of the oil. So we can't drill our way out of this.  Whether it is T. Boone Pickens or some friend of mine in central Illinois, it is obvious: You have to look for other solutions, and those solutions mean the oil companies are not going to be the answer to every question. Unfortunately, the Republican side of the aisle, time and time and time again, all they have to suggest is drill more oil and make more money for the oil companies.  That isn't the answer to America's energy problem. If it were the answer, we would have seen, as the Senator said, gasoline prices coming down as we made more acreage available for drilling over the last several years. It has not happened.
