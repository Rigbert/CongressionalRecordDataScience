Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's concerns in OCS matters, particularly with respect to the Gulf of Mexico bordering his State of Florida. I agree that leasing moratoria, such as in this conference report, are not a fully satisfactory way to address our policy for oil and natural gas exploration and development in the OCS.  As chairman of the authorizing committee of jurisdiction, I would like to remind my colleagues of the considerable contribution that oil and gas from the OCS makes toward meeting our Nation's energy needs. Therefore, I am interested in a thorough review of the provisions of H.R. 180, and other bills which would authorize permanent closures of portions of the Outer Continental Shelf, in order to weigh the benefits of oil and gas development versus the potential risks to coastal and shelf resources.  I assure the gentleman that the Committee on Resources will hold a hearing on this issue during the next session of Congress.
