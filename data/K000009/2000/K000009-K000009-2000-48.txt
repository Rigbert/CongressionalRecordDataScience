 Finally, Mr. Chairman, with respect to the Russian food aid, the Agency for International Development has not placed a high enough priority on agricultural and food systems development there.  Would the chairman agree with me that any food aid provided to Russia should be leveraged for greater impact, that any resources generated by this aid should be directed toward substantial economic growth and a reformed agricultural sector, and that agricultural projects should focus on the private sector, especially small-scale producers, small hold farmers, and women in order to maximize impact in fostering reform and allowing aid to reach the greatest number of people?
