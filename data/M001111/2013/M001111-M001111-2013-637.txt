 I know there are probably 8,000 amendments that can be offered to this because nobody is happy with the fact that we are faced with a continuing resolution that does not reflect the needs of all of our communities. I know she did not come here to debate process or to be the mother of Senators and get them over here to offer amendments. I know where her passion is. It is fitting for her kids and families and communities in Maryland. That is what she wants to get back to.  If we can get past this and put the CR in place, swallow hard and then get our budget done and work toward a process of a bipartisan budget, we need to do that so we can then give the Senator the ability to put the Appropriations Committee bills together. They will come out here and we will be able to offer amendments and people will have their say about the spending of the future. We cannot get to that unless we get that work done.
