 President, I rise today in support of passage of the Defense Production Reauthorization Act of 2003. This bill will reauthorize the Defense Production Act of 1950 for an additional 5 years.  Mr. President, the Defense Production Act of 1950 was originally passed in response to the outbreak of war on the Korean Peninsula.
