 President, I wish to pay tribute to Ira Yellin, who passed away on September 10. He was only 62 years old.  My heart goes out to his wife, Adele, to his daughter Jessica and his son Seth, to his mother Dorothy and his two brothers, Marc and Albert.  Ira was a true visionary, a man who championed the restoration of downtown Los Angeles long before it was popular.  His own restoration of the Grand Central Market, an enduring emblem of the ethnic diversity that is Los Angeles, is perhaps the greatest of his many accomplishments as a real estate developer.  Yet Ira was involved in so much more than real estate. He was a civic and community leader, and served as a past president of the American Jewish Committee and a member of the board of the Skirball Cultural Center and the J. Paul Getty Trust.  The son of a Talmudic scholar, an ex-Marine, an urban pioneer, a political and social activist, Ira was an optimistic man of boundless energy. Not even the lung cancer that he battled so bravely over the last year could slow him down.  Up until the very end of his life he maintained his commitment to his work, to his community and, above all, to his loving family, in a way which has earned my highest admiration and my deepest affection.  Ira Yellin was a wonderful man who will be sorely missed, yet both his notable achievements and his engaging personality have made a lasting impact on all of us. He will not be soon forgotten.                          ____________________
