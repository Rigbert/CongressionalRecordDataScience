 I readily acknowledge the expertise of Senator Frist. He is a widely respected heart surgeon. He certainly is a man who understands the practice of medicine, unlike anyone else in the Senate. I do not come as an expert on the practice of medicine. If I have any expertise, it is in trial practice because before I was elected to Congress, I was a trial attorney. I made my living defending doctors and hospitals, and suing doctors and hospitals. I understood medical malpractice then, but as I read this amendment I am troubled.  Let me acknowledge first, yes, there is a national problem with medical malpractice insurance across America. It costs too much in many areas, and we are finding that in many parts of the country doctors cannot afford to continue to practice because of the cost of premiums. But the answer from Senator McConnell on the Republican side is to suggest that the reason the premiums are so high is because of jury verdicts.  They overlook the obvious. Let me point to a source of information not considered liberal in nature, the Wall Street Journal, which on June 24 of this year published an article. I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Wall Street Journal, June 24, 2002]                      Delivering Ms. Kline's Baby              (By Rachel Zimmerman and Christopher Oster)       As medical-malpractice premiums skyrocket in about a dozen      states across the country, obstetricians and doctors in other      risky specialties, such as neurosurgery, are moving, quitting      or retiring. Insurers and many doctors blame the problem on      rising jury awards in liability lawsuits.       ``The real sickness is people sue at the drop of a hat,      judgments are going up and up and up, and the people getting      rich out of this are the plaintiffs' attorneys,'' says David      Golden of the National Association of Independent Insurers, a      trade group. The American Medical Association says Florida,      Nevada, New York, Pennsylvania and eight other states face a      ``crisis'' because ``the legal system produces multimillion-     dollar jury awards on a regular basis.''       But while malpractice litigation has a big effect on      premiums, insurers' pricing and accounting practices have      played an equally important role. Following a cycle that      recurs in many parts of the business, a price war that began      in the early 1990s led insurers to sell malpractice coverage      to obstetrician-gynecologists at rates that proved inadequate      to cover claims.       Some of these carriers had rushed into malpractice coverage      because an accounting practice widely used in the industry      made the area seem more profitable in the early 1990s than it      really was. A decade of short-sighted price slashing led to      industry losses of nearly $3 billion last year.       ``I don't like to hear insurance-company executives say      it's the tort [injury-law] system--it's self inflicted,''      says Donald J. Zuk, chief executive of Scpie Holdings Inc., a      leading malpractice insurer in California.       What's more, the litigation statistics most insurers      trumpet are incomplete. The statistics come from Jury Verdict      Research, a Horsham, Pa., information service, which reports      that since 1994, jury awards for medical-malpractice cases      have jumped 175 percent, to a median of $1 million in 2000.      During that seven-year period, the median award for      negligence in childbirth was $2,050,000--the highest for all      types of medical-malpractice cases, Jury Verdict Research      says. (In any group of figures, half fall above the median,      and half fall below.)       But Jury Verdict Research says its 2,951-case malpractice      database has large gaps. It collects award information      unsystematically, and it can't say how many cases it misses.      It says it can't calculate the percentage change in the      median for childbirth-negligence cases. More important, the      database excludes trial victories by doctors and hospitals--     verdicts that are worth zero dollars. That's a lot to ignore.      Doctors and hospitals win about 62 percent of the time, Jury      Verdict Research says. A separate database on settlements is      less comprehensive.       A spokesman for Jury Verdict Research, Gary Bagin, confirms      these and other holes in its statistics. He says the numbers      nevertheless accurately reflect trends. The company, which      sells its data to all comers, has reported jury information      this way since 1961. ``If we changed now, people looking back      historically couldn't compare apples to apples,'' Mr. Bagin      says.       Some doctors are beginning to acknowledge that the      conventional focus on jury awards deflects attention from the      insurance industry's behavior. The American College of      Obstetricians and Gynecologists for the first time is      conceding that carrier's business practice have contributed      to the current problem, says Alice Kirkman, a spokeswoman for      the professional group. ``We are admitting it's a much more      complex problem that we have previously talked about,'' she      says.       The upshot is beyond dispute: Pregnant women across the      country are scrambling for medical attention. Kimberly      Maugaotega of Las Vegas is 13 weeks pregnant and hasn't seen      an obstetrician. When she learned she was expecting, the 33-     year-old mother of two called the doctor who delivered her      second child but was told he wasn't taking any new pregnant      patients. Dr. Shelby Wilbourn plans to leave Nevada because      of soring medical-malpractice insurance rates there. Ms.      Maugaotega says she called 28 obstetricians but couldn't find      one who would take her.       Frustrated, she called the office of Nevada Gov. Kenny      Guinn. A staff member gave her yet another name. She made an      appointment to see that doctor today but says she is      skeptical about the quality of care she will receive.       In the Las Vegas area, doctors say some 90 obstetricians      have stopped accepting new patients since St. Paul Cos.,      formerly the country's leading provider of malpractice      coverage, quit the business in December. St. Paul had insured      more than half of Nevada's 240 obstetricians. Carriers still      offering coverage in the state have raised rates by 100      percent to 400 percent, physicians say.       Dr. Wilbourn says his annual malpractice premium was due to      jump to $108,000 next month, from $33,000. The 41-year-old      solo practitioner says the increase would come straight out      of his take-home pay of between $150,000 and $200,000 a year.      In response, he is moving to Maine this summer.       Dr. Wilbourn mourns having ``to pick up and leave the      patients I cared for and the practice I built up over 12      years.'' But in Maine, he has found a $200,000-a-year      position with an insurance premium of only $9,800 for the      first year, although the rate rises significantly after that.      Premiums in Maine are relatively low because a dominant      doctor-owned insurance cooperative there hasn't pushed to      maximize rates, the heavily rural population isn't notably      litigious and its court system employs an expert panel to      screen out some suits, says Insurance Commissioner Alessandro      Iuppa.       Until the 1970s, few doctors faced big-dollar suits.      Malpractice coverage was a small specialty. As courts      expanded liability rules, malpractice suits became more      common. Dozens of doctor-owned insurance cooperatives, or      ``bedpan mutuals,'' formed in response. Most stuck to their      home states.       St. Paul, a mid-sized national carrier named for its base      in Minnesota, saw an opportunity. An insurer of Main Street      businesses, St. Paul became the leader in the malpractice      field. By 1985, it had a 20 percent share of the national      market. Overall, the company had revenue of $8.9 billion last      year, with about 10 percent of its premium dollars coming      from malpractice coverage.       The frequency and size of doctors' malpractice claims rose      steadily in the early 1980s, industry officials say. St. Paul      and its competitors raised rates sharply during the 1980s.       Expecting malpractice awards to continue rising rapidly,      St. Paul increased its reserves. But the company      miscalculated, says Kevin Rehnberg, a senior vice president.      Claim frequency and size leveled off in the late 1980s, as      more than 30 states enacted curbs on malpractice awards, Mr.      Rehnberg says. The industry's rate increases turned      malpractice insurance into a very lucrative specialty.       A standard industry accounting device used by St. Paul and,      on a smaller scale, by its rivals, made the field look even      more attractive. Realizing that it had set aside too much      money for malpractice claims, St. Paul ``released'' $1.1      billion in reserves between 1992 and 1997. The money flowed      through its income statement and boosted its bottom line.       St. Paul stated clearly in its annual reports that excess      reserves had enlarged its net income. But that part of the      message didn't get through to some insurers--especially      bedpan mutuals--dazzled by St. Paul's bottom line, according      to industry officials.       In the 1990s, some bedpan mutuals began competing for      business beyond their original territories. New Jersey's      Medical Inter-Insurance Exchange, California's Southern      California Physicians Insurance Exchange (now known as Scpie      Holdings), and Pennsylvania Hospital Insurance Co., or Phico,      fanned out across the country. Some publicly traded insurers      also jumped into the business.       With St. Paul seeming to offer a model for big, quick      profits, ``no one wanted to sit still in their own      backyard,'' says Scpie's Mr. Zuk. ``The boards of directors      said, `We've got go grow.''' Scpie expanded into Connecticut,      Florida and Texas, among other states, starting in 1997.       As they entered new areas, smaller carriers often tried to      attract customers by undercutting St. Paul. The price      slashing became contagious, and premiums fell in many states.      The mutuals ``went in and aggravated the situation by saying,      `Look at all the money St. Paul is making,''' says Tom Gose,      President of MAG Mutual Insurance Co., which operates mainly      in Georgia. ``They came in late to the dance and undercut      everyone.''       The newer competitors soon discovered, however, that ``the      so-called profitability of the '90s was the result of those      years in the mid-80s when the actuaries were predicting the      terrible trends,'' says Donald J. Fager, president of Medical      Liability Mutual Insurance Co., a bedpan mutual started in      1975 in New York. Except for two mergers in the past two      years, his company mostly has held to its original single-     state focus.       The competition intensified, even though some insurers      ``knew rates were inadequate from 1995 to 2000'' to cover      malpractice claims says Bob Sanders, an actuary with Milliman      USA, a Seattle consultancy serving insurance companies.       In at least one case, aggressive pricing allegedly crossed      the line into fraud. Pennsylvania regulators last year filed      a civil suit in state court in Harrisburg against certain      executives and board members of Phico. The state alleges the      defendants misled the company's board on the adequacy of      Phico's premium rates and funds set aside to pay claims. On      the way to becoming the nation's seventh-largest malpractice      insurer, the company had suffered mounting losses on policies      for medical offices and nursing homes as far away as Miami.       Pennsylvania regulators took over Phico last August. The      company filed for bankruptcy-court protection from its      creditors in December. A trial date hasn't been set for the      state fraud suit. Phico executives and directors have denied      wrongdoing.       In the late 1990s, the size of payouts for malpractice      awards increased, carriers say. By 2000, many companies were      losing money on malpractice coverage. Industrywide, carriers      paid out $1.36 in claims and expenses for every premium      dollar they collected, says Mr. Golden, the trade-group      official.       The losses were exacerbated by carriers' declining      investment returns. Some insurers had come to expect that big      gains in the 1990s from their bond and stock portfolios would      continue, industry officials say. When the bull market      stalled in 2000, investment gains that had patched over      inadequate premium rates disappeared.       Some bedpan mutuals went home. Scpie stopped writing      coverage in any state over     than California. ``We lost money, and we retreated,'' says      the company's Mr. Zuk.       New Jersey's Medical Inter-Insurance Exchange, now known as      MIIX, had expanded into 24 states by the time it had a loss      of $164 million in the fourth quarter of 2001. The company      says it is now refusing to renew policies for 7.000      physicians outside of New Jersey. It plans to reformulate as      a new company operating only in that state.       St. Paul's malpractice business sank into the red. Last      December, newly hired Chief Executive Jay Fishman, a former      Citigroup Inc. executive, announced the company would drop      the coverage line. St. Paul reported a $980 million loss on      the business for 2001.       As carriers retrench, competition has slumped and prices in      some states have shot up. Lauren Kline, 6\1/2\ months      pregnant, changed obstetricians when her long-time      Philadelphia doctor moved out of state because of rate      increases. Now, her new doctor, Robert Friedman, may have to      give up delivering babies at his suburban Philadelphia      practice. His insurance expires at the end of the month, and      he says he is having difficulty finding a carrier that will      sell him a policy at any price.       Last year, Dr. Friedman says he paid $50,000 for coverage.      If he gets a policy for next year, it will cost $90,000, he      predicts, based on his broker's estimate. ``I can't pass a      single bit of that off to my patients,'' because managed-care      companies don't allow it, he says.       Dr. Friedman says he is considering dropping the obstetrics      part of his practice. Generally, delivering babies is seen as      posing greater risks than most gynecological treatment. As a      result, insurers offer less-expensive policies to doctors who      don't do deliveries.       Mr. Golden of the insurers' association argues that      whatever role industry practices may play, the current      turmoil stems from lawsuits. The association says that from      1995 through 2000, total industry payouts to cover losses and      legal expenses jumped 52 percent, to $6.9 billion. ``That      says there are more really huge verdicts.'' Mr. Golden says.      Even in the majority of cases in which doctors and hospitals      win--the zero-dollar verdicts--there are still legal expenses      that insurers have to pick up, he adds.       Industry critics point to different sets for statistics.      Bob Hunter, director for insurance at Consumer Federation of      America, an advocacy group in Washington, prefers numbers      generated by A.M. Best Co. The insurance-rating agency      estimates that once all malpractice claims from 1991 through      2000 are resolved--which will take until about 2010--the      average payout per claim will have risen 47 percent, to      $42,473. That projection includes legal expenses and suits in      which doctors or hospitals prevail.       While the statistical debate rages, pregnant women adjust      to new limits and inconveniences. Kelly Biesecker, 35, spent      many extra hours on the highway this spring, driving from her      home in Villanova, Pa., to Delran, N.J., so she could      continue to use her obstetrician. Dr. Richard Krauss says he      moved the obstetrics part of his practice from Philadelphia      because malpractice rates had skyrocketed in Pennsylvania.      Ms. Biesecter, who gave birth to a healthy boy on June 5,      says Dr. Krauss was the doctor she trusted to guard her      health and the health of her baby: ``You stick with that guy      no matter what the distance.''       Dr. Krauss, 53, left Philadelphia last year only after his      malpractice premium rose to $54,000, from $38,000, and then      was cancelled by a carrier getting out of the business, he      says. After getting quotes of about $80,000 on a new policy,      he moved. New Jersey hasn't been a panacea, however. His      policy there expires July 1, and the carrier refuses to renew      it. The doctor says he hopes to go to work for a hospital      that will pay for his coverage.
