 Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  As the ranking member of the Subcommittee on International Monetary Policy and Trade, I rise to express my strong concerns regarding the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank.  Mr. Speaker, many supporters of the Export-Import Bank argue that the Bank is necessary because it creates jobs and it helps out small business. Obviously, when you spend hundreds of millions of dollars, you are going to create jobs. You could drop money out of an airplane and you would create jobs.  The question is, given the amount of money that we spend, given the risk to American taxpayers, is the Export-Import Bank doing a good enough job in creating work for the American people? And I would submit very strongly that that is not the case. And if the Export-Import Bank is not thoroughly reformed in terms of its goals and the way it functions, it should not continue to exist.  The problem that I have with the Export-Import Bank is that we continue to primarily fund many of the largest corporations in America, who openly acknowledge and are very proud of the fact that they are laying off hundreds of thousands of American workers and taking our jobs to China, to Mexico, and to other desperate developing countries where people are being paid pennies an hour to do human labor. Essentially what the Export-Import Bank says is, ``Thank you, large corporation, for laying off thousands of American workers; and as your reward for doing that, hey, come on in line and we're going to give you a loan or a loan guarantee or some other kind of subsidy.''  I am sure that that policy and that approach makes sense to somebody, especially the well-paid CEOs of the large multinational corporations and their lobbyists and friends who contribute huge sums of money into the political process, but I do not think it makes sense to the average American worker or the average American taxpayer. How could we have a so-called job-creating program when the major recipients of Export-Import loans and guarantees are the major job cutters in the United States of America?  Some of my opponents will say, well, they are creating jobs. I acknowledge that. But the fact of the matter is, given the huge amount of money that is being spent, given the leverage that the Export-Import Bank has, they are doing a poor job. And in my view, you do not reward companies that publicly acknowledge to the world that they are going to China to hire people at 30 cents an hour and then you say to those people, ``No problem. Come on in line and you're going to get taxpayer dollars.''  Mr. Speaker, last summer I worked with the subcommittee chairman from Nebraska (Mr. Bereuter), a good friend of mine, who is doing a very good job on this issue. Together, we introduced a bill, H.R. 2517, that would have addressed this problem in a very serious way. H.R. 2517 would have prevented companies from receiving Export-Import Bank assistance if they lay off a greater percentage of workers in the United States than they lay off in foreign countries.  For example, if a company lays off 20 percent of its American workforce but only lays off 10 percent of its foreign workforce, that company would be denied future Export-Import Bank assistance unless it restored those American jobs. I know that people think that is a radical idea. Imagine telling American companies who want taxpayer money that they cannot just willy-nilly lay off American workers. Imagine them having to come forward and say that they want to grow jobs in their company.  The other aspect of the legislation that the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Bereuter) and I worked on together was to put more emphasis on small business help for the Export-Import Bank. The fact of the matter is, it is not Boeing, it is not General Electric, it is not the large multinationals that are creating jobs in this country; it is small business. I say that if small businesses want help in creating jobs in the United States, let us support them. And if Boeing and General Electric want to take jobs to China, that is fine, but do not come to the taxpayers of this country and ask for support.  I should mention, Mr. Speaker, that that legislation had the support of eight major labor unions and one prominent business group, including the United Steelworkers, the International Association of Machinists, UNITE, Boilermakers, Pace, the United Electrical Workers, the Independent Steelworkers Union, the Teamsters and the U.S. Business and Industry Council.                              {time}  1530  I would like to ask my good friend, the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Bereuter), the chairman of the subcommittee, if he will support me in allowing me to bring this amendment to the floor of the House so that the Members have a chance to vote on that.
