President, today I join with Senator Thurmond to introduce the Major League Baseball Antitrust Reform Act of 1995. As chairman and ranking Democrat on the Senate's Antitrust Subcommittee, we will be participating in hearings later this week into the exemption from the Federal antitrust laws enjoyed by major league baseball. Our antitrust laws are intended to protect competition and benefit consumers. No one is or should be above the law. Yet for over 70 years, major league baseball has operated outside our antitrust laws. I think that should be reviewed and corrected.  Last summer, the Senate Judiciary Committee had an opportunity to right this situation when we considered a bill to repeal baseball's antitrust exemption that was very similar to the  [[Page S2661]] bill we are introducing today. While Senator Thurmond and I supported the measure, some of our colleagues blinked and the measure was defeated.  Soon thereafter negotiations between major league baseball owners and players disintegrated. We have since witnessed a preemptive strike, the unilateral imposition of a salary cap, failed efforts at mediation, the loss of one season and likely obliteration on a second, and pleas from all corners to resolve the current impasse going for naught.  In my view, major league baseball's exemption from Federal antitrust laws has significantly contributed to the problem that confronts us all today. Had Congress repealed that out-of-date, judicially proclaimed immunity from law, I believe that this matter would not be festering. I hope that we will, at long last, take up the issue of major league baseballs' antitrust exemption.  Baseball has been the national pastime. It has served to bind parent to child. It teaches important values including the benefits of teamwork and doing ones best. It is part of our history. The game's current caretakers are about to cost the American people another year without baseball.  Seniors who look forward to the joys of spring training and to following their favorite teams on radio or television will have to do without. Youngsters looking for positive role models, contemporary heros, and a sport to span generations or Americans will be shortchanged.  Cities and towns that have invested millions in facilities to support major league baseball will be cheated. Vendors and others who rely on baseball for jobs that help them scratch out a living for themselves and their families will be hit, again.  There is a public interest in the resumption of true, major league baseball. The current situation derives at least in part from circumstances in which the Federal antitrust laws have not applied, Congress has provided no regulatory framework to protect the public, and the major leagues have chosen to operate without a strong, independent commissioner who could look out for the best interests of baseball. Thus, competing financial interests continue to clash, with no resolution in sight.  In my view, the burden of proof is on those who seek to justify baseball's exemption from the law. No other business or professional or amateur sport is possessed of the exemption from law that major league baseball has enjoyed and abused.  I look forward to our prompt hearings and to move ahead thoughtfully to consider whether major league baseball, as it is currently organized, is entitled to exemption from legal requirements to which all other businesses must conform their behavior. It is time to forge a legal framework in which the public will be better served. Since the multibillion-dollar businesses that have grown from what was once our national pastime are now big business being run accordingly to a financial bottom line, a healthy injection of competition may be just what is needed.                                 ______      By
