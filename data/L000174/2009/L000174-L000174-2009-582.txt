President, this week, the Senate is considering critical legislation to renew our economy and to renew America's promise of prosperity and security for all of its citizens. I have long held the view that American innovation can and should play a vital role in revitalizing our economy and in improving our Nation's health care system. I commend the lead sponsors of this legislation for making sure that the economic recovery package includes an investment in health information technology that also takes meaningful steps to protect the privacy of American consumers.  The privacy protections for electronic health records in the economic recovery package are essential to a successful national health IT system, and these safeguards should not be weakened. In America today, if you have a health record, you have a health privacy problem. The explosion of electronic health records, digital databases, and the Internet is fueling a growing supply of and demand for Americans' health information. The ability to easily access this information electronically--often by the clickof a mouse or a few keystrokes on a computer can be very useful in providing more cost-effective health care. But the use of advancing technologies to access and share health information can also lead to a loss of personal privacy.  Without adequate safeguards to protect health privacy, many Americans will simply not seek the medical treatment that they need for fear that their sensitive health information will be disclosed without their consent. And those who do seek medical treatment assume the risk of data security breaches and other privacy violations. Likewise, health care providers who perceive the privacy risks associated with health IT systems as inconsistent with their professional obligations will avoid participating in a national health IT system.  The economic recovery package takes several important steps to avoid these pitfalls and to protect Americans' health information privacy. First, the provisions give each individual the right to access his or her own electronic health records and the right to timely notice of data breaches involving their health information. The economic recovery bill also places critical restrictions on the sale of sensitive health data and requires that the Department of Health and Human Services educates and conducts outreach to American consumers and businesses regarding their privacy rights and obligations. Lastly, the bill enhances the enforcement tools available to the States, as well as to Federal authorities, to deter lax health information privacy. These key privacy safeguards must not be weakened as the Senate considers the economic recovery bill.  Of course, more can--and should--be done in the weeks and months ahead to further improve health information privacy, such as strengthening the rights of consumers to control their own electronic health records. In Vermont, we have formed a public-private partnership that is charged with developing Vermont's statewide electronic health information system, including a policy on privacy. I believe that in order for a national health IT system to succeed, we in Congress should follow Vermont's good example and work together for the long term with public and private stakeholders to ensure the privacy and security of electronic health records.  As the Senate considers the economic recovery package, we face many difficult challenges in our Nation. The challenge of finding the right balance between privacy and efficiency for a national health IT system is just one, but it is an important test that we must meet head on. Without meaningful privacy safeguards, our Nation's health IT system will fail its citizens. In his inaugural address, President Obama eloquently noted that in our new era of responsibility ``there is nothing so satisfying to the spirit, so defining of our character than giving our all to a difficult task.'' The privacy safeguards in the economic recovery package take an important step toward tackling the difficult but essential task of ensuring meaningful health information privacy for all Americans.  Again, I commend the lead sponsors of the economic recovery bill and President Obama for their commitment to include meaningful health privacy protections in the bill. I also commend the many stakeholders, including the Center for Democracy & Technology, Consumers Unions, the American Civil Liberties Union, and Microsoft, that have advocated tirelessly for meaningful health IT privacy protections in this legislation. I urge all Members to support the health IT privacy protections in the bill, so that our national health care system will have the support and confidence of the American people.  I ask to have a copy of a February 1, 2009, editorial from the New York Times in support of funding protections for patients' privacy entitled, ``Your E-Health Records,'' printed in the Record following my full statement.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, Feb. 1, 2009]                         Your E-Health Records       As part of the stimulus package, $20 billion will be pumped      into the health care system to accelerate the use of      electronic health records. The goal is both to improve the      quality and lower the costs of care by replacing cumbersome      paper records with electronic records that can be easily      stored and swiftly transmitted.       The idea is sound, but it also raises important questions      about how to ensure the privacy of patients. Fortunately, the      legislation would impose sensible privacy protections despite      attempts by business lobbyists to weaken the safeguards.       With paper records the opportunities for breaches are      limited to over-the-shoulder glimpses or the occasional lost      or stolen files. But when records are kept and transferred      electronically, the potential for abuse can become as vast as      the Internet.       Electronic health records that can be linked to individual      patients are already protected by laws that apply primarily      to hospitals, doctors, nursing homes, pharmacists,      laboratories and insurance plans. The stimulus bill that has      passed in the House, and a similar bill awaiting approval in      the Senate, would strengthen the privacy requirements and      apply them more directly to ``business associates'' of the      providers, like billing and collection services or pharmacy      benefit managers, that have access to sensitive data but are      not readily held accountable for any misuse.       The potential for harm was spelled out by the American      Civil Liberties Union in a recent letter to Congress.      Employers who obtain medical records inappropriately might      reject a job candidate who looks expensive to insure. Drug      companies with access to pharmaceutical records might try to      pressure patients to switch to their products. Data brokers      might buy medical and pharmaceutical records and sell them to      marketers. Unscrupulous employees with access to electronic      records might snoop on the health of their colleagues or      neighbors.       The bills pending in Congress would go a long way toward      preventing such abuses. They would outlaw the sale of any      personal health information without the patient's permission,      mandate audit trails to help detect inappropriate access, and      require that patients be notified whenever their records are      lost or used for an unauthorized purpose. They would also      beef up the penalties for noncompliance and allow state      attorneys general to help enforce the rules--a useful backup      in case the federal government falls down on the job. The      House version would also encourage the use of protective      technologies, like encryption, to protect personal medical      information that will be transmitted.       Health insurance plans and some disease management groups      are complaining that the new requirements would impose      administrative burdens that could actually impede the use of      electronic records and interfere with coordination of care.      They want to ease the marketing restrictions, notify patients      only if security breaches are harmful, and keep the attorneys      general out of the enforcement role.       It should be possible through implementing regulations to      fine-tune the privacy requirements so that they do not      disrupt patient care. Congress must make every effort to      ensure that patients' privacy is protected.
