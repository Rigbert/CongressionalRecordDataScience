Chair, I rise today in strong opposition to the amendments that would reduce funding appropriated in H.R. 2551, the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 2012 for the U.S. Botanic Garden.  As you may know, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison initially had the idea of starting a national botanic garden and helped to establish one on the National Mall in 1820. It is a keystone on our mall and belongs to the American people. The mission of the U.S. Botanic Garden is to demonstrate the aesthetic, cultural, economic, therapeutic and ecological importance of plants to the well-being of humankind. It is a national and global center for learning about how to sustain life on our planet, especially as climate changes and new challenges confront our society's plant life.  According to the Architect of the Capitol, approximately 1 million people visit the U.S. Botanic Garden each year. About 12,000 different plant accessions comprising more than 60,000 plants are displayed for exhibition, study, conservation and exchange with other institutions. The Botanic Garden is America's encyclopedia for sustaining production and life itself.  In addition to displaying some of the world's most rare and endangered plants, the U.S. Botanic Garden provides numerous educational opportunities through its partnerships, workshops, lectures, tours and demonstrations. Some specific education programs include the opportunity to earn a Certification in Botanical Art and Illustration, the Junior Botanist Program and several hands-on activities exploring plant materials. The Gardner instructs the next generation with partnerships across our nation.  Mr. Chair, we are still in the midst of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, and a series of odd weather events. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Agricultural Statistics Service reports that greenhouse, nursery and floriculture operations account for 2.5 percent of all U.S. farms but employ nearly 5 percept of hired farm workers. This sector has a sales value of $16.6 Billion. It is a one-of-a-kind endowment America depends on.  From my perspective, it is vitally important that we continue to support institutions such as the U.S. Botanic Garden not only because of its ability to preserve rare and vital plants essential to life but also for its potential to inspire the entrepreneurial spirit. We know its visitors will one day lead to increased economic output and job creation in the agricultural sector of our economy so dependent on innovation and advanced technology.  Therefore, I urge my colleagues to reject any amendment that would reduce funding to the U.S. Botanic Garden.                          ____________________
