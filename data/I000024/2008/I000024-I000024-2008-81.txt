President, the commitment and duty of the Army soldiers who have risked their lives to preserveour freedom have left an indelible mark on this Nation. During the Army's 233-year history, tens of thousands of these brave men and women have sacrificed their lives on distant battlefields to keep our Nation safe. I salute them for their service to this country.
