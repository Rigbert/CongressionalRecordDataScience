President, first I thank the Senator from Nebraska for allowing me to come in immediately following his remarks.                           Amendment No. 183  An amendment was just offered by the minority leader. Let me explain what this is. As the former chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, and now the ranking member, we have been very much concerned for a long period of time over what they are trying to do with cap-and-trade. All the way back to the Kyoto treaty and then through the five different bills that were debated on the Senate floor, we recognized the incredible cost to the American people if we were to pass cap-and-trade legislation.  The interesting thing about this is the most votes that were in the Senate at any one time in order to pass cap-and-trade were about 30. Obviously it takes a lot more than that. So what this administration did was say: All right, if you are not going to pass cap-and-trade regulation--keep in mind what that is; that would end up being the largest tax increase in the history of America on the American people--if you are not going to do it through legislation, we will do it through our regulations, through the Environmental Protection Agency.  There was an endangerment finding. The Administrator of the EPA had the endangerment finding and it was based on the IPCC flawed science, but nonetheless it was there. So they started on a route to regulate CO2 through regulations. Let's stop and think about what that would be. The costs we have determined, over a period of 10-years, to take over the regulation and have in fact a type of cap-and-trade through regulation--or by regulation--would be about $300 billion to $400 billion a year. I did a calculation as to what that would cost the average family in the State of Oklahoma and it was about $3,000 for each family who actually files a tax return.  You have to ask the question, what do you get if you pass this. First of all, I think most people right now are concerned with the price of gasoline at the pump. It is going up again. I suggest it is not market forces that are forcing the price up. It is nothing less than regulation. We have an administration that is doing all it can to kill fossil fuels in America. This is a chart showing--and this all happened in the last year--in the United States we have the largest recovery reserves in oil, coal, and gas of any other country. In fact, our research is right there. You can see recovery reserves are astronomical compared to China, Iran, Canada, and some of the other countries.  The problem we have is a political problem. We are not allowed to go ahead and exploit our own reserves. It is simple supply and demand. I think there is not a person listening to us now who has not studied supply-and-demand basics back in school. If we have all this supply here, why can't we exploit the supply?  To give another illustration of what we have--this is coal reserves. We have 28 percent of all the world's coal reserves. We are exploiting right now clean coal technology, being very successful. We have, in addition to this, oil and gas reserves. But the problem we have is a political problem.  It was the Secretary of Energy, Steven Chu, who made the statement in the Wall Street Journal:       [S]omehow we have to figure out how to boost the price of      gasoline in Europe.  ``To boost the price of gasoline to the levels in Europe.'' Right now the levels in Europe are around $8 a gallon. That is what the administration wants us to pay. Why do they want that? They want that so we will be priced out of using fossil fuels. We are talking about oil, gas, and coal.  Right now we are faced with this. Frankly, as we speak, in this very moment over in the House of Representatives they are taking up what they call the Upton-Inhofe bill. That is the same amendment the minority leader just filed. What that does is propose the content of the Inhofe-Upton bill, which says the EPA does not have jurisdiction over controlling CO2. That should be a legislative matter. You say, Who would agree with that?  Max Baucus, Democrat from Montana, said:       I do not want the EPA writing those regulations. I think      it's too much power in the hands of one single agency, but      rather climate change should be a matter that's essentially      left to the Congress.  The Senator from Nebraska who just walked off the floor:       Controlling the levels of carbon emissions is the job of      Congress. We don't need the EPA looking over Congress'      shoulder telling us we're not moving fast enough.  He went on further to say:       Because the EPA regulations would be a government-directed      command-and-control regime, they would raise the price of      energy--  . . . in his State and for all the other States.  This is something I think we have talked about but there is one thing that seems to keep getting overlooked. Somebody asked me the other day, they said: Inhofe, what if you are wrong, in terms of how CO2--they are talking about catastrophic global warming. I said: It is very simple. I have a great deal of respect for the Director of the Environmental Protection Agency. She actually said--Lisa Jackson--in response to my question, live on TV, in our committee. I said:       Let's say we pass a cap-and-trade either by regulation or      legislation. What do you think that is going to do in terms      of the overall emissions of CO2?  Her response was, well, it wouldn't really affect them because that would only affect the United States.  I go on further and say: If we were to restrict these, and stop us from producing oil, gas, and coal in the United States, necessarily our power would be reduced. That would move it to China, to India, to Mexico, to places where they do not have these regulations and do not have restrictions on emissions. It would have the effect of actually increasing, not decreasing, CO2. Even if we are wrong on that we have to keep in mind it would not make any difference.  I know there are several others who want to talk about this. I am very excited we now have this as a pending amendment, to adopt what I refer to as the Inhofe-Upton bill. He referred to it as the Upton-Inhofe bill. It would merely take out the jurisdiction of the EPA to regulate CO2.  I would say also in the case of the Director, Lisa Jackson, when I asked the question--and this was a year ago in October, I say to my good friend from Louisiana--I said: If you are going to try to have an endangerment finding so that would allow the EPA to regulate the same as the cap-and-trade would, it has to be based on science. What science would you base it on? Her response was the United Nations IPCC. What is that? It was Climategate IPC. It happened about a year ago. It was cooked science. I remember standing at this podium in this Senate many times, talking about how they have tried to falsify the science to make people believe catastrophic global warming is going to come in as a result of CO2 emissions.  I am glad this has come up. Right now we are looking at gasoline approaching $4 a gallon. It is a supply-and-demand situation. My friend from Louisiana has a lot of gas and oil in her State. We do in my State of Oklahoma. We need to get the regulators, who are the politicians, to allow us to go ahead and exploit our own resources. Eighty-three percent right now of the Federal lands where we could be producing oil and gas is off limits.  The last thing I will say before yielding the floor is that if we were to take the recoverable oil and the recoverable gas and take away the political obstacles that are in the way, we would have enough to run this country for 90 years, in terms of the supply of oil, and for 90 years in the supply of gas, all produced here in the United States. That would mean we would not have to be reliant upon the Middle East to run this machine called America.  Let's pull away those. The way to do that is to vote in favor of this amendment and I am very excited we will have the opportunity to do that shortly.
