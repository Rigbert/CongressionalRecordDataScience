 President, I am pleased to report two pieces of good news out of Congress today. After 2 years of policies that lacked public support, the tide is beginning to turn.  Today the President will sign a bill that ensures no American--not a single one--gets a tax hike on January 1. Republicans have fought hard for this legislation. Up until last week, most Democrats resisted. But in the end the American people were heard. That is a welcome change from the last 2 years.
