HUTCHISON. Then you see the chairman of the Committee on Environment and Public Works who says: Excuse me, but this is my jurisdiction, and I would like to address it. And he is, as Senator Domenici said, one of the most distinguished of our Members.  I say to Members, do this: MTBE should be looked at. It is a way to clean the air. It is an additive to gasoline to meet the clean air requirements of EPA.  We should not have a sense of the Senate that holds up the Agriculture appropriations bill. I hope Members will vote to table this sense of the Senate and give Chairman Chafee the opportunity to look at this issue to determine if there is something wrong with MTBE, which I think is very much a question.  But to have something like this continue to hold up this bill, when our farmers certainly need the relief this appropriations bill is going to give us, I think is the wrong approach.  I urge Members to table this sense of the Senate.
