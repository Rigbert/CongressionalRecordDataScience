Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, our Nation is facing a health care crisis driven by uncontrolled litigation. Medical professional liability insurance rates have soared, causing major insurers to either drop coverage or to raise premiums to unaffordable levels. Doctors are being forced to abandon patients and practices or to retire early, particularly in high-risk specialties such as emergency medicine, brain surgery and obstetrics and gynecology. Women are being particularly hard hit, as are low income and rural neighborhoods.  H.R. 5, the HEALTH Act, is modeled after California's highly successful health care litigation reforms enacted in 1975 and known under the acronym MICRA. California's reforms, which are included in the HEALTH Act, include a $250,000 cap on noneconomic damages, limits on the contingency fees lawyers can charge, and authorization for defendants to introduce evidence to prevent double recoveries. The HEALTH Act also includes provisions creating a fair share rule by which damages are allocated fairly in direct proportion to fault, reasonable guidelines on the award of punitive damages, and a safeharbor for punitive damages for products that meet applicable FDA safety requirements.  It is important to note that nothing in the HEALTH Act limits in any way the award of economic damages from anyone responsible for harm. Economic damages include anything to which a value can be attached, including lost wages, lost services provided, medical costs, the cost of pain-reducing drugs, and lifetime rehabilitation care, and anything else to which a receipt can be attached. Because of this, the reforms in the HEALTH Act still allow for very large, multi-million dollar awards to deserving victims, including homemakers and children, as the experience in California has shown.  Still, the California reforms have been successful. Information provided by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners shows that since 1975, premiums paid in California increased by 167 percent while premiums paid in the rest of the country increased by 505 percent. As Cruz Reynoso, the Democratic Vice Chairman of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission wrote recently in the Los Angeles Times, ``What is obvious about MICRA is that it works and it works well. Our California doctors and hospitals pay significantly less for liability protection today than their counterparts in States without MICRA-type reforms.''  The Congressional Budget Office has concluded that ``under the HEALTH Act, premiums for medical malpractice insurance ultimately would be an average of 25 percent to 30 percent below what they would be under current law.'' If California's legal reforms were implemented nationwide, we could spend billions of dollars more annually on patient care. Reform at the Federal level is necessary because the current crisis is national in scope.  According to a report by the Department of Health and Human Services, ``The cost of these awards for noneconomic damages is paid by all other Americans through higher health care costs, higher health insurance premiums, higher taxes, reduced access to quality care, and threats to quality of care. The system permits a few plaintiffs and their lawyers to impose what is in effect a tax on the rest of the country to reward a very small number of patients.'' Congress must act to let doctors treat patients wherever they are and to reduce health care costs for all Americans.  H.R. 5 will also save the Federal taxpayers billions of dollars. Former Democratic Senator George McGovern has written in the Wall Street Journal, ``Legal fear drives doctors to prescribe medicines and order tests, even invasive procedures, that they feel are unnecessary. Reputable studies estimate that this `defensive medicine' squanders $50 billion a year, enough to provide medical care to millions of uninsured Americans.''  According to the Department of Health and Human Services, ``If reasonable limits were placed on noneconomic damages to reduce defensive medicine, it would reduce the amount of taxpayers' money the Federal Government spends by $25.3-44.3 billion per year.''  Furthermore, despite accusations from the other side of the aisle, this is not a crisis caused by insurance companies. The President of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners wrote last month that ``To date, insurance regulators have not seen evidence that suggests medical malpractice insurers have engaged or are engaging in price fixing, bid rigging, or market allocation. The preliminary evidence points to rising loss costs and defense costs associated with litigation as the principal drivers of medical malpractice prices.''  We all recognize that injured victims should be adequately compensated for their injuries, but too often in this debate we lose sight of the larger health care picture. This country is blessed with the finest health care technology in the world. We are blessed with the finest doctors in the world. People are smuggled into this country for a chance at life and healing, the best chance they have in the world.  The Department of Health and Human Services issued a report recently that included the following amazing statistics. During the last half century, death rates of children and adults up to age 24 were cut in half and infant mortality rates have plummeted 75 percent.                              {time}  1215  Mortality among adults between the ages of 25 and 64 fell nearly as much and dropped among those 65 years and older by a third. In 2000, Americans enjoyed the longest life expectancy in American history, almost 77 years.  These amazing statistics just did not happen. They happened because America produces the best health care technology and the best doctors to use it. But now there are fewer and fewer doctors to use that miraculous technology or to use that technology where their patients are. We have the best brain-scanning and brain-operation devices in history and fewer and fewer neurosurgeons to use them. Unlimited lawsuits are driving doctors out of the healing profession. They are reversing the clock; and they are making us all less safe, all in the name of unlimited lawsuits and personal injury lawyers' lust for their cut of unlimited awards for unquantifiable damages. But when someone gets sick or is bringing a child into the world and we cannot call a doctor, who will we call, a lawyer?  As a Nation today, we have to choose. Do we want the abstract ability to sue a doctor for unlimited, unquantifiable damages when doing so means that there will be no doctors to treat ourselves and our loved ones in the first place? On behalf of all 287 million Americans, all of us who are patients, let us say yes to reasonable health care litigation management and pass the HEALTH Act.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
