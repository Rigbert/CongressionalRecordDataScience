  Let me just associate myself with the remarks of the gentleman from Iowa and thank him for his support, and I thank the gentleman from New York and the gentlewoman from Ohio. I also want to thank the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Skeen) for his support of the concept of agritourism.  The gentleman is aware that agritourism has worked very, very well in New Mexico and in many other parts of this country; and we should all be clear that what we are talking about now is a national program. Vermont is experimenting, getting into it, New Mexico is in it, Ohio is in it, Massachusetts, New York. But this is a national program which will accept competitive applications from people all over this country.  I should say that as the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur) has already indicated, there is strong bipartisan support for the concept of agritourism and an understanding that it would really be very unfair to family farmers all over this country who, as the gentleman from Iowa pointed out, are looking for alternative sources of revenue.
