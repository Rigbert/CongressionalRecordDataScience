Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, this bill, H.R. 772, is a bipartisan piece of legislation introduced by Representatives Cathy McMorris Rodgers and Tony Cardenas to amend the Food and Drug Administration's menu labeling rule that was issued in November of 2014.  The goal of the bill was to make implementation of the nutrition disclosure law useful for consumers and workable for food service establishments. The existing regulatory framework, which has not yet been implemented, is not only cumbersome for the food industry, but it also impedes businesses' ability to provide meaningful information that customers can use to make nutrition decisions.  The Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act is critical to avoid harming consumers' choices, jobs, and, certainly, small businesses. This bill was drafted to address the challenges of an overly prescriptive, one-size-fits-all approach to regulation affecting a very, very diverse industry.  We need to ensure that the law works for all food establishments: convenience stores, supermarkets, grocery stores, pizza shops. All have enormous challenges complying with the regulations as written.  This bill is going to provide those entities with the flexibility and, frankly, the certainty that they need to comply without compromising consumers' access to nutrition information. The Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act will establish a more reasonable standard for Federal regulations and allow nutritional information to be provided by a remote access menu for establishments where the majority of orders, in fact, are placed off premises.                              {time}  1245  Consumers should have this information when they are placing an order. A menu board may work for some businesses where customers order at the counter where they also pay, but for an establishment where most people now order online or from a phone, having the calorie information when they pick up their order won't be very helpful to that consumer.  This legislation also takes steps to preserve local foods and fresh items that might be sold at just a few locations. To do so, the bill clarifies that menu labeling regulations are intended for standard menu items, defined as those items with substantially the same recipe prepared in substantially the same way with substantially the same food components that are routinely included on a menu or menu board or are routinely offered as a self-service food or food on display at 20 or more locations.  This bill also eliminates draconian penalties that are required in current law by removing criminal felony penalties for store managers and allowing restaurants and retailers to take corrective actions. This shields small-business owners and their employees from frivolous lawsuits based on inadvertent human error. No one ought to be criminalized for putting too many pickles on a sandwich or maybe not enough olives. This bill further clarifies that establishments will have 90 days to correct a violation before FDA brings enforcement action.  The food retail sector employs--let's face it--millions of Americans and provides access to affordable, healthy options. The Federal Government shouldn't impose arbitrary regulations that are going to cause unnecessary harm to businesses and consumers.  The businesses impacted by this bill widely support providing consumers with nutritional information to better inform their food decisions, but they want to do it in a practical and a commonsense way. This legislation provides clear guidance to small-business owners, ensuring compliance and, at the same time, delivering critical information.  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my Energy and Commerce Committee colleagues for their work on both sides of the aisle. I urge its passage today, and I reserve the balance of my time.
