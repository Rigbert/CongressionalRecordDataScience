President, I know my colleagues are waiting. I liked Craig Thomas. We served in the House together and in the Senate. When they had his funeral service, I made a point of joining many of my colleagues to make the trip out to his beloved Wyoming to meet his neighbors and supporters and friends and family. It was a wonderful, beautiful service. He was such a quiet and strong man. He and I disagreed on lots of issues, but I respected him so much. I think his real strength was shown in his last battle with leukemia and cancer. Craig kept a smile on his face, despite some very difficult days. His wife Susan at his side out in Wyoming was a reminder that we are really a Senate family.  We can debate issues back and forth, as we just did, but at the end of the day, I think he was a great Senator who served his State well, and it was an honor that I could count him as a friend.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
