Speaker, the Republican budget has it backward. They propose cutting Social Security and Medicare benefits by over $2,500 per recipient through the year 2002 to pay for tax breaks to the privileged few. This means your grandmother's Social Security and Medicare benefits will shrink substantially. Her nursing home expenses will rise if she can even get in.  However, the money saved from these harsh cuts will not go to balance the budget. The money will go to pay for tax breaks to the wealthiest among us: The American billionaires who move to the Caribbean and take their money with them to escape paying taxes here; or the families earning $200,000 a year, who will be bestowed a $500 tax credit; or the foreign corporations who do business in this country and earn millions but do not pay a dime in taxes.  If the Republicans were serious, they would not balance the budget on the backs of our seniors to pander to the rich and powerful who can pay for lobbyists in this town. If the Republicans were serious, they would not have a budget-busting $360 billion tax giveaway paid for by our grandmothers.                          ____________________
