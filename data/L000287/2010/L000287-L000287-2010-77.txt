Madam Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Ms. Leslie Judith Goldberg, R.N. to thank her for her 20 years of service to the Members and staff of the U.S. House of Representatives.  Almost every staffer in the House complex, particularly those who work in the Cannon House Office Building, knows Nurse Leslie. Always smiling, extremely knowledgeable, and thorough, she has a legendary ability to help staff find the best possible health care services for their needs. For years, she has collected feedback on the quality of health practitioners and shared both praise and concerns with prospective patients. As a result, she was well-known in doctors' offices throughout the region; they were always asking, ``Ahhh, you were referred by Nurse Goldberg? Who is this Nurse Leslie?''  Born in Providence, Rhode Island, Leslie joined her mother and sister in this vital profession after graduating from the Jewish Hospital of Brooklyn. She went on to work at the New York University Hospital in neurosurgery and the Regional Institute for Children and Adolescents.  In 1990, Nurse Goldberg joined the Office of the Attending Physician and dedicated the end of her great career to serving and caring for the Members and staff of this institution. She is a part of our family. We mourned with her when her loving husband, Alan Goldberg, passed away far too early in life, and we celebrated when she returned to us--her adoptive, extended family.  We all know how much she adores her three sons, Michael, Aaron, and David and daughter-in-law, Lisa. And her grandson, Ari, is the light of her life. While we will Miss her laughter, her smile, her caring, skillful techniques, and infinite knowledge, I applaud her for taking the time to fulfill her personal dreams--travel, volunteer, and most importantly take care of Ari and the grandchildren to come.  Nurse Goldberg, we will miss you terribly; you leave enormous shoes to fill. Thank you for your 20 years of service and keeping us safe, healthy, informed, and always smiling.                          ____________________
