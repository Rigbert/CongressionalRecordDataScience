Mr. Chairman, it is unfortunate that we have a piece of legislation here that seems to divide our States and our Representatives from those States, but frankly this really is not a fair bill to many of our States.  When we bring appropriations bills to the floor, we do our very best, and I think people on both sides would agree, we do our best to make sure that we play fair with everybody in this Chamber. I have looked at the original bill, I have looked at the proposed amendments, I have looked at the manager's amendment; and all I can see is that taxpayers and the highway users in my State of Florida are not being treated fairly.  I understand that there are some very nice incentives in this bill for Florida and for other States that are supporting the gentleman from Georgia. My vote is not going to be bought off because there are some very nice projects in this bill for Florida. I am still going to vote for the amendment offered by Mr. Isakson. If we cannot pass Mr. Isakson's amendment, I will vote against the bill because it is not a fair piece of legislation for a large part of this country.
