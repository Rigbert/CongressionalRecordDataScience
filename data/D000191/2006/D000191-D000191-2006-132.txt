Speaker, well, it is budget week here in Washington and on the Republican side of the aisle they are issuing shovels.  Now, the shovels here in Washington have two purposes. One is to shovel certain substances to obscure what they are really doing, and the other is to dig the debt hole of the United States of America, the indebtedness of the American people, yet deeper while languishing programs that are important to average folks while the wealthy get more.  This budget would reserve substantial funding for tax cuts for the richest among us. It would reserve tax cuts so that we can extend the tax where people who own stock that pays dividends would pay a much lower rate of tax than an American who works for, say, $30,000 a year in wages and salary.  It would extend the capital gains tax cuts which again primarily benefit people over $300,000 a year. For someone who earns, 50, $60,000 a year, the average tax break in capital gains is $50 since we exempt people's principal residence. That is where most middle class people have their capital. They do not have a whole lot of other investments. They are kind of struggling to get by. This budget is not going to help.  This budget would borrow every penny. We are taxing working people more than we need to collect money for Social Security. The theory is that money is being set aside to pay for the retirement of the baby boom, the coming change in the demographics of the society, the crisis the President talked about in funding Social Security.  Well, what are the President and Republicans doing with the $192 billion extra we will collect in Social Security taxes this year only from people who earn $94,000 a year or less? They are going to spend it. They are going to spend part of it on tax cuts for people who earn a heck of a lot more than $94,000 a year.  This deficit-producing budget is going to do an incredible disservice to our Nation. It will give us a new record and, of course, there have been many records under the Bush administration, and this will set the record of the five consecutive years of largest deficits in the history of the United States, from the small government folks down there at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.  Now, true, a lot of it is done in emergency supplementals. They cannot anticipate. This budget, for instance, says, unlike the President who says it will be a future President who decides when and if the United States withdraws from Iraq, the Republican budget, as honest as the day is long, says that we will spend $50 billion next year on Iraq and Afghanistan. Of course, that is quite a bit less than half of what we spent this year. So maybe they know something the President does not know and America does not know about the withdrawal timetable, or maybe it is more dishonest bookkeeping where we will have yet another unanticipated expense for the war in Iraq and the ongoing problems of pacifying Afghanistan.  So this budget is rife with these sorts of things. The total deficit this year will be $543 billion, including borrowing $192 billion of hard-earned money that is going to pay for supposedly future Social Security retirement. And over 5 years they are going to raise the debt of the United States of America. Again, it has been raised. Four times in the last 5 years, the debt ceiling has been raised. It is a 65 percent increase in the indebtedness of the United States of America.  This President has accumulated more foreign debt than the 42 Presidents that preceded him in office. Record after record after record is falling to the Republican leadership and the Republicans in the White House, something that they can be proud of. All so they can feed tax cuts for people who earn over a million bucks a year. That is really a great way to run a country.  They are anticipating with this budget, again even with dishonest bookkeeping, that we will be up to $11.3 trillion of debt by 2011. That would be about $27,000 for every American. $27,000 of debt. That would have more than doubled the debt since George Bush took office. Doubling the debt in that short period of time is, again, quite an accomplishment. It took 42 Presidents and more than 200 years to accumulate a significant debt and the President is going to manage to double it in a mere 5 years.  So hopefully we can take away the shovels, we can pull aside the veils, we can reveal to America what is going on and we can pass a budget that meets the priorities of the American people, not a privileged few.                          ____________________[Pages H1397-H1398]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                         ADMINISTRATION SHOVELS  Mr. DeFAZIO.
