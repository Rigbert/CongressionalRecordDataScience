 President, today I am introducing legislation to provide for a nationally coordinated program of research, promotion, and consumer information regarding kiwifruit for the purpose of expanding domestic and foreign markets for kiwifruit.  This bill is identical to H.R. 1486 introduced in the House by Congressman Wally Herger, Congressman Vic Fazio, and others.  The kiwifruit industry is an important and growing sector in American agriculture, with tremendous potential to expand sales both at home and abroad through increased promotion and consumer education.  California presently represents 99 percent of the U.S. kiwifruit production.  Kiwifruit are commercially grown in Kern, Tulare, Fresno, San Joaquin, Yolo, Sutter, Butte, Yuba, and Colusa Counties.  Altogether, there are about 700 kiwifruit growers in my State.  In 1993, U.S. consumption of kiwifruit was 59 percent California grown, 33 percent Chilean imports, and 8 percent New Zealand imports.  It is my understanding that Chilean exporters have expressed interest in participating with California growers in promoting kiwifruit to encourage increased domestic consumption and expand opportunities in foreign markets.  The self-help program, administered by the Department of Agriculture, would be funded almost entirely by industry user fees. The industry would assess benefiting domestic growers and importers to equitably share in the costs.  Currently there are 18 similar federally authorized commodity research and promotion programs.  Once Congress approved the authorizing legislation, the promotion program must be approved by a majority of the handlers of kiwifruit, including the handlers of imported kiwifruit.  Specifically, this bill would authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to issue a federal order for kiwifruit research, promotion, and consumer information; establish an eleven member kiwifruit board composed of six growers, four importers, and one member of the general public to run the promotion program; authorize the kiwifruit board to collect assessments, at no more than $0.10 per seven pound tray of kiwifruit, to pay for research, promotion, and consumer information and for administrative expenses incurred by the kiwifruit board; authorize use of the assessments not only for domestic generic promotion, but also for promotion activities outside the United States; and require the kiwifruit order to be approved by a majority of the producers and importers and by a majority of those producing and importing more than 50 percent of the total volume of kiwifruit produced and imported.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 897       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
