 I disagree with it. I disagree with it for a lot of reasons I have spoken to. I am going to vote and urge my colleagues not vote to table. We will do it the right way. But at least they have an argument that the President has not asked for it. I think we should be telling the President he has it.  We are not demanding, the Senator from Arizona and I, that he use ground troops. We are saying to him: We want to make sure you understand that you have to win this and you can't come back to us and say you didn't do it because you didn't have the means. At least that is why this Senator is pushing this.  The arguments I find totally disingenuous, though, are the ones that go like this. I heard today: You know, I voted against the bombing, but I tell you what, I am going to vote to table this use of the available ground troops to the President because I don't trust the President. But I tell you what, if this President were a leader, he would do whatever it took to stop this. But I am going to vote against giving him the authority it would take to stop it because I don't trust this President.  How? I don't understand.  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for one more question?
