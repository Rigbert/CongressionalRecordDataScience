 President, I will not take much time of the Senate, because time is short. There is no doubt that questions will arise with regard to this bill. Questions will arise regarding intent. I want to take this time to ensure that a printing error in the Treasury portion of the bill does not cause any confusion. The manager's statement regarding the Internal Revenue Service Tax Modernization System [TSM] Request For Proposal [RFP] addressed on page H12010 of Saturday's Record uses two dates: July 31, 1997 and July 31, 1999. July 31, 1997 is the date.  Mr. President there may be other errors, but I have not found them. The Government Printing Office has done an exceptional job in producing a lengthy and complex document in a very short time.                             fcc relocation
