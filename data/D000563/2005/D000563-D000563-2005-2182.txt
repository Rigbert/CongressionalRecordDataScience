There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 345       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

(a) In General.--Subpart 2 of part D of the Social Security      Act is amended by inserting after section 1860D-11 the      following new section:           ``MEDICARE OPERATED PRESCRIPTION DRUG PLAN OPTION       ``Sec. 1860D-11A. (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any      other provision of this part, for each year (beginning with      2006), in addition to any plans offered under section 1860D-     11, the Secretary shall offer one or more medicare operated      prescription drug plans (as defined in subsection (c)) with a      service area that consists of the entire United States and      shall enter into negotiations with pharmaceutical      manufacturers to reduce the purchase cost of covered part D      drugs for eligible part D individuals in accordance with      subsection (b).       ``(b) Negotiations.--Notwithstanding section 1860D-11(i),      for purposes of offering a medicare operated prescription      drug plan under this section, the Secretary shall negotiate      with pharmaceutical manufacturers with respect to the      purchase price of covered part D drugs and shall encourage      the use of more affordable therapeutic equivalents to the      extent such practices do not override medical necessity as      determined by the prescribing physician. To the extent      practicable and consistent with the previous sentence, the      Secretary shall implement strategies similar to those used by      other Federal purchasers of prescription drugs, and other      strategies, to reduce the purchase cost of covered part D      drugs.       ``(c) Medicare Operated Prescription Drug Plan Defined.--     For purposes of this part, the term `medicare operated      prescription drug plan' means a prescription drug plan that      offers qualified prescription drug coverage and access to      negotiated prices described in section 1860D-2(a)(1)(A). Such      a plan may offer supplemental prescription drug coverage in      the same manner as other qualified prescription drug coverage      offered by other prescription drug plans.       ``(d) Monthly Beneficiary Premium.--       ``(1) Qualified prescription drug coverage.--The monthly      beneficiary premium for qualified prescription drug coverage      and access to negotiated prices described in section 1860D-     2(a)(1)(A) to be charged under a medicare operated      prescription drug plan shall be uniform nationally. Such      premium for months in 2006 shall be $35 and for months in      succeeding years shall be based on the average monthly per      capita actuarial cost of offering the medicare operated      prescription drug plan for the year involved, including      administrative expenses.       ``(2) Supplemental prescription drug coverage.--Insofar as      a medicare operated prescription drug plan offers      supplemental prescription drug coverage, the Secretary may      adjust the amount of the premium charged under paragraph (1).       ``(3) Requirement for at least one plan with a $35 premium      in 2006.--The Secretary shall ensure that at least one      medicare operated prescription drug plan offered in 2006 has      a monthly premium of $35.''.       (b) Conforming Amendments.--       (1) Section 1860D-3(a) of the Social Security Act (42      U.S.C. 1395w-103(a)) is amended by adding at the end the      following new paragraph:       ``(4) Availability of the medicare operated prescription      drug plan.--       ``(A) In general.--A medicare operated prescription drug      plan (as defined in section 1860D-11A(c)) shall be offered      nationally in accordance with section 1860D-11A.       ``(B) Relationship to other plans.--       ``(i) In general.--Subject to clause (ii), a medicare      operated prescription drug plan shall be offered in addition      to any qualifying plan or fallback prescription drug plan      offered in a PDP region and shall not be considered to be      such a plan for purposes of meeting the requirements of this      subsection.       ``(ii) Designation as a fallback plan.--Notwithstanding any      other provision of this part, the Secretary may designate the      medicare operated prescription drug plan as the fallback      prescription drug plan for any fallback service area (as      defined in section 1860D-11(g)(3)) determined to be      appropriate by the Secretary.''.       (2) Section 1860D-13(c)(3) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-     113(c)(3)) is amended--       (A) in the heading, by inserting ``and medicare operated      prescription drug plans'' after ``Fallback plans''; and       (B) by inserting ``or a medicare operated prescription drug      plan'' after ``a fallback prescription drug plan''.       (3) Section 1860D-16(b)(1) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-     116(b)(1)) is amended--       (A) in subparagraph (C), by striking ``and'' after the      semicolon at the end;       (B) in subparagraph (D), by striking the period at the end      and inserting ``; and''; and       (C) by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:       ``(E) payments for expenses incurred with respect to the      operation of medicare operated prescription drug plans under      section 1860D-11A.''.
