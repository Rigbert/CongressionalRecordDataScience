President, last week, the mastermind of one of this century's most horrific crimes against humanity died apparently peacefully in his sleep. Pol Pot, founder and leader of the Khmer Rouge, architect of the grisly genocide which claimed at least one million Cambodian lives between 1975 and 1979, died at the age of 73. While some may see Pol Pot's death as final closure on one of the most shockingly brutal and despotic reigns in history, his death should not absolve the international community from seeking justice for the people of Cambodia.  The scars from Pol Pot's four-year reign of terror remain in Cambodia, and on the face of humanity. History will judge us. Did they do enough? Did they do what they could? Did they even care? If those assessments were written today, the community of nations would be found wanting. The fact that Pol Pot lived to his dying day having never been punished for his crimes is the best evidence of that.  When Pol Pot and his Khmer Rouge captured the Cambodian capitol of Phnom Penh in April 1975, he and his lieutenants began a barbaric campaign to exterminate intellectuals, foreigners, bureaucrats, merchants, and countless others who did not fit Pol Pot's vision of a ``pure'' Cambodia. Many thousands more were forced into slave labor camps, eventually dying from starvation, torture, and disease. I have met some of the survivors of that nightmare who escaped to Thailand and ultimately resettled in the United States, including in Vermont. They are a living tribute to the invincibility of the human spirit.  Four years later in 1979 Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge were forced from power, but they left behind a ghastly swath of death and carnage that counted at least one million Cambodians dead and a country that to this day is trying to cope with the ghosts of that era. Virtually every Cambodian now alive knows or is related to someone who perished under the Khmer Rouge.  Although Pol Pot was the architect of the killing fields of Cambodia, those in his inner circle were responsible for carrying out his commands. Many of Pol Pot's chief lieutenants still roam the Cambodian countryside, reportedly along the Thai border. Men like Khieu Samphan, former President of Kampuchea; Nuon Chea, former second in command and someone described as Pol Pot's ``alter ego;'' and Ta Mok, a Khmer Rouge leader whose portfolio included killing Cambodians who had worked for the old Lon Nol government. Ta Mok was nicknamed ``the Butcher.''  The wanton killing did not end decades ago. In 1996 British mine clearer Christopher Howes and his Cambodian interpreter, Houn Hourth, were abducted by Khmer Rouge soldiers and later led to a field and shot in the back. According to recent reports of interviews with Khmer Rouge officials, aides close to Pol Pot ordered the killing. Mr. Howes posed no threat to Pol Pot or the Khmer Rouge. He was in Cambodia working to make the country safer for the Cambodian people by helping remove one-by-one the millions of landmines sown in the fields. Today, Cambodia is infested with mines which continue to maim and kill the innocent.  I am encouraged that the Administration appears ready to seek some formal mechanism to bring to justice key members of Pol Pot's inner circle. A number of possible approaches have been suggested, including a war crimes tribunal for Cambodia like the existing tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, or an international penal tribunal that includes Cambodian participation. These ideas and others merit further discussion as we examine appropriate ways to seek justice for the Cambodian people.  The United Nations has also named a three-person team to investigate the remaining Khmer Rouge leaders. This too, is an encouraging sign.  Whatever it takes, we must not let the fact that Pol Pot eluded justice diminish our resolve to apprehend and punish the members of his inner circle who are also guilty of crimes against humanity. History will judge us harshly if we turn our backs now.  I ask unanimous consent that two editorials be printed in the Record.  The editorials follow:               [From The New York Times, April 17, 1998]                        Pol Pot Escapes Justice       Pol Pot, elusive to the end, died just as the world finally      seemed to be serious about bringing him to justice. No      punishment, however, could have fit the evil he committed.      From 1975 to 1979, Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge wiped out a large      fraction of Cambodia's people, and left the rest with a      country submerged in violence and pain.       The Khmer Rouge regime was surely the most bizarre in      modern history, its philosophy made up of one part Maoism and      three parts paranoia. It emptied the cities and marched      Cambodians to the countryside to starve on state farms.      Having an education, or even wearing glasses, could get one      killed as a class enemy. Thousands of Khmer Rouge's own      cadres were forced to confess to spying and tortured to      death. There is probably no adult in Cambodia today unscarred      by the loss of a close relative. Political life, too, is      still poisoned. The nation's spectacular misrule stems in      part from the scarcity of educated people and the political      habits learned in four years of terror.       The Vietnamese invasion that ousted the Khmer Rouge in 1979      forced Pol Pot and his men into the jungle, where they      continue to wage a guerrilla war to this day. Many Khmer      Rouge troops have received amnesty and become wealthy and      influential members of Hun Sen's Government, including Mr.      Hun Sen himself. Pol Pot's death will rob investigators of      the chance to try him and to hear about the crimes of Khmer      Rouge leaders who are still in positions of power.       Pol Pot, who became a Communist while on a scholarship in      Paris in the early 1950's, never apologized. In an interview      last October, the only one he had granted since 1978, he said      that whatever he had done he did for his country. He disputed      that millions had died but acknowledged that hundreds of      thousands had. Those killings were necessary, he said,      because the Vietnamese wanted to assassinate him and swallow      up Cambodia. His conscience was clear.       This was said by an old man so weakened by malaria and      stroke that he could barely walk. He always had a gentle      manner and soft voice, and in the interview smiled      constantly. He did not seem a man who could have presided      over the deaths of more than a million people. Three months      before the interview, however, the Khmer Rouge put him on      trial, not for the crimes of his regime but for his murder of      a political rival and the man's family. The camera showed the      Khmer Rouge troops watching the trial chanting robotically,      ``Crush, crush, crush.'' He, of course, had taught them that.      The soft-spoken old man of the interview was a mirage. His      disciples showed who Pol Pot really was.                                                                    ____               [From The Washington Post, April 17, 1998]                             After Pol Pot       The reported death of Pol Pot in the Cambodian jungle means      that one of this century's most egregious mass murderers will      not stand trial or be held accountable for his crimes. But it      should not mean that Pol Pot's accomplices now will be let      off the hook, and it does not mean that other nations with an      interest in Cambodia's future should ease their pressure for      a restoration of democracy there.       Between 1975 and 1979 more than 1 million and probably      closer to 2 million Cambodians were executed or died from the      effects of torture, deliberate starvation and brutal      overwork. Pol Pot was the nation's communist leader at the      time; he presided over the deaths of one-fifth of his      population. But he was not alone. According to painstaking      documentation assembled by the Cambodia Genocide Project at      Yale University (partially funded by the State Department), a      standing committee, on March 30, 1976, formally established      an integrated national network of extermination centers.      These were responsible for an estimated 1 million deaths of      people who are now buried in 20,000 mass graves. Eight to 10      members of that committee are still alive and at large.       The tendency on the part of the international community      will be to abandon efforts to bring to trial those guilty of      crimes against humanity. With Pol Pot gone, attention will      fade; some believe his colleagues killed him for just that      reason. Moreover, some of Pol Pot's onetime comrades are in      league with Cambodia's current leader, Hun Sen. It would make      diplomats' jobs easier to let them be. It would also be an      affront to justice and to Cambodia's many victims.       The same international fatigue is emerging with respect to      Hun Sen, who seized     power in a coup last July. Officials from the United States,      Japan, Cambodia's neighbors and other nations will meet in      Bangkok on Sunday to decide whether to resume some aid to his      regime, at least to help organize an election he wants to      hold in July. Hun Sen hopes the election will legitimize his      authoritarian rule. Some in Bangkok will want to go forward      because Hun Sen has allowed deposed prime minister Prince      Ranariddh to return to Cambodia, supposedly a gesture of      reconciliation.       But political killings of Ranariddh supporters continue,      and no one has been brought to justice for more than 40 past      murders; Hun Sen's opponents live in fear and with limited      access to the media; no impartial courts or electoral      commission exist. Until these conditions change, a credible      election is impossible. The United States and its allies      should not put themselves in the position of blessing any      other kind.                          ____________________
