Mr. Chairman, I rise today to urge my colleagues to oppose this so-called Thomas campaign finance reform bill. The Thomas bill is a shame, a sham, a scam. It is a farce, it is a joke, because it is not reform at all. This is a special interest bill designed to allow the superwealthy to funnel hundreds of thousands of dollars into the Republican campaign coffers.  The American people are in agreement. Our political process is sick. It is corrupt. There is too much money, too much special interest influence on our elections. But that is Dr. Gingrich's prescription for this problem? Well, testifying before the Committee on House Oversight, Gingrich said there was not too much money in our political process, there was too little. Far more money is needed, he contended.  Well, this bill is Dr. Gingrich's solution. It would increase the ability of superwealthy people to influence our election. In fact, in its original form this bill would have allowed an individual to donate more than $3 million to Republican coffers. Only when the Democrats in the House exposed this scandal did the Republicans change this bill overnight.  Mr. Chairman, Newt Gingrich has succeeded in funneling between $10 and $20 million into campaigns through his personal political slush fund, GOPAC, without ever reporting a single dime. It is alleged that he used nonprofit groups to further channel funds to his pet political projects.  Mr. Chairman, this bill will open the floodgates of special interest funds. This bill is the Republican way to do under the law what must now be done by going around the law.  This bill, not Medicare, Mr. Chairman, deserves to wither on the vine. Let me say it again, Mr. Chairman: This bill, not Medicare, deserves to wither on the vine.
