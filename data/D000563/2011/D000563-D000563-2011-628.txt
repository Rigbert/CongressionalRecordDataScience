 He ended up taking out the GI loans, going $21,000 in debt over and above the GI bill, and he couldn't finish. He didn't want to go further into debt.  I might say to Carlos that he got off easy. I had a young woman who went to Westwood College for a criminal justice degree. After 5 years of extra effort to get her diploma, she ended up with a worthless diploma that she couldn't turn into a job anyplace, at any sheriff's office or anyplace related to criminal justice. I might say to the Senator from Iowa, she was $90,000 in debt at the age of 26, with a worthless diploma from Westwood College, this for-profit school. She is living in her parents' basement because she cannot get a job that pays anything, and whatever she makes goes to the student loans, and she cannot borrow a nickel now to get a real education.
