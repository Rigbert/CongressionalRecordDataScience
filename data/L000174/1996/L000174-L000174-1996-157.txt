President, I listened carefully to my good friend from Mississippi. I have a feeling that my amendment, while it comes close to his description, I am hoping it is somewhat outside the pale--an expression that he, with his cosmopolitan and erudite upbringing, his education in another part of the world dear to both of us, would understand, the expression, ``beyond the pale.'' So, I might try to bring it within the pale of acceptability. Since the managers are not too pressed for time, I was thinking, perhaps to give the Reporter of Debates a chance to rest a bit, I may suggest the absence of a quorum for just a couple of moments so that we might reason together.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
