 President, I would like to pay tribute to a young man who recently lost his courageous battle with cancer. Jesse Schott, a 17-year-old student at North Bullitt High School near Shepherdsville, KY, became a local hero and will be dearly missed by all those who knew and loved him.  Although first diagnosed with brain cancer at the age of 3, Jesse spent his life chasing his dreams. In fact, it was often during the darkest moments of his fight that Jesse accomplished his most impressive feats. As a first sergeant in his Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps, JROTC, Jesse commanded the color guard under the bright lights at the football stadium. Last December, after learning his cancer had spread, Jesse surprised many when he competed in a drill meet. When he was too ill to complete his Eagle Scout project to build a receptacle for old or damaged flags to be properly retired, his fellow scouts helped finish the task.  Whatever the hardship that confronted him, Jesse didn't complain. Reassured by his faith and his loving family, he persevered and kept fighting. Jesse encouraged those around him with bravery beyond his years. A fellow member of the JROTC said, ``He was going through the battle of his life and he never gave up so why should I give up on anything?''  His life may have been cut short, but Jesse clearly left a lasting impact on those he met. His community honored his life and his example. The Zoneton Fire Department named him an honorary firefighter. Jesse was named the honorary mayor of Hillview. The Kentucky National Guard made him an honorary member earlier this year. Jesse's life will continue to inspire those who knew him and those who will hear his story for many years to come.  I urge my Senate colleagues to join me in extending our condolences to Jesse's family. I hope that their happy memories of Jesse will ease their grief during this difficult time.                          ____________________
