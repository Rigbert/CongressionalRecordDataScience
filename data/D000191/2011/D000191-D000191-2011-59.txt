  Mr. DeFAZIO. Earlier this month, the House stood in silence when we observe and honor those who serve in our Nation's police forces, and I rise today in memory of Eugene Police Officer Chris Kilcullen.  Officer Kilcullen died in the line of duty April 22, 2011. He was an exemplary member of the Eugene Police Department, served with valor and distinction, and received 85 commendations in his 12 years in the department. He served as a member of the traffic enforcement team and was a skilled negotiator with the crisis negotiation team. He saved lives.  Officer Kilcullen loved to be a police officer. At his memorial service, he was honored by hundreds of uniformed police officers and dozens of elected and public officials. He was remembered by his peers for his exemplary service, kindness, collegiality, endearing good nature, and unmatched rapport with the public he served.  His tragic death is a sobering reminder of the dangers confronted daily by men and women in law enforcement. One American law enforcement officer is killed in the line of duty every 53 hours.  In a final tribute at his service, a ``last call'' went out for ``One Mary 18.'' Dispatchers refer to Eugene motorcycle officers as ``Mary units.'' After there was no response to the call, the faceless dispatcher called out, ``All units be advised, One Mary 18 is secure. He may be gone, but he is not forgotten. Rest in peace, Chris. Rest in peace.''  Christopher Kilcullen is survived by his wife, Kristie Kilcullen, and daughters, Sydney and Katie Ann.                          ____________________
