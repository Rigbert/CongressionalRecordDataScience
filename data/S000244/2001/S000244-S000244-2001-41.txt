Speaker, I thank the fourth bright mind of the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions) for his compliments, and I rise in support of the rule and in support of H.R. 3210. I wish to compliment the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Oxley) for his vigorous work on this difficult issue.  I am particularly supportive of the litigation management provisions in H.R. 3210 which will benefit all people in all industries that fall victim to terrorist attacks of a catastrophic nature. Any bill that fails to limit potentially infinite liability for terrorist-caused litigation would fail to recognize the obvious. Traditional tort rules are designed to address slip-and-fall cases caused by banana peels, not terrorists; and while banana peels may be accidents waiting to happen, terrorists are suicidal killers plotting the deaths of thousands of innocents and the destruction of billions of dollars of property.  Under this legislation, if the Secretary of the Treasury determines that one or more acts of terrorism have occurred, an exclusive Federal cause of action kicks in for lawsuits arising out of, relating to, or resulting from the acts of terrorism; and the lawsuit must be heard by a Federal court or courts selected by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation. These claims in Federal court are subject to limits on punitive damages and attorneys' fees. Defendants are only liable for noneconomic damage in direct proportion to their responsibility for the harm, and damage awards to plaintiffs must be offset by any collateral source compensation received by the plaintiff.  By enacting these provisions to cover terrorist-inspired litigation, individuals and businesses will be protected by Congress from potentially limited liability and bankrupting litigation. Also under these provisions, the size of damage awards for which the United States taxpayer will have to provide up-front sums to cover would be reduced, just as the Federal Tort Claims Act's limits on punitive damages and attorneys' fees limit damages and litigation that will result in money taken from the U.S. Treasury.                              {time}  1130  These provisions protect the American taxpayer. Those opposed to them wish to turn the key to the United States Treasury over to the plaintiffs' bar.  Existing tort rules do not properly apply when the primary cause of injury is a suicidal fanatic motivated by a deep hatred of America. These are not garden variety slip-and-fall or auto accident cases, and this Congress has already recognized this key distinction in passing the liability protection provisions governing lawsuits relating to the September 11 attacks.  As a result of the Aviation Security Act conference report, as well as the Air Transportation Safety and Systems Stabilization Act, September 11-related lawsuits against air carriers, air manufacturers, owners and operators of airports, State port authorities, and persons with property interests in the World Trade Center must be heard in Federal court in New York; and the total damages against these potential defendants, should they be found liable, are capped at the limits of the insurance coverage they had on September 11.  Let this be clear, that what is proposed in the litigation management provisions of this bill the House has already approved in both the Aviation Security Act and in the Air Transportation Safety and Systems Stabilization Act. So Members have already voted for this once and twice.  In addition to these provisions, the Airline Security Act that originally passed the House also limited punitive damages and attorney's fees, and required that damage awards to plaintiffs be offset by any collateral source compensation received by the plaintiffs.  The litigation management provisions of H.R. 3210 would similarly benefit victims of future terrorist attacks. If these same provisions are not extended to private businesses which might be attacked in the future, the mom-and-pop store down the street will have to invest scarce resources to turn itself from a corner shop into a fortified bunker designed to withstand foreign attacks to avoid potentially infinite liability, or pay through the nose in higher insurance premiums because the risks are higher and their exposure is greater.  Furthermore, without the litigation management provisions in H.R. 3210, no limits would be placed on the fees of attorneys bringing terrorist-caused cases against Americans and their businesses, and ultimately against the taxpayers, under this bill.  Reasonable limits on attorney's fees serve the same purpose behind restrictions on permanent damages and joint and several liability. They maximize the funds available to large numbers of victims when there are only limited resources available for compensation. Such protections are more important than ever in the context of the terrorist attacks causing large-scale losses. Again, the litigation management provisions in this bill will spread the wealth out to more victims, rather than having one or two large awards ending up bankrupting the pot of money available.  The 1993 World Trade Center bombing killed six people, yet resulted in 500 lawsuits by 700 individuals, businesses, and insurance companies. Damages claimed amounted to $500 million. Eight years later, these cases are only now just getting to trial, and hundreds of plaintiffs have yet to receive a cent in compensation.  By providing reasonable limits on potentially infinite liability and consolidating all cases in one or a few Federal forums, victims of terrorism will recover more quickly and more equitably because a few enormous awards in one court will not bankrupt a responsible party before another court can consider arguments of others who may have stronger claims against the same party.  I urge all Members to support these vitally important provisions, which ensure equitable compensation to victims while protecting the American economy and the American taxpayer.
