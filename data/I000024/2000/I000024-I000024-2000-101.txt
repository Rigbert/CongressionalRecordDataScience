I urge my colleagues to support this for the state of readiness of our Nation.                               Exhibit 1               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 22, 1999]                          (By Henry Kissinger)No U.S. Ground Forces for Kosovo--Leadership Doesn't Mean That We Must                         Do Everything Ourselves.       President Clinton's announcement that some 4,000 American      troops will join a NATO force of 28,000 to help police a      Kosovo agreement faces all those concerned with long-range      American national security policy with a quandary.       Having at once time shared responsibility for national      security policy and the extrication from Vietnam, I am      profoundly uneasy about the proliferation of open-ended      American commitments involving the deployment of U.S. forces.      American forces are in harm's way in Kosovo, Bosnia and the      gulf.
