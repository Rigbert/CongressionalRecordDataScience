 President, just before the State work period, I asked Senators to consider some important questions: In a time of limited Federal resources and tough choices, is it fair to treat localities that cooperate with Federal law enforcement or work hard to follow Federal law no better than localities that refuse to help or actually actively flout the law? When a deputy sheriff puts her life on the line every day, is it fair to make her live in constant fear of being sued for simply trying to keep us safe? When felons enter our country illegally and repeatedly, is it fair to victims and families to not do what we can now to stop them?  The answer is that it isn't fair. That is why colleagues should support the legislation we will consider this afternoon. It aims to ensure more fairness to cities and States that do the right thing, redirecting certain Federal funds to them from those that choose not to do the right thing. It aims to support law enforcement officers who risk everything for our safety, protecting them from lawsuits for simply doing their federally mandated duties. It aims to deliver justice for victims and their families, substantially increasing deterrence for criminals who commit felonies and then try to illegally reenter our country--endeavoring to save more Americans from the pain these families continue to experience every day.  We all know the heartbreaking story of Kate Steinle. Kate was walking arm in arm with her father one moment, begging for help the next as she began bleeding to death in his arms. The man who ended her life shouldn't have even been there that day. He had been convicted of seven--seven--felonies and deported five times, but San Francisco is a so-called sanctuary city that arbitrarily decides when it will cooperate with the Federal Government and when it will not, and it refused to even honor the Federal Government's request for an immigration detainer.  What happened to Kate is tragic, and it is not an isolated incident. Consider this letter from Susan Oliver, who lost her husband just last year. Here is what she had to say:       The man that killed my husband, Deputy Danny Oliver, was      deported several times for various felonies. However, due to      the lack of coordination between law enforcement agencies,      his killer was allowed back into the country. . . .       I [am] asking for only one thing. I do not want your      sympathy, I want change so others will not have to endure the      grief we have in our lives every day.  The bill which we will consider this afternoon is supported by law enforcement organizations such as the National Sheriffs' Association, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, and the National Association of Police Organizations.  Here is what the International Union of Police Associations had to say about it:       The International Union of Police Associations is proud--  Proud--     to add our name to the list of supporters of the bill      addressing ``Sanctuary Cities'' titled Stop Sanctuary      Policies and Protect Americans Act.       As it now stands, our officers can be held liable for      sharing relevant information and honoring immigration      detainers, even when they are from federal immigration      officials. This legislation remedies that.       Additionally, the bill provides a financial disincentive      for cities to become or remain ``sanctuary cities''. . . .  The organization also noted that this bill would help end the ``revolving door'' of criminals who ``even though convicted of felony criminal activity and deported, unlawfully return to prey upon our citizens.''  The issue before us is not truly about immigration; it is more about keeping our communities safe. Those who defend so-called sanctuary cities callously disregard how their extreme policies hurt others. The President's own DHS Secretary has used terms such as ``not acceptable'' and ``counterproductive to public safety'' when referring to sanctuary city policies. Such extreme policies can inflict almost unimaginable pain on innocent victims and their families.  As the father of three daughters, I know--I know--we can do better. I amcalling on every colleague to put compassion before leftwing ideology today. This bill would support the deputy sheriff who puts her life on the line every day. This bill would provide hope and justice for victims and their families. So let's vote to support them, not defend extreme policies that actually hurt them.                          ____________________
