President, shortly before Senator Thurmond retired from the Senate, I included a tribute in the Congressional Record on his long career. As the Senate notes his passing so soon after his retirement, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record my earlier remarks from September 24, 2002.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:       Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a colleague      who has a career of public service that may never be matched      again in the history of our country.       Strom Thurmond sits on the other side of the aisle in the      Senate chamber but I consider him a friend with whom I have      worked closely. I will miss him.       We often worked together in the field of antitrust laws. We      worked together on the National Cooperative Production      Amendments of 1993, the very first high technology bill      signed by President Clinton, and to improve the protections      against anticompetitive conduct in the Digital Performance      Rights in Sound Recordings Act.       Senator Thurmond has been a legislator. I must admit that      when Senator Thurmond and I have worked together, it has      raised some eyebrows. Whenever we introduced legislation      together, he and I fondly remarked that the bill was either a      brilliant piece of drafting or one of us had not read it.       Needless to say, there have been many occasions when Strom      and I sat on opposite sides of an issue. Even though there      were issues about which we felt deeply, Senator Thurmond      always conducted himself with the utmost integrity. Strom has      always told the Senate how he felt and did so with the people      of South Carolina first and foremost in his mind.       Senator Thurmond has always been a gentleman. His warmth      and kindness one afternoon in the Senate Dining Room framed      what has to be one of the strangest meetings of all times in      that venue. In 1994, I invited Jerry Garcia and the Grateful      Dead to join me for lunch in the dining room. As we sat down      for lunch, Senator Thurmond entered the room and came over to      say hello. I took the opportunity to introduce him to Jerry.      It was quite a meeting of cultures.       Besides our devotion to the Senate, I share with Senator      Thurmond the distinction of being from a State that has      provided the Senate Judiciary Committee with three Chairmen      over the history of the Committee. South Carolina and Vermont      each have had three Senators who have chaired the Committee.       I have learned much from the senior Senator from South      Carolina. Let me share with you one additional aspect of      Senator Thurmond's legacy to the Senate as he completes this      term and retires from office. In addition to all his      longevity records and legislative achievements and buildings      named for him, there is something else about him I will      always remember.       When we hold hearings for Federal judges--and we have held      a number this year--I am always careful to carry on a      tradition that Senator Thurmond started. Senator Thurmond      always reminded nominees for high office that it is essential      to treat others with courtesy and respect. He always reminded      nominees that the people and lawyers who appeared before      them, whatever their position in the case, whether rich or      poor, white or black, man or woman, whatever their religious      or political affiliation, they are each and every one      deserving of respect and fairness.       Senator Thurmond was right to remind judges--and even      Senators--of that simple rule. It is another contribution he      has made to all of us that will continue to serve us well.       Mr. President, as I said earlier, I will miss Strom      Thurmond. He has been named President-Pro-Tempore Emeritus      for good reason.                          ____________________
