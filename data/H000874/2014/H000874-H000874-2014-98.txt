We obviously need to deal with the immediate problem.  I was talking, of course, about the longer-term problem, but I appreciate the gentleman's observation with reference to the supplemental. I am a supporter of that supplemental.  Obviously, the Appropriations Committee needs to review it with respect to the proper levels of funding, but there is no doubt that we, right now, have inadequate resources to deal with the humanitarian crisis that confronts us immediately, and those funds are necessary.  I am pleased that the gentleman brought it up, and I look forward to working with him on it.  Unless the gentleman wants to make further comment, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________
