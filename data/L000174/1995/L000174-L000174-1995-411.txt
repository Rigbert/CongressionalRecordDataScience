President, I am proud to be a cosponsor of the Ryan White CARE Act.  Today, AIDS is the leading cause of death among Americans between the ages of 25 to 44 years. Truly, a staggering statistic.  Since the beginning of the epidemic in 1981 through June of 1994, the number of reported AIDS cases in Vermont is 213. Eighty-two of these cases were reported in the previous year alone. This represents an increase of 242 percent over the reported total in 1991-92.  AIDS knows no gender, sexual orientation, age, or region of the country. AIDS is something that affects all of us.  Since its enactment in 1990, the Ryan White CARE has done so much to help provide health care and services to the growing number of people with HIV/AIDS. I hope that we can work toward a speedy passage.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be able to proceed as if in morning business.
