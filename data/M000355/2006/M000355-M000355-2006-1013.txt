 President and colleagues, the first vote of the week will be tomorrow morning at approximately 11 o'clock on a district judge. Following that vote, we will begin consideration of the emergency supplemental appropriations bill. Senators who intend to offer amendments to that bill are reminded to work with the bill managers. Additional votes obviously will occur, we hope, tomorrow afternoon.                          ____________________[Page S3428]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                                PROGRAM  Mr. McCONNELL.
