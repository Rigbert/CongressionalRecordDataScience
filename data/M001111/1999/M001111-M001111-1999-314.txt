 Education is an issue that is important to everyone at home as well. I will again plead with the chairman from the committee to allow us to offer our amendments, to get an up-or-down vote, to limit the number of amendments, but to let us move forward on issues like this, like class size, that are bipartisan, that have been agreed to before, that the American public wants and that makes a difference for all of our children.  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.
