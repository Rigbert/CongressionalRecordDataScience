 Edward Earl Gidcumb. Mr. Gidcumb, or ``Earl'' to his friends, celebrates his 88th birthday this July 31. He served America during World War II as a storekeeper, second class, in the U.S. Navy, and survived some harrowing experiences.  Earl's story is commemorated in a book titled ``WWII DC: The Long Overdue Journey,'' which details the experiences of World War II veterans from Kentucky and describes a trip made by these Kentucky veterans to the Nation's capital in 2004 to visit the National World War II Memorial. Earl still is an active participant in the Kentucky veterans community as one of the few buglers left in western Kentucky; he plays taps at military funerals and civic events. Earl also contributed to the establishment of the Kentucky Veterans and Patriots Museum in Wickliffe, Kentucky.  Earl was a high-school student when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. He graduated from high school on May 23 of 1943; on May 25, he was sworn into Naval service in Marion, IL.  Earl underwent training in Chicago and then served aboard several vessels, the first of which, the U.S. Navy ship LST 218, was bound for Pearl Harbor. Earl recalls, ``water supply was very short and we took salt-water baths using a special soap for bathing in salt water. We slept in bunks stacked six high and down below the main deck . . . I started out in the Atlantic Ocean and ended up on the Pacific Ocean.''  Earl spent time in Pearl Harbor before being posted to the USS Indianapolis CA 35, a heavy cruiser. He received five battle stars while serving on the Indianapolis for 10 months. A few months after being transferred off that ship, the Indianapolis was sunk by a Japanese submarine.  ``I would not be here today if I had remained aboard the Indy,'' Earl says. ``The second torpedo of the two that sunk it hit the part of the ship where I slept each night. There [were] 1,196 aboard, 800 went down with the ship, [and] 317 survived after several days in the water. Some died from their wounds, some were eaten by sharks,and the balance drowned. It was the Navy's worst naval disaster.''  Earl was transferred to Oregon, where he was joined by his wife, Jean Moore. Earl and Jean were high-school sweethearts and got married when Earl went home on 30 days' leave. After 45 years of marriage, sadly, Jean passed away in 1989.  Earl was reassigned again, this time to the USS Bottineau APA 235, a troop carrier. The ship went to Japan not long after the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. They received occupation troops from Honshu, Japan. Earl earned another battle star for an encounter with a Japanese suicide plane in Okinawa Bay. After 2 years, 8 months, and 9 days of faithful service, Earl was discharged in 1946.  Looking back nearly 70 years later, Earl recalls the lessons he's learned. ``I was only 17 when I entered service,'' he says. ``I had no idea what I was facing . . . I had no reason to be scared.''  ``I saw men put in LCVP vessels and sent to do battle on the beach to take the island back from the Japanese. I saw some of the same men brought back in body bags. I saw 450 Japanese planes shot down in the Battle of the Philippine Sea, all in one day. I saw a Japanese Zero so close I could see the orange Japanese flag on the side of the plane. I saw body parts of Japanese soldiers scattered everywhere when I went over the Island of Tarawa. We lost 8,000 Marines of our own. This was my first battle.''  Madam President, I am grateful heroes like Mr. Edward Earl Gidcumb are still able to transmit their wisdom and share their stories with the rest of us. The life story of Mr. Gidcumb is certainly inspiring. I know my colleagues in the U.S. Senate join me in thanking him for his valiant service to our country. It is thanks to him and his fellow soldiers that America was able to triumph in World War II and advance freedom and democracy.                          ____________________
