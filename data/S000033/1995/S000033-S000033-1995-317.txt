 I wonder how many Americans know this. We have in the United States today by far the highest rate of childhood poverty in the industrialized world. Over 22 percent of the children in America are living in poverty. Many of our elderly people are living in poverty.  The new jobs that are being created are significantly lower-wage jobs than was the case even 15 years ago, especially for the young men and women who are just graduating college. Why is all of this happening?  Clearly those are the issues that we should be discussing, but unfortunately, we spend very little time doing that.
