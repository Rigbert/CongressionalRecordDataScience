 President, I would like to briefly discuss the funding levels for international broadcasting in this legislation. I am disappointed by the considerable reductions in the Senate bill in this account. We have important priorities in this account. Radio Free Asia, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), and the Voice of America are critical instruments of American foreign policy. For a relatively modest cost, these broadcasting agencies project American values and promote American ideals. RFE/RL was of critical importance during the Cold War in undermining the tight control on information imposed by the communist states in Eastern Europe and Eurasia. Although the Cold War is over, RFE/RL still have an important function in a region where independent media are not yet firmly established, and, in many countries, is barely adequate. I authored the legislation in 1994 which created Radio Free Asia--which broadcasts news about local events to China and the other dictatorships in the region--and I want to ensure that it has the necessary resources so that it can perform its function.  It is my understanding that Committee has assumed that the bill fully funds Radio Free Asia at the requested level of $19.4 million. Is that the understanding of the Chairman?
