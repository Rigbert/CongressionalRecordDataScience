President, for the first time in more than 2 years, the Senate is turning its attention to an issue related to our broken immigration system. But in stark contrast to the comprehensive, hopeful legislation last reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee, the majority is simply scheduling a show vote today on a divisive, partisan proposal that has not even been considered in the Judiciary Committee. What a difference a change in leadership makes.  There are few topics more fundamental to who we are as a Nation than immigration. A consistent thread through our history is the arrival of new people to this country seeking a better life. Immigration has been an ongoing source of renewal for America--a renewal of our spirit, our creativity, and our economic strength.  Two years ago, the Senate reaffirmed its commitment to these ideals when we approved S. 744, the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act. That legislation, which was supported by 68 Senators from both parties, would have meaningfully improved our great country by making our communities safer, strengthening our economy, improving border security, and keeping families together. It was a remarkable, bipartisan effort that was made better through the extensive amendment process in the Senate Judiciary Committee. It was an example of all that we can accomplish when we actually focus on the hard job of legislating.  The bill we are considering today could not be more different. This legislation is not bipartisan. It does not reflect a desire to meaningfully improve what we all agree is a broken immigration system. Instead, this bill is, as the New York Times editorialized on Saturday, ``a class-action slander against an immigrant population that has been scapegoated for the crimes of a few, and left stranded by the failure of legislative reform that would open a path for them to live fully within the law.''  Those who support this bill point to a tragedy that captured our attention this summer. Any time an innocent person is killed, we have an obligation to understand what happened and try to prevent similar tragedies in the future. We all feel that way about the senseless and terribly cruel death of Kate Steinle. Her death was avoidable. Our system failed, period. And it is heart-wrenching that such a beautiful, young life was taken by a man who should never have been free on our streets.  We are motivated to do something in the wake of her death. Just as we are motivated to act in the wake of the senseless killings of nine men and women attending a Bible study class in Charleston, SC. Or the nine innocent people brutally murdered at an Oregon community college. These are moments that demand leadership. We should roll up our sleeves and start to address the problems that led us here. We should address gun violence and the criminals who threaten our safety instead of characterizing entire immigrant communities as criminals.  Unfortunately, it does not appear that we will be given that chance. Rather than marking this legislation up in Committee with input and amendments from both sides, the bill before us was yanked off of the Judiciary Committee agenda once the majority leader decided to bring it straight to the floor. Others can speculate about what motivated the timing of today's vote. What we know for sure is that this action goes against precisely what the majority leader promised last year when he said that ``[b]ills should go through Committee. And if Republicans are fortunate enough to gain the majority next year, they would.'' It is disappointing that he has broken his promise on legislation of such importance.  If this bill were to become law, it would create two new mandatory minimums and cost us millions of dollars that we do not have. This would deny funding for critical services in local communities and do nothing to fix the broken immigration system we have today. At a time when the Judiciary Committee is engaged in a thoughtful, bipartisan effort to reform our criminal justice system and save taxpayers money in the process, it makes no sense to forgo that process for considering this immigration bill.  If we are really trying to make our communities safer, we should listen to the police officers and law enforcement officials who dedicate their lives tothat very mission. We should listen to domestic violence advocates who say the approach in this partisan bill will have a dangerous effect on the lives of women and children at risk. They are telling us this bill will make our communities less safe. It will undermine the trust and cooperation between police officers and immigrant communities. It will damage efforts to prevent crime and weaken their ability to apprehend those who prey on the public. That is why the National Fraternal Order of Police is opposed to policies that would be implemented by this bill. It is why the National Taskforce to End Sexual and Domestic Violence Against Women opposes this bill. It is why the U.S. Conference of Mayors opposes this bill.  I ask unanimous consent that letters from the National Fraternal Order of Police and the National Taskforce to End Sexual and Domestic Violence Against Women be printed in the Record.  I agree with Senator Heller, who noted: ``For two years we haven't had a discussion and so all the sudden we're going to bring up an immigration issue and not talk about the bigger issue.'' The problems plaguing our immigration system demand that we respond thoughtfully and responsibly. We can do better. We owe it to the American public to do better. I urge Senators to vote against cloture on this partisan bill that will not make us safer.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                National Fraternal                                              Order of Police,                                    Washington, DC, July 15, 2015.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Harry M. Reid,     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.     Hon. John A. Boehner,     Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington,          DC.     Hon. Nancy P. Pelosi,     Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell, Mr. Speaker, Senator Reid and      Representative Pelosi: I am writing on behalf of the members      of the Fraternal Order of Police to advise you of our strong      opposition to any amendment or piece of legislation that      would penalize law enforcement agencies by withholding      Federal funding or resources from law enforcement assistance      programs in an effort to coerce a policy change in so-called      ``sanctuary cities.'' This is not meant to be construed as a      position on ``sanctuary cities,'' but rather on the use of      Federal programs as an enforcement mechanism.       Local police departments answer to local civilian      government and it is the local government which enacts      statutes and ordinances in their communities. Law enforcement      officers have no more say in these matters than any other      citizen and, with laws like the Hatch Act in place, it can be      argued they have less. Law enforcement officers do not get to      pick and choose which laws to enforce and must carry out      lawful orders at the direction of their commanders and the      civilian government that employs them. It is wrong and a      gross unfairness to punish these brave men and women, or the      citizens they serve, because Congress disagrees with their      enforcement priorities with respect to our nation's      immigration laws.       The FOP believes very strongly that local police      departments should at all times endeavor to cooperate with      their Federal law enforcement colleagues but they also must      follow the laws and policies of the government that employs      them. It is critical to public safety and national security      that local, State, Federal and tribal law enforcement work      together and rely on the expertise and resources that each      agency brings to the mission. This cannot be achieved if the      Federal government is reducing the resources available to      local law enforcement nor will it aid in cooperative efforts      to address threats to public safety.       For these reasons, the FOP will vigorously oppose any      amendment, bill or other legislative effort which would      reduce or withhold funding or resources from any Federal      program for local and State law enforcement. If Congress      wishes to effect policy changes in these cities, it must find      another way to do so.       On behalf of the more than 330,000 members of the Fraternal      Order of Police, I want to thank you for your consideration      of our view on this issue. Please feel free to contact me or      Executive Director Jim Pasco in my Washington office if I can      be of any further assistance.           Sincerely,                                                 Chuck Canterbury,     National President.                                  ____         National Task Force To End Sexual and Domestic Violence            Against Women,                                                 October 14, 2015.       Dear Senator: As the Steering Committee of the National      Taskforce to End Sexual and Domestic Violence (NTF),      comprising national leadership organizations advocating on      behalf of sexual and domestic violence victims and women's      rights, we represent hundreds of organizations across the      country dedicated to ensuring all survivors of violence      receive the protections they deserve. For this reason, we      write to express our deep concerns about the impact that S.      2146, the ``Stop Sanctuary Policies and Protect Americans      Act,'' will have on communities with ``sanctuary'' policies.      Such legislation will be dangerous for all victims of sexual      assault, domestic violence, and trafficking, and in      particular, for immigrant victims, and communities at large.       S. 2146 undermines policies that local jurisdictions have      determined are Constitutionally sound and appropriate for      their respective communities, and it decreases the ability of      law enforcement agencies to respond to violent crimes and      assist all victims of crime, U.S. Citizens, and immigrants      alike. As recognized in the bipartisan Violence Against Women      Act (VAWA), law enforcement plays a critical role in our      coordinated community response to domestic and sexual      violence. Law enforcement funds support critical training,      equipment, and agency staffing that assists domestic and      sexual violence victims. Provisions in S. 2146 that reduce      funding for law enforcement agencies will allow violent      crimes to go uninvestigated and leave victims without      redress.       In addition, provisions in S. 2146 seek to reduce Community      Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds to communities with      ``sanctuary'' policies, which will harm communities by      reducing access to critical housing and community services      that are accessed by all victims, including both U.S.      Citizens and immigrants.       Community trust policies are critical tools for increasing      community safety. We recently celebrated the twenty-first      anniversary of VAWA, which has, since it was first enacted,      included critical protections for immigrant victims of      domestic and sexual violence. Laws that seek to intertwine      the immigration and law enforcement systems will undermine      the Congressional purpose of protections enacted under VAWA      and will have the chilling effect of pushing immigrant      victims into the shadows and allow criminals to walk on our      streets. As VAWA recognizes, immigrant victims of violent      crimes often do not contact law enforcement due to fear that      they will be deported. According to a study conducted by the      National Domestic Violence Hotline and the National [email protected]      Network: Casa de Esperanza, 45% of the foreign-born callers      expressed fear of calling and/or seeking help from the police      or courts. Furthermore, 12% of US-Born callers expressed fear      of seeking help due to the current wave of anti-immigrant      policies. Immigrants are already afraid of contacting the      police and these policies will only exacerbate this fear.       Perpetrators use fear of deportation as abuse. Local      policies that minimize intertwining of local law enforcement      with ICE help bring the most vulnerable victims out of the      shadows by creating trust between law enforcement and the      immigrant community, which in turn help protect entire      communities. Abusers and traffickers use the fear of      deportation of their victims as a tool to silence and trap      them. Not only are the individual victims harmed, but their      fear of law enforcement leads many to abstain from reporting      violent perpetrators or coming forward, and, as a result,      dangerous criminals are not identified and go unpunished.      These criminals remain on the streets and continue to be a      danger to our communities.       S. 2146's harsh criminal penalties will harm victims of      trafficking, sexual assault, and domestic violence. Immigrant      victims are vulnerable to being arrested and prosecuted for      crimes directly connected to their victimization. For      example, victims of domestic violence are arrested and      convicted of domestic violence related crimes, even when they      are not the primary perpetrator of violence in the      relationship, due to language and cultural barriers. In      addition, victims of sex trafficking are often arrested and      convicted of prostitution-related offenses. Often, victims      are desperate to be released, and in some cases, reunited      with their children upon arrest and/or during trial. These      factors--combined with poor legal counsel, particularly about      the immigration consequences of criminal pleas and      convictions--have in the past and will likely continue to      lead to the deportation of wrongly accused victims who may      have pled to or been unfairly convicted of domestic violence      charges.       For these reasons, we urge you to affirm the intent and      spirit of VAWA and oppose S. 2146 and other similar      legislative proposals that may be introduced. Thank you very      much for taking this important step to protect and support      immigrant survivors of domestic violence, trafficking, and      sexual assault.

Sincerely,     The National Task Force To End Sexual and Domestic Violence.                          ____________________
