President, Senator Kyl opened debate on this amendment last night by noting that when an earlier version of this amendment was offered a few weeks ago to S. 2454, it was a ``somewhat different'' amendment. I understand and appreciate this understatement, but I also appreciate that Senator Kyl and his lead cosponsor Senator, Cornyn, were willing to compromise and make improvements to their original text.  I wish to express my appreciation to the Democratic leader, Senator Reid. He was right to insist that the original version of the Kyl-Cornyn amendment--a much broader version that some Senators wanted to adopt almost immediately when it was introduced a few weeks ago--deserved review and should not be rushed through the Senate to score political points. He was right, as the latest version of the amendment attests. In addition, in the immigration debate prior to the April recess, Senator Durbin recognized and described several drafting flaws in the original amendment that would have swept in hundreds of thousands of immigrants, perhaps unintentionally. With a little time, and thanks to a lot of hard work, the amendment has been significantly changed, narrowed, and improved.  Among the modifications, the amendment now includes a waiver of its provisions. It allows the Secretary of Homeland Security to waive certain conditions of ineligibility to participate in the earned legalization program in title VI of the bill. A negative impact on family members, or humanitarian concerns such as harsh conditions in the immigrant's home country, should allow participation in the earned legalization program. An alien's failure to obey an order of deportation may be based upon the alien's trepidation over leaving behind his U.S. citizen children. An immigrant may have had to use false documents to gain entry into the U.S., such as the case of an asylum seeker who is fleeing persecution.
