 President, 30 years ago, President Lyndon Johnson stated,       The American firefighter today must meet the challenge of      fires caused by numerous new chemicals, explosives, and      combustible fibers, and other dangerous materials. He must be      prepared to fight fires in crowded cities and giant      buildings, as well as in remote rural communities.  Today, we know that these challenges to the fire services have grown considerably. The greatest example, of course, being the tragedy in Oklahoma City.  That is why today, Mr. President, I am honored to pay tribute to Steven P. Austin, who last night at the National Fire and Emergency Services Dinner, was named Fire Service Person of the Year.  Steve Austin serves as chairman of the National Advisory Committee for the Congressional Fire Services Institute, working countless hours to meet the challenges faced by the fire and emergency services. He works diligently helping those who help us in times of crisis.  Steve Austin may remember President Johnson's words back in 1966, because 3 years prior, Steve Austin began his service as a volunteer firefighter. Today, he continues to respond to emergency calls as a member of the Aetna Hose, Hook and Ladder Company of Newark, DE.  Along with his work as chairman and firefighter, Steve Austin, continues to serve as a fire claims superintendent for the State Farm Fire and Casualty Company, external affairs representative for the International Association of Arson Investigators, chairman of the NFPA Technical Committee on Fire Investigator Professional Qualifications, and as a member of the Delaware State Fire Police. In the past, he has been president of the New Castle County Volunteer Firemen's Association and also president of the Delaware Chapter International Association of Arson Investigators.  During his distinguished career, Steve Austin has received the George H. Parker Distinguished Service Award, the Life Membership Award, and the Presidential Award from the International Association of Arson Investigators.  Steve Austin is committed to meeting the new challenges faced by the fire services. I am confident that as long as there are dedicated people like him, the fire service will continue to serve us with the heroism, bravery and professionalism that we have all come to expect. It is an honor to pay tribute to him today as a great leader, a great Delawarean, and a great friend.                          ____________________
