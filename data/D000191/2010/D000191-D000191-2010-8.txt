They acted the way the Senate usually acts when confronted with a problem; they added ornaments to the Christmas tree. They actually increased the cost.  This legislation will cost $858 billion over 2 years. That is bigger than the much-reviled stimulus passed in the beginning of the Obama Presidency: $858 billion. That will add approximately $430 billion a year to the deficit for the next 2 years. That is $430 billion more borrowed, probably from China.  Now, the question is: Is this the best possible use of this money? Will this put America and Americans back towork and get us more firmly on the path to recovery? I think not. I think much of this money is wasted and will create zero jobs.  Now, if you think that the Bush-era tax cuts worked well--they didn't create any jobs, but if for some reason you think they worked well--then you are going to like this. In fact, it is even a bigger giveaway than the Bush-era tax cuts. Or if you think the $300 billion of the so-called stimulus that the President gave away in tax cuts, the Larry Summers tax cuts that were so small that no one would notice and they would just spend them on consumer goods--bad politics, bad economics, didn't put anybody back to work, to get three Republican votes, that is why that $300 billion went in there, and bumped out real investment that would have created immediate and real jobs and long-term benefits--no, instead we had ephemeral spending. That was supposed to put Americans back to work.  If you liked that, you are going to love this. It has new provisions. One, instead of President Obama's ``making work pay'' tax cuts, now we are going to attack Social Security. That is right, the Republicans are getting their dreams here.  We are going to give a tax holiday of 2 percent on Social Security. Isn't that great? It goes to any income level. That means Members of Congress will get a minimum of a $2,100 tax break, as will other people who do very well in this country.  But, don't worry, that that would kind of hurt Social Security, to cut its income by $111 billion next year. It would accelerate the point at which it couldn't pay benefits. But, don't worry, we will borrow the money from China, and we will inject it into the Social Security trust fund, tearing down the firewall between the general fund and Social Security.  Next year the Republicans are going to say to the President, Hey, you can't let that tax cut for working people, that FICA holiday, expire. And, oh, by the way, we can't afford to subsidize Social Security anymore out of the general fund.  This is a trap, and that kind of a tax cut is not going to put people back to work.  Then we have the tax cuts for the upper income, $51 billion for incomes above $250,000. Now, remember, up to $250,000, everybody under what President Obama first proposed would get a tax break. It is only your income over 250 that would be taxed at the Clinton-era rates. And guess what happened during the Clinton era? We balanced the budget, and we created 23 million jobs. Not too bad. Now we have record deficits, and we are creating an anemic number of jobs.  They estimate this package might create between 1 million and 3 million jobs, or save them, or later they will say it could have been worse, just like they did with the stimulus. If we directly invested a fraction of this $858 billion in roads, bridges, highways, sewers, water systems, building schools, things that would pass benefits to future generations, we could create millions of jobs and you would have gotten something for your money, other than current consumption.  Then, how about this new provision, estates over $10 million? Now, the media keeps saying $5 million. No, it is 5 and 5, husband and wife, $10 million of an estate tax-free, and after that a lower tax break. That costs $10 billion a year.  We are going to borrow $10 billion a year, all the American people are going to borrow that money, to give 6,000 families a tax break, who are already doing quite well, thank you very much. How many jobs will that create? Zero. Goose egg. None. It isn't about small business anymore. We are talking estates over $10 million.  Then we are going to continue the Bush-era reductions in capital gains and dividend taxes, which go predominantly to the highest income brackets, under the premise that those things too create jobs. If this is a job creator, it is the least efficient, lamest way to create jobs at unbelievable expense.  If we want to create jobs, there are better ways to do it; or if you want to do the tax relief, you could do it for much less. If you cut out the upper income, over $250,000, the estates over $10 million, look at capital gains, dividends, don't do the FICA tax, or at least cap it so people at levels of Members of Congress don't get it, we could do this for less and put more people to work.                          ____________________
