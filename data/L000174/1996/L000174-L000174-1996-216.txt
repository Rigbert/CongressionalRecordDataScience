President, I cannot support this budget resolution for 1997 fiscal year.  While I am encouraged that the majority was able to moderate their balanced budget plan from last year because of stronger economic estimates from the Congressional Budget Office, this budget resolution still falls short. It cuts Medicare and Medicaid more than is necessary to achieve a balanced budget. And it cuts education and environment funding while increasing defense spending--which is unacceptable in today's post-cold war world.  This Republican budget cuts Medicare by $167 billion, $50 billion more than the President's budget over the next 6 years.
