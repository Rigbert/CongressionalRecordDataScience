Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the 180th Fighter Wing and the 555th Air Force Band (ANG), both stationed in the Ninth Congressional District in Swanton, Ohio. On April 7, 2001, the Air Force awarded the 180th Fighter Wing and the 555th Air Force Band the 2000 Outstanding Unit Award.  This citation recognizes the 180th Fighter Wing for service to America over a two-year span from June 1998 to May 2000. During that time, the brave men and women of this unit twice participated in overseas deployments to enforce the non-fly zone in Northern Iraq. Participating in Operation Northern Watch Joint Task Force based at Incirlik Air Base in Turkey, the unit completed 138 flights, often under hostile fire in the form of Iraqi surface-to-air missiles and anti-aircraft artillery. They successfully destroyed predetermined targets, resulting in a significant reduction of the threat capabilities in Northern Iraq. Moreover, the 180th Fighter Wing led the Ohio and Hungary Partnership for Peace, an initiative aimed at helping the former Soviet Block nation prepare for entry into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The unit trained with the Hungarian Air Force as they adjusted to their new role in the NATO Alliance.  This award, however, recognizes more than just exceptional performance in battle. The Outstanding Unit Award attests to the excellence of this Unit's Standardization and Evaluation, Safety, Health Services, and Environmental Programs. Members of the 180th Fighter Wing and 555th AFB were deployed to Honduras to construct shelters for victims of Hurricane Mitch. Closer to home, they assisted with flood relief along the Ohio River. There, they cleared roads, removed trash and provided safe drinking water to victims. The unit also provided medics and physicians to assist victims as well as performed field media relations, giving citizens time-sensitive information about health, safety and flood cleanup. The 180th later deployed 43 people to Camp Dodge, Iowa to repair several facilities damaged by tornadoes. By using their plumbing, electrical, structural, engineering and heavy machinery skills, the unit saved the Army $160,000 in labor costs--the largest saving by any such group to date.  Finally, I must commend the 180th Fighter Wing and all its members for the community involvement and humanitarian services provided, not just over the last two years, but also throughout its residence in Northwest Ohio. This unit is actively involved in multiple charitable, community and youth programs throughout the region. They have tutored and mentored students at two area schools under the Adopt a School Program, raised funds for Big Brothers/Big Sisters, participated in Operation Feed through the Toledo Seagate FoodBank which donated 4,938 food items and $9,953 through that period, and created an internship program for the Ohio School to Work program.  No doubt: the 180th Fighter Wing and 555th AFB are outstanding in every sense of the word. Whether flying dangerous missions overseas, assisting in disaster relief at home or volunteering free time to teach a child how to read, these men and women perform beyond expectations. Their courage and commitment to the community, as well as their jobs, is unparalleled. We in the 9th Congressional District of Ohio are honored to have such a dedicated, professional and exemplary unit represent our nation here and abroad.                          ____________________
