President, I want to talk about what is happening in regard to mission creep in Bosnia and how that reflects on the hearings that will start very quickly in the Senate in regard to NATO expansion.  Mr. President, when President Woodrow Wilson exhorted Americans to make the world safe for democracy, he did not mean sending U.S. troops to attack foreign television stations and to attempt to try to shut down political speech in other countries. Yet that is exactly what happened last week in Bosnia as NATO troops, or SFOR troops, took over four television transmitters in an effort to control news broadcasts in that shattered region. State Department officials, in declaring victory, pledged to create a system ``free of the monopolizing influence of political parties.'' Let me emphasis that again. Free the system--``free of the monopolizing influence of political parties.'' Then they set about the task of deciding what television content from United States networks might be appropriate for viewing by the citizens of Bosnia--content that is not ``ethnically biased.''  Wrote Lee Hockstader of the Washington Post:       As a result of the seizures of the TV towers, NATO generals      and Western diplomats have cast themselves in the roles of      media executives determined to construct an evenhanded state      television station in a country that has never had one. That      represents a new level of involvement in Bosnia's affairs for      the West * * *  A new level of involvement indeed.  The trouble is, neither the American public nor Congress have been told by President Clinton just what out expectations are in Bosnia. What is our mission? How long will it last? How much will it cost? What will be accomplished? How do we extract out troops from the mess they are in?  None of these questions have been answered.  Is this war? If U.S. troops were involved in a war situation, we could expect media outlets to be military targets.  Is this war? If so, we can expect costs and casualties far beyond what the administration has projected.  Is this war? If so, what national security interests are at stake?  Is this war? If so, our troops cannot be expected to defend their lives with Nielsen ratings.  Mr. President, given this outlandish situation, we are tempted to treat these events as farce:  So when a television station in our home State gives a Senator a rough time, maybe we should call the Marines instead of the news director.  And certainly many Americans would agree they should not be bothered by the ``monopolizing influence of political parties'' during next year's campaign season.  Now we are back to campaign finance reform. But, Mr. President, Bosnia is serious business. Lives are at risk. Regional stability is on the line. We have serious obligations.  A few days ago Congress adopted an important amendment to the Defense appropriations bill, kindly referred to by the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee as the ``Roberts amendment.'' It requires the President to certify to Congress by May 15, 1998, that the continued presence of United States forces in Bosnia is in our national interest and why.  He must state the reasons for our deployment and the expected duration of deployment.  He must provide numbers of troops deployed, estimate the dollar cost involved, and give the effect of such deployment on overall effectiveness of U.S. forces.  Most importantly, the President must provide a clear statement of our mission and out objectives.  And he must provide an exit strategy for bringing our troops home.  If the President does not meet these conditions, funding for military deployment will end next May.  Following our actions against the television stations, Serbian officials warned there would be retaliation. And the New York Times reported that Bosnian Muslims are secretly arming themselves.  A senior NATO commander was quoted, ``The question no longer is if the Muslims will attack the Bosnian Serbs, but when. The only way to prevent such an attack, at this point, is for the peacekeeping mission to extend its mandate.''  Sound familiar. You bet it does.  Extend the mandate--that's mission creep by any name.  And it is the dangerous result of a policy that is lacking in direction, lacking in leadership and lacking in purpose.  The events of the last few days are alarming. They make it more urgent that the administration develop and articulate a course of action that is based on sound policy.  Taking over TV transmitters? Trying to figure out on an even basis what should be programmed, what the people of Bosnia should hear and listen to?  I suggested to one of my colleagues that if we had a choice of programs we should put ``Gunsmoke,'' which is a favorite TV show of mine, on the Bosnian TV stations. I don't know what would be the opposing viewpoint. Maybe ``Natural Born Killers'' could be posed for some of the people who have been convicted or who have been indicted under the war crimes trials. Maybe in terms of programming we could decide on old newsreels of Tito. Maybe that would do some good.  This is incredible in terms of taking over the TV transmitters.  We need hard answers on Bosnia.  We need direction.  We don't need Nielsen ratings.  In that regard, I thank my colleague from Texas for bringing up this special time for us to consider how Bosnia also segues in our decision in regard to NATO expansion.  However, with all due respect to former Ambassador Richard Holbrook and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, there is not much support for American military presence in Bosnia in Dodge City, KS, where ``Gunsmoke'' came from. Now, the question is, are the American people willing to commit to additional military responsibilities called for under article 5 of the NATO Charter, and at what cost? Will they support a commitment to the Czech Republic? How about Slovakia or Slovenia or perhaps Macedonia?  When I went over during the August break to visit our troops in Bosnia, our intelligence officials and others in that part of Central Europe, here came the folks from Macedonia wanting to be included in NATO expansion. Some 20 Senators, myself included, following the leadership of the distinguished Senator from Texas, asked that question and 10 others in a letter to the President prior to Madrid. With many Senators listed as skeptical or undecided, clearly I think the hard questions must be asked in full.  Simply put, to bring NATO expansion into focus, I think President Clinton must become engaged. In Warsaw, St. Petersburg, and in Bucharest, he addressed general European security concerns but he has not made a case to the Congress and to the American people. As a matter of fact, in remarks during his European trip, the President said in the post-Soviet era, military matters are no longer primary, that terrorism, illegal drugs, national extremism, regional conflicts due to ethnic, racial, and religious hatreds do matter. I can assure you using an expanded NATO to address these concerns raises more questions than answers.  What means would be used? Warplanes, ground forces, and naval power are of little use in fighting ethnic hatred and racism. If NATO membership reduces the threat of ethnic rivalries, somebody should tell that to the Protestants and Catholics of Northern Ireland, the Basques in Spain, and the Kurds in Turkey.  Do we really want to change the most successful security alliance in history to a European United Nations? With 16 NATO members and 28 other nations inaugurating the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, the protocol rituals and welcoming speeches left no time for any serious discussion. The meeting was over.  And, I must say while I understand the personal and emotional feelings that all freedom loving people feel when visiting Prague, Warsaw, and Budapest, I do not think NATO expansion will right the wrongs of Yalta nor do I agree that raising serious questions about NATO expansion represents the echoes of Munich as some in the administration have charged. To characterize serious critics as appeasers or isolationists sets needed debate off on entirely the wrong foot.  Let me emphasize my reservations are not a reflection on the potential new members or their worthiness to join the alliance. I am extremely impressed with the success of the nations of Eastern Europe and their dramatic move toward democracy.  Let me share some of my major concerns.  Without argument NATO has been the most successful alliance in history. Likewise, most will agree that chief among the reasons for NATO's success is the fact that it is a military alliance comprised of like-minded nations focused against a common threat. As we know, in the past the security threat was the Soviet Union and the nations of the Warsaw Pact.  Today, however, that threat is vastly diminished--some would say gone. With the Warsaw Pact now history, there certainly is no clear threat to the survival of Europe on the horizon.  Certainly there are concerns for stability in Europe such as we have witnessed in Bosnia and in Albania. But do we need to fundamentally alter the structure of this very successful alliance to insure stability in Europe? Will the results of our actions be to turn a superb military alliance into a political alliance with diminished military capability? If we do, will NATO survive?  Let me stress we have vital interests in maintaining a healthy and stable Europe. That's not the question. Europe's continued peace is vital. But is enlargement of NATO necessary to achieve that goal?                  Why it is necessary to enlarge NATO?  The proponents state the reasons for enlargement include, preventing a power vacuum from developing in Eastern Europe and promoting total European stability by reducing in risk of instability in Europe's eastern half. The concern appears to be if NATO does not offer membership, the countries of Eastern Europe will founder, will not become fully developed Democratic states, or will become embroiled in ethnic or nationalistic disputes based on historic rivalries like we see in Bosnia. Worse, this theory holds, they will again become part, either voluntarily or forced, of an alliance with a resurgent Russia.  The Clinton administration has steadfastly maintained the position that a stable Europe will be no threat to Russia and in fact will increase the security of Russia. However, the Russians do not see it that way and have consistently stated they are opposed to NATO expansion for national security concerns.  Part of the ``why enlarge NATO'' question should be the timing of such an enlargement. Unfortunately, part of the motivation of the timing of this venture is to have the first new members join at the same time as the 50th anniversary of NATO. Let me say again, we are thinking about altering NATO, fundamentally realigning our relations with Europe, risking our resources and committing our military for questionable national interests and basing the timing of such an important event on the 50th anniversary of NATO.  Mr. President, that is public relations. It is not foreign policy.  What are the alternatives to NATO enlargement? Perhaps an enhanced Partnership for Peace would provide the desired stability and military security in Eastern Europe instead of membership in NATO. Perhaps membership in the European Union, coupled with Partnership for Peace, would allow continued development of Democratic systems in Eastern European nations. Those alternatives should be part of the national debate.  Let's take a look at the cost of all of this. What are the costs of NATO enlargement? I am concerned with the widely varying values and assumptions used to arrive at the U.S. portions of the bill for enlargement. Since the Madrid Summit, it is clear that our allies are not on board for sharing costs of enlargement. Until this plan for sharing is established and agreed to, how can we know what our actual costs will be and why we should proceed? If our allies refuse to carry what we feel is their fair share, given our defense responsibilities, will the United States pay more? And, if so, asking American taxpayers to up the ante would be most difficult.  Just as we have seen in the Bosnian operation, unexpected funding for DOD has directly affected the much-needed military modernization and procurement programs. Why should we be willing to risk the future of our military capability in defending our vital national interests by rushing into NATO enlargement without confidently knowing, in great detail, the costs associated with the enlargement and what our allies and the new members will and are capable of funding.  What will be the Russian reaction to NATO enlargement? Mr. President, just yesterday Susan Eisenhower and several distinguished foreign policy experts came to the Senate and testified before myself and Senator Sessions and Senator Collins and Senator Stevens and others as to why they felt NATO enlargement was the wrong step at the wrong time.  The most important concern that must be well understood is the reaction of the Government of Russia to the enlargement of NATO. If we get this wrong, the need for enlargement will be self-fulfilling and we will again need a strong military alliance facing east. We are in danger of awakening the Russian bear, not taming him and putting him in a cage.  Aleksei Arbatrov, the deputy chairman of the Russian Parliament's defense committee, was recently quoted as saying that the way in which an expanded NATO was imposed on the Russians ``was a shock for those trying to improve relations.'' He added there ``was a widespread feeling of betrayal among Russian Democrats.''  Mr. Arbatrov predicted Russia could turn to a strategy of first-strike nuclear capability to combat what is perceived as a NATO threat on its doorstep.  ``There is no chance whatsoever'' that Russia's Parliament would ratify START II or START III, Mr. Arbatrov said.  I know that the Russians have joined the Partnership for Peace, signed the Founding Act, and have been officially quiet, semiquiet, about three potential new NATO members. However, there can be no doubt that all factions of the Russian political system are opposed to the expansion. What they see is a military alliance moving eastward, ever closer to their borders.  We cannot allow Russia to dictate our actions or the actions of NATO. Let that be perfectly clear. But it would be most dangerous to embark on such an important foreign policy matter as NATO enlargement without fully understanding or accounting for the Russian concerns. That is what Susan Eisenhower stated. That is what the other foreign experts stated.  Why are the Baltic States and NATO such a sensitive issue to Russia? There are at least two reasons. Addition of the Baltics would move NATO's borders to Russia, and a section of Russian territory, including the city of Kalinningrad, would be completely surrounded by NATO.  When asked about the Russian reaction to the addition of the Baltics to NATO, the Russian Ambassador to the United States said ``the reaction would be fierce.'' Even with this understanding of the potential reaction by Russia, the administration continues to insist the Baltic States are likely to be asked to join in the next round.  I remain concerned we are approaching the Russian issue, Mr. President, with much bravado and arrogance with our fingers crossed behind our back.  Although I consider these three areas--why enlarge? what is the cost? and what will be the reaction of Russia?--to be the most critical, there are other areas of significant importance that must be part of the debate, Mr. President. I look forward to discussing these three and the others in detail in the coming months. NATO enlargement is the most important foreign policy and military decision the United States will make or has made for many years. We must make the right decision.  And again, Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Texas for leading the charge in asking the right questions, the complex questions that must be asked before the Senate considers either in committee or in the Chamber later the ratification of NATO.  Mr. President, may I ask how much time I have consumed of the 25 minutes that was yielded to me?
