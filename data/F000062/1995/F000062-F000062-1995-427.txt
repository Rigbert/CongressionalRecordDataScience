 It is a big-ticket item for working Americans. Because it goes into a trust fund--and this trust fund is like an annuity. It is like buying an insurance policy. What you put in you [[Page S2551]] believe you will get back when you retire--we should protect that trust fund. We should protect that annuity.  The Reid amendment protects that trust fund and protects that annuity, and I am proud to support it and vote for it.  The vote on this issue will be very close. The balanced budget amendment may have 67 votes without the Reid amendment. It may not.  There is, however, enough support in this body to pass a balanced budget amendment with Social Security excluded. So if my colleagues want to take a gamble to try to pass a balanced budget amendment without the Reid amendment because they want to misuse Social Security funds, they can do that. But, they have an opportunity to pass a real and honest constitutional balanced budget amendment that protects Social Security. I know this Senate could pass it, and I hope it does. It will be nobody's fault, but their own if the constitutional amendment goes down because they took this gamble.  Finally, I want to address my remarks to the concern that just came up about section 2 in the budget report. It was the argument made by the distinguished Senator from Florida. That budget report, right in the very beginning of section 2, points out that to utilize funds from Social Security for purposes of this amendment would only take a majority vote. Votes for other than this program would take a three-fifths vote.  To run a deficit, the Federal Government must borrow funds to cover its obligations. Section 2 removes the borrowing power from the Government, unless three-fifths of the total membership of both Houses vote to raise the debt limit.  However, the point that was made by Senator Graham, which is well taken, is that in the case of Social Security this vote would be a simple majority. That is wrong.  To sum up, I would like to commend the Senator from Nevada. I would like to commend the coauthors of this amendment. Many of us have said, if the Reid amendment is agreed to, we will vote for a balanced budget amendment. We have said so for good and just reasons. There is a need for the castor oil of a constitutional amendment to force the body to do some of the things it has been loath to do.  However, without the Social Security amendment, I believe the balanced budget amendment is, indeed, a slippery and treacherous slope. I believe it jeopardizes the retirements of future generations and it jeopardizes a trust that these bodies have put in place with purpose and with specific financing. We should not do that. We should not break that trust with the American people.  I yield the floor.                               Exhibit 1         National Committee to Preserve Social Security and            Medicare,                                                 February 1, 1995.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am writing with regard to S. 290,      introduced recently by Senators Kempthorne, Dole, Thompson      and Inhofe. The fact that the sponsors of S. 290 believe that      it is necessary to take action to protect Social Security      under a balanced budget amendment is, in my view, proof that      it is imperative that the Senate adopt your amendment to      exclude Social Security from the balanced budget amendment.       The pending balanced budget amendment reverses the 1990 law      removing Social Security from a consolidated budget and puts      Social Security back on budget as part of the Constitution.      This presents serious problems for Social Security which      cannot be addressed by S. 290 or any statutory measure. The      sponsors of S. 290 cannot bind future Congresses to their      legislation, or for that matter ensure that this Congress      will not modify or overturn this legislation while Social      Security would remain on budget as part of the Constitution.      I also note that while S. 290 attempts to prohibit Congress      from increasing Social Security revenues or reducing benefits      to balance the budget, it will allow Congress to continue      using the surplus in the Social Security trust funds to      conceal the deficit. This only confirms our understanding      that the proponents of the balanced budget amendment intend      to continue this budgetary charade thereby avoiding balancing      the budget until will into the next century.       The nearly six million members and supporters of the      National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare      strongly oppose this practice of using the surplus generated      by the Social Security payroll tax to fund deficit reduction      or mask the true size of the general fund deficit.       Let's not forget that the continued borrowing from the      Social Security trust funds will only create huge debts for      the next generation which will be forced to redeem the bonds      through massive tax increases.       The only way for proponents of the balanced budget      amendment to live up to the many promises not to harm or      undermine Social Security is to explicitly exclude it from      the text of S.J. Res 1.           Sincerely,                                                Martha A. McSteen,                                                        President.
