 Taking Social Security off budget will require about $3 trillion more in spending cuts by the year 2017. However, the alternative of leaving Social Security on budget allows Social Security funds to be stolen to avoid spending cuts. When the baby-boomer generation begins to retire, there will not be any funds available for them to collect.  In order to address this valid concern, I believe a capital budget should be established to assure continued Federal investments in major public physical assets. Instituting a capital budget would more than offset the effects of moving Social Security from the budget. However, I was not permitted to offer this alternative. I was hoping that we would have been able to vote on this alternative. However, the Senate was denied that opportunity by an [[Page S3239]] objection from the other side of the aisle. It is rather ironic--we are considering amending our Constitution--the great protector of free speech--and my speech was stifled, squashed, and censored.  In conclusion, I do not believe that the working men and women of this country are well served if we take the FICA tax moneys that they believe will be available for their retirements and use them to balance the budget. That is wrong. It is dishonest. It masks the debt. It betrays people. And it jeopardizes the retirements of future generations. I will not break the trust of the American people.  I urge my fellow Senators to vote for this honest balanced budget amendment. I want to see a balanced budget amendment pass this Senate.  This amendment can pass--there are enough Senators in this body who support a balanced budget amendment to pass this version.  However, if Senators wish to gamble in an attempt to gather enough votes for House Joint Resolution 1, they can.  I, for one, do not wish to take that risk.  I will vote for this honest balanced budget amendment.
