Speaker, I have never been hesitant to work with any Member, Republican or Democrat, to get things done for our country. I count good friends on both sides of the aisle. To me, this vote is not about politics, it is about respect, integrity, our laws and, yes, the Constitution.  One of the highlights of my life was serving in the White House. There was never a time that I have not had the greatest respect for the office of the President.  Etched in the marble fireplace under President Lincoln's portrait in the White House is a quote taken from a letter written by President Adams to his wife Abigail in 1801. It reads, I pray heaven to bestow the best of blessings on this House and on all that hereafter inhabit it. May none but honest and wise men ever rule under this roof.  We have millions of public servants in this land, some serve as governors, some as legislators or school board members. In every one of those roles, we will never agree always on the best course that they choose for our Nation or community. But as Americans we need to respect them and their decisions. That is what our democracy is all about. The key bedrock of every public official is their oath of office. Integrity does count. I do not know of a single Michigan community that would tolerate a public official violating that oath. The charges and evidence contained in these articles are indeed most serious. Perjury to a grand jury, obstruction of justice, what kind of message do we send to America if we set a lower standard for the highest public official in this land?  You have to tell the truth, even when it is not easy, even when it is not convenient. That is the basic tenet and foundation of our society.  The question for us today is whether there is enough evidence for us to try this case in the Senate. I believe that there is sufficient evidence, and I will vote to impeach the President with a clear conscience.
