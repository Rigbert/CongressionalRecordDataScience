 President, we had this constitutional amendment before us in 1997. It only got 38 votes, and it takes 67 votes to change the constitution. Frankly, I am surprised it even got 38 votes. This amendment would essentially repeal a major part of the First Amendment. The Bill of Rights has protected our free speech for over 200 years. We do not need to begin eviscerating it now.  The Washington Post opposes this amendment. Common Cause opposes this amendment. The distinguished Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Feingold, and others oppose this amendment. This amendment is simply a very bad idea.  I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Utah, Mr. Bennett.
