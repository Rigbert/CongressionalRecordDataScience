Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Ms. Ruth Riley, who served as my district scheduler for 16 years.  It is hard to believe how quickly time passes, and throughout the years Ruth remains consistent and constant with a warmth and grace, which endears her to all. A daughter of Ohio and a proud political science graduate of the University of Cincinnati, Ms. Riley moved to Atlanta to pursue a promising career in the private sector. In 2001, I invited her to join my Atlanta staff in the trusted position of serving as the district scheduler.  As you well know, Mr. Speaker, scheduling is one of the most challenging and key positions in any congressional office. This is especially true in Georgia's diverse and vibrant Fifth Congressional District. Every year, Ms. Riley works with me to review thousands of requests. In fact, there are more invitations for speeches, visits, and tours in Georgia's Fifth Congressional District and the State of Georgia, than there are days in the year. It is never-ending work.  Within our office, Ruth plays a critical role through a brand and perspective that is uniquely her own. As a result, many staff seek her counsel and comfort on difficult days. We all appreciate Ruth's vibrant, work-life balance and love of life and art. Many know her appreciation of photography as a shutterbug enthusiast, passion for beauty as a licensed esthetician, and commitment to service through the Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc.  I know Ms. Riley's family and friends play a critical role in supporting and shaping this dynamic woman, and I personally believe the cherished memories of Ruth's beloved grandmother, Ms. V. Blondell Pryor, contribute to her work ethic and kindness. For these reasons, Mr. Speaker, I am particularly grateful to her family--especially her husband, James Preston Riley, Jr.; beautiful children--James Heru Thornton Riley, III, David Nkosi Erskine Riley, II, and Langston Amon Pryor Riley; and mother--Sandra Elizabeth Fletcher.  Perhaps most importantly, Ms. Riley is a constant champion and advocate for each and every person; she treats everyone with a distinct professionalism, courtesy, and compassion, which reflect her corporate experience and commitment to the principles of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s vision of the Beloved Community. Ruth remains committed to protecting the principles of democracy and ensuring the access of the people to their elected representative.  It is for these reasons that I thank Ms. Ruth Riley for her trust, service, and commitment to my office and the people we serve.                          ____________________
