Speaker, further reserving the right to object, I thank the gentleman for his comments on that. As he knows, we were hopeful that perhaps we could get a matter that was of some controversy last night out of the way. If the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Weldon) gets here in the next few seconds, and I am hoping to see him come through the door because, happily, we have resolved that issue, I think, on both sides with all the relevant parties.  I know the gentleman is on his way. He will be here in a second I am told by his advance person.
