 President, if I could have a moment to respond to the Senator from Virginia.  Thank you very much for giving it the thought that I know the Senator will give it and the explanation the Senator will give. I would particularly like to have the Senator comment, as the Senator thinks about it, on what Marine Corps General Sheehan has said and written about. I have quoted him, but he has also published, as well, in one of the defense publications on a longer basis than what I quoted. I think he ought to have considerable credibility in this area, because he is making the same criticisms.  Second, I am not sure I can be here, and I do not have to be here, but if the Senator will notify me when the Senator will be on the floor to respond, I would appreciate that.
