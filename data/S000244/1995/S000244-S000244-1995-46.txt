Chairman, I am shocked at listening to the argument from the gentleman from North Carolina [Mr. Watt] and the gentleman from Texas [Mr. Doggett]. That was the same argument that was used 30 years ago in this Chamber by those who were opposed to the civil rights legislation that revolutionized our society.  [[Page H2935]] This Congress, 30 years ago used the commerce clause for passing the Civil Rights Act of 1964, one which opened up public accommodations, lunch counters, mom and pop cafes, local city buses to people of all races without discrimination. And that is one of the things that this Congress can take pride in doing.  What we are proposing to do here is to use the commerce clause for something that is just as much interstate commerce as the civil rights legislation. And that is to try to have a uniform standard throughout the country on punitive damages so that there will not be forum shopping in a State that has a lower standard on what has to be proven in order to get punitive damages.  There are a number of States that have adopted the clear and convincing standard, including California, and Colorado has adopted the beyond a reasonable doubt standard for punitive damages.  What will happen in the States that have adopted a higher standard than preponderance of the evidence is that those manufacturers will end up paying much higher product liability insurance premiums even though the people in that State will not be able to enjoy what they are paying for.                              {time}  1530  Consequently, you are going to be seeing people in California, which has passed a clear and convincing evidence standard, through their higher consumer prices, benefiting the people in the other States that have not. This issue should be federalized, and the amendment should be defeated.
