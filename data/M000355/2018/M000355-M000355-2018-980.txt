 President, I would like to take a moment to congratulate Alan Watts, an indispensable broadcaster in western Kentucky, who will soon celebrate his 25th year with WKDZ/WHVO Radio in Cadiz. When the listeners of Caldwell, Christian, Lyon, Todd, and Trigg Counties tune in for the news, a trusted voice provides them with the information important to their lives.  Even before he graduated from high school, radio broadcasting had piqued Alan's interest. He worked part-time at WHOP in Hopkinsville through college, and he proudly remembers that his news career began when he attended a rally featuring Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush.  Alan's time at WKDZ began in 1993 not with a formal contract, but rather with a handwritten agreement with the owner, D.J. Everett. He started by answering phones, writing stories on an electric typewriter, and delivering the weekend news. As the station has grown and expanded during the last 25 years, Alan has taken on more responsibility and has become a well-known local figure.  On weekdays at 5 a.m., Alan goes on air for his ``Morning Ag Report.'' The program debuted in 2008 with the mission to tell the southern Pennyrile region's agriculture story. In his own words, ``Each morning I start my day at 3 with a much-needed cup of coffee and a fresh outlook on life.'' Bringing the latest news to farm families, Alan and his team have earned the strong support of the community, but he doesn't sign off after a single program. Alan also hosts the ``WKDZ Country Club'' program for 3 hours, sharing news and local events and hosting a number of guests. It is his way to help listeners throughout the region begin their day.  As if 4 hours of daily broadcast weren't enough, Alan doesn't stop there. This January, he became the host of the Kentucky Farm Bureau's ``Across Kentucky'' program that airs on more than 140 radio stations across the Commonwealth. He is also a frequent guest on RDF-TV, the first 24-hour TV network with programming focused on agribusiness and rural lifestyles. Winning such praise as the 2007 Kentucky Farm Bureau Communications Award and the 2018 Christian County Friend of Agriculture, Alan has clearly earned the respect of his listeners and his peers.  I have enjoyed my many opportunities to join Alan's program over the phone, in studio, and here in my office in the U.S. Capitol. Covering everything from farm bills to tax reform and the Supreme Court, we have discussed the issues that are important to western Kentucky. When I join his show, I know that my constituents in the region are listening.  I would like to thank Alan for his years of dedication to his agricultural community and, once again, to congratulate him on this milestone accomplishment. As he continues his impressive career, I send my best wishes to him, his wife, Susan, and their daughter Jennie. I urge my Senate colleagues to join me.  Mr. President, the Kentucky New Era recently published a profile on Alan's career. I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Kentucky New Era, June 20, 2018]   Alan Watts: Interviews Behind the Camera Set Stage for Career in                               Broadcasting                          (By Tonya S. Grace)       As a youngster, Alan Watts used to go to LaFayette and drop      into Jimmy Landers' general store.       He recalls the seeds, which, much like the familiar penny      candy sought by eager kids in past decades, were scooped up      by the pound by families who bought them for planting on the      farm.       ``Jimmy Landers had a store (where you) dipped seeds out of      a bucket,'' remembers Watts, a Herndon farm kid who grew up      to become the news and farm director at WKDZ/WHVO Radio in      Cadiz. ``He had a dipper, and you would dip out however much      you wanted, a pound or whatever.''       Landers operated his store until 2003.       Five years later, Watts' Morning Ag Report debuted on the      air, and it has gained a following of folks as nearby as      Christian and Trigg counties, as far away as Stewart and      Montgomery counties in Tennessee.       Now a resident of PeeDee in south Christian County, Watts      has made a living apart from his life on the family farm; in      almost three decades in broadcast journalism, he's seen four      presidents in person, met Fox news journalist Geraldo Rivera      (a tiny little guy, Watts says) and followed his fellow      broadcaster and late mentor Dink Embry into the Washington,      D.C.,-based National Association of Farm Broadcasting.       Only 150 or so people are members of the organization whose      programs and services promote agriculture throughout the      country,     and Watts says he is honored to be counted among their ranks.       He considers the countless people whose stories he has      shared with his broadcast audiences through the years and      says it is those stories about people that he enjoys the most      about what he does.       ``I really care about the people I talk about and the      people I do stories on,'' notes Watts, who celebrates his      25th year with WKDZ come August. ``I really love to tell the      story of people. It's nothing about me, but about the people      you meet, the average common people who are wonderful      people.''       Some of the stories hurt, the one about the murders of      three children in 2008 in Roaring Springs, for example, or      more recently, about the murders four years ago of Trigg      Countian Lindsey Champion, his wife and daughter.       Champion had been a listener as well as a guest of Watts'      Morning Ag Report and was just ``a genuinely nice man,''      Watts recalls, He has fond memories of Champion, who had been      retired from the Farm Credit Services office in Hopkinsville      and was active in his family's Champion Farms in Cadiz.       Through the years, Watts has gained an affinity, a      closeness, with the people he speaks with in his capacity as      a broadcaster, the folks who are the subjects of the stories      that are his livelihood. There are those who know him even      though he may actually have never met them before, Watts      muses.       Worth it every day.       They feel like they're a part of my life and I'm a part of      their life,'' observes Watts, who is the second-longest      tenured employee at WKDZ. ``And that's what makes it worth it      every day.''       Seated recently inside the studios at the Cadiz station,      Watts recalls how Embry, a longtime radio man at WHOP in      Hopkinsville, and colleague Bob McGaughey at rival WKOA,      first piqued his interest in the medium. The older men      frequently interviewed Watts, then a teenager showing his      family's cattle and sheep at the Western Kentucky State Fair,      for their farm programs.       Watts found the process an intriguing one       ``Where I really got my interest was watching Dink Embry,''      Watts explains. ``What Dink Embry did on the radio fascinated      me.''       He eventually began hanging out with Embry, helped him set      up equipment and ``enjoyed seeing what was going on and      learning from him.''       He began working part-time at WHOP in 1985 or 1986,      conducting farm interviews for the station. Graduating from      high school in 1986, he went on to Hopkinsville Community      College before transferring to Western Kentucky University in      Bowling Green, where he received a degree in mass      communications with a minor in animal science. Were it not      for radio, Watts says, a career in animal genetics would have      captured his attention.       He continued to work at WHOP throughout college and, after      graduating in 1990, began his career with the station,      working as a disc jockey and announcer. For a brief time, he      left radio for the insurance business.       But he discovered sales was not for him and so, in 1993,      Embry made a phone call on Watts' behalf and spoke with owner      D.J. Everett at WKDZ.       Watts came on board in August of that same year, just four      months after Cindy Allen Lax, who is now the station's senior      marketing specialist.       Watts says he likely is one of the few people who do not      have a contract.       ``D.J, never had me sign a contract,'' he recalls of the      agreement handwritten on a piece of paper that signified his      hiring at the radio station.       Everett, he notes, had great expectations of his new      employee and was tough, but he also became a great friend and      mentor to Watts. From Everett, Watts learned a ``tremendous      amount of knowledge'' that taught him how to look for news,      how to gather it and how to report the news to listeners.       In his early days with the station, Watts wrote his news on      a typewriter in the newsroom, and, at a time when the station      had only four employees, he also helped answer the telephones      and did things in the business office.       ``In those days, you did everything,'' Watts recalls.       Agriculture is big.       At the time, he said he didn't address agriculture much but      did incorporate it into his regular newscasts, something he      made a point of doing because ``agriculture is such a big      industry here,'' he explains.       In 2007, Watts received the Kentucky Farm Bureau      Communications Award, recognizing his efforts to highlight      the work that farmers do while also helping others understand      the importance of agriculture.       His Morning Ag Report with Alan Watts began the following      year, its beginnings taking shape with the germ of an idea      after he attended a meeting.       The Ag Edge website was developed not long after the      morning show.       Watts and David Fourqurean, an ag extension agent in McLean      County, were returning from a Farm Bureau meeting, and Watts      decided WKDZ should do something, given agriculture's impact      in the area and his knowledge of it.       The program airs from 5 to 6 a.m. Monday through Friday.       Fourqurean and other agents have been frequent guests on      the popular program. Watts interviews local farmers, features      agriculture-related things going on in the community and      highlights other current news events.       People comment about how the program reminds them of      growing up on the farm, and they talk about how much they      enjoy the conversation.       Watts is mindful of listeners who live on the farm and      elsewhere, and for those who are not involved in agriculture,      there's a need to explain what that load of tobacco they're      following down the highway means to them, he notes.       This past January Watts saw President Donald J. Trump when      the president was a featured speaker at the American Farm      Bureau Federation's annual convention in Nashville; Trump was      interesting to see, noted Watts, who said the president      connected so well with his rural audience on that day.       ``He reminded me a lot of (former President Ronald) Reagan,      with less finesse,'' Watts said of the 40th president known      as ``the great communicator.''       Watts saw Reagan speak at Western's Diddle Arena, and he      recalled the president's reaction when a balloon popped      during his presentation.       Reagan, who was shot by attempted assassin John Hinckley      Jr. in 1981, ducked upon hearing the noise and called out      ``Oh, you missed me.''       In the ensuing years, Watts also saw former presidents      Barack Obama and George W. Bush and interviewed former U.S.      Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack, These days, Watts is a      frequent guest on RFD-TV, where he shares what is going on in      agriculture in western Kentucky with viewers.       He has taken over as host and producer of Kentucky Farm      Bureau's ``Across Kentucky'' broadcast and, in Cadiz, he co-     hosts the Trigg County Farm Tour.       Earlier this year, Watts was named the 2018 Christian      County Friend of Agriculture by the Christian County      Agribusiness Association.       He notes that there are so many neat people to meet in      agriculture, and Watts, who rises early every morning to      prepare for his Morning Ag Report, declares that he looks      forward to those early mornings every day.       ``I don't think there's anything I'd rather do,'' he says      of his love of agriculture and of the people he meets in his      local community. ``It's still fun and exciting every day.''       Watts and his wife Susan Watts have a daughter, 10-year-old      Jennie Watts, who continues to work on her family's farm in      south Christian County.                          ____________________
