Speaker, reserving the right to object--and I do not intend to object--I want to thank the majority leader. I personally, as a former majority leader, appreciate the policy enunciated by the Speaker in turn to accommodate Members' schedules so that we vote on time. But this was an extraordinarily important vote. Large numbers of Members of both sides missed it, and I very much appreciate the majority leader's action and the Speaker's agreement to it to accommodate our Members so that, on this important bill, they will be able to vote on the 26th.  Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my reservation of objection.
