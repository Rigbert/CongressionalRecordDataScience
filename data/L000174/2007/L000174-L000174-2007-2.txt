President, I would like to bring to the attention of the Senate an article by Rabbi Michael Cohen who is director of special projects at the Arava Institute for Environmental Studies. Rabbi Cohen recently submitted the article entitled ``The Genesis of Diversity'' to the New York Times. In this article, Rabbi Cohen eloquently reminds us that environmental and biological diversity is not simply a thought or something we simply sit back and observe. Rather we are constant participants in the act of diversity and as such it is our responsibility as human beings to protect our environment. This article serves as a reminder of the importance of preserving environmental and biological diversity during this holiday season.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Rabbi Michael M. Cohen's article entitled ``The Genesis of Diversity'' be printed in the Congressional Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                        The Genesis of Diversity                        (By Rabbi Michael Cohen)       In 1968 Hanukkah and Ramadan ended on the same date. The      next day was Christmas Eve. That evening, one quarter of the      world's population saw, for the first time, images taken by      the Apollo 8 astronauts of the earth from a lunar orbit. The      earth, a beautifully colored marble ball floating across the      black backdrop of the universe, also looked lonely and      vulnerable. Those pictures captured the imagination of the      world, triggering something in the consciousness of humanity      that gave birth to the environmental movement and, two years      later, the first Earth Day.       To frame that moment, a shared historic moment that would      transcend all the divisions of the world, the Apollo 8 crew      read from the beginning of the Bible, the first ten lines      from the Book of Genesis. The opening chapters of Genesis not      only include the account of the creation of the earth but      over and over tell us of the importance of diversity.       All of creation is called ``good,'' reminding us of the      value of the multiplicity of the world that we live in. The      text also teaches us, by describing everything that is      created before humans as ``good,'' that all things have      intrinsic value in and of themselves beyond any value that we      may place on them. Once humans are created, ``very good'' is      the adjective applied by the text. An anthropocentric reading      of the text would say this is because the world was created      for our needs, and once we are in place we can do what we      want with the world. A biocentric reading of the text says      that ``very good'' only means that creation as described      in the text was complete, and that we humans were the last      piece of the biological puzzle.       This reading is supported by the reality that if humans      were to disappear from the face of the earth all that had      been created before us would go on quite well, actually      better, without our presence. However, if a strata of the      diversity of life that had been created before humans were to      disappear, we, and all that had been created after it, would      no longer exist. In a bit of Heavenly humor on Darwin's      survival of the fittest, it is actually the smallest and      least physically strong species, like the butterflies, bees,      and amoebas, that hold the survival of the world in place.      Unlike the other species of the planet, we have the power to      commit biocide if we do not protect and preserve those      smaller forms of life.       The importance of diversity is emphasized a few chapters      later, in the story of Noah, where Noah is told to bring      pairs of each species onto the ark so that after the flood      they can replenish the earth. After the flood, God places a      rainbow in the sky as a reminder to never again destroy the      world. It is both a symbol and a metaphor: a single ray of      light refracted through water, the basic source of all life,      produces a prism of colors. As with the Creation story, we      are again reminded that the foundation of diversity is that      we all come from one source. On its most profound level, this      understanding should give us all the awareness that we have a      relationship with and are connected to the rest of humanity      and creation.       Immediately following the story of Noah we read about the      Tower of Babel. The whole account takes up only nine verses.      The conventional reading is that its message is one against      diversity; the babel of languages at the end of the story is      understood as a punishment. The Israeli philosopher Yeshayahu      Leibowitz presents a different reading of the text. For      Leibowitz, Babel represents a fascist totalitarian state      where the aims of the state are valued more than the      individual. In such a society, diverse thought and expression      is frowned upon. The text tells us that everyone ``had the      same language, and the same words.''       We read in the genealogies that link the Noah and Babel      stories that the ``nations were divided by their lands, each      one with its own language, according to their clans, by their      nations.'' Leibowitz sees the babel of languages not as a      punishment but a corrective return to how things had been and      were supposed to be.       That is still our challenge today. Diversity is not a      liberal value; it is the way of the world. We know that the      environment outside of our human lives is healthier with      greater diversity, coral reefs and rain forests being prime      examples. It is also true for humanity. We are better off      because of the different religions, nations, cultures, and      languages that comprise the human family. The Irish Potato      Famine was caused because only one variety of potato was      planted. Without diverse crops, the disease spread easily      on a large and deadly scale.       In one of his State of the Union addresses, former      President Bill Clinton said, ``This fall, at the White House,      one of America's leading scientists said something we should      all remember. He said all human beings, genetically, are 99.9      percent the same. So modern science affirms what ancient      faith has always taught: the most important fact of life is      our common humanity. Therefore, we must do more than tolerate      diversity--we must honor and celebrate it.''       The opening of the Bible understands diversity not as a      noun but as a verb; diversity is the basic action for life as      we know it on this planet. Its importance is underscored by      the fact that three accounts in its opening chapters      highlight diversity as a foundation of the world we live in.      Such an orientation is essential for our survival as a      species.                          ____________________
