Mr. Speaker, today I am pleased to introduce legislation which will enable Alaska Native Settlement Trusts to achieve the goals envisioned for them by the Congress in the original authorizing legislation: to encourage Alaska Native Corporation to use their own assets to provide segregated, protected funds to ``promote the health, education, and welfare of . . . (Settlement Trust) beneficiaries and preserve the heritage and culture of Natives.'' Settlement trusts have been impeded from achieving the laudatory goals originally envisaged because of deficiencies in the original legislation and impediments arising from certain IRS interpretations as well as inflexibility in current tax administration with regard to the trust.  In recent years I have written to the Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee informing him that what has started as a simple proposition, promoted by Congress in the Settlement Trust legislation--to provide aid from a protected source to Alaska Natives who often have very little in other available assets to sustain them and in particular in their retirement years--had become a complex and bewildering situation which frustrated the use of the settlement trust provisions in law. This result stems from an IRS interpretation calling for the immediate taxation to potential beneficiaries when these trusts are established by Alaska Native corporations which have earnings and profits, as opposed to taxation when the money is actually received by the beneficiaries. Put simply, in the case of some beneficiaries, particularly the elderly, who have to prepay taxes in order to receive their benefits and, if they die prematurely, they will not even receive the amount of their prepaid taxes back. Needless to say, this is a substantial impediment to setting up and continuing such beneficial trusts.  But those Native corporations having favorable tax situations which enable them to make contributions to trusts which are not immediately taxable to their beneficiaries face other impediments. The IRS has taken the position that there is no authority to withhold tax from beneficiary payments, which prevents a simple way for a Native to pay his or her tax. The IRS requires that trust reporting to beneficiaries be accomplished via the complex so-called ``K-1'' form as opposed to the simple 1099 form, so familiar to most of us. As you can imagine, the requirement to use the former, particularly in rural areas in the state of Alaska where accountants may not be readily available, presents major reporting problems. We believe the IRS internally has been supportive of such a change but has advised in the past that it would need to be accomplished by statute.  Finally, the original authorizing legislation failed to provide a mechanism to encourage sustaining the longevity of these trusts dedicated to the goals enumerated. Such trusts are currently treated as regular trusts and penalized for accumulating income with an assessment of the highest marginal tax rate. Accordingly, from the standpoint of a settlement trust, it currently makes good tax sense to distribute all income to the beneficiaries rather than leaving it to be taxed at the current trust tax rate. This, however,does not make good social sense and encourages the opposite result one would envision for these entities, whose goal is to sustain the funds on a long-term basis in order to fulfill the objective envisioned for Settlement Trusts.  Accordingly, Mr. Speaker, Congressman Miller and Congressman Hayworth, and Iare today introducing legislation today which will rectify these problems and facilities settlement trusts functioning in a manner more in keeping with the underlying goals of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. In general, this legislation provides that:  1. Contributions to settlement trusts will not result in immediate taxation to beneficiaries. In the case of ANCSA corporations which have earnings and profits at the time of transfer, any and all distributions from the trust of either principal or interest, will be taxable as ordinary income to the beneficiaries when received up to the amount which would have been subject to taxation under present IRS rulings. This replicates the taxation presently imposed by the IRS but delays it from the establishment of the trust to the distribution to beneficiaries, which is clearly the proper point of taxation. It should be noted that currently, the distribution of principal is not taxable. This provision provides for the taxation of such distribution as part of the overall balance worked into the bill.  2. A settlement trust will be able to defer taxation of up to 45% of its current income in order to ``inflation proof'' and not dissipate the principal. However, when this deferred income is ultimately distributed to beneficiaries, they will be taxes at ordinary income rates rather than at more favorable capital gains rates or, in some cases at present, not taxed at all.  3. Beneficiaries of settlement trusts will be able to have up to 15% of their distributions by the trust withheld to satisfy their anticipated federal income tax obligations. This will obviously speed up and help insure IRS collections.  4. A settlement trust will be able to issue form 1009's to beneficiaries which should greatly simplify their reporting and again enhance tax collections.  Mr. Speaker, in the development of this bill, a serious effort has been made to address concerns raised during discussions with Department of Treasury officials as well as with representatives of the Joint Committee on Taxation. Substantial information has been provided already to the Joint Tax Committee to help permit the committee to make a realistic revenue estimate. In this regard, it is our belief that by providing offsetting tax measures in the bill and speeding up and otherwise enhancing the collections of tax, we believe that the legislation we introduce today should be essentially revenue neutral.  In sum, such trusts were intended to provide for the segregation of Native assets, to immunize such assets from potential dissipation through business ventures (or premature distributions) or otherwise and to provide a fund which would remain intact fort a substantial period of time and hence contribute to the health, education, welfare, heritage and cultural objectives in the current settlement trust statute for years to come. Unfortunately, general tax interpretations and policy, established for far different reasons, have hampered these Congressional goals and objectives.  Therefore, I am pleased that, on a bipartisan basis, I can join with my colleague and Ranking Minority Member on the Resources Committee, Mr. Miller, and my other distinguished colleagues Mr. Hayworth to introduce this important remedial legislation.       Narrative Explanation For Settlement Trust Tax Legislation                           bill section 1(a)  Identification of ANCSA Settlement Trusts As Eligible To Elect Tax                              Exempt Status       This provision of the draft legislation permits settlement      trusts organized under the Alaska native Claims Settlement      Act, 43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq. (ANCSA), to elect tax exempt      status.                           bill section 1(b) Detailing Tax Treatment For Settlement Trusts And Their Beneficiaries       This new subsection amends the Tax Code to add a new      section 501(p), which is comprised of six paragraphs      clarifying the tax treatment of ANCSA settlement trusts.       Paragraph (1) provides that contributions to ANCSA      settlement trusts are not deemed distributions to the ANCSA      corporation's shareholders--the conveyance to the trust does      not trigger taxation to the beneficiaries. Paragraph (1)      applies whether or not a settlement trust has made the (p)(2)      election, and alters an existing IRS ruling posture which has      operated as a disincentive to contributions to settlement      trusts by taxing beneficiaries prior to their receipt of      distributions. However, as noted below, the draft legislation      further provides that if an ANCSA corporation has earnings      and profits for the taxable year of a contribution, those      earnings and profits (up to the amount of the contribution)      must be transferred to the trust. Subsequent distributions by      the trust will produce ordinary income to the beneficiaries,      until these transferred earnings and profits are exhausted.      This transfer of earnings and profits eliminates the      possibility that settlement trusts could be used to bail out      corporate earnings and profits.       Paragraph (2) provides the basic mechanism by which a      settlement trust elects tax exempt status. In general under      the legislation an electing settlement trust must meet two      requirements to be tax exempt. First, the trust must timely      file for the election as prescribed. Second, the beneficial      interests in the trust must abide by alienation restrictions      which prohibit transfers of trust units in the same manner      that transfers of ANCSA corporate stock are prohibited;      failure to do so results in revocation of the election. If an      electing trust violates the alienation restrictions at any      point during a taxable year, the section 501(p) election will      be automatically revoked for that year and all subsequent      years. Once the section 501(p) election is evoked, that trust      would not be able to reelect.       Paragraph (3) provides the distribution requirements for an      electing trust in the amount of 55% of adjustable taxable      income. If an electing trust fails to meet this requirement,      it is taxable at the maximum individual tax rates (presently      39.6%) on whatever amount it would have had to distribute to      meet the 55% requirement. As an example, if an electing trust      distributed only 50% of its taxable income for a given year,      then 5% (55% requirement less 50% actually distributed) would      be subject to tax.       Paragraph (4) describes the taxation of the beneficiaries      of settlement trusts. Subparagraph (4)(A) applies to electing      settlement trusts and imposes a rule that distributions by      such trusts are automatically taxable as ordinary income      regardless of the source of those distributions. This would      include amounts retained without tax incidence at the trust      level which are subsequently distributed to beneficiaries.      Subparagraph (4)(B) applies to trusts which have not made the      new subsection 501(p)(2) election. If the ANCSA corporation      does not have earnings and profits for tax purposes when a      contribution is made to a settlement trust, subsequent      distributions by that trust are taxable to the beneficiaries      under the existing rules of Subchapter J of the Code. In      general, under existing law the character of income earned by      the trust would flow out to the beneficiaries and      distributions of capital and accumulated income are tax free.       On the other hand, if the ANCSA corporation has earnings      and profits when a contribution is made to a settlement      trust, further rules apply. The contribution is deemed to      transfer the corporation's earnings and profits up to the      amount of the contribution to the settlement trust.      Subsequent distributions by the trust to its beneficiaries      will be deemed to come from these transferred earnings and      profits and produce ordinary income to the beneficiaries, the      same as would occur if the ANCSA corporation had distributed      those earnings and profits directly. This treatment continues      until the trust has fully distributed the amount of the      transferred earnings and profits. Only thereafter is taxation      of the beneficiaries controlled by Subchapter J.       Paragraph (5) permits beneficiaries to elect to have up to      15% of their distributions by the trust withheld from their      ongoing trust distributions to satisfy their anticipated      federal income tax obligations. This paragraph applies      whether or not a settlement trust has made the 501(p)92)      election.       Paragraph (6) defines a settlement trust with reference to      ANCSA.                           Bill Section 1(c)                         Information Reporting       Section 1(c) provides a mechanism to permit beneficiary      reporting under form 1099. Annual information reporting on      form 1099 reporting is advantageous for all settlement      trusts, even where taxability for beneficiaries is determined      under Subchapter J (i.e. as to non electing trusts which have      no transferred earnings and profits). In the case of a non      electing settlement trust, the 1099 would differentiate among      the different types and character of income being      distributed. Also, 1099 reporting would be in lieu of the      existing requirement that a non electing settlement trust      attach a copy of beneficiary K-1s to its own tax return.                           Bill Section 1(d)                             Effective Date       The provisions of the bill are applicable to taxable years      beginning and contributions made after December 31, 1996.                               ____________________
