  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I have nothing against classics. I drove a 1968 Barracuda to work today. But I am looking at hybrids because of the high cost of gas and to get a little more efficient.  The Republicans are offering us a classic energy bill today, firmly rooted in the 1950s: no improvements in efficiency, no investment in energy-efficient technologies, no breakthroughs. Even worse, $8 billion of subsidies to the oil and gas industry. Well, heck, they need it. That was only the quarterly profit of ExxonMobil gouging people at the pump last quarter. They want to give us more of the same.  The President's own energy information administration says this bill will, quote, have only negligible impact on production, consumption and imports of oil. In fact, they said it will probably increase the price of gasoline by 3 cents per gallon. I guess that is to pay for the new subsidies to the suffering oil and gas industry.  That is an energy policy for the 21st century?                          ____________________[Page H2154]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                            THE ENERGY BILL  (Mr. DeFAZIO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)
