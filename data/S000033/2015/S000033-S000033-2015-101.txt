 President, I appreciate Senator Moran raising this issue. Last year we wrote the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act. We included language to allow veterans living at least 40 miles from a VA facility to access care in the community.  Like Senator Moran, I represent a rural State. I am the first to understand the unique needs of rural veterans. I have spoken with Senator Moran and understand his intention is to ensure that veterans living at least 40 miles from a facility that provides the care they need can seek care in the community through the Choice Program on a case-by-case basis.  If that is his intention, I think it is a good amendment. I think we should all support it.
