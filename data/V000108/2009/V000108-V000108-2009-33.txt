The historical marker is located at the center of Furnessville, Indiana, where Edwin Way Teale and his family once lived. Furnessville, a community with undefined borders, lies between Pine and Westchester townships, at the north end of Porter County. An unveiling ceremony of the historical marker will take place on Saturday, May 30, 2009, in the center of Furnessville near Musette Lewry, estate of the late American Naturalist, Edwin Way Teale.  Edwin Way Teale put Furnessville on the map with his autobiographical book Dune Boy: The Early Years of a Naturalist. The book was an account of the time he spent as a child on the farm owned by his grandparents, Edwin and Jemina Way, discovering the dunes of Northwest Indiana. In 1915, his grandparents' farm burned down. Next, The Maples, in the center of Furnessville, became home to hisgrandparents, and many years later, was the home of Teale's wife, Nellie, and their son, David. Eventually, Musette Lewry was built on this foundation. Trent D. Pendley, who purchased Teale's home in Furnessville, applied for the State Historical Marker, which was approved in October 2007 by the Indiana State Library after undergoing significant study. There are only about 500 of these larger markers throughout the State of Indiana. The criteria for the State Historical Marker is based on the national significance of the site or honoree.  Edwin Way Teale was born on June 2, 1899, in Joliet, Illinois. As a child, his fondest memories were the summer months he spent on the Furnessville farm owned by his grandparents. It was this time spent in Indiana, as a child, that became the backdrop for Teale to discover his love, respect, and wonder of nature. His grandparents gave him the freedom to explore the surrounding landscape, which became the most significant influence on his future career as a writer and naturalist. Teale went on to study English Literature and received a Bachelor of the Arts degree from Earlham College in Richmond, Indiana. During this time, he met his wife, Nellie Donovan, and they were married in 1923. Teale then began his writing career after graduating with a Master of the Arts degree from Columbia University in 1926. Edwin and Nellie had one son, David, who died in battle during World War II. In honor of their son, Edwin and Nellie collaborated on a four-book series detailing natural seasonal changes across the United States. In 1965, Teale won the Pulitzer Prize for Wandering Through Winter, a book that was part of this series, which is an account of the four winter months he and his wife spent traveling through the United States. He also won the John Burroughs Award for nature writing, and went on to publish thirty books in his lifetime. Edwin Way Teale passed away on October 18, 1980.  Madam Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in commending the Indiana Historic Bureau's unveiling of the State Historical Marker to honor one of Northwest Indiana's finest citizens, Edwin Way Teale. For his notable, and highly respectable literary and environmental influence both nationally and in Northwest Indiana, he is worthy of the highest praise. I respectfully ask you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring Edwin Way Teale and acknowledging the Indiana State Historical Marker in his name as a tremendous source of pride for Northwest Indiana.                          ____________________
