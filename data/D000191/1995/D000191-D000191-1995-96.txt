Speaker I have been preceded in the well by several Members who spoke eloquently and personally of reverence for our freedoms as symbolized by the flag: the gentlewoman from Florida who fled the oppressive Castro regime for her freedom; the gentleman from Korea who immigrated to America for great freedom and opportunity. In Castro's Cuba, South Korea, mainland China, and the old Soviet Union, there was one common thread. Show disrespect to the hammer and sickle, you go to jail. In Cuba, China, Korea, all the tottering oppressive regimes, show disrespect to their symbol, you go to jail.  Until today, America was different. We had a Bill of Rights that was the beacon of liberty to oppressed people around the world. When they throw off the chains of oppression, they do not endeavor to copy our flag. They endeavor to copy our Bill of Rights and our Constitution.  Vote ``no''. Do not be afraid to be free. Save the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
