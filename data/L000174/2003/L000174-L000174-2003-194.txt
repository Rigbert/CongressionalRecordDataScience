 The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). It would not be precluded.  Without objection, it is so ordered.  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Leahy for his work on this amendment, along with Senator Hatch, who lends and contributes a great deal of teeth to this bill. I know they have worked very hard.  As I mentioned to Senator Hatch, as did the Senator from Oregon, we know that the Senator and his committee will be involved in the oversight of the enforcement of this legislation. We thank you for his valuable contribution.  I urge the sponsors of those amendments, Senators Corzine, Santorum, Enzi, Landrieu, Boxer, and Harkin, to please come to the floor in courtesy to their colleagues so we can take up and dispose of these amendments. Please show some courtesy to your colleagues. If you have amendments pending, please come. We are ready for them.  I yield the floor.
