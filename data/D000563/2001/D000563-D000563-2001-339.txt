I wouldn't question them. But the Senator knows, if you are going to total up the medical profession, where they come down on which bill, you don't have a chance, my friend. They are all on this side of the aisle. They support the real patients' protection bill. Finding 300,000 doctors who agree with one thing or the other, congratulations.  I can tell you, when you look at the American Medical Association, the American Nurses Association, the American Hospital Association, they are all on this side of the aisle I think that is very clear.  As you go through here, access to doctor-prescribed drugs, if a doctor says this is the drug you should have, this is what you need to get well, the health insurance company takes a look at the list and says, sorry, that drug is not on our list; you can't prescribe it.  Wait a minute. If that is the drug that you need, that is what you need. That isn't a decision of an insurance company; that is a decision of a doctor. Doctors go to medical school. Insurance company clerks go to business school maybe. They shouldn't be making medical decisions.  The choice of provider, point of service, emergency room access--our bill provides that protection start to finish.  Let me ask, how much time remains?
