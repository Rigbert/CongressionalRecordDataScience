These individuals will be honored as part of BP's A+ for Energy program at a very special luncheon that will take place at the Radisson Star Plaza Hotel in Merrillville, Indiana, on Monday, July 21, 2008.   BP's A+ for Energy program, being offered in Indiana for the second year, recognizes community educators who have gone above and beyond to bring real-world, innovative ideas into our schools, allowing students to become involved in classroom, after-school, extra-curricular, or summer activities that will not only challenge and enrich their lives, but will also teach them the importance of energy conservation.   The twenty-five individuals selected as the winning A+ for Energy teachers, based on their grant submissions, were chosen by two independent panels of experts in the fields of education, science, and the environment. Each recipient will be awarded a cash grant of either $5,000 or $10,000 to take back to their schools, as well as a scholarship to attend a three-day energy training conference sponsored by BP, in partnership with the National Energy Education Development (NEED) Project and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). It is estimated that more than 8,400 students will benefit from these grants.   This year's A+ for Energy honorees are: Karen Augustyn of Tolleston Middle School in Gary (Project P.O.W.E.R.--Providing Our World with Energy Resources), Patricia Casella of Jefferson Elementary School in Hammond (Experience Energy!
