  I voted in support of the FISA bill as a member of the Intelligence Committee. But I made clear in that committee, as well as in statements called additional views, which are attached to the report of the bill, that I coauthored with Senators Snowe and Hagel that changes were necessary.  In the Judiciary Committee, we were able to secure improvements to the Intelligence Committee's bill that I believed were needed. Most importantly,the Judiciary Committee added strong exclusivity language similar to the amendment I have now before the Senate.  Unfortunately, the Judiciary package was not adopted on the floor. So the amendments we present are designed to restore the exclusivity language I believe is vital to FISA and goes to the heart of the debate on this bill, which is whether this President or any other President must follow the law.  With strong exclusivity language, which is what we try to add, we establish a legislative record that the language and the intent of the Congress compels a President now and in the future to conduct electronic surveillance of Americans for foreign intelligence purposes within the parameters and confines of this legislation.
