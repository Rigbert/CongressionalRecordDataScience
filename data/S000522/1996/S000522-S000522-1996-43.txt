Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 10 seconds.  The gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Durbin] has not obviously read the bill. On page 73, section 519, the text stipulates exceptions for the life of themother, or the pregnancy is the result of an act of ``rape or incest.''  So the argument Mr. Durbin is making isn't at issue and misses the mark by a mile. Please, next time read the bill.
