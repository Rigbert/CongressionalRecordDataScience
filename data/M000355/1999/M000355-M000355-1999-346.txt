 Moynihan, Mr. Lieberman, and         Mr. McCain):  S. 837. A bill to enable drivers to choose a more affordable form of auto insurance that also provides for more adequate and timely compensation for accident victims, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.                         auto choice reform act  Mr. McConnell. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a progressive, bipartisan bill to allow hard-working Americans to keep more of what they earn.  Imagine for a moment a tax cut that could save families $193 billion over the next five years. Better yet, this tax cut would not add a single penny to the deficit. Sound impossible? Not really. It's called Auto Choice.  The Auto Choice Reform Act offers the equivalent of a massive across-the-board tax cut to every American motorist. Based on a study by the RAND Institute for Civil Justice, the Joint Economic Committee (``JEC'') in Congress issued a 1998 report estimating that Auto Choice could save consumers as much as $35 billion a year--at no cost to the government.  In fact, the 5-year net savings described in the JEC report could reach $193 billion. Let me say that again, Mr. President: a potential savings of $193 billion--that is $50 million more than five-year tax cut savings projected in our budget resolution.  So what does this mean for the average American?  It would mean that the average American driver could keep more of what he or she earns to the tune of nearly $200 per year, per vehicle. And, Mr. President, low-income families would be the greatest beneficiaries of this bill. According to the JEC, the typical low-income household spends more on auto insurance in two years than the entire value of their car. Auto choice would change that by allowing low-income drivers to save 36 percent on their overall automobile premium. For a low-income household, these savings are the equivalent of five weeks of groceries or nearly four months of electric bills.  And, Mr. President, let me say again--Auto Choice would not add one penny to the deficit. It wouldn't cost the government a cent.  I expect that there will be a good deal of discussion over the next few months about Auto Choice and the effort to repair the broken-down automobile insurance tort system. But, Mr. President, everything you will hear about Auto Choice can be summed up in two words: Choice and Savings.  Consumers want, need, and deserve both.  Very simply, the Auto Choice Reform Act offers consumers the choice of opting out of the current pain and suffering litigation lottery. The consumers who make this choice will achieve a substantial savings on automobile insurance premiums by reducing fraud, pain-and-suffering litigation and lawyer fees.  Mr. President, before you can truly comprehend the benefits of this pro-consumer, pro-inner city, pro-tax cut bill, you must understand the terrible costs of the current tort liability system.  The current trial-lawyer insurance system desperately needs an overhaul. And nobody knows this better than the American motorist--who is now paying on average nearly $800 per year per vehicle for automobile insurance. Between 1987 and 1994, average premiums rose 44 percent--nearly one-and-a-half times the rate of inflation.  Why are consumers forced to pay so much?  Because the auto insurance tort system is fundamentally flawed. It is clogged and bloated by fraud, wasteful litigation, and abuse.  Fundamental flaw #1: The first flaw of the current system is rampant fraud and abuse. In 1995, the F.B.I. announced a wave of indictments stemming from Operation Sudden Impact, the most wide-ranging investigation of criminal fraud schemes involving staged car accidents and massive fraud in the health care system. The F.B.I uncovered criminal enterprises staging bus and car accidents in order to bring lawsuits and collect money from innocent people, businesses and governments. In fact, F.B.I. Director Louis Freeh has estimated that every American household is burdened by an additional $200 in unnecessary insurance premiums to cover this enormous amount of fraud.  In addition to the pervasive criminal fraud that exists, the incentives of ourlitigation system encourage injured parties to make excessive medical claims to drive up their damage claims in lawsuits. The RAND institute for Civil Justice, in a study released in 1995, concluded that 35 to 42 percent of claimed medical costs in car accident cases are excessive and unnecessary. Let me repeat that in simple English: well over one-third of doctor, hospital, physical therapy and other medical costs claimed in car accident cases are for nonexistent injuries or for unnecessary treatment.  The value of this wasteful health care? Four billion dollars annually. I don't need to remind anyone of the ongoing local and national debate over our health care system. While people have strongly-held differences over the causes and solutions to that problem, the RAND data make one thing certain--lawsuits, and the potential for hitting the jackpot, drive overuse and abuse of the health care system. Reducing those costs by $4 billion annually, without depriving one person of needed medial care, is clearly in our national interest.  Why would an injured party inflate their medical claims, you might ask. It's simple arithmetic. For every $1 of economic loss, a party stands to recover up to $3 in pain and suffering awards. In short, the more you go to the chiropractor, the more you get from the jury. And, the more you get from the jury, the more money your attorney puts in his own pocket.  Which leads us to Fundamental Flaw #2--that is, the excessive amounts of consumer dollars that are wasted on lawsuits and trial lawyers. Based on data from the Insurance Information Institute and the Joint Economic Committee, it is estimated that lawyers rake in nearly two times the amount of money that injured parties receive for actual economic losses. Surely we would all agree that a system is broken down when it pays lawyers more than it pays injured parties for actual economic losses.  Fundamental Flaw #3: Seriously injured people are grossly undercompensated under the tort system. A 1991 RAND study reveals that people with economic losses $25,000 and $100,000 recover on average barely half of their economic losses--and no pain-and-suffering damages. People with losses in excess of $100,000 recover only 9 percent of their economic losses--and no pain-and-suffering damages. So, the hard facts demonstrate that seriously-injured victims do not receive pain-and-suffering damages today--event though they are paying to play in a system that promises pain-and-suffering damages.  Fundamental Flaw #4: Not only does the current system force you to typically hire a lawyer just to recover from a car accident, it also forces you to wait for that payment. One study indicates that the average time to recover is 16 months, and of course, it takes much longer in serious injury cases.  Auto Choice gives consumers a way out of this system of high premiums, rampant fraud, and slow, inequitable compensation. Our bill would remove the perverse incentives of lawsuits, while ensuring that accident victims recover fully for their economic loss.  So, what is auto choice? Let me first answer with what it is not. It does not abolish lawsuits, and it does not eliminate the concept of fault within the legal system. Undoubtedly, there will be more equitable compensation of injured parties, and thus less reason to go to court--but the right to sue will not be abolished.  Auto Choice allows drivers to decide how they want to be insured. In establishing the choice mechanism, the bill unbundles economic and non-economic losses and allows the driver to choose whether to be covered for non-economic losses (that is, pain and suffering losses).  In other words, if a driver wants to have the chance to recover pain and suffering, he says in the current system. If he wants to opt-out of the pain and suffering regime and receive lower premiums with prompt, guaranteed compensation for economic losses, then he chooses the personal injury protection system.  This choice, which sounds amazingly simple and imminently reasonable, is, believe it or not, currently unavailable anywhere in our country. Auto Choice will change that.  Let me briefly explain the choices that our bill will offer every consumer. A consumer will be able to choose one of two insurance systems.  The first choice in the Tort Maintenance System. Drivers who wish to stay in their current system would choose this system and be able to sue each other for pain and suffering. These drivers would essentially buy the same type of insurance that they currently carry--and would recover, or fail to recover, in the same way that they do today. The only change for these tort drivers would be that, in the event that they are hit by a personal protection driver, the tort driver would recover both economic and noneconomic damages from his own insurance policy. This supplemental first-party policy for tort drivers will be called tort maintenance coverage.  The second choice is the Personal Injury Protection System. Consumers choosing this system would be guaranteed prompt recovery of their economic losses, up to the levels of their own insurance policy. Personal protection drivers would achieve substantially reduced premiums because the personal injury protection system would dramatically reduce: (1) fraud, (2) pain and suffering lawsuits, and (3) attorney fees. These drivers would give up the chance to sue for pain and suffering damages in exchange for lower premiums, guaranteed compensation of economic losses, and relief from pain and suffering lawsuits.  Under both insurance systems--tort maintenance and personal protection--the injured party whose economic losses exceed his own coverage will have the chance to sue the other driver for excess economic losses. Moreover, tort drivers will retain the chance to sue each other for both economic and noneconomic loss. Critics who say the right to sue is abolished by this bill are plain wrong.  The advantages of personal protection coverage are enormous.  First, personal protection coverage assures that those who suffer injury, regardless of whether someone else is responsible, will be paid for their economic losses. The driver does not have to leave compensation up to the vagaries of how an accident occurs and how much coverage the other driver has. A driver whose car goes off a slippery road will be able to recover for his economic losses. Such a blameless driver could not recover under the tort system because no other person was at fault. No matter when and how a driver or a member of his family is injured, the driver will have peace of mind knowing that his insurance will help protect his family.  Second, the choice as to how much insurance protection to purchase is in the hands of the driver, who is in the best position to know how much coverage he and his family need. He can choose as much or as little insurance as his circumstances require, from $20,000 to $1 million of protection.  Third, people who elect the personal protection option will, in the event they are injured, be paid promptly, as their losses accrue.  Fourth, we will have more rational use of precious health care resources. Insuring on a first-party basis helps eliminate the incentives for excess medical claiming. When a person chooses to be compensated for actual economic loss, the tort system's incentives for padding one's claims disappear. If there's no pain-and-suffering lottery, then there's no reason to play the game.  Fifth, Auto Choice offers real benefits for low-income drivers because the savings are both dramatic and progressive. Low-income drivers will see the biggest savings because they pay a higher proportion of their disposal income in insurance costs. A study of low income residents of Maricopa County, Arizona, revealed that households below 50 percent of the poverty line spent an amazing 31.6 percent of disposable income on car insurance.  For many low-income families the choices are stark: car insurance and the ability to get to the job, or medicine, new clothing and extra food for the children. Too often these families feel forced to drive without any insurance. In fact, some areas in our country have uninsured motorist rates exceeding ninety percent. I would hope that this Senate would not sit back and allow our litigation system to promote this kind of lose-lose scenario for consumers.  Moreover, Auto Choice offers benefits to all taxpayers, even those who don'tdrive. For example, local governments will save taxpayer dollars through decreased insurance and litigation costs. This will allow governments to use our tax dollars to more directly benefit the community. Think of all the additional police and firefighters that could be hired with money now spent on lawsuits, Or, schools and playgrounds that could be better equipped. New York City spends more on liability claims than it spends on libraries, botanical gardens, the Bronx Zoo, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Department of Youth Services, combined. Imagine the improved quality of life in our urban areas if governments were free of spending on needless lawsuits.  The bottom line? We think that consumers should be able to make one simple choice: ``Do you want to continue to pay nearly $800 per year per vehicle for auto insurance and have the chance to recover pain and suffering damages? Or would you rather save roughly $200 per year per vehicle, be promptly reimbursed for your economic losses, and forego pain and suffering damages?''  It's really that simple. And, we're not even going to tell them which answer is the right one. Because that's not up to us. It's up to the consumer. We simply want to give them the choice.  In closing, I'd like to quote The New York Times, which has summed up the benefits, and indeed, the simplicity of our bill: ``[Auto Choice] would give families the option of foregoing suits for nonmonetary losses in exchange for quick and complete reimbursement for every blow to their pocketbook. Everyone would win--except the lawyers.''  Mr. President, this bill is bipartisan and bicameral. I am proud today to again have the support of Senators Moynihan  and Lieberman. We first introduced this bill in the 104th Congress, and I want to take a minute to say how much I appreciate their ongoing commitment to provide meaningful relief for consumers across the country, especially low-income families. And, we have now added another heavy hitter to our list of original cosponsors, Senator John McCain, the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee.  I also want to thank House Majority Leader Dick Armey and Congressman Jim Moran. They joined our team in the last Congress, and I am pleased to say that they will again be leading the charge in the House.  Auto Choice has broad support from across the spectrum. It should be obvious by the support and endorsements that Auto Choice is not conservative or liberal legislation. It is consumer legislation. To show this range of support, I ask unanimous consent that the Record include the statements in support of Auto Choice from the Republican Mayor of New York City, Rudolph Giuliani; the former Massachusetts Governor and Democratic presidential candidate, Michael Dukakis; and award-winning consumer advocate Andrew Tobias. I also ask unanimous consent that the Record include statements on behalf of Americans for Tax Reform, Citizens for a Sound Economy, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                             The City of New York,                                          Office of the Mayor,                                     New York, NY, April 13, 1999.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     U.S. Senate, Senate Russell Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: I am writing to you in support of      Auto-Choice insurance reform, which will dramatically reduce      automobile insurance premiums for American motorists.       Drivers across the country are struggling with the burden      of unjustly high automobile insurance premiums caused by      excessive pain and suffering damages awarded in personal      injury actions. Three out of every four dollars awarded in      these actions are spent on this subjective component of tort      recovery. Also contributing to high premiums are inflated and      fraudulent insurance claims. The Federal Bureau of      Investigation has estimated that more than $200 of an      American family's average annual premiums go to pay for      automobile insurance fraud. Because insurance companies have      to cover these payments, our premiums are significantly      higher than they ought to be.       New York City has proposed State legislation to remedy some      of the ills afflicting our tort recovery system, such as      capping pain and suffering awards. However, your assistance      is needed nationwide to protect ordinary drivers who suffer      from the incentives that invite plaintiff attorneys to sue      without restraint, in the hope of obtaining a large, unearned      contingency fee from a large pain and suffering recovery.      Attorneys receive one third or more of a tort recovery, a sum      that often bears no relationship to the amount of time or      effort invested by the attorney, while drivers often pay      premiums that are not commensurate with the protection      actually afforded. That is grossly unfair.       I support Auto-Choice because it would be a major step      forward in tort reform and would provide billions of dollars      in relief to taxpayers. Auto-Choice gives motorists the      option to choose between two insurance coverage plans. The      personal protection plan permits drivers to insure for      economic loss only. Under this option, injured drivers      recover from their own insurance carrier for economic loss      without regard to fault. No lawsuit would be required unless      an injured driver seeks recovery of economic loss exceeding      his or her own policy's coverage. Under the second plan,      traditional tort liability coverage, motorists insure for      economic and non-economic damages, and recover both from      their own insurance carrier. Under either plan, drivers may      sue uninsured or inebriated drivers for economic and non-     economic damages. The result is a first party recovery      framework that separates pain and suffering damages from tort      recovery. With litigation incentives eliminated, motorists      will pay only for protection actually provided at a price      they can better afford. Injured drivers recover medical      bills, lost wages and other pecuniary loss without the      headache of protracted litigation. For those that think pain      and suffering recovery is an important part of insurance      coverage, that option is available to them in the bill--at      the price they are willing to pay, for the amount of coverage      they wish to have.       Families throughout the country would benefit considerably      from savings on automobile insurance premiums generated by      this bill. According to the Congressional Joint Economic      Committee, within a five year period, Auto-Choice could give      motorists a total of over $190 billion in disposable income      that otherwise would go to insurance companies. The average      annual premium nationwide would be reduced by $184, and in      New York, drivers would see a $385 decrease in the average      annual insurance premium. That means more disposable income      available to spend and more incentive to save. Until now, the      insured have had to endure paying what is, for all intents      and purposes, an ``automobile insurance tax'' to subsidize      non-economic tort awards and inflated insurance claims. With      these new reforms, drivers will realize what is essentially a      huge tax cut, without any countervailing decrease in      government service delivery.       Without the benefits of Auto-Choice, drivers will continue      to pay high premiums. As I have stated previously in      testimony submitted in 1997 to the Senate Committee on      Commerce, Science and Transportation concerning the      introduction of Auto-Choice legislation in the Senate:      ``Residents, as taxpayers, lose money that could otherwise be      spent on essential services. Residents, as individuals, lose      money otherwise available as disposable income. Residents, as      consumers, lose money because the cost of goods and services      increases as businesses have to pay higher insurance      premiums. Finally, and perhaps most disturbingly, residents      lose faith in our judicial system as a result of courts      clogged with tort litigation only to be out-done by hospital      emergency rooms clogged with ambulance-chasing lawyers.''       In short, Auto-Choice would make an important difference in      the lives of New Yorkers and drivers throughout the country.      I look forward to opportunities to work with you in support      of this important reform.           Sincerely,                                              Rudolph W. Giuliani,     Mayor.                                  ____                                          Northeastern University,                              Department of Political Science,                                        Boston, MA, April 7, 1999.       I enthusiastically endorse the ``choice'' auto insurance      bill you are jointly sponsoring. Your action is an important      act of bipartisan leadership on an issue that significantly      affects all Americans.       The issue you address has been a great concern of mine      throughout my political career ever since I sponsored the      first no-fault auto insurance bill in the nation.       Given the horrendous high costs of auto insurance, coupled      with its long delays, high overhead, and rank unfairness when      it comes to payment, your ``choice'' reform takes the      sensible approach of allowing consumers to choose how to      insure themselves. In other words, your reform trusts the      American people to decide for themselves whether to spend      their money on ``pain and suffering'' coverage or food,      medicine, life insurance or any other expenditure they deem      more valuable for themselves and their families.       The bill is particularly important to the people who live      in American cities where premiums are the highest. It is no      surprise that the cost studies done by the Joint Economic      Committee indicate that while your reform will make stunning      cost savings available to all American consumers, its largest      benefit will go to low income drivers living in urban areas.       The bill will also help resolve the country's problems with      runaway health costs. By allowing consumers to remove      themselves from a system whose perverse incentives trigger      the cost of health care costs, your reform will lower the      cost of health care for all Americans while ensuring that      health care     expenditures are more clearly targeted to health care needs.       I look forward to assisting you to the fullest degree as      you exercise your vitally needed leadership on behalf of      America's consumers.     Michael S. Dukakis.                                  ____                                                    Miami, FL,                                                   March 25, 1999.       To Whom It May Concern: As an independent journalist and      private citizen, I have been studying and working for      automobile insurance reform for twenty years. I have written      a book on the subject.       It astounds and saddens me that the system in Michigan--a      state that knows something about automobiles--has not been      adopted anywhere else in America. Michigan's coverage      provides the seriously injured accident victim VASTLY better      insurance protection than anywhere else. Yet it costs less      than average. It has worked well for 25 years, more than      proving itself. It is not perfect, but most consumer      advocates agree it is by far the most humane, efficient, and      least fraud-ridden system in the country.       And yet the coalition of labor unions and consumer groups      that helped pass the Michigan law has failed to duplicate      this success anywhere else. And over time, things in most      states have only gotten worse. More uninsured motorists, more      fraud, higher premiums, and even more shamefully inadequate      compensation to those most seriously injured.       Given that reality, Senators Lieberman and Moynihan, and      Jim Moran in the House, have got it absolutely right in      supporting Auto Choice legislation. It is not perfect either.      But it allows the man or woman who earns $9 an hour, let      alone less, to opt out of a system that forces him or her, in      effect, to shoulder the cost of the $125-an-house insurance      company lawyer who will fight his claim . . . shoulder also,      the enormous cost of padded and fraudulent claims . . . and      then, if he wins, typically fork over 33% or 40% of the      settlement, plus expenses, to his own attorney.       These attorneys are good people. But as virtually every      disinterested observer from Richard Nixon in 1934 to      Consumers Union in 1962 and periodically thereafter has said,      the current lawsuit system of auto insurance makes no sense.      It makes no sense that more auto-injury premium dollars in      many states go to lawyers than to doctors, hospitals,      chiropractors and rehabilitation specialists combined. Yet      that is the case. Give consumers the choice to opt out of      this system. The only difference from 1934 and 1962 and 1973      (when Michigan enacted its good system) is . . . it's gotten      worse.           Sincerely,     Andrew Tobias.                                  ____                                     Americans For Tax Reform,                                   Washington, DC, March 29, 1999.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Russell Senate     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: Americans for Tax Reform      wholeheartedly endorses the ``Auto Choice Reform Act''      legislation to provide consumer choice in automobile      insurance.       Automobile insurance rates have skyrocketed during the last      ten years. Between 1987 and 1994, premiums rose more than 40      percent--one-and-a-half time the rate of inflation. In 1995,      the average policy cost more than $750. Clearly, these costs      must be reduced, and we believe your legislation will achieve      this goal.       Auto choice provides savings of about 45 percent on average      for personal injury premiums for drivers that choose the PIP      option. Especially, auto choice aids low-income drivers, who      would save about 36 percent on their overall premiums. Not      only does this plan give savings, but it will enable more      low-income workers to get better paying jobs.       Most importantly, your bill gives consumers something they      really want--a chance to choose the kind of auto insurance      that fits their individual needs.       Auto choice is an idea whose time has come. ATR supports      your efforts to make it a reality.           Sincerely,                                               Grover G. Norquist,     President.                                  ____                                 Citizens for a Sound Economy,                                   Washington, DC, April 13, 1999.     Senator Mitch McConnell,     Russell Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: On behalf of Citizens for a Sound      Economy and its 250,000 members, I wish to convey our strong      support for the Auto Choice Reform Act of 1999.       Most Americans rightly believe that they pay too much for      auto insurance. And year after year, state legislatures and      insurance departments respond with price controls and      underwriting restrictions, which only make matters worse. The      Auto Choice Reform Act of 1999 is based on the realization      that to reduce the cost of auto insurance, two elements of      the accident compensation system must be addressed: Losses      resulting from bodily injury, including damages for ``pain      and suffering''; and the tort-based system for redressing      those losses.       Under the tort-based compensation system that operates in      most states, accident victims may not file bodily injury      claims with their own insurance company. Instead, they must      try to collect from the other driver's insurer--which they      can do only if they succeed in establishing that the other      driver was legally at fault for their injuries. Compensating      accident victims in this way is costly, inefficient, and time      consuming. Trial lawyers, who constitute one of the most      powerful special interests in America, are the primary      beneficiaries of the current system.       Those eligible for compensation under the current tort-     based system are subject to a perverse pattern of recovery.      People with minor injuries are often vastly overcompensated,      while in many cases the seriously injured cannot recover      nearly enough to cover their economic losses.       ``Contingency'' fee arrangements, whereby insureds agree to      pay their attorneys a percentage of whatever sum they receive      as compensation for their losses, siphon away about a third      of an injured person's recovery award. Meanwhile, insurance      costs are driven up because of the tort system's promise to      compensate victims for their ``noneconomic damages.'' A      catchall term that generally refers to ``pain and      suffering,'' noneconomic damages are wildly subjective and      impossible to quantify. Usually the successful claimant      simply collects some multiple of his economic losses--     typically three times--as compensation for pain and      suffering.       This system creates a powerful incentive to inflate      economic damages, typically by claiming unverifiable soft-     tissue injuries. In Michigan, where third-party liability for      pain and suffering has been virtually eliminated thanks to      the state's strong no-fault law, auto accident victims suffer      about seven soft-tissue injuries (sprains, strains, pains and      whiplash) for every 10 ``hard'' injuries (such as broken      bones). By contrast, in California, where auto accident      victims are compensated through the tort system, injured      motorists claim about 25 soft-tissue injuries for every 10      verifiable hard injuries. The ratio of soft-tissue injuries      to hard-tissue injuries is similar in other tort states and      states with weak no-fault laws. Obviously, these disparities      raise troubling questions about the legitimacy of many soft-     tissue injury claims--troubling, because ultimately the cost      of inflated medical damages is passed on to all drivers in      the form of higher premiums.       If the Auto Choice Reform Act becomes law, drivers will be      able to choose either pure no-fault coverage, or a package      that would allow them to collect pain and suffering damages      from their own insurer, or from the insurers of other drivers      with similar premium coverage. ``Pain and suffering'' would      thus become an insurable risk, limiting legal liability to      cases involving egregious behavior, or where both parties      have agreed to pay, in the form of higher premiums, for the      privilege of engaging the legal system. Meanwhile, truly      negligent drivers--those who cause accidents intentionally,      or while impaired by drugs or alcohol--would continue to be      liable for their behavior, in addition to being subject to      criminal sanctions.       By curtailing litigation and attorney involvement in the      claim-settlement process, the Auto Choice Reform Act would      have a dramatic impact on auto insurance rates. The RAND      Institute for Civil Justice estimates that drivers choosing      the no-fault option would reduce their premiums by 21 percent      on average.       The Auto Choice Reform Act would yield even greater      benefits to low-income motorists, who are increasingly      dependent upon personal auto transportation at a time when      welfare rolls are being cut and jobs are being transferred      from the central city to the suburbs. Happily, the      Congressional Joint Economic Committee has determined that      low-income drivers could cut their premiums by as much as 48      percent if the Auto Choice Reform Act becomes law.       In sum, by allowing policyholders to opt out of the tort      system, the Auto Choice Insurance Reform Act would rely on      market forces--rather than price controls and hidden cross-     subsidies--to drive down auto insurance premiums.       Serious efforts to reform auto insurance at the state level      have been stymied repeatedly by the trial lawyers' lobby.      Inflated medical bills, attorney fees, court costs, and      exorbitant pain-and-suffering awards continue to impose      tremendous costs on the automobile insurance system--costs      that insurers must pass on to consumers in the form of      escalating premiums. Because they profit handsomely from the      inefficiencies wrought by this system, trial lawyers and      their political allies will doubtless make every effort to      defeat the Auto Choice Reform Act of 1999. Their desire to      maintain the status quo must not be permitted to prevail over      the interests of America's motorists.           Sincerely yours,                                   Robert R. Detlefsen, Ph.D.,                                               Director, Insurance     Reform Project.                                  ____                                              Chamber of Commerce,                              of the United States of America,                                   Washington, DC, April 15, 1999.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: I am writing on behalf of the U.S.      Chamber of Commerce, the world's largest business federation,      representing more than three million businesses and      organizations of every size, sector, and region, to commend      you for your continued leadership and sponsorship of the Auto      Choice Reform Act.       This legislation would provide motorists and businesses      with a very valuable option. They could cut their automobile      insurance premiums by over 20 percent by voluntarily opting      out of coverage for pain and suffering injuries in auto      accidents. Those choosing this option would continue to      receive full compensation for medical bills, lost wages and      other economic losses, and would receive payment quickly--     within 30 days. Those who wish to retain coverage similar to      that presently available could do simply by paying higher      rates.       As the largest business federation, the U.S. Chamber of      Commerce supports this legislation and a similar bill in the      House of Representatives because they provide a more      affordable and efficient insurance option for businesses and      motorists. Last year, the Joint Economic Committee (JEC)      estimated that enactment of Auto Choice legislation could      allow consumers to receive an annual auto insurance premium      reduction of over $27 billion. This amounts to an average      annual savings of $184 per car. Of particular importance to      businesses, the JEC also estimated that commercial vehicle      owners could see their auto insurance premiums decline by      over 27 percent for a total business savings of $8 billion      per year. This is equivalent to a huge tax cut for all      Americans.       The U.S. Chamber pledges to continue to support this      important legislation. Through our grassroots network and      media outreach, we will inform the business community and      public about the key benefits of this proposal. We thank and      commend you for your leadership on the Auto Choice Reform Act      and look forward to working with you for its successful      passage.           Sincerely,                                                  B. Bruce Josten.
