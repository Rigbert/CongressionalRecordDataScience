Speaker, I want to thank my friend for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my strong concern with yet another stopgap measure. Nearly 60 years ago, a Republican President, Dwight Eisenhower, led the charge to create the Interstate Highway System. He realized that good roads were not just about commerce and economic development, they are a national security priority to keep America safe.  I have said it before and I will remind you again: there is no such thing as a Republican road or a Democratic bridge. Today, American roads and bridges, American transit, and American highways are crumbling. This is a national embarrassment.  We have already rolled the ball down the road more than 30 times, and here we are doing it again. The time for talk is past. In the words of Dr. King: We have been bogged down in the paralysis of analysis for too long.  Delay for another day is not an option. American jobs are on the line. In a few short weeks, transportation projects across our country will grind to a stop. We must act, and we must act now.
