President, I rise to speak in support of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, known as CARA, of which I am proud to be a cosponsor. I want to begin by commending Senators Whitehouse and Portman for crafting this vitally important bill and also to thank Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Leahy for their leadership in the Judiciary Committee.
