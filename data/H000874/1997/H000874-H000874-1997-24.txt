Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York for his comments.  As a preface, I have served on the Subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government since January 1983. It is the responsibility of that subcommittee to oversee the Internal Revenue Service's budget and its management practices.  In the last three terms of Congress under Democratic and Republican leadership, our subcommittee has raised very substantial questions, and we have worked with the distinguished gentlewoman from Connecticut on those issues and the distinguished staff of her subcommittee who has done such an outstanding job.  I want to say to the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Portman] and to Senator Kerrey, as they know, that I think their efforts have produced a good work product. I think the commission raised many appropriate questions and recommended some very solid solutions. Having said that, I want to preface my remarks by saying that I ask no colleague to follow me in either adopting my premises or my vote, not one, because I understand the power of the rhetoric that precedes this bill to reform the IRS.  There have been a lot of columns written on this issue. Jim Glassman, not an apologist for Democratic policies, says do not reform the IRS, and he says Republicans talk grandly about simplification but this year passed legislation adding 285 new sections and 824 amendments to the tax law.  Mortimer Caplin, a distinguished former IRS commissioner, said this:       The proposed overall design by the Restructuring Commission      and its statutory offspring is deeply flawed. It would      obscure the core focus of the IRS, blur the lines of      authority, and hamstring efficiency.  The good news, my colleagues, is that under Secretary Rubin and Deputy Secretary Summers, for the first time since I have been on the Appropriations Committee, there has been a focus on management issues in addition to tax policy issues. As a result, very substantial things are happening at the IRS.  We are starting to get a handle on tax systems modernization, which was a disaster under the Reagan administration, under the Bush administration, and under the early Clinton administration, because the IRS clearly did not get a handle on its information systems technology. The good news is, we are now doing just that. We have an outstanding person that was recruited specifically to take on this task.  The Senate just a few days ago confirmed Mr. Charles Rossotti as the new Commissioner of the IRS. He is the former president of the American Management Systems, Inc., a firm of 7,000 people in northern Virginia. He has been doing exactly what IRS needs todo, in the private sector: Handling information and providing quick, user-friendly responses in an efficient manner. This administration has moved to make sure that the IRS makes many of the changes proposed by the restructuring commission.  Now, having said that, the administration, myself, and others raised very substantial questions about the bill that was originally introduced.  I might say tangentially, there has been no speaker raising any questions prior to me about the problems with this legislation. However, numerous responsible, thoughtful, conservative observers have said that this is not the way to go.  On its surface the legislation which we consider today is about IRS reform. The proponents claim that it will be the answer to all of our concerns about an agency which has admittedly failed to manage its operations well.  However, too many of my colleagues believe that the simple creation of a private sector oversight board will lead to a more user-friendly and responsive IRS.  I would argue that the net effect of H.R. 2676 will be nothing more than phony tax populism as described by Gloria Borger of U.S. News.  And while there are many provisions in this bill which I support, I think the empowerment of a private sector board, with far-ranging powers, will do little more than add just another layer of bureaucracy.  The taxpayer bill of rights title is necessary to provide much needed relief to innocent spouses and those who, because they are ill, are not able to file for a tax refund in a timely manner.  There are also provisions in the bill which I support that are designed to increase electronic filing.  However, the bill creates an unnecessary and more complicated organizational structure at the IRS, which I believe will have the overall effect of less accountability.  While there is no doubt a role for private sector advice and expertise, what the IRS needs is more accountability, not less.  H.R. 2676 would place management in the hands of people who, however well-meaning, are loyal and accountable to the firms and businesses that employ them.  And while IRS bashing may be both fun and easy, I would suggest that if we are truly attempting to make the IRS more user friendly, we ought to take a closer look at the tax writers, not the tax collectors.  As the national commission on restructuring the IRS concluded, Congress' attempt to micro-manage the IRS and its frequent changes of the Tax Code, have undermined the ability of the IRS to manage efficiently in the long or short term.  No matter how many managerial changes we make, it will not make the IRS more user friendly. We ought to focus on improving education and services for taxpayers, better training for IRS employees, modernizing computers, and simplifying the overall Tax Code.  Let's not hamstring the Commissioner's ability to enact real IRS reform by fooling ourselves into believing that adding another layer of bureaucracy in the chain of command is going to solve IRS' problems.  Let's build upon the progress started by Secretary Rubin and ensure that we enter the 21st century with an IRS that is customer-friendly, technologically-advanced, and governed ``by the people, for the people.''  Let us not delegate authority of the IRS to private interests who could easily undermine public confidence in the Agency and dramatically decrease voluntary tax compliance.  Are we all against the outrageous actions of the IRS? Absolutely. Should we take every action possible to eliminate the abuse of citizens that has occurred by IRS personnel or any other person in government? Absolutely.                              {time}  1300  But let me point out to my colleagues, that as Charles Krauthammer wrote so compellingly just a few days ago, ``The IRS does not write the rules it must enforce. Congress and the President do, and the rules are now an insane 9,451 pages long. The Tax Code is so extraordinarily complicated that no taxpayer can ever be sure he has fully complied with the law.''  That is the difficulty the IRS has in implementing the Code, and your commission said so. Your commission said one of the problems IRS has is that the Congress has not given them stable and steady funding levels. Your commission also said that there was not a systemic problem, and I appreciated those honest remarks.  I would hope, Mr. Speaker, that as we vote on this legislation, and clearly it will pass with over 400 votes so that we can all go home and say we are for IRS reform. My colleagues recognize that if one is not for IRS reform on appropriation bills and on tax bills, it will not happen. We will not be able to hide behind this vote.  I will look forward to the conference committee. In my opinion, the chairman of the Committee on Finance wants to go in exactly the wrong direction, as reported today in the papers, exactly the wrong direction, and that is what I fear. I would hope that we would look carefully at the product of the conference committee and ensure ourselves that we are in fact doing the right thing for the taxpayers of America.
