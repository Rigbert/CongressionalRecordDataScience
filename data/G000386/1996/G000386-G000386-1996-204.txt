  Mr. President, with one exception, those figures remain the law today. The Marine Corps got special relief legislation 2 years ago that raised its ceiling from 61 to 68, or by 7. But back in late 1990, there was no disagreement about what had to be done, reducing the number of generals as force structure gets smaller.  The House Armed Services Committee report contained almost identical language. I quote from page 268 of House Report 101-665.       The committee believes that the general and flag officers      authorized strength should be reduced to a level consistent      with the extra force structure reductions expected by fiscal      year 1995.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that that section of the House report be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 section 441--flag and general officers       Section 526 of title 10, United States Code provides that      the total number of general and flag officers authorized to      be on active duty may not exceed 1,073. The committee      believes that the general and flag officer authorized      strengths should be reduced to a level consistent with the      active force structure reductions expected by fiscal year      1995. Section 441 would amend section 526 of title 10, United      States Code to limit to 845 the total number of general and      flag officers authorized within the military services on      September 30, 1995.
