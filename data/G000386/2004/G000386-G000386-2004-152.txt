 President, every half hour, somewhere in this country somebody is killed as a result of an alcohol related traffic accident. This is a sobering statistic. Thanks in part to a massive national response, nearly 1.5 million people are arrested and taken off the road each year for driving under the influence of alcohol, undoubtedly saving lives. But, there is an equally dangerous and potentially devastating problem lurking on our Nation's highways that is going largely undetected.  In 2002, nearly 11 million people drove under the influence of illegal drugs, according to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health Report. While the effort to reduce drunk driving is making progress, those using illegal drugs like marijuana, cocaine, methamphetamine, and opiates continue to get behind the wheel, putting each of us at risk everyday.  According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, drugs are used by approximately 10 to 22 percent of all drivers involved in fatal motor vehicle crashes. In 2003, a study conducted at the Shock Trauma Center at the University of Maryland Hospital in Baltimore found that testing for alcohol alone would have identified less than 30 percent of all the substance abusing drivers admitted to the trauma unit as a result of a motor vehicle accident. Drugged driving is clearly a serious problem.  While it is illegal in all 50 States to drive a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol or drugs, there is no consistency in the way the States approach drug impaired drivers. In fact, existing laws often hinder the prosecution of drugged drivers. Adding further difficulty, there currently is no road side test to detect the presence of a controlled substance in a driver's body.  In response to these challenges, today I am pleased to be joined by Senator Feinstein in introducing legislation designed to encourage States to develop and carry out drug impaired driving traffic safety programs. By adopting a model statute, States become eligible for grants that would assist drivers in need of drug treatment, as well as grants that would enhance the training of law enforcement and prosecutors. Furthermore, in an effort to keep drug impaired drivers off the road, passage of this legislation will advance the research and development of a roadside testing mechanism.  Clearly there is a need to strengthen efforts to identify, prosecute, and treat drugged drivers. Just as the coordinated efforts to prevent drunk driving have saved lives, so too can the devastating consequences of drugged driving be prevented. I encourage my colleagues to join in support of this legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2480       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Drug Impaired Driving      Research and Prevention Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds that--       (1) driving under the influence of, or after having used,      illegal drugs has become a significant problem worldwide;       (2) in 2002, over 35,000,000 persons in the United States      aged 12 or older had used illegal drugs in the past year and      almost 11,000,000 of these persons (5 percent of the total      population of the United States aged 12 or older and 31      percent of past year illicit drug users) had driven under the      influence of, or after having used, illegal drugs in the past      year;       (3) research has established that abuse of a number of      drugs can impair driving performance;       (4) according to the National Highway Traffic Safety      Administration, illegal drugs (often in combination with      alcohol) are used by approximately 10 to 22 percent of      drivers involved in all motor vehicles crashes;       (5) drug impaired drivers are less frequently detected,      prosecuted, or referred to treatment than drunk drivers;       (6) there is a lack of uniformity or consistency in the way      the 50 States approach drug impaired drivers;       (7) too few police officers have been trained to detect      drug impaired drivers, and too few prosecutors have been      trained to prove drug impaired driving cases beyond a      reasonable doubt;       (8) per se drug impaired driving laws, like those used for      driving under the influence of alcohol, are feasible and      represent a sound strategy for dealing with drug impaired      drivers and can assist in the prosecution of drug impaired      driving offenders; and       (9) while it is illegal in all States to drive a motor      vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, drugs other      than alcohol, or a combination of alcohol and other drugs,      there is no consistent method across States for identifying      drug impairment and the presence of drugs in the body.     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.       The purposes of this Act are--       (1) to provide a model for States to implement and enforce      a drug impaired driving statute;       (2) to ensure drivers in need of drug education or      treatment are identified and provided with the appropriate      assistance;       (3) to advance research and development of testing      mechanisms and knowledge about drugged driving and its impact      on traffic safety; and       (4) to enhance the training of traffic safety officers and      prosecutors to detect, enforce, and prosecute drug impaired      driving laws.     SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.       In this Act, the following definitions apply:       (1) Controlled substance.--The term ``controlled      substance'' includes substances listed in schedules I through      V of section 112(e) of the Controlled Substances Act (21      U.S.C. 812(e)).       (2) Inhalant.--The term ``inhalant'' means a household or      commercial product that can be used by inhaling for      intoxicating effect.       (3) Drug recognition expert.--The term ``drug recognition      expert'' means an individual trained in a specific evaluation      procedure that enables the person to determine whether an      individual is under the influence of drugs and then to      determine the type of drug causing the observable impairment.     SEC. 5. MODEL STATUTE.       (a) In General.--Not later than one year after the date of      enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall develop and      provide to the States a model statute relating to drug      impaired driving which incorporates the provisions described      in this Act.       (b) Mandatory Provisions.--Provisions of the model statute      developed by the Secretary for recommendation to the States      under this section shall include, at a minimum, a provision      that the crime of drug impaired driving is committed when a      person operates a motor vehicle--       (1) while any detectable amount of a controlled substance      is present in the person's body, as measured in the person's      blood, urine, saliva, or other bodily substance; or       (2) due to the presence of a controlled substance or a      controlled substance in combination with alcohol or an      inhalant, or both, in the person's body, the person's mental      or physical faculties are affected to a noticeable or      perceptible degree.       (c) Discretionary Provisions.--Provisions of the model      statute developed by the Secretary for recommendation to the      States under this section may include the following:       (1) Sanctions for refusing to submit to a test for the      presence of a controlled substance in a person's body which      are equivalent to sanctions for a positive test result.
