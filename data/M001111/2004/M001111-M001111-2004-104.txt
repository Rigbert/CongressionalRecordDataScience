 President, it has come to my attention that there was an error in processing my amendment to increase funding for, and make other improvements to, the Federal Highway Administration Ferry Boat Discretionary Program.  My amendment was included in the SAFETEA authorization bill, and I want to confirm with my colleagues the correct funding level for the record so there is no confusion.  Prior to my amendment being sent to the desk, I had reached agreement with all the majority and minority managers of the bill to increase funding for the ferry program to the level of $120 million per year in the SAFETEA authorization bill.  Unfortunately, it appears that, in the processing of the final amendments to the bill, the amendment making this change was not the amendment that was sent to the desk and enrolled by the bill clerk.  To clarify the record, I would like to ask my colleague, Chairman Inhofe, what is his understanding of the level that is agreed upon for the ferry program in the SAFETEA authorization bill?
