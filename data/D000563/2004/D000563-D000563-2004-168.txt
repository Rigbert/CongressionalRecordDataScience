I will be happy to yield after I make my statement.  I just pray that we can reach a point where we can get to these bills before anything serious happens in America. But I know in my State of Illinois and in every other State there are units of local government as well as law enforcement units and those who are looking for the resources to be able to respond to a national emergency.  If something serious should occur, God forbid, it is not likely that people will be calling the Senate switchboard. They are going to be dialing 911. They are going to be hoping that on the other end of the line there will be a police department, a fire department, an ambulance, or a hospital that can respond extremely quickly. And the question is, obviously: Are we doing all we should do on a timely basis to provide the resources to these units of local government?  Secretary Ridge said today--and I have the highest respect for him; he is an old friend. I came to Congress with him over 20 years ago. He was an excellent appointment by the President. But he said how much we rely on State and local first responders. If that is the case, wouldn't we want to move as quickly as possible to make resources available for them so they can be prepared to defend America? That is why we should consider this legislation.  The Senator from California, Mrs. Boxer, came to the Senate floor today and made the same unanimous consent request to go to these issues. Again, the majority said no, we are not going to consider these issues. There is nothing more important. I would hope we would move to them quickly.  I yield to the Senator from Alaska for a question.
