Speaker, I want to thank the esteemed ranking member of New York (Mr. Engel), a dear friend, for yielding time in support of the Ukraine Support Act, H.R. 4278, and for his leadership from the time we traveled to Ukraine together well over a decade ago; and to Congressman Royce, the chairman of the committee, to reaffirm America's strong support for liberty and the people of Ukraine at this really critical time in world history and the history of Central and Eastern Europe.  The assistance that is contemplated here is in the form of a loan guarantee and will aid Ukraine's efforts to recover its own missing assets to pay the money back. Ukraine is fully capable of earning its way forward. It is already the third largest grain exporter in the world, so this is nothing that can't be repaid.  In addition, the bill authorizes $10 million for international broadcasting to Ukraine. I can guarantee you--I did an interview with Voice of America about a week ago--I received emails from people in Ukraine. They are waiting to hear the song of liberty.  Let us sing it loudly by passing this legislation quickly on a bipartisan basis and stand for freedom when it matters most.
