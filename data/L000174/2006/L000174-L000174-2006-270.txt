President, I am pleased that the Senate will pass a bill providing needed corrections to the Violence Against Women Act, VAWA, and the Department of Justice authorization bill we passed last year.  Among the improvements made in the amendment, the changes ensure that the VAWA public housing provisions allow a landlord to bifurcate a lease to evict an abuser while allowing a cosigning lessee as well as an authorized resident to remain as tenants. The bill also makes technical improvements in the administration of STOP grants and the Campus Grant Program. The bill improves the administration of grants to tribal governments and ensures that the 10-percent designation of VAWA grants to Indian tribes applies throughout all sections of the law.  I commend the efforts of all those who worked hard to improve this important law, and I am glad to support the improvements in this amendment that will sustain this law as a vital tool in our efforts to put an end to domestic violence.  In the last 25 years I believe that we have only been successful twice in passing authorization bills for the Department of Justice. I was pleased to be involved in both of them, working with Chairman Sensenbrenner and the Republican leader on the Senate Judiciary Committee at the time. This bill improves the most recent authorization we considered and passed in a bipartisan manner.                          ____________________
