Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ms. Lesley Kilp Haenny inthe Department of the Interior, Bureau of Ocean Energy Management on the occasion of her departure from the Bureau's Office of Congressional Affairs.  Ms. Haenny is ending her federal service to join her husband, Jeremy Haenny, a Staff Sergeant in the U.S. Air Force, who was deployed three times to Afghanistan and recently transferred to the State of Washington.  Ms. Haenny distinguished herself through exceptional service while serving as a Congressional Liaison for the Bureau's Office of Congressional Affairs. Many Members of this chamber and our staffs have had the pleasure of working with Ms. Haenny over her four-and-a-half years of service with the Bureau.  Every day she provided key support for not only the Bureau and the Department of the Interior but also in assisting every Member of Congress and the constituents they serve. During her time in the Liaison office, Mrs. Haenny was instrumental in ensuring successful communication that kept Members of this body informed of the Bureau's activities in managing the nation's vital offshore energy resources, both renewable and conventional, in a way that ensures environmentally and economically responsible development. Her keen abilities in organization and interpersonal relationships were critical to the timely and successful communications with this body on the mission and program operations of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management.  I would like to express my deepest appreciation to Mr. and Mrs. Haenny for their exemplary service to our nation. I wish them safe travels and continued success in this new endeavor.                          ____________________
