 President, I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding the adjournment of the Senate, when the Senate receives from the House a correcting resolution relating to the Treasury-Transportation conference report, the text of which is identical to the concurrent resolution at the desk, the concurrent resolution be considered and agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.
