 President, I am happy to talk to the chairman of the Appropriations Committee in order to work out a time agreement. I do have more I would like to say. This amendment is extremely serious. It is an emergency. We would like some more time, so I am happy to talk to the chairman about having an agreement on time, if he would like to do that.
