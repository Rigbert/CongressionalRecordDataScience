Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Because the irony is Members are put in a position where they have no alternative by the Rules Committee because their amendments are not made in order, which may well have been supported by the overwhelming majority of the House of Representatives, and that is the position that Members are put in on a regular basis. The situation, I suggest to the gentleman, does, in fact change when an amendment is defeated, and a Member then has a new judgment to make. That was my point.  Mr. LaHOOD. I take your point.                          ____________________
