President, I thank the Senator for his amendment and for working with us on this committee. I am sure he is aware the amendment concerns a large number of tribal communities in Oklahoma, as well as those in South Dakota. I believe right now we have the largest percentage of Native Americans per capita of any of the States.  This amendment has been cleared on both sides. I ask the Senator from Vermont if it is the Senator's wish to go ahead and accept this now, if this has been cleared on the minority side.
