President, I take this opportunity to acknowledge a very important deed this body has accomplished prior to the conclusion of the 109th Congress. Despite some incredible obstacles and limited time we have succeeded in protecting real health insurance coverage for low-income, working Americans.  The State Children's Health Insurance Program, SCHIP, which I am proud to have helped establish in 1997, has made a difference in expanding health insurance coverage to low-income children around this country. In previous years, Congress has stood up for low-income children and produced the additional funding necessary to keep the SCHIP program running. A number of states are again facing urgent shortfalls in their SCHIP allotments in fiscal year 2007. I was deeply disappointed when the tax extenders package did not include, as expected, a modest proposal to help those states facing immediate shortfalls in their SCHIP budgets.  Not so long ago, Rhode Island could proudly claim it had the lowest rate of uninsured children in the country. The latest Census Bureau report is now showing a different picture--the number of uninsured children rose a full percentage point, from 5.8 percent to 6.8 percent from 2004 to 2005. My state has worked hard over the past decade to build a children's health insurance program that has become a model for the nation. Yet, Rhode Island is anticipated to be the first of several states in a funding shortfall next year. Specifically, my state is facing a $43 million shortfall and will have only 32 percent of the funding necessary to sustain SCHIP in 2007. These dollars mean the difference between thousands of children, pregnant women, and families getting access to health care or not getting the care they need at all.  Included with the reauthorization of the National Institutes of Health, NIH, is a modest bipartisan proposal to defer the shortfalls that would negatively impact the SCHIP program in my state as well as several others. This additional time is needed to work on a more permanent solution to the chronic shortfalls and other structural issues that should be addressed in the context of SCHIP reauthorization next year.  I would be remiss if I did not extend my sincere gratitude to the Democratic leader, Senator Harry Reid, and his staff, particularly Kate Leone, for their understanding, tenacity, and tireless effort in making this possible. I would also like to thank my colleague from Montana, Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Max Baucus, and his staff for all of their hard work in putting together a carefully crafted stopgap measure, and I look forward to working with him on the equally challenging task of SCHIP reauthorization next year.  In the waning hours of the 109th Congress, we have taken a small but important step to maintain our commitment to America's children.                          ____________________
