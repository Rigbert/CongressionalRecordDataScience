President, before he leaves the floor, I just want to commend the distinguished Senator from Utah on all his extraordinary work in the health care field. If you look at what the Senator from Utah has achieved in the S-CHIP area, his work that led to the Hatch-Waxman legislation, and what he has done on a whole host of health care issues, the senior Senator from Utah has made an extraordinary contribution.  As we begin this discussion on Medicare reform, I commend the Senator from Utah on an excellent statement. I think the Senate will have another success over the next few weeks. After the Senator's success on S-CHIP, Hatch-Waxman, community health centers, and other areas, there will be yet another significant milestone the Senator from Utah will have helped to achieve in the health care area. He and I are working on a variety of initiatives now. I commend the Senator on an excellent statement and wish to associate myself with his remarks.
