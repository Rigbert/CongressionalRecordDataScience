 Our legislation would have provided financial assistance to low-income Medicare beneficiaries who cannot afford Medicare premiums and it would have finally moved us forward on the issue of mental health parity. This is an issue that is long overdue. There are millions of American families who are struggling with mental health issues. They understand that the high copayments for mental health services in effect deny service to a lot of those who cannot afford them. We wanted to address that in the bill. We thought it was a priority. The Senator from Kentucky in his measure they brought before us did not include that, and that is unfortunate.  I say to the Senator from Kentucky, I believe in the battle of ideas on the floor of the Senate. Looking back, in the time I have been here I have lost a lot of amendments on the floor. I have come here, brought the amendments, debated them, subjected them to a vote, and lost. But it was a fair fight. People spoke on both sides of the issue. The Senate spoke. That is how it should be. If the majority prevails, then we move forward. That is the only way this body can work.  But the Republicans have now taken a new approach and that approach is: We will not debate issues. We will not deliberate them. It is a take-it-or-leave-it situation. Seventy-seven filibusters have been used now. They are stopping this Medicare bill. Then when they realize how bad it looks back home--when they know they cannot explain it to seniors and disabled when the doctors who treat them say we are about to take a 10-percent pay cut and I may not be able to see you--they understand it is hard to explain that vote. So then they come to the floor and make a unanimous consent request to say let's drop in a bill and take care of the whole problem.  That is not the way the Senate works either. We don't want to turn the Senate into the House, but the Republican strategy is turning the Senate into a ghost town. We don't do anything here. We have procedural votes three or four times a week and then go home. If those in the Senate were paid on the basis of debate, deliberation, amendments, bills passed and that kind of effort, we would not earn a minimum wage around here because we never get to the substance anymore. There were 77 Republican filibusters so far, the latest on the energy issue.  For the Senator from Kentucky to come forward and say the reason we could not support the idea of moving forward on these energy tax credit extenders was because they involved a tax--do you know who was going to pay that tax? Companies that locate overseas, American companies that go overseas trying to avoid our taxes would have been subject to more taxes. The Senator from Kentucky is saying 41 of his members have taken a solemn pledge not to raise the taxes of those American companies that go overseas to avoid paying American taxes. How about that? Is that what we need in America, more incentives to take jobs offshore?  Senator Baucus in the Finance Committee had a reasonable approach to this, taking that money and putting it back into America for tax breaks for our families and to encourage energy production for our future, and the Republicans voted no--time and again they vote no. But the American people will have a final vote on November 4. They will remember the party that is trying to move forward an agenda to make this a better nation and they will remember the party of filibusters that votes no.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
