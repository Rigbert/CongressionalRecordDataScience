 President, I wish to pay tribute to Charles Carr, who passed away on December 2, 2010, following a life dedicated to service, family, and his community. He was a personal friend and, along with his family, I mourn his passing.  A native of Blount County, AL, Charles was a graduate of Oneonta High School and Snead State Junior College. After earning his bachelor's and master's degree in education from Auburn University, Charles began his distinguished career as an educator in the Blount County public schools. Later, he taught at Snead State Junior College and Wallace State Community College. Charles was a well-liked and admired educator by his former colleagues and students.  After serving 13 years in the classroom, his love of teaching and public service led him to Alabama's State capitol where he served on the staff and in the cabinet for Governors George Wallace and Guy Hunt as the director of postsecondary education. There, he also served as a mentor to many of those who would cross his path and give a helping hand to those who felt they did not have a voice. In doing so, he built a wide network of friends across the State.  After leaving the government to work as a private consultant, Charles joined Community Bank. Later, in 2002, he became the executive director of the Blount County-Oneonta Chamber of Commerce, a position that brought him joy and satisfaction. He was deeply committed to his community and I know that he enjoyed promoting it through his position with the chamber.  While Charles had great success in his career, he was first and foremost a family man. He was devoted to his cherished wife and son and enjoyed spending time with his extended family. He is survived by his wife Brenda Maynor Carr of Union Grove; son Jonathan Elliott Carr of Washington, DC; and two brothers, Jim Carr of Oneonta and Ken Carr of Houston, TX.  I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing and honoring the life of my friend, Charles Carr. He will be greatly missed by all who knew him.                          ____________________
