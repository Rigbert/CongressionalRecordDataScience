 President, I hope we follow the advice of the Senator. We know this is the right thing to do. We know this is the right thing to do.  We know it is, as a minimum, worthy of scientific study to determine whether this can be done with efficacy. And we also know--I do not fully understand, frankly--we also know there are certain interests that do not want that to happen. Because they are fearful--the only thing I can conclude, Senator, is they are fearful that the study will come forward and say, ``Guess what? You can do this without in any way diminishing the effectiveness of fertilizers used for agriculture.''  Because, obviously, if the study is going to come back and say you cannot do this without diminishing significantly the capacity of the fertilizer to function, that cannot worry them because if that is the case we are not going to do it. There is no way that would get done here.  So I always am confused by this response. I was confused in 1973 about why people responded the way they did. I hope we will not let interests that I do not fully understand sidetrack even a study. I might point out, by the way, with regard to taggants, originally the people who are now opposing the Senator's language and the President's language were opposed to even a study before. Now they are for a study. I hope we can just bypass--not have to go through another 10 years before we get to the point where they see their way clear, suggesting we can even look at a study.
