In fact, that is what I said again this morning. If we had the memoranda, something Mr. Estrada said he is perfectly willing to let us have but the administration wouldn't let him, but if we had the memoranda, if we were able to ask what he meant by this or that in the memoranda, once that was done, if he answered those questions, whether I agreed or disagreed with the answers to the questions, this Senator at least is perfectly willing to have it go forward on a vote, which is basically what we did with numerous other Democratic and Republican nominees in the past in similar circumstances. I don't want there to be any question about that.  This Senator is perfectly willing to have this matter come to a vote once Mr. Estrada did what he has said that he is perfectly willing to do--make available his memoranda and answer questions about them. So far only the administration has refused, and the distinguished Democratic leader and I wrote a letter to the President to that effect.
