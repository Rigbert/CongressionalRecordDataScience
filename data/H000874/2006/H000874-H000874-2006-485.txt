Leader, not since you have been leader, but in times past, as you know, our side of the aisle has been very concerned about the way conferences have proceeded. Senator Enzi, who is one of the Chairs of the, I guess, the pension conference, has indicated he wanted to see a bipartisan conference, a full conference, a conference, frankly, as I historically remember them.  My understanding, frankly, is from both now, the two ranking Democrats of the relevant committees, particularly the ranking Democrat of the Ways and Means Committee, but also the ranking Democrat, I guess, of the Education and Labor Committee, there is a concern that the conference is now proceeding essentially in a partisan fashion, that is to say, Democrats are not being included in the discussions. In fact, we believe that Mr. Thomas is negotiating the tax and pension provision with Republicans as if the two conferences were one.  I want to tell you, Mr. Leader, obviously, we have some substantial concerns about that, as we have had in the past in terms of our ability to participate in putting our views forth in the conferences themselves. I don't know whether you have any comment on that, but I would be certainly very interested to hear it so I could relate to my colleagues what they might expect.  I yield to my friend, the majority leader.
