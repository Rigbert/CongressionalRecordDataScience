 Senators Murkowski and Cantwell are working with Members on both sides of the aisle to debate and offer amendments to the bill. Now that we have overcome the Democratic filibuster on the motion to proceed to this bill, Senators are free to come to offer their amendments. The tree has not been filled and Chairman Murkowski is managing an orderly process to alternate amendments between the two sides.                          ____________________
