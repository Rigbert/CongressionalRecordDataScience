Mr. Speaker, as the Chairman of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, I had the great honor to serve as the Chairman of the conference committee for H.R. 3, SAFETEA-LU.  The conference committee had to reach agreement on a broad range of issues to be able to send a bill to the President that he could sign. I want to take this opportunity to clarify what I believe was the intent of the conferees concerning the language that became section 5508, the Transportation Technology Innovation and Demonstration Program. This provision extended a program that began under TEA-21. TEA-21 promised that the initial system contemplated by the program would be built out in greater than 40 areas. I have been a long-standing supporter of this public/private partnership that helps travelers avoid highway traffic congestion. It is currently providing up-to-date and accurate traveler information in areas across the country.  I believe it was the conferees intent that all of the existing $54 million that has been provided for the current contracting team would be used to carry out the existing contract to deploy the current highway congestion information system under Part I. I believe it was our intention that Part I funds would stay in Part I. In this way, if deployment areas do not take advantage of all of the obligated funds, congested cities will have the opportunity to benefit from the $54 million that is currently obligated under Part I and will be able to proceed under the existing contract with the existing contractor. TEA-21 promised that the initial system would be built out in greater than 40 areas and staying the course with the existing contractor is an important element of keeping that promise. Any funds appropriated for Part II would be recycled within Part II.  Because there is a 180-day clock running for areas to consent to participate in the program, I respectfully urge that USDOT quickly get implementing guidance to the field that is consistent with this intent.                          ____________________
