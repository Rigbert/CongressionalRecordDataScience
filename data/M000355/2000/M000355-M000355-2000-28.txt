 President, earlier this year the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies held an organizational meeting to officially begin preparations for the next Presidential Inauguration hosted by Congress to be held on Saturday, January 20, 2001.  Next year marks more historic milestones as it will be the 200th anniversary of the first Presidential Inauguration in our Nation's Capital, the first Presidential Inauguration of the 21st Century, and, not least of all, the first inauguration of the new millennium. 2001 also marks the 100th birthday of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, an entity which I am greatly honored to serve as Chairman.  As we approach adjournment for this Congress, let us look forward with great anticipation and excitement to our Nation's 54th Presidential Inauguration and celebrate this remarkable American tradition in which the peaceful transference of power takes place with all our citizens as witnesses.  In 1789, our Nation's Father and first President, George Washington, recited the oath of office on the Balcony of Federal Hall in New York City. By 1801, the seat of the U.S. Government had moved from New York City, to Philadelphia, and finally to Washington, D.C.  On March 4, 1801, Thomas Jefferson became the first President to be inaugurated at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., in a room now known as the ``Old Supreme Court Chamber.'' In 1829, Andrew Jackson became the first President to be inaugurated on the East Front of the Capitol, where the majority of swearing-in ceremonies continued to take place until the late twentieth century. It was not until President Ronald Reagan's inauguration on January 20, 1981, that the swearing-in ceremony moved to the West Front of the Capitol where larger crowds could be accommodated. Though below-freezing temperatures in 1985 forced the second Reagan inaugural ceremony inside to the Capitol Rotunda, the West Front set the standard for the next three Congressionally hosted ceremonies. The 2001 Presidential inaugural ceremonies will continue that tradition.  It is interesting to note that until 1901 the Presidential inaugural ceremonies were planned and conducted solely by the Senate. A century later, the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies brings together the Senate and the House of Representatives in welcoming America's President-elect to the Capitol for the public swearing-in ceremony.  Upon undertaking this endeavor, it became apparent that steps needed to be taken to direct that the important historic materials generated by the JCCIC were preserved. For a committee reconstituted every four years, these documents are critical tools for conducting this massive quadrennial event. To ensure these materials are preserved in an appropriate manner, I am introducing a resolution to establish the procedures for archiving the records of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a press release which documents the May 24 organizational meeting of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies and the text of Senate Concurrent Resolutions 89 and 90 be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:U.S. Senator Mitch McConnell Named Chairman of the Joint Congressional                    Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies       Washington, DC.--U.S. Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY),      Chairman of the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration,      today was appointed Chairman of the Joint Congressional      Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies.       Joining McConnell on the committee are Majority Leader      Trent Lott (R-MS), Senator Christopher Dodd (D-CT), Speaker      of the House J. Dennis Hastert (R-IL), House Majority Leader      Richard Armey (R-TX) and House Minority Leader Richard      Gephardt (D-MO).       The members met today and appointed McConnell as the      Chairman of the Joint Congressional Committee, approved the      committee's budget and selected the West Front of the Capitol      for the location of the ceremony. McConnell is the third      Kentuckian to Chair the Congressional Committee since it was      formed in 1901.       ``I am truly honored to have been selected as Chairman of      this Congressional Inaugural Committee,'' said McConnell. ``I      look forward to the extraordinary privilege of planning the      first Presidential Inauguration of the 21st century.''       The JCCIC is charged with the planning and execution of the      Inaugural activities at the Capitol: the swearing-in ceremony      and the traditional luncheon which follows.       The Presidential Inauguration will be held Saturday,      January 20, 2001.                                  ____                            S. Con.

The joint committee is authorized to make the      necessary arrangements for the inauguration of the President-     elect and Vice President-elect of the United States on      January 20, 2001.

The joint committee--       (1) is authorized to utilize appropriate equipment and the      services of appropriate personnel of departments and agencies      of the Federal Government, under arrangements between the      joint committee and the heads of those departments and      agencies, in connection with the inaugural proceedings and      ceremonies; and       (2) may accept gifts and donations of goods and services to      carry out its responsibilities.                                  ____                            S. Con. Res. 90       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives      concurring),     SECTION 1. USE OF THE ROTUNDA OF THE CAPITOL.
