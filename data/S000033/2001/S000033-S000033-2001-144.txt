 Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time.  Mr. Speaker, the Republican proposal is grossly unfair and grossly irresponsible. At a time when millions of middle-class families are struggling to keep their heads above water, the Republican proposal provides 43 percent of the tax breaks to the wealthiest 1 percent, the people who need it the least, and 12 percent of the benefits to the bottom 60 percent of the people who need it the most.  Equally important, by providing a huge $1.6 trillion tax break, there will not be money available in future years to help us in Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, veterans needs, and education. Can we afford a tax cut? Yes. It should be smaller than the President's, and it should be geared to the middle class and not the wealthy. Support the Rangel substitute.
