 This has been a happy experience. We can proudly recommend to all Members of the Senate today that they vote in favor of an important new piece of legislation that goes right to the core of what our democracy is all about; that is, the ability to vote.  This legislation will make a positive difference in our country, and is a step forward for our democracy. This bill has been fashioned in a way that I wish we could produce more legislation, which is in a bipartisan fashion.  I enthusiastically support this bill and urge all of my Republican colleagues--in fact, all of our colleagues in the Senate--to proudly vote for this legislation.  I yield back the remainder of my time.                           Amendment No. 2907
