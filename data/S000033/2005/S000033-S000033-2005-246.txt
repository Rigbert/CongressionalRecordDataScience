 Speaker, ten years ago the Howard Center for Human Services was established. It is a remarkable organization, one which provides essential services to the citizens of four counties in northern Vermont. Although its origins are in the nineteenth century, its earliest forebearer was a ladies' aid and relief society in 1873. Its willingness to join together several different NGOs in 1994, overriding several smaller portfolios in the interest of providing a broad umbrella of services to the community, is testimony to its commitment to serving the needs of Vermont.  The focus of its staff and programs is on developmental disabilities, those with mental problems, and on children, youth and families who face difficulties of many sorts. It serves those in crisis and those with ongoing problems. Altogether, the Howard Center serves over 15,000 Vermont residents each year through Howard Community Services, the Baird Center, and Adult Behavioral Health Services. It does so efficiently, dedicating almost 90 percent of its budget directly to programs and outreach for those thousands of Vermonters in need of the services it provides.  The Howard Center provides accredited services in the areas of mental health, alcohol and other drug addictions programs, family services, and employment services. Its many programs range from crisis intervention and stabilization to outpatient treatment, case management services coordination, community housing, residential treatment, job development and supports, and criminal justice service case management. In addition to a dedicated staff and hundreds of contracted workers supporting individuals and families in their homes and in the community, 500 volunteers help the Howard Center meet the needs of our friends and neighbors in northern Vermont.  I could go on at length about the individual programs of the Howard Center, but in the interest of time I will mention just one, one that is representative of the remarkable commitment and innovation that the Howard Center brings to providing human services to northern Vermont. The Streetwork program provides daily assistance and support to people with psychiatric disabilities, and to those dealing with substance abuse, homelessness and other unmet social service needs; it provides those services on the main streets of downtown Burlington, by going out to people rather than waiting for them to come into offices or clinics.  In these difficult times, when the middle class is under siege and shrinking and low income families see the social safety net in shreds, when fringe benefits for many jobs axe disappearing and more people are medically uninsured, when low and moderate income housing is often unavailable, the Howard Center provides a bulwark and a refuge to those who are in need of social services. I congratulate them on the past ten years, and look forward to a new decade in which they continue to sustain tens of thousands of Vermonters.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Page E2]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                      TEN YEARS OF STELLAR SERVICE                                 ______                                                           HON.
