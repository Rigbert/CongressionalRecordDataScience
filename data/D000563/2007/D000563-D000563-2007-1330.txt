President, why hold off for tomorrow what we can do today? The current healthcare crisis in our Nation did not happen overnight. It has been accumulating as a result of a lack of serious attention to the most pressing healthcare issues, including healthcare workforce shortages. As a husband and a parent, I pray every day that my wife and children will have access to the quality healthcare they deserve when they need it. As a public official, I believe that it is my responsibility to help make that care available for not only my own family, but also for the families in the State of Illinois and across the Nation.  The growing shortage of critical care physicians undermines the quality and availability of health care services in the United States. This shortage can be expected to disproportionately impact rural and other areas of the United States that already often suffer from a sub-optimal level of critical care services. When a loved one needs a critical care doctor, would we not want one to be available? If research tells us that their recovery may be better and their recovery time faster, would we not want our loved one to have access to a critical care doctor?  The Leap Frog Group has clearly documented that significant improvement in outcomes--in both quality and cost--result when a critically ill or injured patient is seen by an intensivist. With a greater use of intensivists, an estimated 54,000 deaths that currently occur in ICUs could be avoided. Unfortunately, only one-third of our critically ill citizens are treated by physicians and nurses specifically trained to manage their complex health issues.  In June 2003, Congress asked the Health Resources and Services Administration--HRSA--to examine the healthcare needs of a growing population and the availability of pulmonary and critical care physicians. In its May 2006 report to Congress entitled ``The Critical Care Workforce: A Study of the Supply and Demand for Critical Care Physicians,'' HRSA found that the country does not have enough physicians trained in critical care medicine to treat all those in need of the care. The report projected future demand for these services and found that, as a result of having to staff ICUs with critical care doctors, a total of 4,300 intensivist physicians will be needed when only 2,800 are available. The HRSA report recognized that the demand in the United States for critical care medical services is rising sharply and will continue to do so.  To proactively address the healthcare needs of our nation, I am pleased to join with my colleague Senator Crapo today to introduce legislation to address the looming shortage of critical care providers. Our bill, The Patient-Focused Critical Care Enhancement Act authorizes a series of modest and sensible measures that--if enacted now instead of waiting for this shortage to worsen--can help to obviate the problem.  First, the Patient-Focused Critical Care Enhancement Act would direct the Agency for Health Research and Quality to assess the current state of and recommend ``best practices'' for critical care medicine. The authorization of demonstration projects on innovations in ICU services and on family-centered, multi-disciplinary approaches to critical care services are important for determining how to improve the quality of the care delivered and how to best make use of our existing resources of critical care doctors.  Our bill would also expand telemedicine opportunities for critical care physicians to promote efforts relating to critical care and ensure that all communities have greater access to this important, lifesaving care. For our rural communities and medically underserved areas, the need for critical care doctors is exacerbated. This bill will hopefully expand the effectiveness of existing critical care providers in environments where intensivists are in short supply.  Finally, to address the supply problem, the bill would allow for the National Health Service Corps to support and encourage critical care providers to practice in medically underserved areas.  The Patient-Focused Critical Care Enhancement Act is strongly endorsed by the key medical specialty societies and patient groups involved in critical care medicine, including the American College of Chest Physicians, the American Thoracic Society, the Society for Critical Care Medicine, the Association of Critical Care Nurses and the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Foundation.  This multipronged approach is to look at both short term and long term solutions to a growing concern. But in today's complex healthcare situation, multiple solutions are a necessity. We do not want to face this shortage in the future in a direr situation as the nursing shortage currently is.  The answer to the opening question is simple. We must not hold off for tomorrow what we can do today, and we must not wait for our healthcare crisis to worsen. Our country will face a critical care workforce shortage. I want my family to have access to the best quality care when they need it, and this includes having access to a critical care doctor. Passage of the Patient-Focused Critical Care Enhancement Act is a step in that direction.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 718       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Patient-Focused Critical      Care Enhancement Act''.     SEC. 2. PURPOSE.       The purpose of this Act is to optimize the delivery of      critical care medicine and expand the critical care      workforce.     SEC. 3. FINDINGS.       Based on the Health Resources and Services Administration's      May 2006 Report to Congress, The Critical Care Workforce: A      Study of the Supply and Demand for Critical Care Physicians,      the Senate makes the following findings:       (1) In 2000, an estimated 18,000,000 inpatient days of ICU      care were provided in the United States through approximately      59,000 ICU beds in 3,200 hospitals.       (2) Patient outcomes and the quality of care in the ICU are      related to who delivers that care and how care is organized.       (3) The demand in the United States for critical care      medical services is rising sharply and will continue to rise      sharply largely as a result of the following 3 factors:       (A) There is strong evidence demonstrating improvements in      outcomes and efficiency when intensive care services are      provided by nurses and intensivist physicians who have      advanced specialty training in critical care medicine.       (B) The Leapfrog Group, health care payors, and providers      are encouraging greater use of such personnel in intensive      care settings.       (C) Critical care services are overwhelmingly consumed by      patients over the age of 65 and the aging of the United      States population is driving demand for these services.       (4) The future growth in the number of critical care      physicians in ICU settings will be insufficient to keep pace      with growing demand.       (5) This growing shortage of critical care physicians      presents a serious threat to the quality and availability of      health care services in the United States.       (6) This shortage will disproportionately impact rural and      other areas of the United States that already often suffer      from a suboptimal level of critical care services.     SEC. 4. RESEARCH.       (a) In General.--The Secretary of Health and Human      Services, through the Agency for Healthcare Research and      Quality, shall conduct research to assess--       (1) the standardization of critical care protocols,      intensive care unit layout, equipment interoperability, and      medical informatics;       (2) the impact of differences in staffing, organization,      size, and structure of intensive care units on access,      quality, and efficiency of care; and       (3) coordinated community and regional approaches to      providing critical care services, including approaches      whereby critical care patients are assessed and provided care      based upon intensity of services required.       (b) Report.--Not later than 18 months after the date of      enactment of this Act, the Agency for Healthcare Research and      Quality shall submit a report to Congress, that, based on the      review under subsection (a), evaluates and makes      recommendations regarding best practices in critical care      medicine.     SEC. 5. INNOVATIVE APPROACHES TO CRITICAL CARE SERVICES.       The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall undertake      the following demonstration projects:       (1) Optimization of critical care services.--       (A) In general.--The Administrator of the Centers for      Medicare & Medicaid Services shall solicit proposals      submitted by inpatient providers of critical care services      who propose to demonstrate methods to optimize the provision      of critical care services to Medicare beneficiaries through      innovations in such areas as staffing, ICU arrangement, and      utilization of technology.       (B) Funding of proposals.--The Administrator of the Centers      for Medicare & Medicaid Services shall fund not more than 5      proposals, not less than 1 of which shall focus on the      training of hospital-based physicians in rural or community,      or both, hospital facilities in the provision of critical      care medicine. Such projects shall emphasize outcome measures      based on the Institute of Medicine's following 6 domains of      quality care:       (i) Care should be safe.       (ii) Care should be effective.       (iii) Care should be patient-centered.       (iv) Care should be timely.       (v) Care should be efficient.       (vi) Care should be equitable.       (2) Family assistance programs for the critically ill.--       (A) In general.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services      shall solicit proposals and make an award to support a      consortium consisting of 1 or more providers of inpatient      critical care services and a medical specialty society      involved in the education and training of critical care      providers.       (B) Measurement and evaluation.--A provider that receives      support under subparagraph (A) shall measure and evaluate      outcomes derived from a ``family-centered'' approach to the      provision of inpatient critical care services that includes      direct and sustained communication and contact with      beneficiary family members, involvement of family members in      the critical care decisionmaking process, and responsiveness      of critical care providers to family requests. Such project      shall evaluate the impact of a family-centered,      multiprofessional team approach on, and the correlation      between--       (i) family satisfaction;       (ii) staff satisfaction;       (iii) length of patient stay in an intensive care unit; and       (iv) cost of care.       (C) Outcome measures.--A provider that receives support      under subparagraph (A) shall emphasize outcome measures based      on the Institute of Medicine's following 6 domains of quality      care:       (i) Care should be safe.       (ii) Care should be effective.       (iii) Care should be patient-centered.       (iv) Care should be timely.       (v) Care should be efficient.       (vi) Care should be equitable.     SEC. 6.
