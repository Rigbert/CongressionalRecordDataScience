President, on January 12, Gen. Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan spoke to his people at a moment of great danger. Half a million Indian troops were massing on the border over the contentious issue of Kashmir, unresolved for over 50 years, and the December 13 terrorist attack on the Indian Parliament. Memories were still fresh of 100,000 demonstrators in the streets after September 11, praising Osama bin Laden and burning effigies of Musharraf and President Bush.  The speech was given to the nation of Pakistan, but it was followed closely by India and the West.  He made the choice facing Pakistan very clear. In his words, the ``day of reckoning'' had come. His nation must choose between the Kalishnikov culture of religious extremism and a progressive Islamic state. He made his case in terms far different than Western secular leaders. Speaking to his Muslim nation, he invoked the name of the Prophet Mohammad, the Koran and Islamic history and tradition.  If Osama bin Laden could find justification for his hate-filled extremism in a corruption of Islamic belief, Musharraf found tolerance, universal brotherhood and peace in Islam.  When we met with him 2 days later in the Presidential residence, he repeated the message in his speech that Islam teaches not only an obligation to God--Haqooq Allah--but also an obligation to others--Haqooq Al-ebad. And beyond the rhetoric of tolerance, he calls for a historic change in the madrassas, Islamic religious schools, so often identified with the memorization of the Koran, little or no education, and a breeding ground for hatred.  Pakistan's new jihad against illiteracy and poverty will require the madrassas to be religious schools, with a recognized curriculum, registered with the state; accredited in math, science and English, with trained teachers and foreign students deported if they are not legally in the country.  And he went further. All mosques are to be registered. Newer mosques require government permission and the loudspeakers outside the mosque, used traditionally for a call to prayer, cannot be used to incite hatred or extremism.  Musharraf told us that the public response to his revolutionary message has been positive, even among the Muslim clergy who met with him before it was given.  He believes that Pakistan, in his words, the ``Citadel of Islam,'' can show the world that the Muslim faith is consistent with the values of this new century.  If real peace and progress are to come to the Islamic world, we must help him succeed.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the speech be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:President General Pervez Musharaf's Address to the Nation, January 12,                                   2002       I begin in the name of God, the most Beneficent, the most      Merciful.       Pakistani Brothers and Sisters!       As you would remember, ever since I assumed office, I      launched a campaign to rid the society of extremism, violence      and terrorism and strived to project Islam in its true      perspective. In my first speech on October 17, 1999, I had      said and I quote; ``Islam teaches tolerance, not hatred;      universal brotherhood, not enmity; peace, and not violence. I      have a great respect for the Ulema and expect them to come      forward and present Islam in its true light. I urge them to      curb elements which are exploiting religion for vested      interests and bringing a bad     name to our faith''. After this, I initiated a number of      steps in this regard. First, in the year 2000, I started      interacting with the Taliban and counseled them to inculcate      tolerance and bring moderation in their ways. I also told      them that those terrorists who were involved in terrorist      acts in Pakistan and seeking refuge in Afghanistan should be      returned to us. Unfortunately, we did not succeed.       In the year 2001, I think it was January, we sealed the      Pak-Afghan borders and I gave directions that no students of      any Madarissah (religious seminaries) should be allowed to      cross into Afghanistan without relevant documents. After      this, I despatched a number of delegations to meet Mullah      Omar. I continued to advise them tolerance and balance.      Later, on February 15, 2001, we promulgated the Anti-     Weaponisation Ordinance. Through this law, we launched a de-     weaponisation campaign in Pakistan.       On 5th of June, on the occasion of the Seerat Conference, I      addressed Ulema belonging to all Schools of thought and spoke      firmly to them against religious extremism. On the 14th of      August 2001, we finally took a very important decision to ban      Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and Sipah-e-Muhammad and placed Sipah-e-     Sahaba and TJP (Tehrik-e-Jafria Pakistan) under observation.      In addition, on a number of occasions, I called Ulema and      Mashaikh and held extensive consultations with them.       The objective was to take them on board in our campaign      against terrorism and extremism. These measures have been      continuing since our government assumed office in 1999. I am      explaining all this to you in great detail only because of      the fact that the campaign against extremism undertaken by us      from the very beginning is in our own national interest. We      are not doing this under advice or pressure from anyone.       Rather, we are conscious that it is in our national      interest. We are conscious that we need to rid society of      extremism and this is being done right from the beginning.       This domestic reforms process was underway when a terrorist      attack took place against the United States on the 11th of      September. This terrorist act led to momentous changes all      over the world. We decided to join the international      coalition against terrorism and in this regard I have already      spoken to you on a number of occasions. We took this decision      on principles and in our national interest.       By the grace of God Almighty our decision was absolutely      correct. Our intentions were noble and God Almighty helped      us. I am happy to say that the vast majority of Pakistanis      stood by this decision and supported our decision. I am proud      of the realistic decision of our nation. What really pains me      is that some religious extremist parties and groups opposed      this decision. What hurts more was that their opposition was      not based on principles. At a critical juncture in our      history, they preferred their personal and party interests      over national interests.       They tried their utmost to mislead the nation, took out      processions and resorted to agitation. But their entire      efforts failed. The people of Pakistan frustrated their      designs. As I have said, I am proud of the people of Pakistan      who support correct decisions and do not pay heed to those      who try to mislead them.       I have interacted with the religious scholars on a number      of occasions and exchanged views with them. I am happy to say      that our discussions have been very fruitful. A majority of      them are blessed with wisdom and vision and they do not mix      religion with politics.       Some extremists, who were engaged in protests, are people      who try to monopolise and attempt to propagate their own      brand of religion.       They think as if others are not Muslims. These are the      people who considered the Taliban to be a symbol of Islam and      that the Taliban were bringing Islamic rennaissance or were      practising the purest form of Islam. They behaved as if the      Northern Alliance, against whom the Taliban were fighting,      were non-Muslims! Whereas, in fact, both were Muslims and      believers. These extremists were those people who do not talk      of ``Haqooqul Ibad'' (obligations towards fellow human      beings). They do not talk of these obligations because      practising them demands self-sacrifice. How will they justify      their Pajeros and expensive vehicles? I want to ask these      extremists as to who was responsible for misleading thousands      of Pakistanis to their massacre in Afghanistan? These misled      people were let down by the very people in whose support they      had gone. All of us should learn a lesson from this. We must      remember that we are Pakistanis. Pakistan is our identity,      our motherland.       We will be aliens outside Pakistan and be treated as      aliens. Pakistan is our land. It is our soil. If we forsake      it, we will face difficulties. This lesson we must learn.       Sectarian terrorism has been going on for years.       Every one of us is fed up of it. It is becoming unbearable.      Our peace-loving people are keen to get rid of the Klashinkov      and weapon culture. Every one is sick of it. It was      because of this that we banned Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and      Sipah-e-Muhammad. Yet little improvement occurred. The day      of reckoning has come.       Do we want Pakistan to become a theocratic state? Do we      believe that religious education alone is enough for      governance or do we want Pakistan to emerge as a progressive      and dynamic Islamic welfare state? The verdict of the masses      is in favour of a progressive Islamic state. This decision,      based on the teaching of the Holy Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him)      and in line with the teachings of Quaid-e-Azam and Allama      Iqbal will put Pakistan on the path of progress and      prosperity.       Let us honestly analyse what the few religious extremists      have attempted to do with Pakistan and Islam.       First, with regard to Afghanistan, they indulged in      agitational activities. Look at the damage it has caused!      Pakistan's international image was tarnished and we were      projected by the international media as ignorant and      backward. Our economy suffered. A number of export orders      already placed with Pakistani industry were cancelled and no      new orders materialised. This led to closure of some      factories and unemployment. The poor daily wage earners lost      their livelihood. Extremists also formed a Pakistan-     Afghanistan Defence Council! Apart from damaging Pakistan,      they had negative thinking and had no idea of anything good      for Afghanistan. Did they ever think of bringing about peace      to Afghanistan through reconciliation among the Taliban and      Northern Alliance? Did they counsel tolerance to them? Did      they ever think of collecting funds for the welfare,      rehabilitation and reconstruction of the war-ravaged      Afghanistan, or to mitigate sufferings of the poor Afghan      people? Did they think of a solution to the hunger, poverty      and destruction in Afghanistan? To my knowledge, only Maulana      Abdul Sattar Edhi, God bless him, and some foreign NGOs and      the UN organisations were providing the Afghans with food and      medicines.       These extremists did nothing except contributing to      bloodshed in Afghanistan. I ask of them, whether they know      any thing other then disruption and sowing seeds of hatred?      Does Islam preach this?       Now, let us see their activity outside Afghanistan.       They initiated sectarian feuds.       Sects and different schools of thought in Islam have      existed since long. There is nothing wrong with intellectual      differences flowing from freedom of thought as long as such      differences remain confined to intellectual debates. Look at      what this extremist minority is doing? They are indulging in      fratricidal killings. There is no tolerance among them.       Quaid-e-Azam declared that Pakistan belonged to followers      of all religions; that every one would be treated equally.      However, what to speak of other religions, Muslims have      started killing each other.       I think, these people have declared more Muslims as Kafirs      (infidels) than motivating the non-Muslims to embrace Islam.      Look at the damage they have caused?       They have murdered a number of our highly qualified      doctors, engineers, civil servants and teachers who were      pillars of our society. Who has suffered? The families of the      dead, no doubt. But a greater loss was inflicted on Pakistan      because, as I said, we lost the pillars of our society. These      extremists did not stop here. They started killing other      innocent people in mosques and places of worship.       Today, people are scared of entering these sacred places of      worship. It is a matter of shame that police have to be      posted outside for their protection. We claim Islam as Deen      or a complete way of life.       Is this the way of life that Islam teaches us? That we      fight amongst ourselves and feel scared of fellow Muslims,      scared of visiting our places of worship where police have to      be deputed outside for protection? Mosques are being misused      for propagating and inciting hatred against each other's sect      and beliefs and against the Government, too.       I would like to inform you that a number of terrorist rings      have been apprehended. In Karachi, the Inspector General of      Police, while briefing me, informed that the leader of one of      these groups is the Pesh Imam (Prayer Leader) of a Mosque in      Malir. The Imam has confessed to murdering many people      himself. This is the state of affairs. To what purpose are we      using our mosques for? These people have made a state within      a state and have challenged the writ of the government.       Now, I would like to dwell upon the subject of Madaris or      Religious Schools in some detail. These schools are excellent      welfare set-ups where the poor get free board and lodge. In      my opinion, no NGO can match their welfare aspects. Many of      the madaris are imparting excellent education. In addition to      religious teachings, other subjects such as science education      and computer training are also being imparted there.       I am thankful to them for undertaking excellent welfare      measures without State funding. I would also like to say that      I have projected madaris internationally and with various      heads of states time and again.       I think no one else in Pakistan has done so much for their      cause. However, there are some negative aspects of some      madrassahs. These few impart only religious education and      such education which produces semi-literate religious      scholars. This is a weakness.       Very few madaris, I repeat very few of them, are under the      influence of politico-religious parties or have been      established by them. I know that some of these promote      negative thinking and propagate hatred and violence instead      of inculcating tolerance, patience and fraternity.       We must remember that historically, the madarasa was a      prestigious seat of learning. They were citadels of knowledge      and beacon of light for the world.       When Islam was at its zenith, every discipline of learning      e.g.: mathematics, science, medicine, astronomy and      jurisprudence were taught at these institutions. Great Muslim      luminaries such as Al-Beruni, Ibn-e-Sina (Avesina) and Ibn      Khuldoon, were the products of these same madaris.       And if we study history, we see that from the 7th to 15th      century AD, transfer of technology took place from the      Muslims to the rest of the world. Look at Muslims' condition      today. Islam teaches us to seek knowledge, even if it      involved travel to China. I am sure you are aware that the      Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) had told prisoners of war in the      Battle of Badar that they would be set free if each of them      imparted education to ten Muslims. Quite obviously, this      education could not have been religious education as the      prisoners were non-Muslims. So the Prophet (Peace Be Upon      Him) was actually referring to worldly education. If we do      not believe in education, are we following the teachings of      Islam or violating them? We must ask what direction are we      being led into by these extremists?       The writ of the government is being challenged.       Pakistan has been made a soft state where the supremacy of      law is questioned. This situation can not be tolerated any      more. The question is what is the correct path? First of all,      we must rid the society of sectarian hatred and terrorism,      promote mutual harmony. Remember that mindsets can not be      changed through force and coercion. No idea can ever be      forcibly thrust upon any one. May be the person changes      outwardly but minds and hearts can never be converted by      force. Real change can be brought about through personal      example, exemplary character and superior intellect. It can      be brought about by Haqooq-ul-ibad (Obligation towards fellow      beings).       Have we forgotten the example of the Holy Prophet (Peace Be      Upon Him) where Islam was spread by virtue of his personal      conduct, true leadership and that is how changes in the world      took place at that time. We have forgotten the teaching of      revered personalities of Islam like Hazrat Data Ganj Bakhsh,      Hazrat Lal Shahbaz Qalandar, Fareed Ganj Shakar, Baha-uddin      Zakria etc.       Was Islam spread by them through force and coercion?       No. They preached Islam by personal example. I give these      examples because it hurts me to see where we have relegated      ourselves now. We must restore that status of Madaris to what      it originally was. We have to change the state of affairs and      take them on the path of improvement.       The second thing I want to talk about is the concept of      Jehad in its totality. I want to dilate upon it because it is      a contentious issue, requiring complete comprehension and      understanding. In Islam, Jehad is not confined to armed      struggles only. Have we ever thought of waging Jehad against      illiteracy, poverty, backwardness and hunger? This is the      larger Jehad.       Pakistan, in my opinion, needs to wage Jehad against these      evils. After the battle of Khyber, the Prophet (Peace Be Upon      Him) stated that Jehad-e-Asghar (Smaller Jehad) is over but      Jehad-e-Akbar (Greater Jehad) has begun. This meant that      armed Jehad i.e. the smaller Jehad was now over and the      greater Jehad against backwardness and illiteracy had      started.       Pakistan needs Jehad-e-Akbar at this juncture.       By the way we must remember that only the government of the      day and not every individual can proclaim armed Jehad. The      extremist minority must realise that Pakistan is not      responsible of waging armed Jehad in the world. I feel that      in addition to Haqooq Allah (Obligations to God), we should      also focus on Haqooq-Al-ebad (Obligations towards fellow      human beings). At Schools, Colleges and Madaris, Obligations      towards fellow beings should be preached. We know that we      have totally ignored the importance of correct dealings with      fellow human beings. There is no room for feuds in Islamic      teachings. It is imperative that we teach true Islam i.e.      tolerance, forgiveness, compassion, justice, fair play, amity      and harmony, which is the true spirit of Islam. We must adopt      this.       We must shun negative thinking.       We have formulated a new strategy for Madaris and there is      need to implement it so as to galvanize their good aspects      and remove their drawbacks. We have developed a new syllabi      for them providing for teaching of Pakistan studies,      Mathematics, Science and English along with religious      subjects. Even if we want these Madaris to produce religious      leaders they should be educated along these lines. Such      people will command more respect in the society because they      will be better qualified. To me, students of religious      schools should be brought in to the mainstream of society. If      any one of them opts to join college or university, he would      have the option of being equipped with the modern education.      If a child studying at a madrasa does not wish to be a prayer      leader and he wants to be a bank official or seek employment      elsewhere, he should be facilitated.       It would mean that the students of Madaris should be      brought to the mainstream through a better system of      education. This is the crux of the Madrasa strategy.       This by no means is an attempt to bring religious      educational institutions under Government control nor do we      want to spoil the excellent attributes of these institutions.      My only aim is to help these institutions in over coming      their weaknesses and providing them with better facilities      and more avenues to the poor children at these institutions.       We must check abuse of mosques and madaris and they must      not be used for spreading political and sectarian prejudices.      We want to ensure that mosques enjoy freedom and we are      here to maintain it. At the same time we expect a display      of responsibility along with freedom. If the Imam of      mosques fail to display responsibility, curbs would have      to be placed on them.       After this analysis, now, I come to some conclusions and      decisions:       First, we have to establish the writ of the Government. All      organizations in Pakistan will function in a regulated      manner. No individual, organization or Party will be allowed      to break law of the land. The internal environment has to be      improved.       Maturity and equilibrium have to be established in the      society. We have to promote an environment of tolerance,      maturity, responsibility, patience and understanding. We have      to check extremism, militancy, violence and fundamentalism.      We will have to forsake the atmosphere of hatred and anger.      We have to stop exploitation of simple poor people of the      country and not to incite them to fueds and violence. We must      concern ourselves with our own country. Pakistan comes first.      We do not need to interfere and concern ourselves with      others. There is no need to interfere in other countries.       Now I turn to other important issues. In my view there are      three problems causing conflict and agitation in our minds.      They include: first the Kashmir Cause; secondly all political      disputes at the international level concerning Muslims; and      thirdly internal sectarian disputes and differences.       These are the three problems which create confusion in our      minds. I want to lay down rules of behaviour concerning all      the three.       Let us take the Kashmir Cause first. Kashmir runs in our      blood. No Pakistani can afford to sever links with Kashmir.      The entire Pakistan and the world knows this.       We will continue to extend our moral, political and      diplomatic support to Kashmiris. We will never budge an inch      from our principle stand on Kashmir. The Kashmir problem      needs to be resolved by dialogue and peaceful means in      accordance with the wishes of the Kashmiri people and the      United Nations resolutions. We have to find the solution of      this dispute. No organization will be allowed to indulge in      terrorism in the name of Kashmir. We condemn the terrorist      acts of September 11, October 1 and December 13. Anyone found      involved in any terrorist act would be dealt with sternly.       Strict action will be taken against any Pakistani      individual, group or organization found involved in terrorism      within or outside the country. Our behaviour must always be      in accordance with international norms.       On this occasion, as President of Pakistan, I want to      convey a message to Prime Minister Vajpaee: If we want to      normalize relations between Pakistan and India and bring      harmony to the region, the Kashmir dispute will have to be      resolved peacefully through a dialogue on the basis of the      aspirations of the Kashmiri people.       Solving the Kashmir Issue is the joint responsibility of      our two countries. Let me repeat some of the observations      made by you, Mr. Vajpayee, some time back, and I quote:      ``Mind-sets will have to be altered and historical baggage      will have to be jettisoned.'' I take you on this offer. Let      us start talking in this very spirit.       Now as Commander of the Armed Forces of Pakistan, I wish to      convey another message. The Armed Forces of Pakistan are      fully prepared and deployed to meet any challenge. They will      spill the last drop of their blood in the defence of their      country. Let there be no attempt of crossing the border in      any sector as it will be met with full force. Do not      entertain any illusions on this count.       I would also like to address the international community,      particularly the United States on this occasion. As I said      before on a number of occasions, Pakistan rejects and      condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestation.      Pakistan will not allow its territory to be used for any      terrorist activity anywhere in the world. Now you must play      an active role in solving the Kashmir dispute for the sake of      lasting peace and harmony in the region. We should be under      no illusion that the legitimate demand of the people of      Kashmir can ever be suppressed without their just resolution.      Kashmiris also expect that you ask India to bring an end to      state terrorism and human rights violations. Let human rights      organizations, Amnesty International, the international media      and U.N. peacekeepers be allowed to monitor activities of the      Indian occupation forces.       Now we come to the second problem, which causes confusion      in our minds and is of our particular concern. It relates to      conflicts involving Muslims. Our religious leaders involve      themselves in such conflicts without giving serious thought      to them. I don't want to talk at length on this.       It is for the government to take a position on      international issues. Individuals, organizations and      political parties should restrict their activities to      expression of their views. I request them to express their      views on international issues in an intellectual spirit and      in a civilized manner through force of argument.       Views expressed with maturity and moderation have greater      convincing power. Expressing views in a threatening manner      does not create any positive effect and anyone who indulges      in hollow threats is taken as an unbalanced person by the      world at large.       I would request that we should stop interfering in the      affairs of others. First, we should attain the strength and      the importance where our views carry weight when we express      them.       Now we come to internal decisions.       The third issue causing conflict in our minds relates to      sectarian differences. As I have already pointed out that      writ of the Government will be established. No individual,      organization or party will be allowed to break the law of      the land. All functioning will be in a regulated manner      and within rules.       Now I come to the extremist organizations. Terrorism, and      sectarianism must come to an end. I had announced a ban on      Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and Sipah-e-Mohammad on 14 August last      year. On that occasion, I had pointed out that Sipah-e-Sahaba      and TJP would be kept under observation.       I am sorry to say that there is not much improvement in the      situation. Sectarian violence continues unabated. We have      busted several gangs involved in sectarian killings. You      would be astonished to know that in year 2001 about 400      innocent people fell victim to sectarian and other killings.       Many of the gangs apprehended include people mostly      belonging to Sipah-e-Sahaba and some to TJP. This situation      cannot be tolerated any more. I, therefore, announce banning      of both Sipah-e-Sahaba and TJP. In addition to these, TNSM      (Tehrik-e-Nifaz-e-Shariat Mohammadi) being responsible for      misleading thousands of simple poor people into Afghanistan      also stands banned.       This organization is responsible for their massacre in      Afghanistan. The Government has also decided to put the Sunni      Tehreek under observation. No organization is allowed to form      Lashkar, Sipah or Jaish. The Government has banned Jaish-e-     Mohammad and Lashkar-e-Taiba.       Any organization or individual would face strict punitive      measures if found inciting the people to violence in internal      or external contexts.       Our mosques are sacred places where we seek the blessings      of God Almighty. Let them remain sacred. We will not allow      the misuse of mosques. All mosques will be registered and no      new mosques will be built without permission. The use of      loudspeakers will be limited only to call for prayers, and      Friday Sermon and Vaaz.       However, I would like to emphasise that special permission      is being given for ``Vaaz'' (Sermon). If this is misused the      permission will be cancelled.       If there is any political activity, inciting of sectarian      hatred or propagation of extremism in any mosque, the      management would be held responsible and proceeded against      according to law.       I appeal to all Pesh Imams to project the qualities of      Islam in the mosques and invite the people to piety. Talk of      obligations towards fellow beings, exhort them to abstain      from negative thoughts and promote positive thinking. I hope      that all Nazims, Distt. Police officers and Auqaf Department      officials will take quick action against violators of these      measures.       On Madaris, a detailed policy will be issued through a new      Madressa Ordinance. The Ordinance will be issued in a few      days. I feel happy that the Madressa policy has been      finalized in consultation with religious scholars and      Mashaikh. I have touched on the merits and shortcomings      prevailing in the Madaris. Merits have to be reinforced while      shortcomings have to be rooted out. Under the Madressa      policy, their functioning will be regulated. These Madaris      will be governed by same rules and regulations applicable to      other schools, colleges and universities. All Madaris will be      registered by 23rd March 2002 and no new Madressa will be      opened without permission of the Government.       If any Madressa (religious school) is found indulging in      extremism, subversion, militant activity or possessing any      types of weapons, it will be closed.       All Madaris will have to adopt the new syllabi by the end      of this year. Those Madaris which are already following such      syllabi are welcome to continue. The Government has decided      to provide financial assistance to such Madaris. The      government will also help the Madaris in the training of      their teachers. The Ministry of Education has been instructed      to review courses of Islamic education in all schools and      colleges also with a view to improving them. So far as      foreign students attending Madaris are concerned, we have set      rules for them. Foreign students who do not have proper      documents would be required to comply with the formalities by      23rd March 2002; otherwise they can face deportation.       Any foreigner wanting to attend Madaris in Pakistan will      have to obtain required documents from his/her native country      and NOC from the government. Only then, he or she will get      admission. The same rules will apply to foreign teachers.       Some Ulema were of the view that some poor people who come      to Pakistan for religious education should not be deported to      the countries of their origin.       I agree that this is a genuine demand but such people      should regularize their stay in Pakistan through their      respective embassies. As I have said, all such activity has      to be regulated and the writ of the Government must be      established.       With a view to ending conflict, I have explained to you at      great length the three areas causing confusion in our minds.      Making rules, regulations and issuing ordinances is easy but      their implementation is difficult. However, I feel all the      measures I have announced are of utmost importance. We have      to implement them. In this regard, the law enforcement      agencies including police must perform their duty.       We are introducing reforms in the police with a view to      improving their efficiency. A great responsibility lies on      their shoulders.       I have directed the police to ensure implementation of the      steps announced by the government and I have no doubt they      will be motivated to perform their duty.       After reforms we expect they will be better trained and      equipped to discharge their duty. Rangers and civil armed      forces will be in their support.       We are also taking steps in consultation with the judiciary      for speedy trial of cases relating to terrorism and      extremism. Anti-terrorist courts are being strengthened and      necessary orders will be issued in a few days.       Apart from these issues, I would also like to inform you,      my brothers and sisters, that we have been sent a list of 20      people by India.       I want to clear our position on this. There is no question      of handing over any Pakistani. This will never be done. If we      are given evidence against those people, we will take action      against them in Pakistan under our own laws. As far as non-     Pakistanis are concerned, we have not given asylum to any      one. Any one falling under this category will be proceeded      against whenever one is found.       My Brothers & Sisters, Pakistan is an Islamic Republic.      There are 98 percent Muslims living in this country. We      should live like brothers and form an example for rest of the      Islamic countries. We should strive to emerge as a      responsible and progressive member of the comity of nations.       We have to make Pakistan into a powerful and strong      country. We have resources and potential. We are capable of      meeting external danger. We have to safeguard ourselves      against internal dangers. I have always been saying that      internal strife is eating us like termite. Don't forget that      Pakistan is the citadel of Islam and if we want to serve      Islam well we will first have to make Pakistan strong and      powerful.       There is a race for progress among all nations.       We cannot achieve progress through a policy of      confrontation and feuds. We can achieve progress through      human resource development, mental enlightenment, high moral      character and technological development. I appeal to all my      countrymen to rise to the occasion. We should get rid of      intolerance and hatred and instead promote tolerance and      harmony.       May God guide us to act upon the true teachings of Islam.      May He help us to follow the Quaid-e-Azam's motto: ``Unity,      Faith and Discipline''. This should always be remembered. We      will be a non-entity without unity.       And I would again like to recite a couplet from Allama      Iqbal.       Fard Qaim Rabte Millat Say Hai Tanha Kuch Naheen.       Mauj Hai Darya Main Aur Baroon-e-Darya Kuch Naheen.       (Amongst the Community Do Individuals Survive; Not Alone;      Like Waves That Exist in Rivers Out of Water Are Not Known.)       Pakistan Paindabad.                          ____________________
