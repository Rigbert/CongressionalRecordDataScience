  Mr. McCAIN. My question is, Why is $50 million made available for Sudan and $50 million to support the Government of Afghanistan, which was not requested by the administration in any way, not scrutinized? Congratulations; hello, Sudan; here is $50 million.  I ask my colleague, if he is concerned about how some of the money is being spent, should he not justify how the amendment would like to have that money spent?
