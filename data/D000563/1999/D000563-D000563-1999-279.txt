BOXER. Mr. President, I think this is a special interest rider. I have to say that, with all due respect. By the way, it doesn't give money to all the oil companies. It only gives it to the top 5 percent, the ones that are vertically integrated. Ninety-five percent of the oil companies are not affected, and they are paying the fair market value. They are paying the royalty based on the fair market value.  I ask unanimous consent, before yielding to the Senator for more questions, to have printed in the Record a letter from the Secretary of the Interior, which was based on the original Hutchison amendment, which addresses the question of the dollars lost. It is very clear what will be lost. In her additional amendment of 21 months, they calculate it at $120 million, and we are just paring it back to the 1-year number. We also have a letter from the Office of Management and Budget which clearly states that the rider, as it is before us now, will cost taxpayers about $60 million.  I ask unanimous consent to have those two documents printed in the Record when I complete my remarks.
