Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend, Mr. Rangel, for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor today because I am sick and tired of the greed that is prevailing in this House. The Republican majority today will help millionaires with their estate tax cut while forgetting hardworking Americans, millions of them, by refusing to increase the minimum wage. This is unbelievable. It is immoral and it is wrong.  The majority must wake up and see the struggles of minimum-wage workers. They work hard every day to feed their families. People cannot afford health care. People are struggling to fill their cars with gasoline. Many people live in poverty. They live paycheck to paycheck, and they have not seen an increase in the minimum wage in 9 years.  This Congress should be ashamed. Be ashamed. When will we stop helping the superrich? They do not need our help. They are not begging for our help. They are not calling us, they are not sending letters or e-mails, they are not petitioning us to help. When will we start to take care of the least among us?  What would the great teacher say, what would the great teacher say when he comes into the Chamber and sweeps the money out of the Chamber?  Franklin Delano Roosevelt says that ``the test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little.'' We are failing this test and we are failing the American people. This is not progress. This is not helping the least among us. This is greed and it is disgraceful.  I urge my colleagues to defeat this bill.
