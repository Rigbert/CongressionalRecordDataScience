Speaker, reclaiming my time, I thank the gentleman for his information. Perhaps we can talk about that further. I understand the problem. We are running out of time. We have got to use the days that are available. That is a very practical problem. I did not have Missouri on my list, but obviously a large number of States. Maryland does not. Maryland does not have elections this Tuesday other than municipal elections, so that is not a real problem for our State. But I understand the time problem, and perhaps we can discuss it a little further and see if there are some other times that we might utilize.  Finally, I would like to inquire further on the schedule for the balance of the year. Our target adjournment date, as I understand it, is November 18. I hope we can make that. As the gentleman pointed out, we do not have total control. The other body has to do things as well for us to get there.  If we do not make November 18, am I correct that the week of Thanksgiving, the Members can be assured that they will not be here the week of Thanksgiving, and am I correct that the probability is that the week after Thanksgiving, which I think starts either the 28th or 29th, that Monday, would not be weeks that we would be here but that, if need be, the week after that and perhaps the week after that in December would be weeks that we would be utilizing?  I yield to the gentleman.
