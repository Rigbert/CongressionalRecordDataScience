Speaker, the tragic death of a young soldier from St. Mary's County, Maryland, who gave the ultimate measure of sacrifice in the global war on terror, saddens all of us. As we continue to fight this war, the loss of each and every service member is a tragedy.  St. Mary's County, the State of Maryland, and our Nation lost a great hero when Army Corporal Matthew Wallace of Lexington Park died from his injuries after being hit by a roadside bomb on July 16th.  Matthew Wallace is the 50th Marylander killed in the war in Iraq.  Matthew told his family that he dreamed of becoming a soldier. Today, a grateful Nation thanks him for sacrificing his life in the pursuit of enduring freedom.  He served in the Army's 10th Cavalry Regiment, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division at Fort Hood, Texas. Often working at the front of his larger unit, he earned distinctions as a marksman and earned the Army Achievement Medal.  In correspondence with his family, Wallace expressed his hope that he was helping the Iraqi people. Unquestionably, his efforts gave generations of Iraqis the dream of democracy.  Wallace attended Great Mills High School, earned his GED, and worked at several local businesses in his hometown of Lexington Park, including Linda's Cafe and a local convenience store where his co-workers praised his maturity and sense of commitment. He enlisted in the Army in early 2004.  When he deployed to Iraq in December, he was well aware of the danger he would be facing. ``He chose to do this,'' his mother said proudly. His sister Jessica recalled flying home from Basic Training with Matthew, who was still in full uniform, and a man came up to him and thanked him for his service. His older sister said she then realized, ``he was now America's son, America's brother.''  Matthew's service to our Nation was source of great pride to his parents, Keith and Mary, as well as his sisters, Jessica, Abigail and Micah. Matthew was a Top Gunner for a Bradley Vehicle for his unit in Iraq who once told his mother ``he was going to fight the war on terror so his sisters' children never had to.'' He felt compelled by the events of September 11 to do something more for his Nation.  Indeed, Matthew Wallace gave his life for all of us. As his Representative in Congress, I am grateful for his patriotism and his sacrifice. The Fifth District of Maryland and all Americans join the Wallace family in mourning the loss of this fine young man a real hero.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Page E1564]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                  TRIBUTE TO CORPORAL MATTHEW WALLACE                                 ______                                                           HON.
