President, I compliment the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Mr. Stevens; the distinguished ranking member, Mr. Byrd; and the distinguished chairman of the Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, Mr. McConnell; and all those who worked on it. This has not been an easy time getting this bill through, partly because of holdups in the other body, holdups that tended to disregard, frankly, the democratic process and how we voted here and voted over there. Be that as it may, we have done the best with a difficult situation. I believe this bill should be passed.                 INTERNATIONAL FAMILY PLANNING FUNDING
