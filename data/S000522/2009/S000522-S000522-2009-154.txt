Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 39, which recognizes and honors the exemplary contributions of Catholic schools across our Nation. The resolution salutes the commitment, professionalism and faith of the teachers and administrators as well as the achievements in the classroom and in the lives of the students. And we commend today the support of the Catholic Church itself in making this educational opportunity possible.  I would also like to thank Mr. Lipinski for his leadership in bringing this resolution to the floor and ask that my colleagues join us in supporting its passage.  Madam Speaker, Catholic education has and continues to make a tremendous impact in the lives of students, families and communities across America and in my home State of New Jersey. Last year, more than 2.3 million children were enrolled in over 7,000 Catholic schools nationwide. The performance of Catholic schools is impressive. More than 99 percent of its students graduate high school, and approximately 97 percent go on to college. The record clearly shows that students at Catholic schools receive a quality education with an integrated focus on the transcendent importance of God, academic excellence, advancement beyond high school and fundamental morals.  Next week, January 25 to 31, marks the 36th annual celebration of Catholic Schools Week. And this year's theme is to live the Gospel with an emphasis on service. Students are encouraged to help others and generously give of themselves expecting nothing whatsoever in return. In the 25th chapter of Matthew's Gospel, Jesus admonished believers to live a life of selfless service to others and specifically asked that we feed the hungry, give drink to the thirsty, clothe the naked, care for the sick and disabled, visit the prisoner and welcome the stranger. Identifying with the disenfranchised, the vulnerable and the weakest among us, our Lord said, and I quote, whatsoever you do to the least of My brethren, you do unto Me.  This year's theme celebrates service, encourages students to embrace Matthew 25 and make a positive difference in the lives of others. Many of America's poor and at risk will benefit from the students' benevolence.  Catholic schools, Madam Speaker, are indeed an integral part of our Nation's fundamental commitment to education and serve a cross-section of American students. Catholic schools have a rich history of welcoming, serving and educating new immigrants. With over 25 percent of Catholic school enrollment from minority backgrounds and approximately 14 percent actually being non-Catholics, it is evident that this extraordinary institution meets the needs of a highly diverse group of young people.  Finally, Madam Speaker, a 1972 pastoral message by the National Conference of Catholic Bishops concerning Catholic education summed up the unique and extraordinary vision of Catholic education. They said in pertinent part, and I quote: Education isone of the most important ways by which the church fulfills its commitment to the dignity of the person and the building of community. Community is central to education ministry, both as a necessary condition and an ardently desired goal. The educational efforts of the church, therefore, must be directed to forming persons-in-community; for the education of the individual Christian is important not only to his or her solitary destiny, but also the destinies of the many communities to which he or she lives.                              {time}  1315  Again, I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this important element of faith-based education which serves alongside America's public and private schools to strengthen and reinforce our educational system.
