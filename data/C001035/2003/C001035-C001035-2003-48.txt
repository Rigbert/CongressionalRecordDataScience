The bill includes substantial funding for programs to conserve our Nation's treasured lands and resources, including $85 million for the forest legacy program; a program that means so much to my home State of Maine.  There is one Maine conservation project, however, that does not receive funds through the Senate bill. It is the Downeast Lakes Forestry Partnership, the goal of which is the sustainable conservation of 342,000 acres in Maine, including 78,800 acres of pristine lakes, 54,000 acres of productive wetlands, 445 miles of unspoiled shoreline, and 342,000 acres of remote forestland. This important project, which enjoys widespread support in my State, including the support of the Governor, is at a critical stage. But it requires Federal support in the coming fiscal year to help bring the project to fruition.  I would therefore ask the chairman whether he will commit to doing all he can to consider funding the Downeast Lakes Forestry Partnership when this bill goes to conference?
