President, I rise to thank my colleagues for designating the week of October 19-25, 2003 as National Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Week. S. Res. 243, the resolution making next week National Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Week, was cosponsored by 44 of my colleagues and passed the Senate last night by unanimous consent.  The need to combat the severe threat of lead poisoning to our children's health has never been greater. It is estimated that 25 million homes nationwide have lead hazards. Many of those homes were built before 1950, when paint contained as much as 50 percent lead. Peeling chips and dust from deteriorating lead-based paint is one of the most common sources of childhood lead poisoning. According to the latest national health estimates, nearly one-half of a million children under the age of 6 suffer from lead poisoning, with these children 8 times more likely to come from low-income working families than wealthy families.  Unfortunately, except for severely poisoned children, there is no medical treatment for this disease. Even then, treatment may only reduce the level of lead present in the body, not reverse the harm already caused. Research shows that children with elevated blood lead levels are seven times more likely to drop our of high school and 6 times more likely to have reading disabilities. And it costs an average of $10,000 more a year to educate a lead poisoned child.  We need to find the will and the resources to eradicate childhood lead poisoning in this country. Designating the last full week in October as National Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Week will help shine a light on this terrible problem, energize the Federal Government into playing a more effective role, and improve local, State and Federal cooperation in the process. With concerted effort, we can eliminate the tragedy of childhood lead poisoning so that no family in our country has to live in unsafe housing. I am committed to addressing this crisis, and believe this resolution can encourage communities to focus on solving the problem.                          ____________________
