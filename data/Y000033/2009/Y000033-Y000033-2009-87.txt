Madam Speaker, pursuant to the Republican Leadership standards on earmarks, I am submitting the following information regarding earmarks I received as part of the FY 2009 Omnibus.  Requesting Member: Congressman Don Young  Bill Number: H.R. 1105  Account: Department of Justice, OJP--Juvenile Justice  Legal Name of Requesting Entity: i-SAFE, Inc  Address of Requesting Entity: 5900 Pasteur Court, Suite 100 Carlsbad, CA 92008  Description of Request: $300,000 will allow i-SAFE to expand services to a projected 6.2 million students nationally by the end of the 2009 school year. It will also help to fund the i-SAFE initiatives that provide data to FBI, local law enforcement, schools and industry leaders such as USPTO, RIAA and ASCAP. This data is provided through the i-SAFE National Assessment Center--a compilation of student surveys that serve as the world's largest data base of student online behavior and attitudes. The State of Alaska provides contract funds for the Village Public Safety Officer program.  i-SAFE Inc. is the leading provider of e-Safety education and training in schools nationwide. i-SAFE also provides schools/districts behavioral statistical data regarding Internet behavior and usage by their students. i-SAFE programmatic assets address a broad range of e-Safety issues through a uniquely comprehensive and holistic framework that includes training of educators (i.e., Professional Development Program--i-SAFE has trained over 85,000 educators nationwide) both online and in-person, extensive community outreach programs towards parents, seniors, legal/law-enforcement officers and, most importantly, a world-class age-appropriate curriculum which features integrated teaching and learning activities for students in all grades from primary to secondary schools. i-SAFE has educated over 8.5 million students nationwide and has cooperative agreement with many of the State Dept of Education(s) and Districts in all 50 states including schools in Washington, DC to name a few: Sidwell Friends School; St. Patricks Episcopal Day School; Woodridge Elementary; Woodridge High School & St. Peters Interparish School.  i-SAFE fulfills a vital role in the digital age and global information society, throughout the United States by empowering Internet users with the knowledge and awareness needed to garner the most benefit from Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs) and the Internet via safe, responsible, ethical and legal use.  Beginning in 2009 Congress mandated that elementary and secondary schools receiving E-Rate discounts must submit a certification to the Federal Communications Commission that as part of their Internet safety policy they are educating minors about appropriate online behavior, including interacting with other individuals on social networking websites and in chat rooms and cyber bullying awareness and response. i-SAFE can provide to every school, throughout the United States the ``E-Rate Certification Compliance Package.'' This package includes all classroom curriculum that is mandated to be taught through the Legislation mandate of the Broadband Act.  Funding will be used to expand the i-SAFE curriculum to more students and classrooms throughout the nation as well as implement the ``E-Rate Compliance Package'' into schools throughout the nation.  This request will also allow i-SAFE to provide, on a quarterly basis, student assessment data (i.e., metrics) to the district/schools upon request allowing them to have metrics on students behavioral attitudes towards online safety.  This Administration is focused on providing every student and school(s) the ability to communicate and learn through today's 21st century communication. Safety is a key component for schools that provide students with the means to access online information and services within their learning environment in the classroom. Education is the diadem to the success of students being empowered with the knowledge of learning safe and responsible tactics as a citizen in today's global economy. The only environment that is conducive for every student, regardless of age, race or socio-economic, to deploy such global education, is that of the classroom. To date, over 8.5 million students nationwide have acquired the critical thinking and decision-making skills to ensure safe online behavior. The efficacy of the i-SAFE program has proven invaluable to the tax payers nationwide.
