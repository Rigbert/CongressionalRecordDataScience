 In particular, I am pleased that the Senate-passed legislation preserves the ability for States to cover lawfully residing pregnant women and children under Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program CHIP. Importantly, States may extend full benefits under these programs to individuals who gain legal status as a result of the bill, including those granted Registered Provisional Immigrant RPI, Blue Card, and V-visa status.  My home State of Washington is one of 27 that have decided to exercise the option to extend these health care benefits to children or pregnant women. We do this because we know that when women have access to prenatal care, children are born healthier. We all benefit when children receive the immunizations they need and are able to see a doctor when they are sick.  During the debate on S. 744, two of my colleagues, Chairman Leahy and Senator Rockefeller, came to the floor to discuss this issue. I join them in support of preserving States' rights to extend Medicaid and CHIP benefits to lawfully residing noncitizen children and pregnant women. I thank my colleagues for addressing an issue that is critical to my home State and I echo their comments on the intention of the Senate with regard to this issue.  Madam President, I would also like to speak today about the need for comprehensive immigration reform by highlighting the work of one of my constituents.  I was touched when I read a poem written by 10-year-old Erin Stark of Bellevue, WA. I met Erin last month at a welcoming ceremony for new immigrants in my home State of Washington. She told me about her passion for writing and explained that she won a national writing contest with the submission of her poem on immigration. I think her words exemplify the diversity and extraordinary contributions made by immigrants to this country.    ``What Would You Miss About Immigrants, If They Didn't Come to                                America?''     Would you miss the food?     The pot stickers, sushi, and dumplings,     Pizza, spaghetti, curry, or crepes?     Just think about it for a minute or two,     Could you survive eating fish at every meal? Could you?     Immigrants are coming every day,     Variety is what they bring with them in every way.     Would you miss the holidays?     Day of the Dead, and Chinese New Year,     Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, and Ramadan too?     Why did the Christians travel the distance,     Was it to share their beliefs and Christmas?     Immigrants are coming every day,     Variety is what they bring with them in every way.     Would you miss their art,     Painting, literature, and music,     Plays, sculpture, and design?     Life would be dull without art,     People might become sad and would get broken hearts.     Immigrants are coming every day,     Variety is what they bring with them in every way.     Would you miss the things they made?     Railroads, canals, communities, and skyscrapers,     Schoolhouses, highways, churches, and businesses?     What would kids do without schools?     We might turn into fools!     Immigrants are coming every day,     Variety is what they bring with them in every way.     Immigrants are coming every day.     They bring recipes, celebrations, talents, and skills.     Variety is what they bring with them in every way.     USA would be bland without immigrants,     Now our nation is colorful and the joy is infinite.                                                      --Erin Stark  Mr. President, I would like to extend a special welcome to Erin Stark. I look forward to seeing all that she will accomplish in the years to come.                          ____________________
