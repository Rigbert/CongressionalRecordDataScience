 Speaker, for the benefit of my colleagues I would like to insert into the Record the following statement by Meika Ferland.  Ms. Ferland is a student from Barton, VT, and her script was the 1996 Vermont State winner in the Veterans of Foreign Wars Voice of Democracy broadcast scripwriting contest.                        Answering America's Call                           (By Meika Ferland)       George Washington. Bob Hope. Betsy Ross. What do these      Americans have in common? Each answered America's call in his      or her own way. George Washington was the first commander-in-     chief of troops as well as America's first President. Bob      Hope entertained soldiers during several wars. And Betsy Ross      sewed the famous red, white, and blue flag that would come to      represent the best nation in the world. Each of these      patriots made a memorable contribution to America's history.       Although we remember these important people and the roles      they played in helping our country become great and strong,      thousands of others have helped in their own small ways. The      boys who beat the drums to maintain the soldier's pace. The      women who made bandages and nursed the wounded. The crowds      that gave a hero's welcome during a parade to honor returning      troops--each of these is answering America's call by      contributing to the morale and the needs of the time.       Today's citizens can also answer America's call. A young      man can register with the Selective Service and be ready to      fight if called upon during a national emergency. A young      woman can volunteer to serve a meal at the local soup      kitchen. A senior citizen can swing a hammer on a crew      building a house in the Habitat for Humanity project. Each of      these activities can make a difference and every person can      make a contribution. The contribution does not have to make a      huge impression like finding a cure for cancer or signing a      peace treaty with a foreign nation. Each of us can answer the      call in our own way no matter how humble. It is important to      remember that every effort no matter how small makes a      difference. I have learned this myself first hand.       At my local high school I am a volunteer in the Big      Brother/Big Sister program. In this program a high school      student is paired with an elementary student from one of the      graded schools. These children are usually needy kids who      lack someone special in their lives. As a volunteer I spend      part of an afternoon each week trying to be a positive role      model who provides attention and security in an otherwise      troubled life.       Sometimes I help my little sister with her homework or we      play games on the computer. She especially likes it when I      read to her. Whatever we do, I can see a twinkle in my little      sister's eye. I know she is thrilled while I am there. Her      smile never leaves her face and when it's time to say good-     bye, I know she is looking forward to next week wondering if      I'll bring her a package of M & M's or a new book to read.       My little sister is not the only one who benefits from our      friendship. It warms my heart to know that I can have such an      impact on a ten-year-old. I am contributing a little bit to      society by being a Big Sister but I am also reaping the      rewards of doing something good for someone else.       In my own way I'm answering America's call. It is a minute      contribution in relation to the whole country but it is my      part, my effort. I believe that each of us has something      worthwhile to contribute and it is up to each of us to do so.      If every American were to do just a little bit towered      answering America's call the United States would be an even      greater place than it is today.                                    ____________________
