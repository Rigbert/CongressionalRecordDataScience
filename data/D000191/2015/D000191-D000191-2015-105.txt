Speaker, on October 9, 2015, I returned to Oregon to attend to various matters in my District. Had I been present, I would have voted on the following:  On agreeing to the Amash amendment to H.R. 702, I would have voted ``no.''  On agreeing to the Messer/Lowenthal amendment to H.R. 702, I would have voted ``aye.''  On agreeing to the Messer amendment Number 2 to H.R. 702, I would have voted ``aye.''  On passage of the Democratic Motion to Recommit to H.R. 702, I would have voted ``aye.''  On final passage of H.R. 702, I would have voted ``no.''                          ____________________
