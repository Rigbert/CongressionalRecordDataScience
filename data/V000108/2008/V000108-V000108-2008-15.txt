Stupak for all of his hard work on this initiative, but also would like to thank the chairman of the full committee as well as the ranking member for their work on this important bill, as well as the chairwoman of the Rules Committee for making this amendment in order.  The amendment would require all iron and steel purchased with funds authorized by this act to use only American-made steel. This stems from a Steel Caucus hearing that was held in April, where we learned that the government does not have an established process to monitor the safety of steel imports. We also learned that foreign imports from China, for example, do not adhere to international standards and guidelines when they manufacture steel.  If the school construction projects provided under this act are to be truly safe for our children, then we must ensure that the steel used is American. If we buy only American steel for our schools, we will know that it adheres to our safety and quality standards, and would encourage my colleagues to support the Stupak-Visclosky amendment to keep our schools safe and to vote for passage of the underlying measure.  Madam Chairman, I recognize the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Wilson) for 1\1/2\ minutes.
