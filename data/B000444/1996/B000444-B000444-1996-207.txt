 President, I have for many years now supported a line-item veto that can help to wipe out wasteful special-interest spending items that are added to our appropriations bills.  But I have also cosponsored and supported line-item veto authority for the President that includes the authority to cut special-interest tax breaks, that lose money from the Treasury as surely as any spending program. In many ways they weaken our control over the deficit more than annual spending bills.  Because tax breaks characteristically last for years with little or no review, they can cause more damage than any single item in 1 year's appropriations bill.  The line-item veto we passed out of the Senate last year, the separate enrollment version that I have consistently supported for over a decade, included clear and strong language that put special-interest tax breaks under the same veto power as any pork-barrel spending project.  Unfortunately, the version that came out of conference with the House has so diluted that provision that it may well apply to virally no tax breaks.  That is why I will vote for Senator Byrd's proposal, that restores the clear authority to cut tax breaks as well as special-interest spending.
