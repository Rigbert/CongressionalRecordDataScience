Speaker, I rise today in strong support for H.R. 2570, the Forced Abortion Condemnation Act. One of the most contentious ongoing debates before Congress is whether or not a woman has a right to choose abortion over life. But this debate is not about the right to choose. This is about forcing a woman to undergo a dangerous procedure without her consent. Regardless of whether you believe in the right to life or the right to choose, we can all agree that this practice is inhuman and barbaric. And one that we, as Americans, cannot and should not condone.  H.R. 2570 denies visas to Chinese officials who carry out forced abortion or sterilization procedures and condemns those in the Chinese Communist Party and other Chinese nationals who oversee and enforce this process. Forced abortion was officially deemed a crime against humanity by the Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal after World War II. What the Nazis did back then is no different then what is happening today in China. China's population control methods of forced abortions and sterilizations are not the way to control overpopulation in that country. The practice holds grave implications for religious liberty and basic human rights.  I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 2570.
