We were faced with what looked to be an impossible task when it began because of the number of amendments. I note for the record that the distinguished Senator dealt with this side in good faith. We were able, as a result, I think, to put the Senate in a position now where we are within range of being able to have a final vote, and the Senate will work its will either for or against the bill. We will actually be able to do that. It is because Senators on both sides of the aisle dealt with each other in good faith and got rid of a lot of amendments that we knew would go nowhere anyway. The Senator from Iowa and I have been able to accept 39 amendments. I think that is good progress, and I extend my appreciation to him.
