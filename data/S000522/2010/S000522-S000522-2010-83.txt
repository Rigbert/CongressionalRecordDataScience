I thank my good friend for his very eloquent statement, and we will all miss Bobby Franks.       Remarks from current and present elected officials who      spoke at the April 17, 2010 memorial service for former U.S.      Congressman and former N.J. Assemblyman Bob Franks, who died      April 9, 2010. The service took place at the Cathedral      Basilica of the Sacred Heart in Newark NJ.:                     new jersey gov. chris christie       Bob Franks' life was grand and glorious as Fran and his      daughters know better than anyone, what Bob cared first and      foremost about despite all of the passions in his life was      family.       This summer as I had many discussion with Bob about lots of      different topics he would always end each of those      conversations we had whether it was in person or over the      telephone, by asking me, in fact imploring me, `You're      spending time with Mary     Pat, right?' have you gone to some of the kids baseball      games?' It was the way he ended each and everyone of those      conversations, no matter whether we were talking about      politics or business because it was something he knew full      well: the demands of a public life, the demands of a private      life, and the rewards of paying attention to both.       Bob Franks' smile is the thing I will remember most, about      him. When he saw you his face immediately lit up, and in turn      he lit up the room. His enthusiasm was mentioned just before.      And he was enthusiastic in everything I saw him do. Whether      it was rooting for the Indianapolis Colts--something that      still do not fully understand, from a guy from NJ--whether it      was some of the deepest and most significant policy issues      that have faced our country over the last 25 years, or      whether it was counseling and encouraging even the smallest      of potential leaders for our state, I speak about that last      part from personal experience. I met Bob Franks in July of      1995 I was a first-term Freeholder who had just run for the      General Assembly, and had come in sixth out of six. And in      the aftermath of that primary, I received a call from      Congressman Franks' office. And the person on the staff said,      `The Congressman would like to know if you'd like to come by      his district office Friday for lunch. He'd like to speak to      you.'       And I immediately said yes, of course. I thought to myself      `It must be losers' week at Bob Franks' office. And I went      there that day to have lunch with Bob Franks. I had no idea      what the agenda was and I had no idea why I was going there.      For an hour and 45 minutes Bob Franks sat with me to dissect      why I had lost the race, why I had done so poorly, what I      wanted to do with my future and how he thought was the best      way to get there. I want to emphasis with you: I had never      met him. He saw something in me in that campaign that      obviously no one who voted did. And he implored me at the end      of the meeting to not give up, not give up on a public life.      He encouraged me to continue to fight. It will be the      enduring gift that Bob Franks gave to me. And if you look      around this cathedral today, there are literally hundreds of      people who can say exactly the same thing. It's just a      different date and a different time and a different challenge      that was before them in that stage of their life. And it was      Bob Franks who patted them on the back. It was Bob Franks who      got in their face and told them not to quit. It was Bob      Franks who by his example showed them that in fact anything      was possible if you were willing to work hard enough, listen      enough, and care deeply enough about making your community a      better place.       The loss that each of us will feel from Bob's death is      significant--significant in the life of our state,      significant in the life of our country, because he served so      ably and so well because of that enthusiasm, that fire and      that ability to inspire others. In the end, I think, that's      what we all hope for out of our public officials: that they      care deeply, that they think deeply, that they act      passionately with the ability to inspire. He checked all the      boxes. And the loss we feel is miniscule compared to the loss      that his family feels. Because for all that he did for us, he      was much, much more for them. This summer, the last time I      met with Bob before I became governor, he said to me as I was      leaving the meeting, `Don't worry about what happens--whether      you win or you lose. Winning would be great, but even if you      lose, I can tell you from personal experience. Life will get      better.' He told me `I have felt that the last couple of      years out of public life, because it has allowed me to get      even closer to Fran and to the girls. And so Bob provided      hope from either end of the spectrum for whatever was going      to happen to you and your life. I know that the legacy he      leaves is sitting here in this cathedral this morning and the      circles that go out from here, because Bob Franks did what      every leader aspires to do: and this is to inspire others.       He has certainly inspired me. God bless you, Fran and the      girls. And God Bless Bob for a life well spent.                        former gov. jon corzine       I feel like a little loner up here. I'm not just sure how I      identify, but I am thrilled to be here.       Fran, I could not be more privileged or honored, to stand      and say some words in celebration of a great life, of a good      man, a very good man, someone that all of us, as you have      heard, believed in, learned from, grew from.       A man of credible character, conviction, courage, but      probably the most defining thing that I think any of us can      say about Bob is that he is a man who loved. He loved      politics, loved all of his friends, the folks who are here,      but most of all, most notably he loved his family. Fran,      Sara, Abby and Kelly--a remarkable, remarkable testimony to      his humanity and care. There was no pure, nor more poignant      view of love than to have a conversation with Bob about his      wife and his daughters.       Others have spoken about that smile, but the thought and      site of those girls, all those girls brought a joy and a      light that I don't think I've seen in the passions that I've      seen in other people anytime in life. You know, I'm probably      like a lot of you. I have more pictures of Bob Franks' girls      than I have of my own grandkids, because you couldn't have a      meeting, a breakfast, a beer or anything else with Bob where      he didn't share a picture and a posting on how the girls were      doing. It meant so much to him. A special part of when you      had that posting was that smile that was there as he talked      about it. It was always, always there. Everybody else has      said it. It was the most winning smile anyone could imagine.      And almost never saw him not smile, except for a couple of      occasions. Anytime the Giants were playing the Colts he had      his game face on. I'm like Gov. Christie; I don't know where      in the heck he got that view from, but that's the way it is.       And then there were the days when we were running against      each other for the United States Senate.       It wasn't always smiles. Neither of us were smiling while      the ads were running. In fact, I remember sitting on stage      one night down at Rider College, I think it was, before a      debate, we were getting mic-ed up. And he did smile, and we      laughed, and we teased each other about the theater and maybe      even a little bit about the B.S. that comes as you go through      that process. And then he proceeded over the next 90 minutes      to absolutely take me apart on healthcare, early childhood      education and anything else, and the only time I saw him      smile was when he dubbed me `Mr. Universal' in that night.      Some of you remember that. It stuck, and I definitely      remember him smiling at me that night. I actually was      frowning.       Anyone who followed Bob's career knew that once he found a      winning argument, he knew how to stick with it. I must have      heard that phrase, `Mr. Universal' a million times over the      next six weeks. Message, message, message. When it came to      politics, Bob knew it as well or better than anyone. And he      demonstrated a remarkable talent in that campaign, because he      took $6 million and made it something that was worth a lot      more. And he showed what a pro could do.       There was also something about that campaign that he and I      actually grew to respect each other. You heard Congressman      Kasich say that mutual respect is an important ingredient in      our public life. Bob really believed that two people could be      of principles--sometimes of different views but principled--     but they didn't have to be disagreeable, as we often hear.       And after that campaign and over the years, we grew into an      easy friendship based on that perspective, developed over      time. We are occasional parishioners at Chuck's church, we      were commiseraters over breakfast or over a beer. I did a lot      with him as we supported the NJ National Guard. He did so      much to support our troops that were in Iraq. And he fought      for the things he believed in in political life in a lot of      ways, but most of all even for a Democrat he became one of      those people who offered guidance, offered perspective,      offered counsel. He was true to the words that he would be a      friend. Of course we had to sneak him in and out of      Drumthwacket, and then we had to meet in the wine cellar for      breakfast in Summit, Grand Summit Hotel. I was never sure      whose reputation we were defending, his or mine.       And then there were those moments at Christ's Church when      we both showed up at the same time. Bob and his family on the      right side. Of course, I was on the left side. We both fell      into a pattern of rolling our eyes when Chuck would tell some      miserable jokes about politics, which was all too frequent.       It was almost a paradox because Bob was such a wonderful      human being. You always wonder sometimes why he was in      politics. People always trump politics in his life. He was a      happy warrior. He had a passion for service and a strong      sense of responsibility for community. But most importantly,      as you heard others say, he loved his family. I know this is      an unspeakable time for the Franks family, for Fran and the      girls. There is nothing fair or right about losing Bob.       I was reminded of a Winston Churchill phrase upon hearing      of the death of Harry Hopkins. He said ``a strong, bright      fierce flame has burned out of a frail body.'' Churchill was      making clear we should never confuse the body and the soul.      The strong, bright, fierce flame of Bob's soul lives in those      three beautiful, beautiful girls, Abby, Sara and Kelly. His      generosity and spirit, his love of people and life, his sense      of purpose, justice, and oh, that smile, always that smile,      will be with his girls, always. And with all of us as well.       God bless Bob, his family and thank you for the life he has      lived.                       gov. christie todd whitman       Fran, Kelly, Sara, Abby, I hope you get a chance at some      point to stand up and just absorb this room.       Everyone here is a friend, or an admirer, a support of      someone Bob mentored. They are here out of love. They are      here out of love for Bob and what he stood for, and here for      you, for the family. You know a lot of people who are      involved in the rough-and-tumble of politics get      characterized as either being really good at the political      side of it, the background, the fierce fighting, or they're      the policy wonks, that's what they care about. Bob was both.      He was a fierce, fierce partisan. He was a Republican. He      never made it personal, because he always knew it was about      policy, about doing right by the people of the state. And      that's what made him such a special person.       He was a true gentleman, in every sense of the word. He      honored the profession. He loved it. He had that smile. He      lit up a room. But because he really cared. There was nothing      fake about it. He wasn't putting it on. He loved and cared      about everything. Of course we know he loved and cared most      about his family. I can remember, Kelly, how many     times did we get together at events. Your father and I would      be talking about strategy or something and then all of the      sudden your mom and you would walk into the room and then      that was it. Forget the rest of it. It was his girls, the      people he cared about the most. It was always first and      foremost. But it was because he cared about all of it, all of      us, what he was doing.       His legacy, the people he mentored, all of that is      important. We are remembering it here today and people care      about it. But his real legacy is his family. And while each      of you might not be able to turn around and see him sitting      next to you with that sparkle in his eyes, he's there. He's      in your hearts, he's the angels on your shoulder. He will      always be there with you and for you. And he set an example,      that is unmatched, and you are very very lucky to have had      him. We are all very lucky to have had him, but though for      all too short a period. It just reminds us all to take those      special people and special moments and bring them close to      our heart and never let that flame die. You know, Bob's flame      is going to live on forever.       Thank you for letting me be part of today.                           Governor tom kean       This has been quite a week. I have not been to an event all      week long, of any kind, where Bob hasn't been mentioned.      Where there hasn't been some remarks, where there hasn't been      some longing, been some discussion, public and private. And      now to culminate in this.       I think I counted seven former governors here today. I see      our two United States Senators, I see the Congressional      delegation. I see the legislature out there members of county      government, and all of you who Bob touched in some way or      another. But Fran, for you and your girls, June, for that      remarkable young man that you brought up, we are here today.      We come to pound on your heart with love.       I remember that first time that I met Bob. There were two      of us running, myself, a fellow called Phil Cottonbacker, and      we're both in our early thirties. And in some ways we really      didn't know what we were doing, but we were doing our best,      knocking on doors, trying to meet people. And then one day,      Bob came, out of Summit High School. And I remember because      that's the first time I saw that smile we're all talking      about. That's when I saw the cheerfulness. That's when I saw      the optimism. He already knew as much about politics as I      did, maybe more. I learned something else about Bob. Bob was      a pied piper, because first Bob came to volunteer, then he      brought a friend, then he brought two friends, then three and      four friends. Soon we had 10 people from Bob's class,      knocking on doors, going to supermarkets, passing out      literature, pressing envelopes, whatever we needed, because      Bob made it fun. Bob made it fun for other people. Bob was      sometimes, I think, you know, meeting Bob was like opening a      bottle of fine champagne. Everything, everything was good at      that point.       Well, we won that election and Bob and I stayed in touch.      And it came a number of years later--I'm going to talk about      three basic incidents in my life Bob touched. I was trying to      decide whether to run for governor. I'd lost once already in      a primary. My family was not terribly enthusiastic about the      prospect. I knew there were other strong candidates in the      field. I knew that one of them had much more money then we      would ever be able to spend. I knew that another one had much      more party support than I would ever get. And so the serious      question was whether to take this one on. Well it wasn't a      serious question to Bob. Not at all. Bob was on the phone.      Bob was there in person. Bob was running around the state.      Bob was doing whatever it took, and he would never let me for      a minute even consider the possibility, that I wasn't going      to run. He basically beat on my door until I finally      declared. And once I declared, the campaign was basically run      out of Bob's car for a while. I mean he became my first      campaign manager. People would call me from different parts      of the state who I'd never heard of, saying `You know, I'd      like to support you for governor.' I'd say `That's wonderful.      You like my ideas?' They'd say `No, I like Bob Franks.'       And, of course, Bob brought a number of assets, because not      only did he bring that wonderful enthusiasm and excitement      and all of that, he brought Al Fasola and Roger Bodman. And      once you had Al Fasola, and Roger Bodman and Bob Franks, it      didn't matter who had the money, it didn't matter who had the      political support--I think we ended up with four county      chairmen out of 21. It didn't matter. You were going to win,      because you had the best. And Bob was such an important part      of that and our whole campaign with that enthusiasm. He got      people in the legislature to defy their own county      organizations and their own county parties and come out and      endorse me, and those of you in politics know how tough that      is for anybody to do. He was a remarkable. And I'll say it      here: I don't know if I would have run or not, but I      certainly would not have been elected if it were not for the      efforts of Bob Franks.       When I got there, there were a lot of problems. We were in      a debt point, in a recession as we are now. We had a billion      dollar deficit, had a legislature of the other party, both      houses, and it was difficult. It was very, very difficult.      But there in my office, would be Bob. And Bob would come it,      with that smile, that cheerfulness and that optimism, showing      me how we could do it, how we could get something done. He      would bring in not only Republicans but Democrats. He would      tell me `Have you talked to this assemblyman, or that      senator? You know he's the other party, but he's really a      good person, and you can talk to them about issues.' And we      did that.       We put together some of those coalitions. But always,      always in the background was Bob, who cared so much, who      wanted to see it done right, who did it himself, always the      right way. You know he was always positive. He was never      down. He loved his colleagues in both his parties. He could      be partisan, but never negative, never nasty in any way at      all. He cared so much. The bottom line I think, that not only      did he love politics, but he cared so much about people. He      loved them: individuals, peoples who touched his life and he      came back and touched theirs in a very, very important way.       Politics for Bob was an honorable profession which meant      responsibility and opportunity for achievement and very much      an exciting adventure. After all, what is the use of living,      if not to strive for great causes and perhaps make this      muddled world of ours a little better place. Bob did that. He      cared about that.       The Reverend mentioned St. Paul, when he was in that      prison. He wrote something else. He wrote to his best friend,      he wrote a note. He wrote to Timothy. He wrote these letters,      these words, I think most of you know, to Timothy. He said:       `I have fought the good fight. I have finished my course. I      have kept the faith.'       Bob could have spoken those words. Fran, you and the girls      ought to be so proud, June you ought to be so very proud. We      are all better people for having known Bob. I think of him      smiling, I think of his cheerfulness, I think of his      enthusiasm, and today, I envy the angels.                     Former Congressman John Kasich       Look around. It's amazing today, isn't it? You know, on the      wall of Bob's house is a poster of Bobby Kennedy who would be      surprised? He was a man of great passion, just like Bob. I      remember as a young man, one young girl holding a sign as      Bobby Kennedy passed by, and the sign said: ``Bring Us      Together.'' Bob Franks has brought us together, hasn't he?      And not just the people at the top. He's brought so many of      his young proteges here today who have grown from young into      almost middle-aged men. Bob was a truly remarkable man and      our friendship was forged in the battles of trying to improve      America. That's what it was all about. It was never about the      politics. It was always about what we could do to make the      world a little better place for our children and their      children.       Last week I sat down with some of the people who were on      this team. We went through thick and thin, through government      shutdowns, and criticisms and blowups and yelling and all      wonderful debate that sometimes accompanies politics when it      isn't personal. It's part of life, it's part of what makes      this republic special. And we listed a couple of things that      we wanted to think about Bob, and I wanted to tell you about      Bob.       First of all, insightful. I don't think I ever met a more      insightful man than Bob Franks. He could look at something      that everybody else saw and he would always see it      differently. He could see the twist in it. He could take      advantage of it to move the ball downfield. How about his      cutting-edge humor? Always a little cutting-edge humor no      matter where you were. Sometimes Bob was even good at gallows      humor. You know when there was not even a speck of light      shining in the room, Bob could make us all laugh. He'd remove      the pressure. He'd have the little quip, and we'd all get the      belly laugh going. It would happen when there was no humor in      sight.       Loyalty. You know kids today say `You got my back?' Bob      Franks had your back. He didn't care if you were a Republican      or a Democrat, a liberal or a conservative. It didn't mean      anything. When You were his friend, he had your back. And he      exemplified exactly what we mean by that term.       Friendly. Well he's known for that smile. Some said      earlier, he walked into a room and lit it up. And that was      exactly right, because he had that 100 megawatt smile that      sort of transmitted a sense of strength. He had a sense that      things are going to be OK, things are going to be good.      Things can be really great.       Bob never attacked anybody else. In all the years I knew      him I never heard him say a bad thing about anybody. He was      smart. And what made him so smart is that he understood that      the key to life was not the divisions that exist between      people, but the friendships that potentially could be      developed. And he was a smart of a guy as I ever met and he      transferred on to these three angels down here [gestures to      Franks' daughters] because they're as smart as can be.       Great strategist? Didn't want to be up against him, did      you? Nobody wanted to be up against Bob when he got into      strategy, and frankly, think about what a great general he      would have been in the military. He could have sat in that      tent and figured how to take advantage of every opportunity.      And that's exactly what he did working with me to do      something that hadn't been done in about 40 years.       Oh, he loved his family. Gov. Christie's right. My      conversations were always `Mr. Chairman, how's the family.      How's the girls'. I'd said `Chairman, how's your family?' It      always started that way. Kinda always ended that way.       God, did he love his friends. Roger Bodman, Al Fasola. Oh,      and Laura. Ah, he just loved you to pieces. And of course he      so loved his family, and so loved Fran and those sweet girls.      Saw Kelly yesterday, that she gave me a big hug. And through      the gate, they were in the back yard, I got a chance to see      Sara and Abbey really for the first time. Little angels, and      a tribute to Fran and to Bob.       Of course he loved his Colts. Governor, I could never      figure it our either. I mean that Colt thing was just      unbelievable.       He could give you bad news, couldn't he governor? He could      give you bad news but in such a way that you could accept it.      He gave more bad news more of the time than I can even      believe! But I heard it, and I accepted it because he had      that special something. When he gave you a little bad news,      you knew that he had your back. You knew that he was right      with you.       You could never be mad at Bob Franks. That was impossible.      No matter what he did to you, you loved him. You never go      upset with him. I guess it was always because you knew he had      your back.       What a listener Bob was. You know, it was one of the things      that many of us have to do better. Bob could reply and      understand because he listened. He listened intently to      anything you had to say.       I liked to call him a foxhole guy. And I measure people      `Are they a foxhole guy.' In other words can I get into a      foxhole with this guy in the middle of the worst battle you      can imagine and know not only would he not jump out of that      foxhole to run and preserve himself, but he would jump out of      that foxhole and fight to help you. Oh, he was a great      foxhole guy.       Friendship. Today in the age of a media culture, fleeting,      situational, conditional, tattered--not with Bob. His      friendship had nothing to do with situations and conditions,      he would be friend to you through thick and thin. And frankly      when we think about it we can learn so much about what      character and principle and tenacity is when we study the      life of Bob Franks.       There is no question he left the world a better place.      Earlier today in the private ceremony, I wish you all could      have heard the testimonies to Bob. And under all of them was      a deep and abiding love and a sense that he made everybody      better because he believed in them. He made this world a much      better place. He inspires us. And I was inspired this morning      listening to the testimony of his dearest friends and family      and the young people that he raised. They're going to leave      their mark on the world and they're leaving it right now as      one of the top aides to the governor of the State of New      Jersey. Yeah, I'm going to miss Bob. I'm going to miss those      calls. But you know I'm going to remember this day, the      testimonies this morning, and this crowd, which is all about      how great his life was and about how many lives he impacted      and affected in a real way.       You know, Reverend, the Lord gives us a big promise. I've      never known the Lord, as I've studied it, to break his      promises. Fran, he promises in the next life, no more tears,      no more heartache, no more broken relationships, no more war,      no more death, and only happiness and fulfillment to be put      under the wings of the Lord.       I believe it. That's where Bob's today. God, Bless you Bob.      We love you, we miss you. We'll see you soon.                          ____________________
