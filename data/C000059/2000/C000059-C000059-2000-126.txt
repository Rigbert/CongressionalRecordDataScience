Speaker, today I highlight the Woodrow Wilson Elementary School, in my hometown of Corona, as a model of cooperation between local governments and private home builders--a partnership which will become more important as California will need more than 2,000 new schools in the next 20 years.  As a former active realtor, I was pleased to dedicate, on September 29, this first permanent, developer-built school in California. Thanks go to: Lt. Governor Cruz Bustamante; President Jose Lakas and the Corona-Norco School Board Members; Mayor Jeff Bennett and the City Council; and, finally, my good friend, Jim Previti for helping to make this school possible.  The Census Bureau reports that state and local governments spent $40 billion in 1999 on construction, modernization, and renovation of public education facilities in the United States--up 54 percent from 1995. In addition, elementary schools typically take 30 to 48 months to complete. However, Turn Key Schools of America and Forecast Homes, who designed and constructed this school, along with the Corona-Norco Unified School District, raised the bar. They were able to complete this school in just 13 months and well below the average construction cost of an elementary school thereby saving taxpayers millions of dollars. This partnership demonstrates what local communities and private businesses can accomplish when they work together.  Our 28th President, Woodrow Wilson was a lawyer, author, educator, administrator, Governor, and President. Education played an important role in his life. Prior to the Presidency, Woodrow Wilson's progressive programs and innovations were fostered as President of Princeton University. Finding new and better ways to meet the educational needs of our children, which is what was accomplished with the construction of this school, is an idea that would have fit nicely with Woodrow Wilson's school of thought.  Mr. Speaker, I am committed to making sure that every education dollar is well spent. This means allowing local school districts, principals and teachers to decide where and how education dollars can best be used, which includes ensuring that schools are built in a timely and cost-effective manner. I am also committed to allowing greater flexibility for the states and local governments to enter into such partnerships which allow the design of child-centered facilities and programs run by caring teachers and principals who know the names of each child.  I want every child to have the opportunity to fulfill their dreams--that could mean becoming a nurse, a teacher, an Olympic athlete, or becoming the President of the United States. All of those dreams can start becoming a reality sooner at Woodrow Wilson Elementary School because of the innovative thinking behind its construction.  Woodrow Wilson once stated, ``This is the country which has lifted, to the admiration of the world, its ideals of absolutely free opportunity--where no man is supposed to be under any limitation except the limitations of his character and of his mind; where there is supposed to be no distinction of class, no distinction of blood, no distinction of social status, but where men win or lose on their merits.'' Our goal is to ensure that all schools afford all children the opportunity to pursue their dreams. For the students at Woodrow Wilson Elementary School, those dreams take shape in the halls and classroom.  The partnership which made this school a reality is a win-win situation for everybody--it cuts the bureaucratic redtape for the local school district, it relieves the over-crowded schools in the area, and it saves taxpayers million of dollars. However, the most important winners at Woodrow Wilson Elementary are the students who now have a brandnew, state-of-the-art school where they can begin their educational journey and realize their hopes and dreams.  I applaud all of those who had a hand in this innovation. Our community is proud of you and grateful for your vision.                          ____________________
