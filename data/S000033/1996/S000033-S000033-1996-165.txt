 Speaker, for the benefit of my colleagues I would like to have printed in the Record this statement by several students from Champlain Valley Union High School in Vermont, who were speaking at my recent town meeting on issues facing young people:       We chose the topic of Drug Education for middle school      through some high school students, just because we feel that      drugs are everywhere, and in every high school, and involve      many people.       I'm going to give you a couple of statistics. In 1992 [the]      Drug Education budget was cut, and since then the per cent of      8th graders rose from 6.2% in '91 to 13% in '94. That is 110%      increase. From 1992-94, pot use rose 62% among the 10th      graders, and 40% among 12th graders. In '91-94, 8th graders      who say [they] use pot in the previous years doubled to 13%.      In '92-94, pot use among the 10th graders increased 66%,      while 12th graders increased 40%. In '94, 95% of 10th graders      and 31% of 12th graders said they used marijuana in the past      year. Pot use has had the most dramatic turn-around in the      1990's.       Other drugs on the rise, gradually: LSD, hallucinogens,      stimulants, barbiturates, and cocaine and crack, in 1994. At      every grade level from eight through twelve, one in five or      six tried sniffing an inhalant (such as glue, aerosol, paint      thinners), to just produce ``instant highs.'' Eighth graders      are most likely to have used inhalants than any other drug      except alcohol or tobacco. More than a third of the eighth      graders surveyed last year, and nearly half of the twelfth      graders said they used illicit drugs at least once. 20% of      the 8th graders said they had used inhalants, the most      widely-used drug in the age group.       I'm going to go a little bit into some of the drug      education programs that are out there. DARE, which is Drug      Abuse Resistance Education; it's not proven to be effective      as far as 7th and 8th graders go. They're more concerned      about being distant from adults, and more concerned about      being accepted among their peers. A police officer comes in,      you know, this is great for 5th graders; they love the cops,      and the whole idea of them coming. But as far as the police      officer question and answer, it's not very effective. Kids as      far as 7th and 8 graders ask questions that they shouldn't be      asking. They should be asking questions on . . . the effects      of this drug: what would it do in long-term of use. It's      proven that 5th graders that have been introduced to the      D.A.R.E. Program increased tobacco use from 7th to 9th grade      from 13% to 37%, and I see that as being a high jump,      considering it's supposed to be preventing drug abuse.       There's another program called the All-Stars Program, which      is involving 7th graders in Lexington, North Carolina. It      doesn't have teachers teaching. It has the children doing      skits--acting out plays--teaching themselves without      realizing that they're actually teaching each other to not do      drugs. I believe that's a pretty effective way of doing it.       There's also a Life Skills Training, that involved 3,597      predominately white, middle class students in 56 public      schools in New York, which were users of alcohol, tobacco and      marijuana. The whole program consists of: 15 classes in 7th      grade; 10 booster sessions in 8th grade; and then it      continues on to your freshman year in high school, where      you're actually involved with older peers, as far as 12th      graders that are more experienced into the drugs. Among these      students that got the complete program vs. a control, 44%      fewer were pot smokers (weekly), 23-33% fewer students got      drunk once/month, and about 33% fewer were a pack a day      smoker. So, the program seems to be pretty effective as far      as teaching education on the effects of drugs and what it      does to you, other than, you know, question & answer.       That's pretty much it.       Congressman SANDERS. Thank you very much. (APPLAUSE) Let me      ask you a couple of questions. From your own personal      observation, how serious is the drug and tobacco problem for      young people in the State of Vermont?       Answer. Very serious. I mean, it's everywhere. . . . To me,      I feel like there's no way you can escape it. You walk into a      bathroom at school, and there's nothing but filled with      smoke. I mean, there are other bathrooms to use, but if that      happens to be the closest one, there's no way of avoiding it.      You know, you tell them to stop, you bring them to the      office, it doesn't stop it; they're going to do what they      want, just because, they're rebelling against the      administration, or whatever it is. And, I just feel a lot of      it needs to be dealt with as far as education.       Congressman SANDERS. What you've suggested is that some of      the government programs, at least in your judgment, might not      be that effective--are not working. What would you suggest to      the State of Vermont actually in order to get kids away from      drugs and tobacco?       Answer. I would suggest--I would start educating in 5th      grade, but then continue through 7th and 8th grade; but not      doing is as D.A.R.E., where an officer comes in. You have      them acting out skits . . . one student being the supposedly      drug dealer and another being peer-pressured into it, and . .      . have another student in there saying, ``You know, don't do      it.'' So, pretty much teaching each other to not do drugs.                          ____________________
