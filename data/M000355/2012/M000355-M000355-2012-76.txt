  Senate Republicans are prepared to finish the continuing resolution today, prepared to vote on the Rand Paul proposal today, and prepared to vote on the Lindsey Graham proposal today. That was acceptable to the majority leader; it is not acceptable to him today. Obviously, something changed over on that side of the aisle.  So I just want everybody to understand that I and all the members of my conference are prepared to finish the business of the Senate that was before the Senate at the suggestion of the majority leader as recently as last night.
