 There is another area where it is a semigovernment nonprofit, which I know the Senator from Illinois feels very strongly about, and that is the Federally Qualified Community Health Centers begun by Senator Kennedy over 40 years ago, where we now have over 1,200 community health centers all over this country. In fact, I know this is widely supported in a bipartisan or tripartisan way, because the Federally Qualified Community Health Centers provide quality health care and dental care and low-cost prescription drugs and mental health counseling.  I might say to my friend from Illinois, one of the provisions in that 2,000-page bill he is holding up is legislation he and I and others have worked hard on, which is to substantially expand the Community Health Center Program into every underserved area in America. We talk about 46 million people being uninsured in this country. We have 60 million people who do not have access to a doctor on a regular basis.  If we expand the Community Health Center Program, if we expand to a significant degree the National Health Service Corps so we can help young people become primary health care physicians by paying off their very substantial medical debts, would my friend agree with me that this would be a major step forward in improving primary health care in America?
