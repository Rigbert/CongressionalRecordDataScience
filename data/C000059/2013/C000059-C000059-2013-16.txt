 Total funding in this bill represents a decrease of $2.9 billion below the fiscal year 2013 enacted level and $700 million below the post-sequester level. While funding is reduced, this bill still provides critical resources for important projects and programs that ensure our Nation continues to have access to affordable, reliable, and clean water and energy.  The bill also provides much-needed funding for our country's flood control projects that are constructed by the Army Corps of Engineers. My own district, California's 42nd District, is home to the Santa Ana River Mainstem project, which is one of the largest Corps projects west of the Mississippi River. I am pleased that the Corps and the Energy and Water Subcommittee continue to recognize the project's importance to providing adequate flood protection to the southern California region.  Additionally, in southern California, we recently lost 2,200 megawatts of power generation with the permanent shutdown of the San Onofre nuclear power plant. A significant generation shutdown of this nature creates tremendous uncertainty for ratepayers through our region.  Of course, energy production challenges are by no means exclusive to southern California. That is exactly why the energy programs funded in this bill are necessary. I am particularly pleased that our subcommittee has funded energy programs by taking an all-of-the-above approach that includes renewable, nuclear, and fossil fuels.  Americans rightfully expect affordable access to clean, affordable, and reliable energy and water. As a member of the Energy and Water Subcommittee, I believe we have done our best to meet those expectations with this bill, and I encourage all of my colleagues to support the bill.  In closing, I just want to thank Subcommittee Chairman Frelinghuysen, as well as Chairman Rogers, for their leadership and crafting a good, responsible bill.  I yield back the balance of my time.
