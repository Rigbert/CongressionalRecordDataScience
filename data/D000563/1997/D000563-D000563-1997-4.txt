President, late this week we will have an executive committee meeting of the Senate Judiciary Committee. We will return to a nomination made by President Clinton, one that I think has become a source of major controversy. The gentleman's name is Bill Lann Lee. Mr. Lee has been named by the President to be head of the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice.  I had never met Bill Lann Lee until about a month ago when he came by my office. He made a very positive impression in the short time we had to speak to one another. Then I read his background and sat through his confirmation hearing, and I want to say that I hope Mr. Lee will get the chance he deserves.  Bill Lann Lee is the son of Chinese immigrants who came to this country to New York virtually penniless. His mother and father started a hand laundry. He and his brother, who is now a Baptist minister, worked in that laundry with their parents. His mother sat, as he said, in a front window of the laundry every day at a sewing machine. His father was back doing washing and ironing, refusing, incidentally, to teach his sons how to iron. That's the major skill in a hand laundry. He didn't want his sons to know how to iron. He didn't want them to work there. He wanted them to think beyond the laundry.  When World War II started, Bill Lann Lee's father, who was 36 years old and could have escaped the draft just by claiming an age deferment but did not do it, volunteered and went in the Army Air Corps and had a very interesting experience because he came back from the war to his family and said, ``That was a good thing to do, not just for the Nation but good for me.''  For the first time, Bill Lee's father said, he was treated like an American, not like someone from China living in America. But when he came back from the war, as a returning veteran after World War II he found that job discrimination and housing discrimination was still very, very strong against Chinese-Americans. So he returned to his hand laundry but more determined than ever that his sons would have a better chance.  When Bill Lann Lee reached college age, it happened that Yale University decided they wanted to diversify their student body. They gave him a chance and said come to Yale and see if you can prove yourself. Well, he sure did. He graduated from Yale with high honors and then went to Columbia Law School and graduated with high honors.  With that kind of background, Bill Lee could have easily gone with a major law firm in New York, Los Angeles, wherever he happened to want to live, but he didn't. Bill Lee had learned a lesson in life, a lesson from his parents, and he decided that he wanted to fight discrimination. So for 23 years he has worked for the NAACP legal defense fund filing lawsuits when people are discriminated against.  The interesting thing about it is, when you think of these lawsuits, many times they are the most controversial lawsuits you can imagine. You know the headlines in the papers when they start talking about housing questions and school questions and questions involving gender or race or religious persuasion. Those are tough cases. But out of 200 cases that Bill Lee handled, only six ever went to trial. He was able to work out agreements in all the other cases.  In fact, one of his leading opponents, Richard Riordan, who is the Republican mayor of Los Angeles, wrote a letter about Bill Lee and said, ``I was on the other side of a lawsuit, and I want to tell you something. We never would have settled it without Bill Lee there. He practices mainstream civil rights law.''  I tell you, my friends, he is exactly the kind of person we need serving in the Department of Justice as the representative of the Office of Civil Rights. But I am sorry to report to you that in the last week some extreme political folks have set their sights to try to nail Bill Lee. They are trying to stop his appointment as the head of theCivil Rights Division, and that is an unfortunate development. It is unfortunate because, first, all he is asking is to be judged fairly. That is all he has ever asked in his life. And second, the things they are saying about him really do stretch the truth.  One of the leading conservative columnists in America, George Will, a man whom I really respect not just because he was raised and went to school in Illinois but because I think he is a pretty bright fellow, wrote a column in the middle of October and said we should turn down Bill Lee as ``a payback''--his words, ``a payback''--because the Senate Democrats, when they controlled the Judiciary Committee, turned down one of the civil rights appointments of a Republican President 10 years ago.  Please, let us not do that to Mr. Lee. Let us not do that to the Senate. Let us give him his chance to stand on his own feet and have an opportunity to serve this country. And so I hope those of you who think that when the Senate goes home and the House adjourns our work is done will realize there are still many men and women waiting for confirmation and one of the most important and highest is Bill Lann Lee. He would be the highest-ranking Asian American ever appointed, and I am glad that the President has named him and I hope that we can find just two, just two Republican Senators on the Judiciary Committee who will join the Democrats in supporting his nomination.                          ____________________
