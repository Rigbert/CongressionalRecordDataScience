Speaker, it is with great pleasure and honor that I congratulate Mr. Richard Krame on his retirement from the Town of Schererville. Dick has spent nearly 50 years dedicating his life to the interests of the residents of Schererville, Indiana. His career has allowed him the opportunity to touch the lives of numerous people. In honor of his gracious service to the community, there will be a celebration of his accomplishments on November 3, 2005.  Dick Krame has accomplished many visionary goals throughout his career. Dick was born in Chicago, Illinois and entered the United States Army in 1943, where his first mission was D-Day 1944. Dick was awarded the Croix De Guerre-with Star, which was the highest decoration a soldier could earn from French President Charles De Gaulle. He also received a number of U.S. awards for his service in the European, African, and Middle Eastern theaters. Dick felt tremendous pride for his country, and he was willing to endanger his own life to protect the lives of his fellow Americans. His courage and heroism will always be remembered, and his sacrifice will forever live in the hearts and minds of those for whom he battled.  After the War, Dick resumed his career with Inland Steel. He moved to Schererville, Indiana in 1954, and he became involved with the community in 1964. He served as an elected member of the Town Board and was Town Board President in 1970, 1971, and 1979. In 1982, Dick retired from his position as a General Foreman with Inland Steel. In 1989, he came out of full-time retirement from Inland Steel to fill many positions with the Town of Schererville. He served as Chairman of the Schererville Planning Commission, a member of the Police Commission, President of the Chamber of Commerce, Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce Corn Roast, a member of the Chamber's Economic Development Commission, and a member of the Quad Town Economic Commission. In 1998, Dick became the Schererville Town Manager.  While Dick has dedicated considerable time and energy to his work, he has always made an extra effort to give back to the community. Dick has been an active member of the Schererville Lions Club for over 42 years, and he was named President of the Lions in 1973 and 1986. Some other of his involvements include the Parade Picnic Committee and the St. Michael Church Council. The Rotary Club of Schererville also presented Dick with their 2004 Outstanding Citizen Award.  His work has been improving his community for over forty years. Though Dick is dedicated to his career and the community of Schererville, he has never limited his time and love for his family. Dick and his wife, Eleanor, have been happily married for thirty years.  Mr. Speaker, I respectfully ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating Mr. Richard Krame for his outstanding devotion to Indiana's First Congressional District. His unselfish and lifelong dedication to those in need is worthy of the highest commendation, and I am proud to represent him in Congress.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Page E2180]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                  CONGRATULATIONS TO MR.
