President, today I would like to take a moment to recognize Dr. Anthony Facui, Director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIAID, for his numerous contributions in medical research and specifically his work on HIV/AIDS, avian flu and anthrax. Even in a city such as Washington, which is filled with driven and motivated people, Dr. Fauci is a cut above. As Director of NIAID, he has worked tirelessly to lead the fight against AIDS and has been instrumental in shaping our understanding of how this disease works. I am proud to have worked with Dr. Fauci and would like to take this opportunity to submit the following article recounting the remarkable work and career of Dr. Fauci for the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 28, 2007]                           The Honored Doctor                     (By Sue Anne Pressley Montes)       Routinely, his gray Toyota hybrid is parked from 6:30 a.m.      until late at night outside Building 31 at the National      Institutes of Health in Bethesda. Sometimes his colleagues      leave notes on the windshield that say things like, ``Go      home. You're making me feel guilty.''       But Anthony S. Fauci has made a career of long hours,      exhaustive research and helping the public understand the      health dangers stalking the planet. As director for 23 years      of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases      at NIH, his milieu is the stuff that scares the daylights out      of most people: bioterrorism, deadly flu epidemics, the      enduring specter of AIDS.       Fauci, who is equally at home in the laboratory, at a      patient's bedside, at a congressional hearing or on a Sunday      morning talk show, scarcely has time to collect all the      accolades that come his way. But this has been an      extraordinary year. In the spring, he won the Kober Medal,      one of the highest honors bestowed by the Association of      American Physicians. In July, President Bush awarded him the      National Medal of Science. And today, he receives one of      medicine's most prestigious prizes, the $150,000 Mary Woodard      Lasker public service award, as ``a world-class      investigator'' who ``has spoken eloquently on behalf of      medical science,'' according to the Lasker Foundation.       No one deserves the honors more, his associates agree.       ``Dr. Fauci is the best of his kind,'' said former U.S.      surgeon general C. Everett Koop, 90, who has often sought      Fauci's medical advice and counts himself as a friend.       For someone else, this might be heady stuff. But Tony      Fauci, 66, has never strayed far from his down-to-earth      Brooklyn roots or his Jesuit training, with its emphasis on      service and intellectual growth. Beginning his career in the      lab--viewed by many as a backwater of medicine--he soon      became the chief detective probing a mystery that would      encircle the world. Before AIDS even had a name, he made the      ``fateful decision,'' he said, to make it the focus of his      research.       ``It was a matter of destiny, I think, but by circumstance      alone I had been trained in the very disciplines that      encompassed this brand-new bizarre disease,'' he said. ``This      was in my mind something that was going to be historic.''       He and his researchers would make breakthroughs in      understanding how HIV, the human immunodeficiency virus,      destroys the body's immune system. Years ago, he assumed a      public role, calmly explaining the latest health scares on      talk shows such as ``Face the Nation.'' Through four      presidential administrations, he has led efforts that      resulted in Congress dramatically increasing funding to fight      AIDS.       Today, as Fauci helps direct the president's emergency plan      for AIDS relief in Africa and elsewhere, he also is leading      the fight against such infectious diseases as anthrax and      tuberculosis. In his $250,000-a-year position, he oversees      1,700 employees and a $4.4 billion annual budget.       ``Fauci doesn't sleep,'' said Gregory K. Folkers, his chief      of staff. ``He's the hardest-working person you'll ever      encounter.''       The doctor's curriculum vitae supports that assertion. The      bibliography alone is 86 pages, listing 1,118 articles and      papers he has written or contributed to. (An example: ``The      Role of Monocyte/Macrophages and Cytokines in the      Pathogenesis of HIV Infection,'' published in      ``Pathobiology'' in 1992.) He has given more than 2,000      speeches, rehearsing with a stopwatch to whittle down his      remarks. He has received 31 honorary doctoral degrees.       Vacations are seldom on the agenda. Often, his wife and      three daughters accompany him to events. This summer, it was      the International AIDS conference in Sydney. But he is seldom      found sitting by the pool behind his Northwest Washington      home. And retirement, he said firmly, is ``not on the radar      screen.''                           Exceptional Child       He learned to question early.       It didn't make sense to him when the nuns at his school      said that you had to go to church to get into heaven. His      beloved paternal grandfather, an immigrant from Sicily, spent      his Sunday mornings cooking. What about him?       ``I remember going up to him one day. `Grandpa, why don't      you go to Mass?' And he said: `Don't worry about it. For me,      doing good is my Mass,' '' Fauci said.       The experience made him determined to do good through his      work. He was 7.       The Faucis lived in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn,      above the family drugstore operated by his father, Stephen, a      pharmacist.       Fauci's only sibling, Denise Scorce, recalls that he was a      well-rounded kid who liked to play ball but only after he did      his homework.       ``He was very normal in every way, but you kind of knew he      was special,'' said Scorce, 69, a retired teacher who lives      in Northern Virginia. ``Everything he did was perfect.''       Fauci won a full scholarship to Regis High School, a Jesuit      institution in Manhattan. Later, he enrolled in another      Jesuit school, the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester,      Mass.       ``The Jesuit training is wonderful. I don't think you can      do any better than that,'' he said. ``I always quote,      `Precision of thought, economy of expression.' ''       Although he had an aptitude for science, he received his      1962 bachelor's degree in Greek/pre-med. He took the minimum      number of science courses required for acceptance at Cornell      University Medical College.       ``I was very, very heavily influenced by the classics and      philosophy, which I think had an important part in my      ultimate interest in global issues and public service,'' he      said. ``I was interested in broader issues.'' I always tried      to look at things at 40,000 feet as well as down in the      trenches.''                         Encounter With ACT UP       One of the most dramatic episodes during Fauci's tenure at      NIH occurred in 1989, when angry ACT UP demonstrators swarmed      his building, demanding to be heard.       Fauci, like many top government officials, was accused of      not doing enough to fight AIDS. The tactics were attention-     getting: smoke bombs, staged ``die-ins,'' chalk bodies drawn      on sidewalks.       ``He was public enemy number one for a number of years,''      said writer and activist Larry Kramer, who led the charge.      ``I called him that in print. I called him very strong,      hateful things. . . . But Tony was smart enough to sit down      and talk with us.''       Fauci read the leaflets the group distributed and others      threw away. ``If you put it in the context of they were human      beings who were afraid of dying and afraid of getting      infected and forget the theater, they really did have a      point,'' he said.       When police officers moved to arrest the protesters, Fauci      stopped them. He invited a small group to his office to talk.       ``He opened the door for us and let us in, and I called him      a hero for that,'' Kramer said in a telephone interview. ``He      let my people become members of his committees and boards,      and he welcomed us at the table. You have to understand that      he got a lot of flak for that.''       It was worth it, Fauci said. ``That was, I think, one of      the better things that I've done.''                          Doctor as Family Man       Christine Grady still laughs when she recalls her first      meeting in 1983 with the famous Dr. Fauci. An AIDS nurse who      had recently joined the NIH after working in Brazil, she was      summoned to interpret for a Brazilian patient who wanted to      go home.       Grady was dismayed when the patient responded to Fauci's      detailed instructions on aftercare by saying in Portuguese      that he intended instead to go out and have a good time. She      knew Fauci tolerated no nonsense.       ``He said he'll do exactly as you say'' is how she      translated the patient's remarks.       She thought she had been found out a couple of days later      when he asked her to come by his office. Instead of firing      her, as she feared, he asked her out to dinner. They were      married in May 1985.       The Faucis live in a renovated 1920s home in the Wesley      Heights neighborhood. Grady, 55, has a doctorate in      philosophy and ethics from Georgetown, and she heads the      section on human subjects research at the NIH's Department of      Clinical Bioethics. Their children are also busy. Jenny, 21,      is a senior at Harvard University; Megan, 18, who will attend      Columbia University next fall, does community service      teaching in Chicago; Allison, 15, is on the cross-country      team at National Cathedral School.       ``He's a goofball,'' said Jenny Fauci of her father. ``He      works hard and he does his thing, but he comes home and he's      singing opera in the kitchen and dancing around.''       She thinks she understands what motivates him. ``Work is      not really work for him,'' she said. ``It's what he believes      in.''       And so Fauci will leave for the office before dawn and      return home long after sunset. It reminds him of that speech      he gave this summer at the AIDS conference in Sydney. ``It      was called `Much Accomplished, Much Left to Do,' '' he said.                          ____________________
