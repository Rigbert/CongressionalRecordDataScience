 President, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize National History Day, a yearlong academic program focused on improving the teaching and learning of history for 6th to 12th grade students, for receiving a 2011 National Humanities Medal. The National Humanities medals honor achievements in history, literature, education, and cultural policy. For the first time ever, a K 12 education program has received this prestigious award. National History Day was recognized as ``a program that inspires in American students a passion for history.''  Each year more than half a million students, encouraged by thousands of teachers nationwide, participate in the yearlong National History Day program. Students choose historical topics related to a theme and conduct extensive primary and secondary research through libraries, archives, museums, oral history interviews, and historic sites. After analyzing and interpreting their sources and drawing conclusions about the significance of their topics in history, students present their work in original papers, Web sites, exhibits, performances, and documentaries. These products are entered into competitions in the spring, at local, State, and national levels where they are evaluated by professional historians and educators. The program culminates in a national competition each June. National History Day programs operate in all 50 States, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories, engaging students with its unique approach to the hands-on learning of history.  In addition to discovering the exciting world of the past, National History Day also helps students develop the attributes that are critical to make them college and career ready. This includes:critical thinking and problem-solving skills, research and reading skills, oral and written communication and presentation skills, self-esteem and confidence, and a sense of responsibility for and involvement in the democratic process. With schools spending more resources and time focusing on English language arts and mathematics education, it is important that programs like National History Day are recognized and supported to ensure students receive a quality history and civics education.  The impact of National History Day is also supported by data. A recent comprehensive study by Rockman et al found that students who participate in National History Day develop a range of college and career-ready skills, and outperform their peers on State standardized tests across all subjects--including science and mathematics.  National History Day is much more than a day, it is an evidence-based history education program that gives our young people skills to succeed in school and post secondary careers as well as a valuable understanding of how the world they live in has been shaped by people and events of the past. National History Day is a unique program that has benefited over 15 million students since 1982. I congratulate them on winning the 2011 National Humanities Medal and wish them many more years of continued success.                          ____________________
