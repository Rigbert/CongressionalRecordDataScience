President, in Oklahoma, we know the importance of predicting and tracking severe weather. Each spring, during tornado season, people in Oklahoma brace themselves for dangerous storms. However, instead of hiding in the dark, like they used to do, today, they can depend on a stellar source for up-to-date, real-time information. The National Severe Storms Labs NSSL has played a vital role in providing research for predicting and tracking this harmful weather. In light of this, I rise today to recognize the 40th anniversary of the vital office of the NSSL within the Department of Commerce/National Oceanic and Atmoheric Administration, in Norman, Oklahoma.  The National Severe Storms Laboratory was established in 1964 and leads the way in investigations of all aspects of severe and hazardous weather. NSSL is a vital part of NOAA Research and the only federally supported laboratory focused on severe weather. The lab's scientists and staff constantly explore new ways to improve understanding of the causes of severe weather and ways to use weather information to assist National Weather Service, NWS, forecasters, as well as Federal, uiversity and private sector partners.  These scientists are working on ways to improve short-term weather forecasting computer models for the National Weather Service's basic tornado research to understand how tornadoes form, as well as real-time delivery ofradar data to the meteorological community and interested partners. Research at NSSL has led to greater knowledge and improved forecasts of tornadoes, flash floods, damaging winds, hail, lightning, heavy snow, ice and freezing rain.  Early on, NSSL researchers recognized the potential of Doppler radar to improve the detection and warning of severe weather. NSSL built the first real-time displays of Doppler velocity data, which led to discoveries of tornado-related radar ``signatures.'' The successful demonstration that Doppler radar could help forecasters provide much improved severe thunderstorm and tornado warnings led to the deployment of the Next Generation Weather Radar, NEXRAD, WSR-88D, network of Doppler radars throughout the United States. This important contribution to the Nation was recognized by a Department of Commerce gold medal award, and was the only NOAA research laboratory so recognized.  NSSL continues to be a pioneer in the development of weather radar. The lab is working with the NWS to deploy dual polarization, a planned upgrade to the current NEXRAD Doppler radar hardware that provides more information about precipitation in clouds to better distinguish between rain, ice, hail and mixtures. Such information will help forecasters provide better forecasts and warnings for flash floods, the number one severe weather threat to human life.  In addition, NSSL researchers are adapting state-of-the-art radar technology currently deployed on Navy ships for use in tracking severe weather. Phased array radar reduces the scan or data collection time from 5 or 6 minutes to less than 1 minute, potentially extending the lead time for tornado warnings beyond the current average of 12 minutes. When combined with other technology being developed at NSSL, warning lead times may be extended even farther.  Recently, NSSL collaborated with the University of Oklahoma, Texas Tech, and Texas A University to build two new 5-cm mobile Doppler radars. These SMART-Radars--Shared Mobile Atmospheric Research and Teaching Radars--are capable of scanning and penetrating an entire tornadic storm or hurricane, providing critical data needed to understand the mysteries of how tornadoes form and for eventually improving severe storm forecasts and warnings.  During the past few years, scientists from NSSL completed several field experiments to study severe and hazardous weather. In 2003 and 2004, researchers launched weather balloons loaded with instruments into thunderstorms during the Thunderstorm Electrification and Lightning Experiment, or TELEX. The lightning observations they made will be used to improve forecasts and warnings of hazardous weather. In 2002, NSSL hosted the International H2O Project or IHOP, one of the largest weather-related studies ever conducted in the U.S.  NSSL has a research partnership with the Cooperative Institute for Mesoscale Meteorological Studies, a cooperative institute between the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the University of Oklahoma. Additionally, NSSL conducts collaborative research with other NOAH laboratories including the Forecast Systems Laboratory, the Environmental Technologies Laboratory, and the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory, as well as the U.S. Navy, Air Force, Army, Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, Texas A, Texas Tech University, Lockheed Martin, Basic Commerce and Industries, Weather Decision Technologies, WeatherNews International, Inc., WeatherData, Inc., and Salt River Project.  I congratulate the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, OK, on their first 40 years. Based on their performance since 1964, I believe we can expect many more years of pioneering scientific research from this outstanding institution, their academic, government and private sector partners, and their many scientists and technicians.                          ____________________
