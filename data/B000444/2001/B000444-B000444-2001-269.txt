 It was a moving ceremony, a chance for all those in attendance to rededicate themselves to the noble goals which shaped Alan Cranston's life.  Alan Cranston will be remembered by those of us who knew and loved him as a man of peace who devoted much of his adult life--four terms in the Senate and a decade as director of the Global Security Institute--to the tasks of promoting nuclear arms control and encouraging world peace. These are not small objectives, but of course Alan Cranston's interests extended beyond them, literally, ``. . . from the Redwood Forests to the Gulf stream waters.'' Never content to sit on the sidelines, Alan Cranston fought tirelessly for the causes in which he believed: nuclear disarmament, the environment, civil rights, and decent housing. He brought the intensity of a sprinter and the endurance of a marathoner to each of these causes.  During his tenure as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee from 1981-1993, Alan Cranston was a devoted supporter of strong U.S. leadership in the world, whether it meant promoting the development of democracy in the Philippines and Cambodia or working to halt the spread of nuclear weapons.  Alan Cranston knew that the United States could not go it alone in the world. In an age when American unilateralism, if not isolationism, has gained a certain currency in Washington, Alan Cranston's life reminds us that the highest aspirations of the American people are those which lead us to care about others and work with others to address common problems.  The intensity, integrity, and commitment Alan Cranston brought to public service stand as an example we all might follow as we begin work in this 107th Congress.  Mr. President, I would ask unanimous consent that a transcript of the remarks made at Senator Cranston's memorial service be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:   Alan MacGregor Cranston Memorial Service, Grace Cathedral in San                      Francisco, January 16th, 2001       The following friends and family took part in the      extraordinary memorial service of Alan MacGregor Cranston:       The Very Reverend Alan Jones, Dean, Grace Cathedral.       Colette Penne Cranston, daughter-in-law of Alan Cranston.       Kim Cranston, son of Alan Cranston.       Gray Davis, Governor of California.       Joseph Biden, US Senator from Delaware.

I am Alan Jones, the Dean of      the Cathedral, and it is my privilege to welcome you to Grace      Cathedral for this celebration of the life of Alan MacGregor      Cranston.       It is fitting that such a large-hearted man be honored and      remembered in a soaring and splendid space.       There was a comment in the London Times about the public      reaction to the death of Diana, Princess of Wales. First, it      showed that our instinct for devotion is still deep within      us. Second, that huge emotions require huge spaces, like      cathedrals. And third, that the things we do in them are      always up for change.       And so I invite you first to allow the instinct for      devotion, the call of something and someone larger than      ourselves to well up in you this afternoon, and I think the      Senator would have applauded anything that called us out of      our cynicism and challenged us not to accept futility as      normal.       I invite you also to acknowledge that huge emotions require      huge spaces. We need great spaces and ways of celebration in      order to locate ourselves in a larger vision of the human      enterprise.       And finally I invite you to be open to that fact, the fact      that things we do in places like this are always up for      change. Life is never business as usual, and nothing would      have pleased Alan more than for us to leave this place      resolved to make a difference.       So, we welcome you to the Cathedral for this celebration of      the life of a man who held a large and generous vision of      what it is to be human.       Our best way to honor him is to share and maintain that      vision of a just and humane society on a planet fit for all      living beings.       So as you remain seated, I invite you to pray.       Dear God, we thank you for the life and the work of Alan      MacGregor Cranston. His generous spirit opened doors and      touched many lives for good. His faith in the human      enterprise inspired us to accept the great joy and      responsibility of being human. His political skills      ensured an enduring legacy.       He was friend to those who had no voice, and a lover of the      great spaces of the wilderness. His long life touched and was      touched by the great events of our time. He was a man for all      seasons.       In public life, he fought for what he believed with passion      and hard work. His caring, open-heartedness and his respect      for people touched the lives of many. His generous spirit      wanted everybody to do well, and this generosity was      infectious.       And so we thank you for his capacity for friendship, his      probing intelligence, and his refusal to be enticed into      meanness and pettiness.       Finally, we thank you for his life and example, and we      commend him into your gracious care. May we honor him by      rededicating ourselves to peace on Earth, and goodwill to all      people, and to building a more just and inclusive America.      Amen.       Colette Penne Cranston. Hello! I am Alan's daughter-in-law,      Colette. I am the first speaker because I need to be. Our      daughter has commented that I seem to have an endless supply      of tears. Since I was honored to have such a close, personal      relationship with Alan, I wanted to give you some insights      into his gentle, unwavering spirit. He was much more than my      father-in-law, he was my friend, my advisor and now and I      know he will love this he has become my Jiminy Cricket, that      little voice in my conscience that says, 'think before you      leap!'       Kim, Evan our seven-year-old daughter and I live right next      to Alan's on the same property. Alan's big sister, who we      call RE, lived up the hill from us until recently. This      arrangement was such a gift for everyone! Alan and Evan had      great sunset walks together, evenings of art work and stories      around the fire at his place, and dinner dates out just the      two of them. They would dress up and go to a restaurant,      often one with a piano player, and make an evening of it.      Evan called him ``Gran.'' One night when the two of them were      returning from a walk, Kim called me out to the balcony and      said, ``Listen!'' We could hear their voices but couldn't see      them yet. Alan was saying, ``Well, you know, Evan, I don't      know why that's true, but it is true dogs love to ride in      cars and cats don't.'' Just then they rounded the corner to      come up the driveway and they were holding hands.       A couple of years ago, the four of us spent three weeks in      the UK. Our first week in London, Alan was occupied with      meetings and a quick turn-around to Geneva, but the final two      weeks we toured the countryside with no particular itinerary      except to visit some relatives in Scotland and the grave of      Rob Roy MacGregor, an ancestor who Alan's middle name is      from. We also visited the graves of Alan and RE's great-     grandparents six generations back, whose tombstones were      leaning together and touching. Each evening before dinner,      Alan would tell Evan a story, some lasting forty-five      minutes. In the parlor of one bed and breakfast where we      stayed for three nights, other guests would join in to listen      and ask if they could come the next night to hear the      stories, they were that good.       One of the most important, and I believe, reassuring      lessons that we can take from Alan's life is that we do not      have to be limited in our later years. When we tell people      that Alan never retired, he never stopped working, they do      not really hear that. The truth is that he was the most      disciplined, diligent, and determined person I have ever met.      He was also still making friends with and inspiring young      people. Two such friends, a man in his thirties and a woman      in her forties, touched us with their expressions of personal      grief following Alan's death. The young men in their twenties      who work with Alan's Global Security Institute, Patrick Neal,      Zack Allen, and Tyler Stevenson, are bright and motivated and      will do great things in their own lives with memories of      Alan staying with them. Don't we all wish for a life of      impact and meaning and a quick, painless end surrounded by      those we love? He did most everything right!       I can, of course, remember a difficult time in Alan's      career. At the time I was in an elected position also, so I      was very interested in how he was handling it. As I watched      what was happening to him, I asked him, ``Alan, how can you      bear this?'' He answered, ``Colette, there are politics in      the locker room, the boardroom and the United States Senate.      Since you have to put up with them wherever you are, I want      to be in the Senate, where the politics are intense, but I      can get the most done.''       Over Thanksgiving, Alan and his sister took a week's      vacation together. He was working to finish his book on      sovereignty rather than just relaxing by the pool and she      said, ``you work too hard''. He replied, ``I want to stagger      across the finish line knowing I've done all I possibly      can!'' He did not stagger, he was still sprinting!       I want to close with a message from our seven-year-old      daughter, Evan. Her Brownie     troop leader read a story about loss that she said helped      her. It was about a badger who was the oldest and wisest      member of a community of animals. He knew that because of his      age, he might die soon. Dying meant only that he would leave      his body behind, and as his body didn't work as well as when      he was young, he wasn't too concerned about that. His only      worry was how his family and friends would feel. He died      before the start of a winter and the animals were very sad.      But as they thought about him they realized he had given them      each something to treasure: a parting gift of a skill or      piece of knowledge. Evan said, ``Didn't Gran help lots of      people and do lots of things to make the world better?'' I      said, ``Yes, he left behind countless parting gifts for all      of us to never forget!''       Kim Cranston. Thank you all for being here today to      celebrate Alan's life--yes, I too called him Alan.       In the program for this ceremony is the observation of the      Chinese philosopher Lao-Tzu that Alan carried in his pocket      most of his life as a guide to the style of leadership he      practiced. It begins by observing that leaders are best when      people barely know that they exist, and concludes by      observing that of the best leader, when his work is done and      his aim fulfilled, the people will all say, ``we did this      ourselves.''       In the world of modern politics in which name recognition      is so important, this approach to leadership presented an      interesting paradox for Alan, which is also present today as      we celebrate the accomplishments of his life.       I understand, however, that there is a little known      addendum to Lao-Tzu's observation that states that ``after      such a leader has passed on, people will join together to      mourn their loss, celebrate their accomplishments, and      recommit to the causes they shared.'' I welcome you here      today in that spirit.       Alan touched many people's lives in many different ways. We      all have stories we can tell about times we spent and things      we did with Alan to make the world a better place. This      afternoon we have time for just a few of Alan's friends and      collaborators to share some of their stories with us. I want      to invite each of you to join us after this ceremony at the      reception at the Fairmont Hotel where, in addition to having      the opportunity to catch up, laugh, and cry, there will be      video cameras so each of you can take a moment if you'd like      to tell your story.       My own story is simple. I was incredibly blessed to have      had Alan as a wonderful father, my dearest and oldest friend,      a treasured teacher and mentor, and an invaluable      collaborator and leader in addressing the great challenges of      our time.       It is almost unbearable for me to think we will never again      in this life share another meal, or football game, or joke or      prank, or afternoon discussing strategy.       I learned many, many things from Alan. Five stand out      today.       First, I learned about the subtle, profound power of the      style of leadership he practiced. In the past few days it's      been very enriching for me to reflect on Lao-Tzu's      observation of leadership and everything that Alan helped us      accomplish in his lifetime.       Second, I learned that the greatest meaning in life is      found in making the world a better place. As one of Alan's      heroes, Martin Luther King, Jr., observed ``Life's most      persistent and urgent question is ``What are you doing for      others?''       Third, I learned something Alan understood early on: We      live in one of the most extraordinary moments in human      history. In our lifetimes, for the first time since humans      have inhabited the earth, we have developed the capacity to      destroy human and perhaps all known life in the universe      forever, either through a sudden nuclear holocaust or the      more gradual destruction of the environment. Simultaneously,      we are developing the capacity to create sustainable and      economically just societies.       What those of us alive now do together may well determine      which of these two paths we take, and could help decide the      fate of the human race. There exists a small window of      opportunity for us to act. A window of opportunity that may      well not exist for the generations of our children or their      children. If humanity is to continue, if we are to prosper      rather than perish, we must transform our society and develop      effective approaches to resolve those challenges that we      share and can only address at the global level. This is the      task before our generation and it was to that end that Alan      devoted most of his working life.       The fourth lesson is that in view of all this it is      important to keep a sense of humor. Colette told me she'd      recently spoken with Alan about something someone had done      that affected them both, which she found very disturbing.      Colette asked Alan why it didn't seem to bother him as much      and he replied: ``I find that in situations like this I can      choose to be either terrified or amused.''       And the fifth lesson is to be compassionate to our fellow      living beings.       Of course, I learned a great deal more from Alan, but these      are the lessons foremost in my mind today.       While to many people Alan seemed a whirlwind of activity,      he was also a voracious reader and a prolific writer.       In 1945, he published ``The Killing of the Peace,'' which      detailed how a small group of people defeated Woodrow      Wilson's campaign to create the League of Nations to address      the global challenges we face, and which the New York Times      called one of the ten most important books of the year.       And just a few days before he passed on, Alan completed a      book--``The Sovereignty Revolution'' that begins with the      following passage:       It is worshiped like a god, and as little understood.       It is the cause of untold strife and bloodshed. Genocide is      perpetrated in its sacred name.       It is at once a source of power and of power's abuse, of      order and of anarchy. It can be noble and it can be shameful.       It is sovereignty.       I commend this book to you all and I'm happy to announce      today it will soon be available through, among other places,      the web site for the Global Security Institute      (www.gsinstitute.org), the nonprofit organization Alan      recently founded to advance his work to abolish nuclear      weapons and advance global security.       While we all miss Alan, we can take solace in knowing that      he fulfilled the purpose of making a difference with his life      and leaving the world a better place.       In closing, I want to thank you again for being here to      mourn the loss we all share, celebrate what we've      accomplished, and recommit to the causes that brought us      together. As Alan would say at the end of nearly all of his      speeches, I thank you for all you are doing and urge you      onward.       Thank you.       Gray Davis, At first I want to express the deep condolences      of my wife Sharon and I to Eleanor Cameron, Alan's sister, to      Kim, Colette, and to the extended Cranston family.       My friends, we come here today not just to mourn Alan      Cranston, but to honor him. We're greatly saddened by his      passing, but we're grateful for his extraordinary life and      the rich legacy he left behind.       Alan was a native Californian who grew up to be an      extraordinary public servant. He had a sharp intellect, a      humility of spirit, and a quality of compassion that is rare      in life and rarer still in public life. He was an      extraordinary person. Yes, he was a pragmatist who understood      that progress was a long struggle for common ground. But he      was also an idealist who believed that violence anywhere was      a threat to freedom everywhere.       He reminded us that there is a moral force in this world      more powerful than the mightiest of nations or the force of      arms. And one by one, he tackled the great issues of our      time: World peace; arms control; veterans' health;      environment. One by one, he made a difference.       For those of you fortunate enough to spend some time in the      Golden Gate National Recreational Area or the Santa Monica      Mountains or the desert lands that he protected, you know      what a difference he made. Future generations will      acknowledge their debt of gratitude to Alan Cranston, and it      is most appropriate that we thank him today.       Alan was also a very good politician. He ran every race      with the same focus and intensity that he learned running the      hundred-yard dash back at Stanford. He was almost always the      underdog. Critics dismissed his chances, saying he lacked the      charisma to win. But Alan proved time and again that in this      state character, not charisma, is what people want most.       He became only the second Californian to be elected four      times to the United States Senate--Hiram Johnson being the      first. He became the patron saint of every candidate for      office inflicted with a charisma deficit, myself included. He      is my personal hero.       Alan may have lacked charisma, but he was enormously      resourceful. Eleanor tells in her book the story of Alan's      first race for Controller in 1958. Alan knew someone who had      a television show in Los Angeles. But the host of the show      reminded Alan he was contractually obligated to talk about      contact lenses. He couldn't mention he was a candidate for      office and under no circumstances could he say he was a      Democrat. But as I said before, Alan was very resourceful. So      he went on the show just a few days before his election and      he said, ``My name is Alan Cranston. I'm running up and down      the state making contacts and jumping in front of lenses. I      am Alan Cranston.'' The viewing audience didn't have a clue      what he was talking about. But he mentioned the name Alan      Cranston eight times. And even though he'd never been elected      to public office before, he was elected Controller of the      State of California. So Alan knew what he was talking about.       Finally my friends, Alan Cranston was part of the World War      II generation. A generation that Tom Brokaw has aptly      described as our ``Greatest Generation.'' A generation from      which much was asked and a great deal was given. A generation      that went to Europe and stood down Adolf Hitler's Nazi      regime, rescued the survivors of the Holocaust, and literally      saved democracy as we know it today.       It was a generation that came home with no expectation of      recognition and went about rebuilding a new America. A      generation that built roads, hospitals and businesses, and      paved the way for the digital economy, although most did not      live to enjoy it. A generation that did their duty, and then      came home.       God has called Alan Cranston home. I know God has blessed      his soul. I know God will give Alan enduring peace for which      he struggled his entire life to try and obtain for all the      peoples of the world. I ask you to say a prayer tonight for      Alan, his family and his loved ones.       It was my honor to lower the flag today in recognition of      his remarkable career, and it's my honor now to present it to      Kim and Colette. Thank you.       Joseph Biden. My name is Joe Biden. I served with Alan for      twenty of his twenty-four years in the Senate, but I consider      myself more a student of Alan's. Kim, Colette, Evan, I never      fully understood your father's tenacity, by the way, until I      heard the repeated emphasis on the middle name MacGregor. Now      I understand it better. Eleanor, my sister Valerie says it's      very difficult raising a brother; you obviously did well at      your chore.       I'm very grateful, and indeed privileged, for having the      honor of being here today to represent the US Senate and the      Senate Foreign Relations committee. It's a task that's well      beyond my capabilities, because the life we commemorate was      so extraordinary. To you, his family, to us, his colleagues      and friends, and to the people of this state and nation,      we're not likely to see anyone like Alan, anytime soon.       I can't help but think of American architect Daniel      Burnham's credo when I think of Alan. He said--       ``Make no little plans, they have no magic to stir men's      blood. Make big plans, aim high in hope and work, remembering      that a noble, logical diagram once recorded will never die,      but long after we are gone will be a living thing, asserting      itself with ever-growing intensity.''       Intensity, big plans, no little plans, that was the Alan      Cranston that I knew. Most of us would consider it a      successful career if we did nothing other than be sued by      Adolf Hitler. But here's a fellow, a young man who came back      from Europe as a correspondent, who felt obliged to translate      accurately Mien Kampf, who felt obliged to begin a crusade to      expose Adolf Hitler. This is a fellow who didn't just decide      to help a little bit. I remember the lecture I got on redwood      forests. I had not seen one and did not know they had to be      preserved. This is a fellow who had no lesser aim than to      eliminate nuclear weapons in his time, to guarantee racial      equality, to provide durable, affordable housing. I know of      no man that I've served with in the Senate, and I've been      there twenty-eight years, who had as many intense interests      and contributed so much to so many different endeavors.       What accounted for that intensity that dominated Alan's      character? It used to baffle me until one day I figured it      out--it was Alan's integrity, his honesty, his inability to      rationalize to himself that he didn't have any responsibility      for this or that problem that he observed in this country.       Alan had an inner compass that would have plagued most of      us. He could spot injustice a mile away. He smelled hypocrisy      almost before he walked in the room. He knew what had to      be done, and he unfailingly did it, or at least attempted      to do it, usually before anyone else, and almost always at      some risk to himself. I think integrity, political      integrity, personal integrity, is doing what you know to      be right even when you know it's likely not to benefit      you. Alan was one of the few people I served with who      never, never wondered whether he should act based on      whether what he was about to do was popular.       Alan MacGregor Cranston, born in 1914. He was almost thirty      years my senior, yet he was one of the youngest people I have      ever known and have ever served with.       It was not just that his policy priorities would fit under      the heading of progressive, although they would, but with      Senator Cranston, the senator from California, it was more      than that. There was what Robert Kennedy described as--       ``The qualities of youth: not a time of life but a state of      mind, a temper of the will, a quality of imagination, a      predominance of courage over timidity, of the appetite for      adventure over the love of ease.''       We've all heard that quote a thousand times, but I can      think of none other that describes the Alan Cranston that I      worked with, although some of you knew him much more      intimately.       Alan's commitment to arms control, his passion for      environmental protection, his leadership in public housing      and transportation, women's rights, civil rights, civil      liberties, his concern for justice in immigration laws; those      efforts, those views had nothing to do with fashion, and      everything to do with conviction.       The Senator was not one for looking at a situation and      deciding what he believed, he knew exactly what he believed.      His public positions were not just what he said and what he      did, they were who Alan Cranston was.       The senator was armed with conviction, but he always knew      that wasn't enough. He was an athlete, after all, and      understood that it's not enough to have talent; that if you      want it to matter, you have to do something with it, and work      like hell at it.       Alan Cranston did work, and he worked at leadership. He      understood power, not as a reflection of status, but a tool      for a purpose, and he used it as well as any man or women      I've ever known.       In his 24 years in the Senate and the years since, Alan      Cranston pushed our consciousness and our conscience on every      issue of consequence, particularly nuclear weapons. He was      not just a powerful senator from California, not just an      influential member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,      not just a democratic whip; he was truly a world leader on      nuclear policy. In China, in North Korea, in the Middle East,      they had to factor in Alan Cranston when they made their      decisions.       He was an internationalist in the great American tradition,      with an idealist's love of peace and a passion for freedom,      and he had a realist's understanding of the global balance of      power and simple human nature.       He had learned from history, he taught from history, but      kept his eye and his aim always on the future: the future of      the Philippines, the future of our relationship with Russia,      and what that would mean to the world, the future of our      natural resources, and the generation of Americans that we'll      never know.       Alan Cranston ran the hundred-yard dash in under ten      seconds when he was at Stanford, and I might add under twelve      and a half seconds when he was almost sixty years old. He was      consistent, and he was fast, in a hurry. I would suggest not      to reach the finish line, but to get to the next race, the      next test, the next opportunity, the next possibility,      always possibilities. The certainty of a redwood, the      spirit of a wild river, ``a predominance of courage over      timidity, of the appetite for adventure over the love of      ease.''       The playwright Sam Shepherd wrote, ``character is an      essential tendency. It can be covered up, it can be messed      with, it can be screwed around with, but it can't ultimately      be changed. It is the structure of our blood that runs      through our veins.'' Evan, you've got good blood, kid. It      runs through your veins.       Ted Turner (via video). I could not begin to say enough      about my dear friend Senator Cranston, so sorry he's passed      away. He has been an inspiration to me for a number of years,      no more so than in the area of weapons of mass destruction.      And even though he did not live to get to see the end and the      abolition of nuclear weapons from this world, there are a lot      of us that are going to continue his work, and I am one of      them. We're going to miss you very much, Senator. Thank you      very much.       Sally Lilienthal. Jonathan Schell wrote recently that Alan      Cranston has quietly done more than any other American to      marshal public will to abolish nuclear weapons. He brought      the issue of nuclear arms reductions and abolition to the      attention of business leaders, policy makers and cultural      figures--and most difficult of all, to retired generals and      admirals. And never by email--he didn't have it.       Our last endeavor together was a national campaign to      mobilize places of worship, which is gathering steam today in      Christian churches, Jewish synagogues and Muslim mosques, and      which was originally housed and organized at the Washington      Cathedral in the nation's capital--The other cathedral.       Early last summer, two years of work came to fruition at an      ecumenical service where religious figures together with      former generals and admirals called for the reduction and      abolition of nuclear weapons. That started the ongoing      campaign, the nub of which was the statement Alan wrote and      rewrote to get it finally signed by eighteen retired admirals      and generals joining in with twenty-one religious figures      around the country. Alan was a marvelous writer and consensus      builder. It wasn't easy to sign up the top military figures      to reduce and finally abolish nuclear weapons, for abolition      is not part of Pentagon thinking. And besides less than four      years before he had traveled widely to recruit sixty-three      different internationally based generals and admirals to sign      another affirmation on the same subject. Let me read you two      short sentences from the statement signed by military and      church which is at the nub, one might say, of our ecumenical      campaign.       ``We say that a peace based on terror, a peace based upon      threats of inflicting annihilation and genocide upon whole      populations, is a peace that is corrupting--a peace that is      unworthy of civilization.''       And he went on to write: ``We say that it defies all logic      to believe that nuclear weapons could exist forever and never      be used. This nuclear predicament is untenable in the face of      a faith in the divine and unacceptable in terms of sound      military doctrine.''       Alan was always positive. I never saw him downhearted      during this laborious struggle to rid the world of nuclear      weapons. He was tireless in working toward our goal and he      never ever thought of failure. So he leaves us with an active      legacy--the most important legacy of all--that of hope, good      solid hope.       William Turnage. My name is Bill Turnage. I came to know--     and to love--Alan Cranston during my seven years in      Washington as President of the Wilderness Society. Kim      has asked me to talk about Alan's great work as an      environmentalist.       California--our golden state--has been twice-blessed by the      mountain gods.       We have been granted a land among earth's most sublime yet      diverse.       And we've been granted a few splendid champions to protect      that heritage.       In early days, farsighted San Franciscans like Thomas Starr      King and Frederick Billings came forward to protect the      Yosemite.       The idea of a national park was born at the time--perhaps      the best new idea our American democracy has ever had.       And these early champions enlisted a great Californian      photographer--Carleton Watkins--to make pictures that would      help persuade the Congress.       And their dream of a Yosemite park was first given shape      and form by America's greatest landscape architect, Frederick      Law Olmsted.       And when the Yosemite Sierra was threatened by hooved      locusts--and loggers--and miners--John Muir came forward and      founded the Sierra Club--and he protected the heart of the      High Sierra, the range of light.       And great Muir bequeathed the protection of the Yosemite to      his inheritor, San Francisco's native son, Ansel Adams.       They were two of the greatest environmental philosophs in      our nation's history.       And to turn their dreams into reality, California was      blessed with two of our nation's greatest environmental      legislators, Phil Burton and Alan Cranston.       And Alan and Ansel formed a very special friendship--a      friendship dedicated to saving wild California. Ansel wrote,      in his autobiography, ``I have known many great people in      California's history, spanning my 60 active years. But I have      never been in contact with a public official of such      integrity, imagination, concern and effectiveness as Alan      Cranston...I have found him to be a great leader, one who      transcends party politics for causes of essential human      importance.''       The honor roll of California's wild places Alan helped save      is too long to recite here; it encompassed our state from the      Oregon border redwoods to the Mojave desert in the south.       Perhaps Alan's most lasting contribution to our country's      future was his characteristically quiet, determined and      effective leadership of the long, arduous but ultimately      successful campaign to save the best of wild Alaska.       One hundred million acres--the size of the state of      California--preserved for all time. We simply could not have      done it without Alan's undaunted leadership.       And it could be said that Alan's most lasting contribution      to our golden state was his characteristically patient yet      visionary leadership of the long, arduous but ultimately      successful campaign to save the best of the great Californian      desert. We simply could not have done it without Alan's      undaunted leadership.       In 1994, when the Desert Protection Act was finally coming      to fruition in a Democratic presidency--and Alan had retired      from the Senate--I proposed, with Alan's consent, naming the      vast wilderness areas of Death Valley National Park--95% of      the largest park in the lower 48--``the Alan Cranston      Wilderness.''       Regrettably, the proposal was declined. Today--at this time      of remembrance and in this hallowed place--I would like to      again propose that we join together to ask the congress to      name this wilderness--now known simply as ``The Death Valley      Wilderness''--for our great friend and Senator. The honor,      like the wilderness he made possible, will last for all time.       James Hormel. My admiration for Alan Cranston began over a      half century ago, although he was not aware of it at the      time. The United Nations was four years old. The Iron Curtain      had fallen. Isolationists were urging the United States to      avoid international commitments. And President Truman was      moving--against that tide--to facilitate the economic revival      of western Europe.       In that climate, at the age of sixteen, I became a member      of a student chapter of the United World Federalists, which      was hailed by some as a major movement toward peaceful co-     existence and was excoriated by others--a very vocal      opposition--as a gathering of Communist sympathizers. Alan      had just become president of the organization. It was typical      of the many challenges which he so willingly took on during      the course of his long and productive life.       Alan already had taken on Adolph Hitler by publishing an      unexpurgated version of Mien Kampf. He already had served      during the Second World War both in the Office of War      Information and in the army. He would augment that service      during a long political career, including the resuscitation      of the Democratic party in California and the outstanding      twenty-four years during which he was a United States      Senator.       It was during his Senate years that we met and developed a      friendship which meant so much to me. I admired Alan's      courageous stands on conservation and social justice, and his      unswerving dedication to the peaceful resolution of conflicts      around the world. I discovered coincidentally that his      grandfather had built the house next door to mine, a fact      which underscored his California roots and his deep concerns      for the well-being of his California constituents.      Independently I met and became a friend of his son Kim, which      gave me a window into another dimension of Alan--Alan as      father.       One of Alan's last acts as a Senator was to write the      letters which started the long and arduous process of my      Ambassadorial appointment. Alan was instrumental not only in      beginning the process, but also in guiding me through many of      the minefields which lay in my path.       My memory of Alan is as a gentle giant. His goodness      radiated to all around him. He was a great leader--the very      embodiment of the highest level of leadership as described by      Lao-Tzu, whose words he carried with him as his life's      philosophy, as he sought quietly and selflessly to make this      planet a better place for all of us.       May we have the wisdom and courage to follow his example.       Harris Wofford. You may not know that in her last years      while still painting, Georgia O'Keefe wrote some still not      published short stories that she showed me. The one that      rises in my memory was about a man she met in her first days      in New Mexico. He invited her to see his ranch, three hundred      miles away, and one day she drove down (hiding her suitcase      in case she decided not to spend the night). She stayed      overnight and from time to time they would visit, doing very      prosaic things, sometimes just watching the horses he      trained, or walking over the land, or looking at the hills.       Five decades later she drove down to his ranch, maybe for      the last time, she thought. They sat a long time looking at      the hills and she found herself saying to herself with great      satisfaction: ``Fifty years of friendship with Richard.''       That's all the story said. Well, for me it's fifty-five      years of friendship with Alan. There was little--too little--     time just sitting and watching the hills. He was always on      the go, running sprints or long distance.       When we met just after World War II we were setting out on      no little prosaic mission--it was a crusade to make one world      a reality in a United Nations with the power to keep the      peace and prevent nuclear war. When we last met at his home      in Los Altos a year ago, his smile was still infectious      and he was still hard at work, in his irrepressible way,      on the same mission, persuading generals and admirals and      people of power to join in a new declaration for the      abolition of all nuclear weapons.       When I reread Eleanor's wonderful, perceptive, loving      biography of her brother, I realized how much our lives      intersected over the years and how much his life intersected      with the great issues of our time.       In 1948, Alan gave my wife Clare her first job directing      United World Federalists of Northern California. He caused      one of the greatest tensions in our half century of marriage      when he ran for President on the great central issue of      nuclear peace and asked me to be one of the three co-chairs      of his campaign with Marjorie Benton and Willie Brown. Clare      did not want me to do that. She loved, Alan but did not think      he could win, and thought it was the one time in our life      when I should stick to working as a lawyer and make some      money.       Like many who would rally to his quiet calls over the      years, I could not say ``no.'' In his sixty years of public      service Alan brought many people of different persuasions to      say ``yes'' and to work together for good things. One of      those times he played a key part in my appointment to the      U.S. Senate--which I like to think was a good thing.       Two days after Senator John Heinz died in an air crash,      Governor Casey asked me if I knew a particular major donor to      the Democratic Party and I said no. ``Then why did he write      me this extraordinary letter asking me to appoint you to the      Senate?'' Casey asked. I had no idea. That was the beginning      of a flood of different, well-done letters in the same vein,      from a range of significant people around the country. A few      days later Alan telephoned to tell me that as soon as he      heard the news of John Heinz's death he had gone to work on      the phone, producing those letters--which I'm sure influenced      Casey in my selection.       But the intersection of our lives began way back. From      Eleanor's book I realized that Alan's first journalistic      break was covering Mussolini in 1938, and that the speech he      heard in the Piazza de Venezia when Mussolini took Stalin out      of the League of Nations was the same one I heard in that      same square as a twelve-year-old boy. Alan's greatest      adventure in journalism was getting into Ethiopia for some      months after the Italian invasion. One of my greatest      adventures was going to Ethiopia with my family, in the Peace      Corps.       Before we met, each of us had written a book, in 1945,      calling for a world union to keep the peace. Alan's was the      powerful story of how isolationism in the Senate had killed      the peace after World War I. It was a sign of his      determination to go to the Senate to see that this did not      happen again.       Despite all the help that Alan gave me in my election      campaigns--and Joe Biden and John Kerry who are here--my      tenure in the Senate was very short. His was very long--and      great.       By my count only Ted Kennedy, in this century, rivals Alan      in legislative accomplishments. Alan's mark was on a thousand      bills and countless votes, large and small, where his      coalition-building skill was the key to success.       Like Lincoln, Alan Cranston truly believed that the better      angels of our nature can be brought forth in this land. He      did not discount the demons and distractions in the way, but      he demonstrated that politics is not only the art of the      possible--it is the only way to make reason rule.       It was our good luck--the good luck so many of us here and      around the country--to have had these many years of      friendship with Alan Cranston.       Jane Goodall (via video). I'm tremendously honored to have      been asked to take part in the memorial to someone I admired      so much as Alan Cranston. My body is far away in Africa but I      want you to know that my thoughts are with you now.       I never got a chance to know Alan really well in life      because our paths didn't cross that often. But what I saw I      loved, and like everyone, I admired Alan so much for his      integrity and his sincerity and his determination to try and      rid the world of the most evil weapons of mass destruction      that we ever created, and Alan did so much to alert people to      the hidden dangers of these weapons stockpiled around the      world.       And we shall miss his leadership most terribly, but his      spirit is still around, still with     us, guiding us, encouraging us, and above all, joining us      together so that we can move confidently towards the goal      that he was setting, and make this world a safer place for      his grandchildren and ours and the children yet unborn. Thank      you, Alan, for being who you were. Thank you.       Cruz Reynoso. I once read that `The most powerful weapon on      earth is the human soul on fire.'       Alan's soul was always on fire for the welfare of those in      need, for the strength of our democracy, for human dignity,      and for a world at peace.       It must have been 1959 or 1960 when my wife and I, with      others from the El Centro Democratic Club from Imperial      Valley (the center of the world) traveled to Fresno for the      annual convention of the CDC, Council of Democratic Clubs. A      featured speaker was Alan Cranston. To this day, I remember      being inspired--he spoke of the role of government in helping      the disadvantaged, of the need for economic democracy, of the      right we all have in equal protection and fairness, and      government's responsibility in protecting those rights, and      of our responsibility to be active participants. That a      person with his soul on fire for those ideals I held dear      could actually be elected to state wide office was, to me, a      marvel and inspiration. I never forgot.       A decade later I found myself as director of California      Rural Legal Assistance. CRLA was the leading legal services      for the poor. Many entrenched interests, including the state      government, found themselves on the loosing side of many      lawsuits CRLA brought on behalf of its clients--farmworkers,      Medical recipients, working poor. Those interests fought      back. Alan worked closely with CRLA to protect our      professional independence and assure our continued existence.      As I saw it, there was little political gain for Alan--it was      his devotion to fairness and to the concept of human dignity      that brought us together. Eventually, it was President Nixon      who overrode the state veto of CRLA, thereby saving legal      services.       And years later Alan's son, Kim, I and countless others      joined Alan in our mutual efforts to register thousands of      new voters, an effort to include all in our democratic      society.       Not all efforts were on a grand scale. My last, and still      ongoing task, has been to represent a prisoner who is in      Soledad for a life term. Alan was convinced that the prisoner      was fully rehabilitated. He called to see if I could help. My      associate, Tom Gray, and I worked with Alan. We will      continue.       Not all was work. I remember those wonderful conversations      as we dined in the Senate restaurant. Once, Alan invited me      to a marvelous San Francisco eatery. At the end of the      evening Alan invited me to join his Washington, D.C. office      in a position of considerable responsibility. Unfortunately,      I could not accept the offer, but the food had been great.       Alan's interest went beyond prison walls or the fifty      United States. His efforts have sought peace for this globe.      John Amos Gomenius, the Czech Religious and Educational      leader wrote about 350 years ago:       ``We are all citizens of one world, we are all of one      blood. To hate a man because he was born in another country,      he speaks a different language, or because he takes a      different view on this subject or that, is a great folly . .      . Let us have one end in view, the welfare of humanity.''       Alan's soul was always on fire--for the welfare of an      individual human being--or the welfare of all humanity.       Jonathan Granoff. My name is Jonathan Granoff. I've had the      privilege of working with Senator Cranston on the abolition      of nuclear weapons with Lawyer's Alliance for World Security,      with the State of the World Forum, with the Middle Powers      Initiative, and most recently, with the Global Security      Institute.       Recently, some journalists from Japan were here in the      beginning of December interviewing Senator Cranston, and I      was there, and they asked me what I did as the CEO of the      Global Security Institute. So I said, and I meant this, when      a tree is ripe with fruit, an intelligent person will sit      beneath the tree and gather the sweet fruit. Alan is still      giving us fruit. And Alan's example of being a true human      being is the sweetest fruit that we could be given, because      Alan taught by seamlessly integrating the highest human      values with his daily life.       He exemplified decency and elegance in action. He lived      without prejudice. People say they live without prejudice;      Alan didn't say it, he just lived it. He didn't harbor any      doubts or suspicions about others, he never engaged in      backbiting or any pettiness, and he was tranquil in the midst      of an extraordinary dynamism, like a smooth, powerful river.       He was full of grace. Alan Cranston remains for us a      statesman in a state of grace. His grace was exemplified in      the ease he had in the midst of conflict, because that ease      rested on a real faith in the intrinsic goodness of humanity.      Because he had found that goodness in himself, and for those      of us who had the privilege of working with him, we know      that's how he got us to do things, because we knew that he      never asked anybody to do anything he wouldn't do; he's the      guy who would be up at two in the morning, and then up again      at six-thirty.       Adversaries were only so as to the issue at hand, but never      as to the person, because Alan honored everyone. His inner      clarity and strength was coupled with this unique ability,      and even desire, to hear everyone's point of view, not as a      political ruse, but because Alan honored everyone.       Alan understood fully two icons his parents did not have      that we inherited from the Twentieth Century. The first is      the awesome, horrific mushroom cloud arising from science and      the quest for unbridled power, unreined by morality, law and      reason, and the other icon is the picture of the planet from      outer space, borderless, majestic, alive and sacred.       Alan honored all life by holding the second icon before      him, and that is why he focused most intensely on the nuclear      issue, because that and that alone can end all life on the      planet, and it becomes the moral standard of our      civilization. I had the privilege of traveling with Alan and      going all over the world working on this issue, and one of      the amazing things is I would forget how old he was, because      his body got old, but he didn't. He had found that secret of      the joyous heart, he had found that place of tranquility in      action.       George Crile is a CNN and 60 Minutes producer, beloved,      very beloved of Alan, and he has put together some footage to      give us all a sense of what it's like to be on the road with      Alan Cranston.       [video insert]       Death is such a mystery, and the only comfort is the love      that we bring to our lives, and the faithfulness with which      we carry forth the mission that great men have given us.      Alan, we will follow in your loving memory. We will stay the      course. We will be vigilant until nuclear weapons are      abolished.       We are guided by the philosophy that you held with you.       Lao-Tzu:       A leader is best       When people barely know       That he exists,       Less good when       They obey and acclaim him,       Worse when       They fear and despise him.       Fail to honor people       And they fail to honor you.       But of a good leader,       When his work is done,       His aim fulfilled,       They will all say,       ``We did this ourselves.''       Senator Cranston sought no honor for himself. He honored      life itself through his service. Together and with your help,      we will follow in his large footsteps, and on the day when      the work is done, the aim fulfilled, we will know that we did      not do it alone. Thank you, Alan. May God give you infinite      peace, infinite bliss, infinite love, Amen.       Alan Jones. We've come to the end of a deeply felt tribute      to a great soul. And any celebration of a great soul      confronts us with choices. And so I offer this final      blessing.       There are only two feelings. Love, and fear. There are only      two languages, love and fear. There are only two activities,      love and fear. There are only two motives, two procedures,      two frameworks, two results. Love and fear. Let us choose      love.       The eye of the great God be upon you, the eye of the God of      glory be upon you, the eye of the son of Mary be on you, the      eye of the spirit be on you to aid you and shepherd you, and      the kindly eye of the three be on you to aid you and shepherd      you and give you peace, now and always, Amen.                          ____________________
