 President, nobody has done more for his country, for the defense of this country, and for the Armed Forces of this country than the distinguished Senator from Virginia. We thank him for his ongoing advice about how to deal with this most difficult problem.  The majority leader and I are in exactly the same place. I believe the Senator from Virginia is as well. It is our great desire to get to conference and get a bill signed before Memorial Day. Exactly as the majority leader indicated, how we get from here to there is a matter under serious discussion between the two of us and with our members. So we will be working to get the job completed at the earliest possible opportunity.
