It is not a filibuster. It would call for using the House resolution of 50 hours of debate and another vote-arama to go through the regular order of things. It is not a filibuster. I stand corrected on that.  But the net result of it is to drag out as long, if not longer, than the earlierdebate on the Senate budget resolution. That is why the unanimous consent request has been made.
