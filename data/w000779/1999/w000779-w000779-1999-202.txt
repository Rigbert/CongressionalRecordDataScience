 The key sentence is, the Senate is expected to vote upon a bipartisan text for S. 96, the Y2K Act, which we will strongly support. There is no question about the position of the company on this legislation.  Finally, we have made nine major changes in this legislation since it passed the committee. I voted against it in the committee because I thought Senator Hollings was absolutely right--that the legislation at that time was not fair to consumers and to plaintiffs. But as a result of the changes that were made, I believed it was appropriate to try to come up with an approach that was fair to consumers and to plaintiffs as well as the small companies involved.  There are other negotiations that are still going forward. Senator Dodd, for example, who is the leader on our side on the Y2K issue, has a number of good and practical suggestions. Senator Kerry has some thoughtful ideas on this as well.  I am very hopeful that we can resolve the procedural quagmire on this issue and quickly get to a vote, up or down. Then as a result of the very useful discussion that we had between the majority leader, Mr. Lott, and Senator Kennedy and others, we can move on to the juvenile justice issue. Because I can assure you, as a result of what we saw in Springfield, OR, last year, we wish to have some positive contributions on that.  Senator Gordon Smith and I have a bipartisan bill which has already passed the Senate once. I am hopeful we can deal with this Y2K issue expeditiously and then go on to the topic that millions of Americans, just as Senator Hollings has said this afternoon, are talking about and want to see the Senate respond to.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
