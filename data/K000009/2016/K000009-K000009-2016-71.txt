Chairman, let me just end by saying, this country has a long and storied history of supporting civil rights and worker rights, and that spirit was clearly violated last week during the vote on the spending bill.  We know that businesses should operate under strict rules of fairness and equality, and, certainly, the Federal Government should.  I am just grateful that we could all be here this evening and try to find a way to move America forward and to make progress, not just for the people of this country, but for humankind.  This amendment will ensure that we are able to achieve a fully equitable workplace and society.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. All time having expired on the amendment to the amendment, does any Member seek time in opposition to the first-degree amendment offered by Representative Maloney?  If not, the Chair will put the question on the amendment to the amendment.  The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Pitts) to the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Sean Patrick Maloney).  The amendment to the amendment was agreed to.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Sean Patrick Maloney), as amended.  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it.
