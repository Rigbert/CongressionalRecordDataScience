I don't want to mischaracterize the Senator's position, but I think what I am about to say he and I share. There is no question in our minds about not only the goodness of the men and women serving in the American military today and their ability and skill to win any military challenge thrown their way. I hope the Senator agrees that it is far better for our military forces and our Nation, in the long run, for us to show wisdom in the decision of how to bring Iraq under control rather than just demonstrate that military strength.
