 President, I would like to respond to what the distinguished Senator from Florida said.  Senator, you know what a pleasure it was to have you on the intelligence committee. I think you understand the time that we have spent to get this bill done, which is now about 6 years, and to take this first step, not because it is a perfect step but because it is a first step that is voluntary, with new authorities that people and companies can use if they want to, and if they don't want to, they don't have to. If they want to, it can be effective in enabling companies to share cyber security information and therefore protect themselves. I know you understand this. I am so grateful for that understanding and for your help.
