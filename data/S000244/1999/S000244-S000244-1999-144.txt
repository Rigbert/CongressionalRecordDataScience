Chairman, I move to strike the last word and I rise in opposition to the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, let me associate myself with the remarks of the gentleman from California, with one exception. I doubt that those sailors on Columbus' boats would have advocated defunding that mission because that meant they would not have been paid when they got back to Spain.  But other than that, I think the argument of the gentleman had a lot of merit, and I would hope that the committee and the House would not be fooled by the opponent's scare tactics.  The ground-based flight hardware is 82 percent complete. If we adopt this amendment of the gentleman from Indiana, that hardware will not go to orbit but will end up in museums around the country as an exhibit of Congress' foolishness in defunding the program when it was close to completion.  The flight hardware for the next six flights is already at the Kennedy Space Center being ready for launch. We American taxpayers have invested $20 billion so far in this project. If the amendment of the gentleman from Indiana were adopted, that money would go right down the drain. And that is a pretty tough sell to tell our taxpayers that we made a $20 billion mistake.                              {time}  1445  I would hope that this amendment would be rejected and rejected by the same overwhelming margins that have occurred in the last several votes on this topic.
