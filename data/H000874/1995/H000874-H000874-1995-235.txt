Chairman, Dave Exley takes care of that stirring stick so his paint will be well mixed, and it will give a good coat. How much more, Mr. Chairman, should we take care of our little children so that when they grow they can paint America successful, they can paint America with more opportunity?  Now, I see the Chairman of our committee standing up here, or sitting here, he is going to stand pretty soon, and he is going to show that little red chart over there. And he is going to go bankrupt as a businessman if he uses that chart, because that chart relates to this chart. How many children are we serving in America that we promised in 1965 to serve under Lyndon Johnson, concurred in by Richard Nixon, followed on by President Ford and endorsed by President Carter, and then said to be by Ronald Reagan one of the programs that works, and what did we do? We retreated. We retreated, Mr. Chairman.  Mr. Chairman, the gentleman's little red chart over there is serving less children. Less children in America who are eligible for Head Start are being served today, Mr. Chairman, and that red chart will not change those statistics, and as that happens, we are losing children in America, and we cannot afford to do that.  This Head Start budget that you talk about drops 48,000 children through the cracks. This budget alone, 48,000 children. I do not know whether your painter thinks that is a good investment. He cares about that stirring stick because it saves him a nickel a day, and he is smart. Would that every American would do that, America would be a more successful Nation. But would that every Member of this Congress, ladies and gentlemen, would understand that those little children, 3 and 4 years of age are America's stirring sticks. They are America's future. They will paint America as a successful, competitive community. They will paint America the kind of land of opportunity of which your Speaker speaks. but opportunity does not just happen for some kids, for any children.  The best solution, Mr. Chairman, as we all know, is two loving, caring nurturing parents. Would that every child had that. And the economic opportunities that all of us can provide our children, God bless them as God has blessed us. But ladies and gentlemen, cutting Head Start makes no economic sense. It makes no common sense, and it makes no human sense.  That is why we ought to reject this bill, because notwithstanding the Chairman's little red chart, we are serving less children who are eligible to be helped and who America has promised to help in Head Start. Let us not have a false start once again. Let us reject this bill. Let us save those little stirring sticks that we call our children, our future.  Mr. Chairman, this is a defining moment for this Congress. With this bill we declare our priorities as a nation.  Should we invest our money in our children and in our future as a nation, or give the money in a tax break to the wealthiest Americans?  The cut to Head Start is only one example of the misguided choices Republicans have made in this bill.  There is a good reason why Head Start is America's best loved program for children. Head Start isn't perfect. But it is a place where children get the education, nutrition, health checkups, and skills they need to learn and succeed in school.  In 1993 and 1994, we reached a high point of serving 40 percent of eligible Head Start kids. At the high point, 6 out of every 10 needy preschoolers couldn't go to Head Start because we didn't have the room.  Despite these shortages, the Republican bill cuts Head Start by 50,000 children in 1996--allowing us to serve only 36 percent of eligible children, the same percentage served in 1991.  Under this bill, 50,000 fewer children will go to Head Start in 1996 than could in 1995.  That's 50,000 children who are more likely to be high school dropouts, juvenile delinquents, or teenage parents.  Fifty thousand children who are more likely to be on welfare--taking from society rather than contributing to it.  Head Start helps children like Guy, who began Head Start in southern Maryland unable to learn and far behind his peers.  Guy's mother and stepfather were overwhelmed and unable to help their son.  That's when Head Start sprang into action. Guy's mom was given medical cards so Guy and his sister could go to the doctor for immunizations and to the dentist for checkups.  Head Start got Guy an appointment at Children's Hospital, where his learning disability was diagnosed and addressed.  Head Start found parenting classes for Guy's parents to help them help Guy.  As Guy's behavior improved, his mom was able to go back to school at Charles County Community College.  Because Guy was in Head Start, his mom could attend school 5 days a week, and graduated from the secretarial program. She is now working for a small business and supporting her family.  In September, Guy will start kindergarten. Thanks to Head Start, he is doing well and is ready to learn.  In 1990, Frank Doyle, the CEO of General Electric called on Congress to fully fund Head Start. He spoke on behalf of TRW, Goodyear, Eli Lilly, AT&T, Mobil, and many other businesses who know that getting children ready to learn is the key to future economic success.  But this bill goes in the other direction. This bill isn't a Head Start--it's a false start. I urge a ``no'' vote on this bill.                      announcement by the chairman
