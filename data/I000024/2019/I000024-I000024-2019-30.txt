President, I rise today to recognize and honor MSG Matthew Williams who was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor by the President of the United States of America on October 30, 2019.  Throughout his life, MSG Matthew Williams displayed tremendous confidence, competence, and determination. He graduated from Angelo State University with a bachelor's degree in criminal justice and completed the hardest training the U.S. Army has to offer: Special Forces Assessment and Selection, the Special Forces Qualification Course, and SERE training.  Master Sergeant Williams is a master and expert in his chosen profession--18 Bravo, U.S. Army Special Forces weapons sergeant--and has proven himself to be a consummate professional with service in numerous positions: weapons Sergeant operational Detachment Alpha 3336, senior weapons sergeant Operational Detachment Alpha 332, senior instructor/writer, Delta Company, 2nd Battalion, 1st Special Warfare Training Group, and operations sergeant, Alpha Company 2nd Battalion, 3rd SFG (A).  Master Sergeant Williams has a proven commitment to service and to this Nation by repeatedly answering the call to action with a deployment in support of Operation JUNIPER SHIELD and multiple deployments in support of Operation ENDURING FREEDOM. He displayed conspicuous gallantry on April 6, 2008, as a member of Operational Detachment Alpha 3336, during Operation Commando Wrath, a mission to capture or kill high-value targets of the Hezeb Islami al Gulbadin in the Shok Valley of Afghanistan. With numerous U.S. soldiers and Afghan commandos pinned down by intense enemy fire, Master Sergeant Williams continuously disregarded his own safety and concern, braved rocket-propelled-grenade and heavy machinegun fire in order to lead a group of Afghan commandos on a counterattack across ice-covered boulders and a fast-moving, ice-cold, waist-deep river to help reinforce and evacuate four wounded teammates and set-up a critical firing position to allow his other teammates and Afghan commandos to escape safety.  For his actions that day, Master Sergeant Williams was awarded the Medal of Honor, the Nation's highest medal, on 30 October 2019, by the President of the United States, Donald J. Trump.  Kevin Stitt, Governor of Oklahoma, proclaimed November 6, as Master Sergeant Matthew Williams Day, and I encourage all citizens to recognize the achievements and contributions by Master Sergeant Williams to the U.S. of America and to the United States Army Special Forces.                          ____________________
