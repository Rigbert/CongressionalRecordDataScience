But I think clearly there will be more debate, as there has been an extraordinary amount of debate on this bill up to this time. There will be more debate than we had available to us with respect the massive amendment and legislation that you offered with reference to Medicare. I believe that there will be sufficient time made available over the consideration of this bill for both sides to make their case.
