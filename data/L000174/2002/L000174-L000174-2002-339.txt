President, this has been a good debate. I might ask the Senate to pass a resolution that just said very simply the Democratic majority will be required to go at the same pace that the Republican majority did under President Clinton. But I have a feeling, if we did that, President Bush would be very upset because I have a feeling he does not want us to go back to the procedures used when his party controlled the Senate. We will not.
