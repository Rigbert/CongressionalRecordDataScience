 President, I wish to say a few words in support of amendment No. 3362, which Judiciary Committee Chairman Grassley and I, with Senators Cantwell and Ayotte, have cosponsored.  This bill has passed the Senate by unanimous consent three times. It ensures that international drug traffickers can be prosecuted when there is reasonable cause to believe that their illegal drugs will be trafficked into our country. It also better enables the prosecution of manufacturers and distributors of listed precursor chemicals who know or intend that these chemicals will be used to manufacture illicit drugs destined for the United States.  Finally, it makes a technical fix to the Counterfeit Drug Penalty enhancement Act of 2012 at the request of the Justice Department.  I would like to thank Senators Grassley, Ayotte, and Cantwell for cosponsoring this amendment. I hope my colleagues will pass it this time with a vote, since it has been done by unanimous consent three times in the past.  I yield the floor.
