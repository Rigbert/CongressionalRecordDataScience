 President, I rise today to join my colleague fromWisconsin, Senator Feingold, in supporting a real pay-as-you-go system in the fiscal year 2006 budget.  This amendment is about restoring fiscal common sense to the budget. It would require 60 votes for tax cuts and mandatory spending increases that increase the deficit.
