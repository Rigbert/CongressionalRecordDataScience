 That is the best quarterly growth rate in 4 years and one of the strongest reports since the great recession.  Earlier this month, we learned that new claims for unemployment insurance recently reached the lowest level since--listen to this--1969 and that the number of continuing claims, week to week, is lower than it has been at any point since 1973. Let me say that another way. Notwithstanding almost half a century of population growth, fewer Americans are applying for new unemployment benefits today than has ever been the case since just a few months after Apollo 11 landed on the Moon.
