Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to a group whose sacrifices, patriotism, and contributions to our country are immeasurable. I am honored that the 98th Bombardment Veterans Association will be having their annual reunion in my congressional district this year. Their distinguished history is one of duty, honor, courage and sacrifice.  The 98th Bombardment Group was constituted on January 28, 1942, at Barksdale Field, Louisiana. They were activated on February 3, 1942, at McDill Field, Florida with B-24 Liberator Bombers and continued their training at Ft. Myers and Drane Field, Florida.  On July 15, 1942, the 98th was alerted and departed for the Middle East, arriving in Palestine in late July. The 98th was initially assigned to the United States Middle East Air Force. They flew their first mission to Mersa Metruh on August 1, 1942.  One of their most famous missions was on August 1, 1943 when 47 B-24s launched for a low-level raid to Ploesti and only 21 returned safely. The Group Commander, Colonel John R. Kane was awarded the Medal of Honor for his leadership. On another raid on Ploesti on July 9, 1944, Lieutenant Donald Pucket sacrificed his life trying to save three of his crewmembers who could not or would not bail out of their aircraft. He was awarded the Medal of Honor posthumously for his sacrifice.  The 98th continued the campaign against Nazi forces during the rest of World War II, flying a total of 417 missions and earning a total of 15 battle streamers as well as two Presidential Citations. The 98th returned to the U.S. in April of 1945 and was re-designated the 98th Bombardment Group.  In 1950, with the beginning of the Korean Conflict, the 98th arrived at Yokota Air Base, Japan and flew their first mission to Korea onAugust 7, 1950. The 98th repeatedly flew against the North Korean Communist forces until the cease fire in 1953. From August 1950 to July 1953, the 98th flew more that 5,000 sorties and dropped more than 40,000 tons of bombs. They earned 10 battle streamers and two Outstanding Unit Awards. They also received the South Korean Presidential Citation. Over the next several years the 98th would be re-designated, inactivated and reactivated until it found its current home as the 98th Range Wing at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada.  In 1949, Colonel Salvator Manzo, a former commander of the 98th Bombardment Group during World War II, began the idea of forming a veterans association for the 98th. In 1976 his idea became a reality when the 98th Bombardment Group Memorial Veterans Association was formed. B-29 and B-47 veterans were invited to join the group and spouses of deceased 98th veterans are given an honorary membership.  The week of September 2-6, 2003, the group will hold its annual reunion and ceremonies at the March Air Field Museum where commemorative tiles will be laid in honor of the 98th for their service and, in addition, their association name will be added to the prestigious ``Flyers Wall'' at the Historic Mission Inn. Our country is forever indebted to those individuals willing to make the ultimate sacrifice so that the rest of us may live freely and without fear. I consider it an honor and privilege to welcome the 98th Bombardment Veterans Association to my district to celebrate and remember their distinguished history; they are truly living legends.                          ____________________
