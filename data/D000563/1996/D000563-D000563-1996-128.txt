Speaker, I guess I am surprised my Republican colleagues are not here today taking note of the fact it was only a year ago that this House of Representatives was tied up in a massive debate over the first 100 days of the new Gingrich Republican leadership and the so-called Contract With America. They were so proud of this contract, we literally spent over 3 months on the floor dealing with 31 separate bills in the Contract With America, and 3 of them became law, 3 out of 31, a colossal waste of time.  As a result, we fell behind in passing spending bills, saw the Government shut down for the longest periods in our Nation's history, and now the Republicans suggest America may just default on its national debt for the very first time in our history. The problem is that the Republicans in the House have become irrelevant to working families across America. They are concerned about the security of their pensions, their health insurance, making certain that they have a job, that their kids can get a good college education.  It is time for Congress to get down to work, put aside the bad year that we just finished, and on a bipartisan basis address the problems that working families really care about.                          ____________________
