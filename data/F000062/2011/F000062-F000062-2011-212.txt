 I thank Senator Risch for his cosponsorship, and, of course, I agree exactly with his statement.  At this time I wish to briefly summarize the arguments in favor of our amendment to strike the first-to-file provisions from this bill. This amendment is cosponsored, as I said, by Senator Risch, Majority Leader Reid, Senators Crapo, Boxer, Ensign, and I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Begich.
