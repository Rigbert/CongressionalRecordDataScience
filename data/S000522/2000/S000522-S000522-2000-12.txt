Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend, the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Bereuter), for yielding me the time; and I thank him for his work on behalf of Burmese people, for the fine remarks of the gentleman from American Samoa (Mr. Faleomavaega), for the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Gejdenson), and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Gilman) for the work on this resolution and, above all, to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Porter), the prime sponsor of it.  Mr. Speaker, just over 10 years ago, in the spring of 1990, the people of Burma courageously embraced democracy. In the face of intimidation by the Burmese military, they turned out in record numbers to participate in freedom and fair elections.  In those elections, the National League for Democracy, led so aptly by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, won more than 60 percent of the popular vote; and as my friend, the gentleman from American Samoa (Mr. Faleomavaega), reminded us 80 percent, 80 percent of the seats in parliament went to the National League for Democracy. The Burmese military responded by rejecting the election results, imprisoning hundreds of NLD Members, including Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and severely curtailing the civil liberties of the Burmese people.  Since that time, the ruling military thugs, who currently call themselves the State Peace and Development Council, have inflicted massive human rights violations and economic privations on the people in Burma. More than 1,300 political prisoners, including the woman elected to lead Burma, Aung San Suu Kyi, still suffer at the hands of their government captors.  Just last month, as we all know, she was forcibly detained when Aung San Suu Kyi attempted to travel outside the Burmese capital to Mandalay. The Burmese regime routinely uses forced labor, and it continues to wage a brutal war against ethnic minorities within its borders.  Mr. Speaker, in August of 1998, I traveled to that region in an effort to secure the release of one of my constituents, Michele Keegan, who had been seized by the Burmese authorities for passing out cards the size of our voting cards that said ``We have not forgotten you. We support your hopes for human rights and democracy.''  The SLORC repeatedly refused my requests for a visa to enter Burma, so I had to help negotiate her release from Bangkok, Thailand. After 5 days of detention, Michele and 17 other foreign activists were expelled from Burma, but not until they had been sentenced to 5 years imprisonment for sedition.                              {time}  2015  Let me remind Members, they handed out a card that said we have not forgotten you, we support your hopes for human rights and democracy, a little card just handed out on the streets in Rangoon; and for that, a 5-year sentence. That is just an indication of what they do to their own people.  Mr. Speaker, I am also proud to note that the State Department reauthorization bill, H.R. 3472, the Embassy Security Act, which I introduced last year that, thankfully, became law, retained a provision that helps ensure that the United Nations Development Program, UNDP, does not enrich the Burmese military regime. It reduces U.S. contributions to UNDP by the amount that that program spends in Burma unless UNDP's activities in Burma: One, are focused on eliminating human suffering; two, are carried out only through private voluntary organizations that are independent of the regime; three, do not benefit the regime; and four, are carried out only after consultation with the leadership of the National League for Democracy and the leadership of the National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma.  The resolution before us today, Mr. Speaker, H. Con. Res. 328, properly commemorates the 1990 elections, describes adequately and accurately the situation in Burma and expresses the sense of the Congress that the United States should strongly support the restoration of democracy in that country. It urges the military regime in Burma to guarantee basic freedoms for Burmese citizens, to undertake a political dialogue with the National League for Democracy and ethnic leaders, and to immediately release all political prisoners, and to fulfill the conditions of international human rights instruments.  It also recognizes the current sanctions in place against the government of Burma as appropriate means of pursuing democracy and civil liberties for the people of Burma.  Again, I want to thank all those involved, but especially the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Porter) for offering this resolution.
