 President, I will take a moment to bid farewell to my friend Yitzhak Rabin. I was unable to attend the funeral due to some family responsibilities, but had an opportunity to get to know the Prime Minister well in his visits to the United States. And to speak to him three or four times a year about the foreign aid program for Israel and other issues related to the Middle East.  Not only has Israel lost a great statesman but the world has lost one of the premier figures of this century.                          ____________________
