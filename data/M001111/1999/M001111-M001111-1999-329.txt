 President, today I have introduced legislation designating the federal building located at West 920 Riverside Avenue, Spokane, Washington, as the ``Thomas S. Foley Federal Building and United States Courthouse.'' The bill also designates the plaza located immediately in front of the building as the ``Walter F. Horan Plaza.''  Speaker Tom Foley had a long and distinguished career in the United States House of Representatives. He served for 30 years, concluding his service as Speaker of the House in the 103rd Congress. He was also Speaker in the 102nd Congress, and held positions as Majority Leader, Majority Whip, and Chairman of the House Agriculture Committee. Speaker Foley now serves as our nation's Ambassador to Japan.  Tom Foley is a native of Spokane, Washington, and earned his undergraduate and law degree from the University of Washington. His parents were highly respected citizens of Spokane.  Mr. Foley personified the high ideal to which all of us aspire as public servants and Members of Congress. First and foremost he was a gentleman who sought consensus, recognizing the value of maintaining a good working relationship among colleagues. He loved Congress, and believed it to be the best forum for democracy in the world.  Speaker Foley worked tirelessly to promote and strengthen the Northwest's economy. During my first two years as a Senator, I enjoyed working with him and I am proud of our joint efforts to help our constituents, especially in the successful promotion of Washington wheat and apples on both domestic and international markets. Without Mr. Foley, we would likely not be exporting our agricultural products to as many destinations across the globe as we do. Today, he continues to see that our goods are sold in places, such as Japan, that historically have had tightly controlled markets.  Today I also honor another Washington native, Walter F. Horan. He served 22 years, from 1943 to 1965, as the Congressman from eastern Washington. Representative Horan was raised in Wenatchee, served in the Navy during the First World War, graduated from Washington State University in Pullman, and raised apples on his family farm.  As a member of the Appropriations Committee, Representative Horan was an excellent advocate for western interests, especially those of his constituents in eastern Washington. As a farmer himself, he knew the needs of the people he served and urged the Congress to pass laws to ensure their economic prosperity. He died in 1966 and is buried in his beloved hometown of Wenatchee.  It is my honor to sponsor legislation that permanently recognizes the contributions these two Washingtonians have made to my state and our nation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 392       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
