Yesterday, it was a second-degree amendment. To accommodate both sides, we will have two first-degree amendments that we will consider today.  Our leader talked about the unfinished business from last year. This first amendment falls into that category. It actually was unfinished business from the Clinton administration. I have a letter from Bob Perciasepe, the clean air man, director for the Clinton administration, saying at the last minute they were unable to get this completed. What we are trying to do now is to complete this effort.  With that, I reserve the remainder of my time so we can hear from the Senator from North Carolina.
