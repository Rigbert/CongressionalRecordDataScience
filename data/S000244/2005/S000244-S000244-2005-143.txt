Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds.  Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from Michigan, I think, has exposed what the difference is between those who are for this bill and those who are against this bill.                              {time}  1630  Earned legalization is a nice word for amnesty for illegal aliens. The American public is against amnesty for illegal aliens. This bill does not give amnesty to illegal aliens, and it should not because it rewards somebody for breaking our laws.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith).
