 President, I rise today to recognize the career ofDon Gordon, an outstanding newspaperman, who has retired after a distinguished career in journalism. Don served the western Kentucky area for 8 years as editorial editor for the Paducah Sun.  Don was born in Overland, MO, and upon graduating high school, served his country in the navy during the Korean war. In 1959, he graduated from the University of Missouri with a degree in journalism and has worked for newspapers ever since. Don has been a reporter, city editor, copy editor, and managing editor and has worked for newspapers in Missouri, Illinois, Oklahoma, and South Carolina, before coming to Kentucky. He and his wife, Zona, moved to Paducah in 1989, to return to a part of the country they love.  Don's interest in writing began at a very early age, and during his school days he was involved in printing neighborhood news and sports sheets. In the years when Don first became a professional journalist, it was very rare for a reporter to be credited with a byline. However, a series of articles Don wrote covering a murder trial so impressed one of his first editors, that he was given a byline for his good work. This was only to be the first of many instances in which Don's work was to be recognized by his peers. While reluctant to mention such things, he has won awards for best editorial from the Kentucky Press Association and was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize for journalism.  ``Excellence'' is the word that best describes Don's work. Day after day, he consistently brought public issues into perspective by combining a mastery of the written language and knowledge of a variety of subjects, both local and national. He was a newspaperman's newspaperman.  Retirement in Don's case does not mean that he will be inactive. After 41 years of marriage, he and Zona will now have the opportunity to travel. The West and Alaska beckon. The couple also looks forward to serving as volunteer missionaries. They are active in Trinity Baptist Church, and have been involved in the Gideon Bible Society, and served in jail and prison ministries.  Mr. President, I commend Don Gordon for his outstanding service to western Kentucky. He will be missed by friends and coworkers, and just as importantly, by his many devoted readers. I ask that you and my fellow colleagues join me in recognizing the career of this outstanding Kentuckian, and wishing him well in all future pursuits.                          ____________________
