President, I rise today to introduce the Residential, Farm, Ranch and Small Business Energy Systems Act of 2003, also known as the Small Wind Energy Systems Act. I am honored to be joined by Senators Allard, Conrad, Harkin, Johnson, Leahy and Dorgan in introducing this legislation.  In order to foster a forward-looking energy policy, the United States needs to broaden its energy portfolio beyond fossil fuels, which are a finite energy source. Any serious attempt to create anational energy policy must include innovative proposals for exploring and developing the use of alternative and renewable energy sources. The legislation I am introducing today would help spur the production of electricity from a limitless source--wind.  This bill, similar to legislation I introduced last year, offers a tax credit to help defray the cost of installing a small wind energy system to generate electricity for individual homes, farms, ranches and businesses. The credit can be applied only to systems up to 75 kW, and is equal to 30 percent of the cost of installation, up to $1,000 per kilowatt. I am offering this legislation in the hope that this tax credit will help make it economical for people to invest in small wind systems, thereby reducing pressures on the national power grid and increasing America's energy independence one family and business at a time.  Small wind systems are the most cost-competitive home-sized renewable energy technology, but the high up-front cost has been a barrier. A typical small, rural wind system rated at 10 kW costs $30,000-$35,000 to install. A 30 percent business investment credit would make wind energy more viable for rural America. In addition, farmers and ranchers can utilize a small wind energy system while simultaneously continuing to use their land for crop growing or grazing. Facilitating the production of renewable energy on land that is already being worked for other purposes would be a boon to our economy, environment, and national security. Finally, the tax credit would help us promote a healthier environment. A typical small system can offset seven tons of carbon dioxide per year; carbon dioxide is the most significant contributor to climate change.  I am pleased to see that others in the Senate are working to promote renewable energy. In the context of our deliberations on energy policy, I hope to work with Senators Grassley and Baucus, and others, in order to build on these efforts. In particular, I hope we can expand the residential credit provided for wind energy systems in the Energy Tax Incentives Act of 2003, S. 597, so that the cap is raised to $1,000 per kilowatt. In addition, I hope to add wind to the business investment credit section of the tax code. Although there is currently in law a business investment credit for solar and geothermal power, there is currently no Federal program to support small wind systems being installed by farmers and ranchers. The Energy Tax Incentives Act of 2003 would add fuel cells to this section of the code. I hope I can work with my colleagues to also add wind to this section, because we need to encourage investments in this source of energy.  Last year, a portion of this legislation was included in the Senate energy bill by unanimous consent. I hope to build on this success this year, by securing passage of the full measure.  For the good of our rural economy, homeowners and business owners, the environment and energy security, I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation. I ask unanimous consent that the legislation be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 759       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
