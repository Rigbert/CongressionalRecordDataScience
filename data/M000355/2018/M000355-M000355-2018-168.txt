 President, on a completely different matter, the Senate is resuming our work this afternoon. Later today, we will vote to advance the nomination of Bernard McNamee, the President's choice to serve on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.  This is an impressive nominee who has the right qualifications for this important job. In his career as a well-regarded lawyer on energy issues, he has represented clients and gained expertise all across the energy sector. He has helped clients build solar projects and natural gas facilities and get renewable energy standards approved. In his own words, he said: ``I have not just talked about fuel diversity and `all of the above' energy policies; I have worked to help make them a reality.''  Mr. McNamee has worked as an energy policy expert at the Department of Energy, as well as right here in the Senate. FERC plays a pivotal role in ensuring our energy security and enabling prosperity. Among other responsibilities, the Commission is responsible for permitting important infrastructure investments such as pipelines and export terminals. Continuing with a deadlocked and understaffed Commission could threaten the status of these investments and the jobs that revolve around them.
