 For obvious safety reasons, a pilot is limited, through Federal regulations, to flying 100 hours per month, or 1,200 hours annually, even though he or she contributes many more hours of service outside of the time spent flying planes. This unusual work schedule, however, raises the potential that a pilot might not be considered a full-time employee for purposes of this legislation under a rule that defined full time status as simply ``working'' upwards of 30 or 40 hours per week. The same is true of other flight-crew employees.  Additionally, railroad hours-of-service employees, who work by the mile or by the day, could also find it difficult to meet the definition of full-time employee under a strict ``hours worked'' standard. Many train and engine service railroad employees are paid by the mile and or by the day or paid for time available to work, and are not paid by the hour. Although these workers are undoubtedly full-time employees within their profession, the annual or weekly hours they are calculated to work might not satisfy a narrow minimum hour component that did not take into account a more flexible hours of service concept for certain types of jobs.  Currently all flight and cabin crew members employed by Part 121 commercial air carriers and train and engine service railroad employees paid by the mile or by the day are full-time employees and receive the same benefits afforded other full-time workers. Is it the Senators' understanding that this bill is intended to allow these working groups to be encompassed in the definition of ``full-time employee'' for purposes of the employer incentives to provide quality health care coverage?
