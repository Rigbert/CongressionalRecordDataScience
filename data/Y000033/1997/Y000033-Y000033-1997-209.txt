Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 408, and I want to thank the gentleman from Maryland [Mr. Gilchrest] and the gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. Saxton] especially for working on this piece of legislation.  If we really, truly believe in conservation and believe in saving the dolphins, and I have probably been in this argument and the discussion longer than anybody on this floor, this is a piece of legislation that must pass. It is our belief, after studying the results of scientists and other people that contributed testimony to the committee, that it is not just the dolphins we are talking about in the sea, we are talking about other species now that will be caught if we do not sign this agreement with the other countries participating.  It is the right thing to do, because there are more than just dolphins there. Yes, they make movies about them; yes, they are pretty; and yes, they swim well; and yes, the seas are attractive because they are there, but the truth of the matter is there is a lot of other life there that must be protected and this is what we are trying to do with this legislation.  The State Department does support it, the administration does support it, which gave me great reservation when I found this out, but what we are trying to do with the help of the gentleman from Maryland [Mr. Gilchrest] is to try to protect the total mass in the sea to make sure that there are those species left that are still under jeopardy.  So I am voting ``yes'' on this legislation. I am going to suggest that if we want to save the dolphins we are talking about, if we want to lower the mortality rate, if we want to protect these other species, then we must vote ``yes'' on this legislation. This is good legislation and it is long overdue.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 408, the International Dolphin Conservation Program Act, introduced by Congressman Gilchrest.  This legislation implements the Panama Declaration, an internationally negotiated agreement for the protection of dolphins and other marine species in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. This agreement, which was developed by 12 nations and several environmental organizations, will prove the framework for the lasting protection of all marine life affected by the yellowfin tuna fishery in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean.  As strange as this may sound, this legislation, which I support, is also supported by the Clinton administration, Greenpeace, the National Wildlife Federation, World Wildlife Fund, Environmental Defense Fund, the Center for Marine Conservation, the American Tunaboat Owners Coalition, the Seafarers' International Union, the Sportfishing Association of California, and the National Fisheries Institute. That combination alone should make everyone here vote for the bill.  As most of you are aware, the protection of dolphin populations in this fishery has been a goal of the Marine Mammal Protection Act for over two decades. We heard from numerous witnesses during the hearings held during the last two Congresses that the unilateral embargo provisions and the dolphin-safe labeling requirements have not changed the nature of the fishery. In fact, the number of sets on dolphins has remained fairly stable for years.  The La Jolla program, on the other hand, has been very successful in promoting more efficient operations and a real reduction in dolphin mortality. However, this program is voluntary. Through the Panama Declaration and this legislation, we how have an opportunity to get real international cooperation in maintaining low dolphin mortality for the entire fishery.  Current law has encouraged the practices of fishing on logs or schools of tuna. Both of these fishing methods have created new problems by magnifying the bycatch of other marine species such as sea turtles, billfish, juvenile tunas, and sharks.  Obviously, we need to address the problem of dolphin mortality, but this should be accompanied by a realization that we also need to address other bycatch problems as well. The Gilchrest bill does just that. H.R. 408 will allow international cooperation, will provide international compliance and enforcement, will cap dolphin mortality, and will provide the mechanism for reducing other bycatch in the fishery.  We appear to have a rather big disagreement over the method of achieving these objectives. Both sides are attempting to protect dolphins. Unfortunately, we have not been able to reach an agreement which addresses some Members' concerns about the dolphin safe label and still allows us to move forward to implement the international agreement known as the Panama Declaration.  This disagreement is unfortunate. However, I believe that the international cooperation embodied in the Panama Declaration and theprovisions to move fishermen away from destructive fishing practices in the Gilchrest bill are the right thing to do.  I urge all Members to support the Gilchrest bill and the international cooperation embodied in the Panama Declaration.  Mr. Chairman, since coming to Congress, I have been involved with the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972. Over the years, I have worked hard to improve the law and we were successful in enacting a number of positive changes in 1994. One of those provisions gave the Secretary of the Interior the authority to issue permits to Americans to import legally taken polar bear trophies from Canada, both before and after 1994.  Our intent in passing this provision was clear: we wanted to make it easier for hunters to import polar bear trophies into the United States as long as that activity did not adversely affect Canadian polar bear populations.  There are about 13,120 polar bears in the Northwest Territories of Canada. According to scientific experts, this population is growing by about 3 to 5 percent each year. Since the annual quota for sport hunting was 132 animals in 1996, this harvest rate is having little, if any, effect on any of Canada's polar bear populations. What this activity is doing, however, is providing thousands of dollars to Canada's Inuits allowing them to maintain their cultural heritage.  While some people may disagree with the interpretation which allows sport hunting to be included in subsistence quotas, at the same time I doubt any of these people have been up to the Northwest Territories. Sport hunters are taking the part of the animal which is useless to the Canadian Inuit. The gall bladder and any other organ which could be traded illegally is destroyed, but the meat, bones, and all that is valuable to the Inuit remains in the villages.  On July 17, 1995, 15 months after enactment of the 1994 amendments, the Department of the Interior issued a proposed rule allowing all pre-1994 polar bear trophies to enter the United States. This was the correct interpretation of the 1994 amendments.  On February 18, 1997, after years of delay, the Department of the Interior issued its final rule. The final rule removed the grandfather provision. While no rationale explanation was provided, it is clear that in a mad rush to avoid litigation, the Department has ignored both the scientific data and the congressional intent contained in the 1994 MMPA amendments. Since the regulations did not follow congressional intent, we are now forced to pass legislation requiring the Secretary to issue permits to allow the importation of polar bear trophies taken prior to the enactment of the 1994 amendments.  These trophies are dead and will not adversely affect Canadian polar bear populations. On the contrary, the importation of these trophies will help to conserve Russian and Alaskan polar bear populations. The Fish and Wildlife Service's importation fee, which is $1,000, is earmarked to go toward conservation and research of these polar bear populations.  We have to remember that these dead bears can no longer influence the stability of Canadian polar bear populations. These trophies have been sitting in warehouses for many years. The polar bear populations will benefit more if we allow the Secretary to issue an import permit and use the $1,000 fee for conservation and research.  The Fish and Wildlife Service has stated to my staff that a new rulemaking process, which is required under section 103 of the act, shall not be necessary to implement this language which authorizes the Secretary to issue import permits for pre-1994 trophies to applicants providing the appropriate documentation. The Service has indicated that a Federal Register notice will be published stating how this new language fits into the final rule published on February 18, 1997. The Service will have to update the final rule to include this new language, but this process will not delay the Secretary from issuing permits to applicants immediately after the 30 day public comment period has ended.  This amendment should not be controversial, since the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Marine Mammal Commission, and the ranking Democrat of the committee do not object this provision. I urge Members to support my efforts to correct the Fish and Wildlife Service's incorrect interpretation of the 1994 Marine Mammal Protection Act.                                  U.S. Department of the Interior,                                    Fish and Wildlife Service,                                     Washington, DC, May 15, 1997.     Hon. Don Young,     Chairman, House Committee on Resources, Longworth House          Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: During the hearing held last week on the      Fish and Wildlife Service's final regulations on import of      polar bear trophies from Canada, the Service and the Marine      Mammal Commission testified about the reasons why the plain      language of the Marine Mammal Protection Act Amendments of      1994 required the Service to apply all of the substantive      criteria of Section 104(c)(5) to the import of all polar bear      trophies, regardless of when they were taken. The testimony      also described the scientific basis for our determinations      that five of Canada's polar bear populations meet the      criteria of the Act, as well as new efforts now underway to      develop a further proposal that will include two more      populations, based on new information received from Canada      too late to be included in the first round of determinations.      The Service concluded that, based on the current statutory      language and available scientific data, it lacked the      authority to allow the import of polar bear trophies taken on      or before April 30, 1994, from the remaining populations      until they meet all of the criteria of the Act.       During the hearing there also was discussion concerning the      position of the Administration regarding potential new      legislation which would explicitly exempt bears which are      already dead and held in storage in Canada from the four      criteria contained in Section 104(c)(5) of the Act. The      purpose of this letter is to notify you that the      Administration would have no objection to such legislation,      provided it is limited to an exemption for polar bear      trophies legally taken in Canada on or before April 30, 1994,      and that no other exemptions from the provisions of the Act      are added. Enclosed with this letter is recommended language,      developed in consultation with the Marine Mammal Commission,      that would include an explicit exemption from the      requirements of Sections 101, 102, and 104(C)(5)(I) through      (iv) of the Act for all trophies taken on or before April 30,      1994, provided the permit applicant can show evidence that      the trophy was legally taken in Canada.       In implementing this exemption, the Service would require      from applicants a valid Canadian CITES export permit for      trophies taken after July 1, 1975 (the date CITES entered      into force in Canada), because the issuance of such a permit      by the Canadian CITES Management Authority automatically      certifies that the specimen was legally acquired. For      trophies taken prior to July 1975, in addition to the      required CITES pre-convention certificate, the Service      would ask for a copy of a Canadian hunting license or      other documentation to prove that the specimen was legally      taken. With this documentation, there would be no adverse      conservation consequences from allowing the import of      polar bears taken on or before April 30, 1994, some of      which have been in storage in Canada for more than twenty      years.       This language would also not affect the authority of the      Service to require that all polar bear trophies be imported      through a designated port (unless prior arrangements are made      for import of a full mount through a non-designated port)      with sufficient prior notice so that Service personnel may be      present to inspect the shipment and apply a tag to the      trophy. This is important to ensure that there is no      stimulation of illegal import or subsequent illegal trade      within the United States in polar bear parts. This language      would also retain the Service's authority to collect a $1,000      fee for each polar bear trophy to be imported. The additional      fees generated from imports of trophies from areas not      currently eligible for import under existing law and      regulations would provide substantially increased benefits      for polar bear conservation.       The Office of Management and Budget has advised that it has      no objection to the presentation of this report from the      standpoint of the Administration's program.           Sincerely,                                                    ------ ------,                                                  Acting Director.       Enclosure.                                  ____        Proposed Legislation for Import for Polar Bear Trophies:       An Act to direct the Secretary of the Interior to issue      permits for the importation of polar bear trophies lawfully      taken in Canada on or before April 30, 1994.       Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 101, 102, and      104 (5)(A) of the Marine Mammal Protection Act, the Secretary      of the Interior shall issue a permit for the importation of      polar bear parts (other than internal organs) taken in a      sport hunt in Canada to an applicant that submits with a      permit application proof that the polar bear was legally      harvested in Canada by the applicant on or before April 30,      1994. All other provisions of section 104 of the Act,      including the charging of an issuance fee, shall be      applicable to such permits.                                  ____  Executive Office of the President, Office of Management and Budget,               Washington, DC., 20503 May 20, 1997 (House)                   Statement of Administration Policy       (This statement has been coordinated by OMB with the      concerned agencies.)h.r. 408--international dolphin conservation program act (gilchrest (r)                       maryland and 29 cosponsors)       The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R.      408, as reported by the House Resources and Ways and Means      Committees. The bill would implement an international      agreement to protect dolphins and the entire ecosystem of the      eastern tropical Pacific Ocean.                                       ____                                    U.S. House of Representatives,                                        Committee on Commerce,                                   Washington, DC, April 23, 1997.     Hon. Don Young,     Chairman, Committee on Resources, Longworth House Office          Building, U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: On April 16, 1997, the Committee on      Resources ordered reported H.R. 408, the ``International      Dolphin Conservation Program Act.'' This measure, just as      H.R. 2823 from the 104th Congress, provides for the      implementation of the Declaration of Panama signed in 1995 by      the United States and 11 other nations.       H.R. 408 includes several provisions within the      jurisdiction of the Committee on Commerce. In implementing      the Declaration, the bill amends the ``Dolphin Consumer      Information Act of 1989,'' on which the Commerce Committee      took action during the 101st Congress. The 1989 Act was      incorporated into the reauthorization bill for the Magnuson      Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Pub. L. 101-627).      H.R. 408 provides for implementation of the Declaration in an      effort to increase international participation in activities      to reduce the number of dolphins and other marine mammals      that die each year as a result of tuna fishing techniques.      The Act would modify the definition of ``dolphin safe'' for      the purpose of labeling tuna products sold in the United      States, and alter current regulations on the importation of      tuna products. Also, the bill would make misuse of the      ``dolphin safe'' label an unfair and deceptive trade practice      under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act.       Recognizing your Committee's desire to bring this      legislation expeditiously before the House, I will not seek a      sequential referral of the bill. However, by agreeing not to      seek a sequential referral, this Committee does not waive its      jurisdictional interest in any matter within its purview. I      reserve the right to seek equal conferees on all provisions      of the bill that are within my Committee's jurisdiction      during any House-Senate conference that may be convened on      this legislation. I want to thank you and your staff for your      assistance in providing the Commerce Committee with an      opportunity to review its jurisdictional interests in H.R.      408.       I would appreciate your including this letter as a part of      the Resource Committee's report on H.R. 2823, and as part of      the record during consideration of this bill by the House.           Sincerely,                                             Thomas J. Bliley Jr.,                                                         Chairman.
