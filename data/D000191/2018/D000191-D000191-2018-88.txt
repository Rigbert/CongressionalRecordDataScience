Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Francis Rooney of Florida). The gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 minutes.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chair, I appreciate the fact that the gentleman is representing very well his constituents' concerns. We had an earlier discussion on the floor about the aircraft noise. An amendment was adopted to have the FAA study the speed of approach and take-off, which can dramatically reduce the noise impact.  I have also asked the FAA to look at establishing alternate performance-based navigation routes so they are not using the same route every day over the same houses and the same neighborhoods.  When I first saw this amendment, it seemed to me innocuous since it seems to follow the basic requirement in thecontroller handbook, FAA Order 7110.65, section 561, which addresses this issue. However, we have been contacted by the National Air Traffic Controllers union, and they have expressed grave concerns that they think it may have unintended consequences.  Unfortunately, they just contacted us, so we haven't been able to get the details of their concerns. So in that case, I would have to oppose the amendment.  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Rohrabacher).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it.
