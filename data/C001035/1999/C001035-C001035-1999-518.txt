President, I thank the chairman and again commend Senator Frist, chief sponsor of this legislation, and the chairman of the committee. I am pleased to join with them in this effort.  Mr. President, the question before us is simple. This is not a question of who is for better schools; this is not a question of who is for putting more Federal resources in education; because both Democrats and Republicans alike share those two goals. The question before us is whom do you trust to make education decisions? Should education decisions be decided in Washington? Should every Federal dollar be attached to a string? Or should we trust the people at the local level--our school board members, our teachers, our parents, to make the best decisions for the students in local schools? To me, the answer is clear. We should increase the Federal commitment to education, but empower local school boards, teachers and parents to make the best decisions in keeping with the needs of their communities. That is the question before us.  The second question before us is, Is the Government, is Congress, going to keep its promise with regard to funding special education? I say the answer to that should be yes. Let's keep the promise that was made more than 20 years ago when Congress passed the legislation mandating special ed. Let's keep our promise. Let's fully fund that important program before creating a whole lot of new categorical grant programs with strings attached. That is the debate.  Everyone here is for better schools, better teachers, but that is not the issue.
