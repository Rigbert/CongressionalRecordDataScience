  That's what the President of the United States makes in a year.  Only one person on the Federal payroll should make that much money.  Mr. President, the appropriators seem to agree with our thinking.  We can thank the appropriators for their pioneering work in this area.  In 1944, they established the first ``cap'' on the defense appropriations bill.  Under Section 8117 of Public Law 103-335, they placed a $250,000 salary ``cap'' on fiscal year 1995 contract payments.  Then, just last year, they lowered the cap to $200,000 on fiscal year 1996 contract payments.  That was in Section 8068 of Public Law 104-61--the fiscal year 1996 defense appropriations bill.  As I pointed out earlier in the debate, that's not a permanent cap.  It's a 1-year cap on fiscal year 1996 defense appropriations.  Mr. President, we need a permanent cap on all Government contracts.  We shouldn't take money out of the pockets of hard working American taxpayers to bank-roll the big executives in defense industry.  We need to get the taxpayers out of the loop.  Pay and bonuses for top defense executives should be determined in the marketplace.  Executive wages should be determined by successes and failures by profits and losses.  And not by a bunch of bureaucrats in the Pentagon.  A $200,000 cap is a good first step in the right direction.  I hope my colleagues will support this amendment.  Mr. President, throughout this debate, I have repeatedly stressed one point:  We need to get government bureaucrats out of the business of deciding how much to pay industry executives.  Mr. President, there is only one place where those kinds of decisions should be made in this country.  And that's in the marketplace.  Those decisions should be governed by profits and business successes.  There is a general consensus for getting the Government out of the loop.  Government bureaucrats are incapable of deciding what an executive should earn.  Mr. President, I have here in my hand an article taken from one of the defense trade journals.  This one is from Defense News, June 3-9, 1996, page 14.  Now, Defense News is a weekly publication with close ties to defense industry.  The article has this title: ``White House Prepares New Rule on Compensation for Executives.''  The report says the White House procurement czar is about to issue a new regulation on how much executive pay can be charged to defense contracts.  ``Industry officials'' are quoted.  And industry officials are saying what I am saying.  They say that this decision should be made in the marketplace.  This is what the reports says, and I quote:  ``Industry officials say the free market should determine how much they [defense executives] are paid, and how much the Government reimburses them [for salary].''  Mr. President, that is exactly what I am saying.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record, the article.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Defense News, June 3-9, 1996]      White House Prepares New Rule On Compensation for Executives                            (By Jeff Erlich)       Washington.--White House officials will make a decision      this month on what portion of defense executives' salaries      the government will reimburse.       The issue of how much corporate executives are paid has      taken on populist overtones as salaries continue to rise      while workers are laid off, a senior government official      said.       ``Some contractors seem to have tunnel vision,'' the      official said. ``There is a larger debate in society about      executive compensation. This is not just about defense      contracting.''       Industry officials, however, say the free market should      determine how much they are paid, and how much the government      reimburses them.       ``If you find the right guy, the leverage of his thought      process is way beyond the value you would attribute to him as      one man,'' Vance Coffman, chief operating officer of Lockheed      Martin Corp., Bethesda, Md., said in a May 29 interview.       Steve Kelman, White House director of federal procurement      policy, is due to issue the pay rule this month. He said May      28 that he has not yet made a decision.       Kelman will weight options that include a cap on how much      the Pentagon can reimburse executives for their salaries.       Congress has a $200,000 cap this year, pending the new      policy. Or Kelman could eliminate any caps and let the DoD's      cost-accounting principles govern levels of reimbursement.       He also will address other forms of pay, such as bonuses,      deferred salary, stock options and other compensation, often      earned during corporate restructuring.       These issues came under congressional scrutiny with the      merger of Lockheed and Martin Marietta corporations. Lockheed      Martin will get $16.5 million from the government in extra      compensation resulting from the restructuring.       ``During the past eight years, 2.2 million Americans have      lost their defense-related jobs. At precisely the same time,      the top CEOs among defense contractors have been taking home      huge salaries and stock payouts paid in no small part by U.S.      taxpayers,'' Reps. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., Bernard Sanders, I-     Vt., and Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., wrote May 9 to Defense      Secretary William Perry.       Bert Concklin, president of the Professional Services      Council, a Vienna, Va.-based consultants association, said      the policy should address only high levels of compensation      resulting from mergers, buyouts or other corporate      restructuring, while leaving alone normal bonuses and      salaries.       ``It should focus on what has apparently gotten the      attention of the critics,'' Concklin said May 28.
