Speaker, I don't often speak or vote for motions to recommit, but occasionally they do pass. And I would note that if this motion to recommit does pass, the bill still comes to us in its final form.  The gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Markey) and I tried to offer this amendment in the Rules Committee. I must say that in our testimony in the Rules Committee upstairs yesterday, I thought we had pretty good support on both sides of the aisle for this amendment from those that were there.  Iran is a bad player. This bill helps India. Why don't we have India on our side as we work against Iran in the world community? That is what this motion to recommit says. It says that the President has to certify that India is on our side as they work for nuclear capability in the world community and to keep Iran on the other side. Why aren't we working together, India and the United States, as we look at Iran in terms of more of the mischief that they are promoting around the world?
