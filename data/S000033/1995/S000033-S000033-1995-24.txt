 Speaker, I thank the chairman, the gentleman from Florida [Mr. Young], and I thank very much the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Murtha] for their cooperation on this issue.  I think the gentleman from Pennsylvania correctly described the situation. It seemed to me, and I think virtually every Member of the U.S. Congress, that there was something wrong in the process when the taxpayers of America were asked to supply $31 million in executive bonuses to the highest ranking officials, who are very, very well paid, of Lockheed and Martin Marietta when they merged.  When I brought that issue to the floor, the gentleman from Florida [Mr. Young] was very gracious, and the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Murtha] was very gracious, and they accepted the amendment. Since then, we together fashioned perfecting language to make absolutely clear that the Pentagon ought not to spend $1 of appropriated funds for the Lockheed-Martin payments or any such future payments pursuant to the merger of defense contractors.  The gentleman from Pennsylvania described the fact that during the conference, as I understand it, the Pentagon was a little bit vague abut their willingness to accept this provision. What I would like to do right now is enter into a colloquy with both Mr. Young and Mr. Murtha, just to make it absolutely clear on the Record that our intent is to make certain that not one penny of taxpayer money goes to the merger of Lockheed-Martin and to the bonuses that those chief executives are going to receive.  Would the gentleman from Florida [Mr. Young] want to comment on that?
