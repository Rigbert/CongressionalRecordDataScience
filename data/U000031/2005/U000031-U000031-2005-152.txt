Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a small Federal program that is often overlooked as a way to provide employment opportunities for people with disabilities. The Javits-Wagner-O'Day Program, often referred to as JWOD, provides more than 40,000 Americans who are blind or who have other severe disabilities with the job skills and training necessary to receive good wages and benefits and gain greater independence and quality of life. The JWOD Program empowers people with disabilities who traditionally face an unemployment rate of 70 percent and rely heavily on social programs such as welfare and SSI.  National Industries for the Blind (NIB) and NISH daily are creating new employment opportunities for people with severe disabilities, along with local nonprofit organizations in the State of Michigan. Demonstrating an excellent Federal-private sector partnership, NISH, National Industries for the Blind, and local nonprofits such as Goodwill Industries of Southwestern Michigan, Inc. enhance opportunities for economic and personal independence of people who are blind or who have other severe disabilities, primarily through creating, sustaining, and improving employment.  On behalf of people with disabilities, I rise to salute the important contributions of JWOD and Goodwill Industries of Southwestern Michigan, Inc. to the city of Kalamazoo and the community as a whole; and hereby commend all persons who are committed to and work towards enhancing employment opportunities for people with visual and other severe disabilities.                          ____________________
