 President, I rise today to praise President Clinton for his determination to push forward our national agenda with the Russians at this week's summit in Moscow.  It is no secret that recently several items of dispute have arisen to cloud the relationship between Russia and the United States. In response, there have been scattered voices calling on the President to cancel his trip.  Mr. President, such a course would have been a profound mistake, and I am gratified that our President had the wisdom and maturity to stay the course. Russia, both in spite of and because of her current difficulties, remains fundamentally important to this country. We must remain engaged with the world's other major nuclear power and continue to strive to bring her into a European security system of democratic countries.  Moreover, British Prime Minister Major, German Chancellor Kohl, and French President Mitterrand all will be attending the ceremonies marking the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II and honoring the heroic sacrifices that the Russian people made in the victorious struggle against nazism. In that context it is unthinkable that [[Page S6276]] the President of the United States would be absent.  But President Clinton's attendance at the Moscow summit in no way signals tacit approval of Russia's brutal behavior in Chechnya. On the contrary, President Clinton will make clear, as he has done in the past, that while we support the territorial integrity of the Russian Federation, we strongly condemn Russian attacks on civilians in Chechnya. The President will, I trust, also call on President Yeltsin to extend the current cease-fire in Chechnya and make it permanent.  Mr. President, another area of profound difference with the Kremlin is the proposed sale of a Russian nuclear powerplant and delivery of nuclear technology and training to Iran. Even though, legally speaking, Moscow is correct that its proposed sale falls within international guidelines, I am convinced that Iran has embarked upon a program to build nuclear weapons and, hence, that the sale would be a reckless and counter productive act.  Although it is highly unlikely at this point that Russia can be made to back down totally, President Clinton--on site, face-to-face with President Yeltsin--will be able to press for important adjustments such as preventing the sale of a gas centrifuge plant, which would significantly increase the danger of Iran's being able to produce weapons-grade enriched uranium. Also, the President may push for an agreement whereby spent nuclear fuel would be returned from Iran to Russia.  I have been dismayed at recent bellicose statements by Senior Russian officials against NATO expansion. In Moscow, President Clinton will make crystal-clear to President Yeltsin that Russia does not have veto power over any actions of NATO, including the alliance's enlargement.  In addition, President Clinton will reiterate that NATO has always been a defensive alliance and that binding qualified Central and East European democracies into the alliance's comprehensive security system will enhance stability in the region and thereby be a gain, not a danger, for Russia. The President might pose the rhetorical question to Yeltsin whether Russia would prefer that there be potential isolated loose cannon countries in the middle of Europe or fully integrated members of a defensive alliance led by the United States. The answer is surely the latter.  In Moscow, President Clinton will be able to urge President Yeltsin to sign Russia up formally as a member of the Partnership for Peace so that it can participate on an ongoing basis in a range of discussions with NATO.  There are other crucially important outstanding issues to discuss with the Russians at the Moscow summit. President Clinton will undoubtedly urge that Russia continue its budget austerity and privatization programs and other economic reforms.  Several arms control issues will certainly be on the agenda, including prospects for ratification of START II, crafting a joint strategy in support of the indefinite extension of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, demarcation between antiballistic missiles and tactical missile defense, and holding to the terms of the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty.  President Clinton will, I am certain, explain in Moscow that cooperation on the issues I have enumerated would strengthen Russia's case for membership in important international bodies such as the Group of Seven Advanced Industrial Nations.  On the other hand, threatening to curtail economic and technical assistance to Russia because of disagreements with Russian policy, as some in the majority party in Congress have advocated, would be ``shooting ourselves in the foot,'' since such a move could only serve to harm the transitions to a free-market economy and true political democracy in Russia that are very much in the United States national interest.  Mr. President, the way to move forward in our emerging relationship with the new Russia is not to sit pouting on the sidelines. Rather, it is to engage the Russians in open, frank, even contentious dialog.  Americans can be proud that we have a President thoroughly versed in all these highly complex matters and able to bring the full weight of the Presidency to bear in face-to-face negotiations.  I know that all Americans join me in wishing President Clinton every success in his vitally important mission.                          ____________________
