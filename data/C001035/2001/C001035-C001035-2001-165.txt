President, first let me make clear that the amendment I am offering does not change the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from Louisiana. What it would do instead is add to the tax cut $70 billion in order to cover the following: A tax credit for small businesses to help them purchase health insurance.  This is based on legislation that the Senator from Louisiana--the other Senator from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu--and I recently introduced to address the problem of small businesses having a difficult time in affording health insurance for their employees. It would provide for full deductibility of health insurance for the self-employed, an issue that I know is something the Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, and the Senator from Missouri, Mr. Bond, have worked on. And it would provide for long-term care insurance above the line deduction to help people and encourage them to purchase long-term care insurance.  The combined total of those provisions would be approximately $70 billion over the next 10 years. That would bring the total tax cut to approximately $1.3 trillion.  I reserve the remainder of my time.
