Speaker, it is wholly fitting that I rise today, Earth Day, to call attention to a report that attests to all of the wonderful strides our nation's largest companies are taking in the interest of sustainability--strides taken not in response to government mandates, but because they are good for customers, good for employees, good for the bottom line, and good for the communities in which these companies do business.  Mr. Speaker, for several years Business Roundtable, a fine organization that represents CEOs of more than 200 of the country's largest companies, has released a comprehensive Sustainability Report in conjunction with Earth Day. The companies participating in the report--most of the Roundtable's members--submit considerable information about the many ways in which they are striving to take sustainability to an even higher level.  Some companies have focused on drastically reducing the energy they use or increasing their use of renewable energy. Others have cut their waste production while increasing their commitment to reuse and recycle in ever more innovative ways. Still others have built sustainability into their products and workforce policies. Many have made progress on several fronts at once.  The 2015 edition of the Business Roundtable's Sustainability Report, ``Create, Grow, Sustain: Leading by Example,'' is hot off the presses, and it is a pleasure for me to introduce it into the Record today. What is most notable--and impressive--to me is that the CEOs themselves contributed to this report through signed letters. These leaders personally attest to the steps taken by their companies and are justifiably proud of them. What a perfect way to mark this Earth Day.  Beyond that, what is most striking about the long list of accomplishments in the area of sustainability by our nation's largest firms is that for the most part, their actions have been taken not because they were forced to by regulations and legislation but because they were good for the bottom line. We see this happening more and more. Companies are using their ingenuity to reduce their impact on the environment, not because they are threatened with government action, but because they consider solid corporate citizenship, including lessening their environmental footprint, to be a major company value.  Mr. Speaker, I hope our colleagues will take the time to review ``Create, Grow, Sustain: Leading by Example'' so that we all can share with our constituent companies the many lessons that Business Roundtable companies have to offer.                          ____________________
