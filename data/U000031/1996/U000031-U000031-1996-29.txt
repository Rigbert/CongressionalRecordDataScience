Speaker, I thank very much the diligent work of our chairman of the full committee and subcommittee, the gentleman from Virginia [Mr. Bliley], and the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Oxley]. This is a very tough and complex issue, flow control and interstate waste.  There has always been a fear, particularly from those of us in the Midwest, that one might pass without the other. Frankly, I was prepared to vote against this bill under suspension, in fact signed a bipartisan ``Dear Colleague'' letter with a number of my colleagues asking us all to do so. But today's assurance that the Governors of the impacted States will in fact help forge an agreement that is acceptable to all of us helps resolve my goal of making sure that we will not see unfair control of interstate waste legislation move forward unless they in fact are dealt with together.                              {time}  1500  I accept Rules Committee Chairman Solomon's pledge of cooperation in working this out. In fact, I am going to go back to all of my colleagues to make sure that when this conference report comes out that it will be an acceptable bill.  Out-of-State waste is a very important issue.  Our landfills will fill up years ahead of schedule because cities like Chicago, New York, and Boston churn out garbage faster than they can deal with it.  Interstate waste is an important tool. It allows States the ability to limit garbage that crosses my borders. My State should not be forced to accept other people's garbage. Michigan isn't a dumping ground for other States' mistakes.  Michigan has had the foresight to develop a plan to dispose of our waste. We are now being forced to deal with garbage from States who haven't.  I make no apologies--frankly, New York City, Boston, Chicago, your garbage isn't our problem.  `We Recycle'--it says so right on the blue trash cans in my office. I've got to separate white paper from wet trash, glass from cardboard. But the Federal Government doesn't afford my communities with this luxury.  Michigan communities shouldn't be forced to clog up their landfills with trash from cities hundreds of miles away. When it comes to dumping in landfills, it all gets thrown into the mix--Kalamazoo's, New York City's, Benton Harbor's, and Boston's--Michigan couldn't bar any State from dumping trash on us--until now.   In a recent letter sent to Speaker Gingrich, Michigan Governor John Engler and several other Midwest Governors wrote ``Citizens constantly ask us why they should recycle in order to conserve space for other States' trash. We need assurances that we can conserve landfill space for our own State's disposal needs.''   Governor, you got your assurance today.  Mr. Speaker, I include for the Record the following letter:         State of Ohio, State of Michigan, State of Indiana,            Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,                                                 January 25, 1996.     Hon. Newt Gingrich,     Speaker, House of Representatives,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Speaker: We are writing to express our opposition      to considering a flow control bill on the House floor under      suspension of the rules without the inclusion of interstate      waste provisions. As governors of states that have been      receiving considerable amounts of out-of-state waste, we feel      it is essential that the House move interstate waste and flow      control together as one bill.       As you know, 23 governors wrote you in June to express      strong support for the interstate waste provisions in H.R.      2323, the State and Local Government Interstate Waste Control      Act of 1995, introduced by Congressman Mike Oxley and passed      by the Subcommittee on Commerce, Trade and Hazardous      Materials in May.       For too long, states have had only limited ability to place      restrictions on shipments of municipal waste across state      lines. Although mandated by federal law to develop      comprehensive waste management plans, states' efforts to      enforce their own planning rules have been overturned      repeatedly by the federal courts. Lacking specific delegation      of authority from Congress, states that have acted      responsibly to implement environmentally sound waste disposal      plans and recycling programs are still being subjected to a      flood of out-of-state trash.       We are not asking for outright authority to prohibit all      out-of-state waste. We are asking Congress to provide state      and local governments with the tools they need to manage      their own waste and limit waste from other states. Any      proposal to grant specific flow control authorities,      therefore, should not be considered without also including      these essential interstate waste provisions.       We strongly believe that Congressman Oxley's interstate      waste provisions address many of our concerns. Twenty-three      governors and the Western Governors' Association have      supported the interstate waste provisions in this bill and      seek two strengthening amendments. One would allow states to      place a percentage limit on the amount of out-of-state waste      that can be received at new facilities or major modifications      of existing facilities. The other would allow states to      authorize the collection of a $1-per-ton surcharge on waste      from other states.       H.R. 2323 would give large exporting states sufficient time      to plan for the disposal of their own waste. It also would      give those states that have acted responsibly to implement      environmentally sound waste disposal and recycling plans      assurance that they can save space within their borders for      their own disposal needs.       In addition, we oppose any provisions that would prohibit      interstate waste restrictions at facilities that are subject      to flow control authorities. Such a provision would prohibit      state and local governments that exercise flow control      authorities from having the opportunity to accept or reject      out-of-state waste shipments, and they could be forced to      receive it unwillingly. We strongly believe that one      community should not be forced to accept other states' waste      while another community has the opportunity to turn it away.       Again, we respectfully urge that interstate waste and flow      control move together as one bill. By considering flow      control separately, Congress would only address one side of      the equation and would not give importing states the tools      they need to limit the large amounts of waste crossing their      borders.           Sincerely,     George V. Voinovich,       Governor of Ohio.     Evan Bayh,       Governor of Indiana.     John Engler,       Governor of Michigan.     Tom Ridge,       Governor of Pennsylvania.
