Bonnell of Toledo, Ohio. Toledo has been called a community of families. Bob Bonnell, an esteemed citizen of that community, seemed to have been born to create and embody ``Fireman Freddie, a friendly, caring, and wise man, who assumed a larger meaning as a loving father for all our community's children. Bob's vocation as a teacher and firefighter saved countless lives as children learned how to save themselves and the lives of their loved ones. They learned new lessons from a Santalike man who cared for them as he would his own children.  Robert E. Bonnell remains a legend in the Toledo Community for his dedication to his community as a firefighter and to the education of the youth of Toledo about the value of safety. Mr. Bonnell became the department's first ``Fireman Freddy'' in 1973. It happened soon after the idea of a fire safety program--and the birth of Fireman Freddy--originated in 1972 when Mr. Bonnell was a ladder truck driver at Station 6 at Starr and Euclid avenues, where he seemed to have a special rapport with school groups who came to tour the firehouse. He was asked to start the educational program and thought it would be a six-month assignment. But Mr. Bonnell hadn't stopped his two-schools-a-day, five-day-a-week visits since January 1973, he told The Blade in an interview in December 1980, just before he retired.  ``To tell you the truth,'' Mr. Bonnell said in a 1974 Toledo Blade article, ``children understand more than you think they do. I never have to talk down to them. I just talk to them in the same way that I talk to adults. For some reason, it works.'' By the time he retired, Mr. Bonnell talked to more than 125,000 elementary students in Toledo public and Catholic schools and the Washington Local school district about fire prevention and fire safety.  Robert E. Bonnell at age 80, passed away Monday, October 29, 2007 in St. Charles Mercy Hospital of congestive heart failure. He will be fondly remembered by the residents who recall being taught by the fireman about fire safety when they were in the fourth and sixth grades.  Mr. Bonnell joined the Toledo Fire Department in 1956 and then served for 25 years, most of them as the department's ``Fireman Freddie'' until his retirement in 1981. Duringhis early retirement he worked as a funeral attendant for the Eggleston Meinert Pavley Funeral Home in Oregon. ``He was a good old country boy, and he liked kids,'' retired Toledo Deputy Fire Chief Robert Schwanzl said. ``He was a storyteller and he had a special knack for telling stories and talking to children. And he was very dependable.''  Born in Weston, West Virginia, on February 22, 1927, to Onal and Genevieve (Beamer) Bonnell, Mr. Bonnell, graduated from Lewis County High School in 1945, when he enlisted in the Army. During the last months of World War II, he was a staff sergeant in Germany. After his honorable discharge in 1947, he returned to West Virginia and later that year married his high school sweetheart, JoAnne Teter. A short time later, the couple settled in Toledo.  In his free time, Mr. Bonnell, who in retirement lived in Northwood and most recently in Walbridge, enjoyed collecting cuff links, of which he had 4,000, and marbles, of which he had more than 50,000. He also liked visiting garage sales, hunting, and fishing. He loved spending time with his family and being ``Pudding Papa'' to his great-grandson.  ``Dad had a zest for life,'' his son, Gregory, said ``He loved people, loved his family, and he loved to have a good time. [And] he was a hard worker and a dedicated individual.'' Mr. Bonnell was a funeral attendant for the Eggleston Meinert Pavley Funeral Home in Oregon during his early retirement years.  His memberships included the Arthur Daly American Legion Post, the National Rifle Association, Paragon Lotus Lodge F, Zenobia Shrine (Stewards, Hillbillies and Wood County) VFW Post #2510 and 40-8 Society of the American Legion, and the Scottish Rite, all in Toledo. In 1988, he received the Meritorious Service Award from the Scottish Rite where he had life membership.  Surviving are his loving wife, JoAnne, with whom he just celebrated 60 years of marriage (June 28, 1947); children, Gregory (Mary) Bonnell and Beverly (Kevin) Sawyer; grandchildren, Angie and Brianne Sawyer, Rob, Mike, Adam and Brian Bonnell and great-grandchildren, Kleiston and Ria. Bob was preceded in death by his parents, his two brothers and a sister.  He will be missed by the Sisters of Notre Dame especially Sister Mary Theresa. He will be sorely missed and fondly remembered by all the lives he touched in our Toledo community. The world was made a better place by the life of Bob Bonnell. May his works inspire others who follow in his golden steps.                          ____________________
