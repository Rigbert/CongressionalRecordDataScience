Speaker, this spring the Fifth District of Maryland lost an extraordinary advocate for the men and women of our Armed Services and for America's naval engineering at the Pax River Naval Air Station. John `Jack' Francis Lynch of St. Ingoes, Maryland, which is in St. Mary's County, passed away on May 18 at the age of eighty-five. Jack spent his career at Pax River, first as an engineer, then as Technical Director, and later as part of the private sector and as an early leader of the Southern Maryland Navy Alliance and the Patuxent Partnership.  When he arrived in Southern Maryland in 1955, Jack began a career that would see him become one of the most influential individuals in the history of Pax River and the region. When he became Technical Director at Pax River in 1979, he realized that the installation was at a disadvantage compared to other major military installations around the country. That was something Jack would not abide. Pax River needed more engineers, so he went to Washington and asked that they be hired. He got what he asked for. Pax River had no on-site offices in Washington, so Jack made the trip to the Pentagon over and over again to lobby military leaders on its behalf. By the time he retired from government service in 1986, Jack had completely transformed the way engineers at Pax River trained and worked.  After leaving government service, Jack joined Mantech International until 1999 and continued to devote himself to Pax River and those who serve there throughout that time and after. In the early 1990's, Jack and I worked closely together and with other state and local leaders to secure funding to build an anechoic chamber at Pax River for the precision simulation of aircraft dynamics, the first of its kind in the world. We also worked together to ensure that Pax River benefitted from consolidation during the 1996 BRAC round, which helped make Southern Maryland the hub for aerospace development and testing it is today and a center for American engineering. Much of these achievements were the result of Jack's efforts to bring stakeholders together into the Southern Maryland Navy Alliance. Later, he led the Patuxent Partnership, which was also instrumental in growing Pax River and its critical role in naval aviation.  I will miss Jack Lynch, not only for his devotion to Southern Maryland and to a strong Navy but also for his optimism and determined spirit. I hope my colleagues in the House will join me in thanking Jack for his service to our country and in expressing my condolences to his wife Patricia Ann ``Trixie;'' their son Thomas and daughter-in-law Susan; their son Paul and daughter-in-law Kimberly; their son Patrick and daughter-in-law Kathy; and their ten grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. May Jack's memory bring them joy and comfort, as it surely will inspire all of us in Southern Maryland to carry on the work he cherished.                          ____________________
