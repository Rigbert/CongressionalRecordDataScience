President, I wonder if the Senator is aware that we seem to go off on things that are not very urgent, whereas we don't take time for things that are urgent.  For example, the nomination of Bill Lann Lee. All the members of the Judiciary Committee on this side of the aisle have asked the chairman for another hearing on Bill Lann Lee, because it is obvious from the debate we had on Thursday in the committee that misstatements of facts have been used, distortion of his record have been used. We find that people supposedly opposing Bill Lann Lee, in fact, support him. We find the cases in which he was involved were misconstrued.  So I just mention this, if we want to do something worthwhile, then I hope the Judiciary Committee and the chairman will stop refusing to have another hearing and will listen to all of us who have asked for another hearing out of fairness to a man who has been much maligned.  I thank the distinguished Senator from Nebraska and yield back to him to answer the question.
