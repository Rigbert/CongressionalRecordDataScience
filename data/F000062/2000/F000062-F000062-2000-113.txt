 President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Arizona. I also thank the Senator from New York, and I thank you, Mr. President, for allowing me to proceed.  I begin by thanking the Senator from Arizona. Mr. President, I say to Jon Kyl, working with him on this amendment has truly been one of the highlights of my 7 years in the Senate. He has worked with credibility and with integrity. He has been fulsome in his sharing of detail. We have gone shoulder to shoulder through virtually every rung of this, through 4 years of discussions, of conferences, of hearings, of 800 pages of testimony, some 35 witnesses. I agree with everything he said about the inclusive nature of the process.  I must tell Senator Kyl how much I admire him. We worked together on the Technology and Terrorism Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee. I saw it there. I have never seen it with another Senator as pronounced as it was in these past 4 years in the work on this issue. I believe a friendship has developed in the process, one which means a great deal to me. His leadership has been superb, and there is certainly nothing either one of us has done for the misunderstanding out there still about what we are trying to do and the importance of it. We will come back another day; there is no question in my mind about that. I cannot thank him enough. From the bottom of my heart, I thank Senator Kyl for his credibility, his intelligence, his integrity. He did his party proud. I am very happy to be a colleague of his and a friend as well.  Before I get into my remarks, I also echo the thanks Senator Kyl provided to a whole host of victims, literally tens of thousands of them, to 37 State attorneys general, to many Governors, to all those across both party lines who support this and understand it. I particularly thank three legal scholars who were with us every step of the way.  I thank Larry Tribe, a professor of constitutional law at Harvard University, for his testimony, for the phone calls, for the advice he has provided and for the statements he has made.  I also thank one of the primary legal scholars in this country who has been a victims' rights representative, legal counsel--just a wonderful human being I have also gotten to know--and that is Professor Paul Cassell, professor of law at the University of Utah.  I would be remiss if I did not thank Steve Twist on behalf of both Senator Kyl and myself. There are few people who have been as ardent in the cause as Steve Twist has been, with his knowledge, with his expertise, with his representation of victims throughout this entire process.  I know that none of the three above-mentioned individuals is going to go away. We have them as part of this enormous victims coalition. We will come back, and we will fight again another day.  But today, Mr. President, I rise with a sad heart because we must postpone our battle for a crime victims' rights constitutional amendment.  This is a fight that actually began 18 years ago when the President's Task Force on Victims of Crime recommended an amendment to the Constitution of the United States which would address victims' rights. This isn't a new idea. It has been around. There is a track record to show why it is necessary.  As I said, Senator Kyl and I introduced that amendment 4 years ago. We have worked long and hard. I think enough has been said about that.  What is unbelievable to me is that we have also been criticized for the hard work we have put into this amendment over the past 4 years.  Senators have come to the floor and told us that the fact that we put our amendment through so many drafts and consulted so many interested parties shows that our amendment does not deserve to be in the Constitution of the United States. Yet, in fact, drafting an amendment to the Constitution of the United States requires an uncanny kind of precision. Because this isn't 1791 when the Bill of Rights was written, or 1789 when the Constitution was adopted, there has been a whole panoply of case law and interpretations that have come throughout the ages that makes the drafting of a constitutional amendment such as this one very difficult. However, I believe we have developed a document that will, in fact, stand the test of time.  What we have tried to do, in essence, is very simple. I would like to show a chart, once again. We have tried to take the Constitution, which provides 15 specific rights to the accused, and no rights to victims of violent crimes--with a scale of justice which we believe is weighted in a certain way to exempt victims from the administration of criminal justice--and give victims some status and standing in the administration of criminal justice, so that the scale of justice would not be so badly tilted but would look something like this other chart where the accused would have certain basic rights, and victims would have certain basic, although limited, rights: The right to notice when a trial takes place; the right not to be excluded from a public proceeding; the right to be heard at that proceeding, if present; the right to submit a statement in writing; the right to notice of the release or the escape of an attacker; the right to consideration for the assurance of a speedy trial; the right to an order of restitution; and the right to consideration of their safety in determining any conditional release of an attacker--simple, basic rights of status and standing.  We have heard much about the fact that this should not be in the Constitution. There has been much talk on the floor about James Madison and other framers. Senators have suggested that our forefathers would not support the amendment.  I tried to point out why our forefathers did not have reason to consider the amendment because when both the Constitution and the Bill of Rights were written, victims had a role in the process. Up until 1850, victims had a role in the process. But it was with the development of the public prosecutors, when victims were no longer in the courtroom, that they became summarily excluded from the process.  I point out that if we look back in history, I find my views very commensurate with those of Thomas Jefferson. He was not among those who wrote the Constitution, but he thought deeply about the Constitution and how and when we should amend it. He was also the inspiration for our Bill of Rights, a document actually drafted by James Madison.  In 1816, 25 years after the Bill of Rights became the law of the land, Thomas Jefferson wrote to Samuel Kercheval, stating his views on amending the Constitution. I think it is important that the Record reflect these views. He said:       I am certainly not an advocate for frequent and untried      changes in laws and constitutions. I think moderate      imperfections had better be borne with; because, when once      known, we accommodate ourselves to them and find practical      means of correcting their ill effects. But I know also that      laws and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress      of the human mind. As that becomes more developed, more      enlightened, as new discoveries are made, new truths      disclosed and manners and opinions change with the change of      circumstances, institutions must advance also and keep pace      with the times.  Similarly, 13 years earlier, he said in a letter to Wilson Nicholas:       Let us go on perfecting the Constitution by adding by way      of amendment, those forms which time and trial show are still      wanting.  I believe very deeply that time and trial show that our amendment is still wanting and should be adopted.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record, in recognition of the widespread support we have received, letters from virtually every law enforcement agency and every crime victims group.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                 County of Shasta,                              Office of the District Attorney,                                      Redding, CA, April 17, 2000.     Re: Crime Victims' Rights Constitutional Amendment     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, Senate HWA Office,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: I write to offer my wholehearted      support for your efforts in sponsoring the Crime Victims'      Rights Constitutional Amendment. Your proposed amendment      would fill a gaping hole in the rights guaranteed to citizens      in our Constitution by providing basic, essential rights to      victims of crime in our nation. As a prosecuting attorney, I      have all too often seen the rights of perpetrators of      horrendous crimes protected at all costs while the basic      human rights of victims and families of victims of those      crimes are ignored and forgotten. It will be great day when      our Constitution and criminal justice system work as hard to      protect the rights of victims as they do the rights of      criminals. I commend you on your efforts to make that day a      reality. Do not hesitate to call upon me if there is anything      I can do to support you with this work.       Thank you for your attention to this matter.           Sincerely,                                                McGregor W. Scott,                                                District Attorney.                                       ____                                                   State of Nevada                                            Executive Chamber,                                    Carson City, NV, May 24, 1996.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, Senate Hart Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am writing to lend my support to      your efforts to protect victims' rights. As one of the      original nine members of President Reagan's Task Force on      Victims of Crime, I have long supported a Constitutional      Amendment to protect the rights of victims of crime.       As the vice-Chairman, and soon to be Chairman, of the      National Governor's Association, I would like to assist you      by raising this issue with our nation's governors.       In Nevada, we've made great strides in protecting victims'      rights through legislative measure ranging from guarding      consumers against auto repair fraud to expanding our domestic      violence laws to cover people in dating or live-in      relationships. Despite these efforts, more changes need to be      made to ensure that victims are treated fairly. The criminal      justice system should not overlook the interest of victims in      light of protecting the rights of the criminals. I firmly      believe that a speedy trial and information about the      proceedings of the trial are minimal rights that the      constitution should grant to all victims.       Please let me know what other ways I can help you with this      cause.           Sincerely,                                                       Bob Miller,     Governor.                                  ____                                   Justice for Murder Victims,                                San Francisco, CA, April 19, 2000.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Regarding: Support of S.J. Res. 3, the Victims Rights          Constitutional Amendment       Dear Senator Feinstein: On behalf of Justice for Murder      Victims, I would like to inform you of our strong support of      S.J. Res. 3, the ``Victims Rights Constitutional Amendment''       Criminals' rights are inherently included in America's      criminal justice system, while crime victims, historically,      have not had a place and/or voice within the criminal justice      system. In fact, to add insults to injury, the majority of      victims are violated and betrayed a second time by the      system. S.J. Res, 3 will secure basic rights for countless      victims of crime throughout our nation as they struggle to      survive their victimization.       Under this legislation, victims would have a right to      receive notice of public proceedings related to the crime      perpetrated against them, notice of the offender's escape or      release from custody, as well as notification of parole      hearings and to have a voice at these hearings. Without the      help and determination of so many crime victims, the system      cannot hold criminals accountable and stem the tide of future      crime.       Victims of crime need to have the same rights across this      great nation. We ``THANK YOU'' for taking an active role in      this very important legislation and for the concern and      support that you continue to show victims of crime and their      survivors.       Please feel free to call on us anytime we may be of help.           Sincerely,                                                  Harriet Salarno,     President.                                  ____                                                     May 20, 1996.     Senator Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate Hart Building, Washington, DC.     Attention: Neil Quinter       Dear Senator Feinstein: Thank you for meeting with me on      such short notice last week and sharing the Crime Victims'      Rights Amendment. As I am currently spending the majority of      my days in court attending the trial of my daughter's killer,      I know too well the inequities facing the families of      victims.       For that reason I wish to offer my whole hearted      endorsement and approval of your attempt to guarantee rights      for the victims and families of victims of violent crime. If      there is anything that I can do to promote your efforts,      please feel free to call on me at any time.           Sincerely,     Marc Klaas.                                  ____                                     Victims & Friends United,                                   Sacramento, CA, April 21, 2000.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Re: Support of Crime Victims' Rights Amendment       Victims and Friends United (VFU), a California grassroots      organization is the representative of nearly 20,000 members      which consists of crime victims, their families, and other      concerned citizens. We have been at the forefront of the      fight for the rights of crime victims for nearly 20 years. We      ensure that existing victims' rights laws are zealously      enforced, and encourage the drafting of new legislation to      further protect the rights of crime victims and improve      public safety.       As President and Board member of VFU, I am writing to ask      you and your co-sponsored Senators to urge the full Senate to      pass the Crime Victims' Rights Amendment to the U.S.      Constitution. In supporting this amendment, the Senate has an      historic opportunity to take a stand for the millions of      Americans who are victimized each year in this country.       For decades we have seen court decisions expanding the      ``rights'' of criminals. Finally, it is encouraging to see      legislators beginning to place equal emphasis on the rights      of crime victims. The rights to be present, heard and      informed throughout the criminal justice process are basic      tenets guaranteed by our U.S. Constitution to those accused      or convicted of crimes in our nation, yet the rights of their      innocent victims are not articulated in our U.S.      Constitution. The Crime Victims' Rights Constitutional      Amendment is necessary to ensure that victims' rights are      respected and enforced in our criminal justice process.       Thank you for all that you do for Californians, keep up the      good work, and realize that you have our full support. If we      can be of further assistance or you need someone from our      organization to testify, please give us a call.           Sincerely,                                                  Patsy J. Gillis,     President and Co-Founder.                                  ____                                               The Law Enforcement                                          Alliance of America,                                     Lynbrook, NY, April 12, 2000.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: On behalf of the Law Enforcement      Alliance of America, I would like to inform you of our strong      organizational support of S.J. Res. 3, the ``Victims Rights      Constitutional Amendment.'' LEAA is asking for your active      support of this important legislation that is expected to go      for a Senate floor vote in late April. Additionally, LEAA      asks that you oppose any attempts to dilute the intent of      this critical legislation.       LEAA is the nation's largest coalition of law enforcement      professionals, crime victims, and concerned citizens      dedicated to finding solutions to the problems plaguing our      country's criminal justice system. Fighting for passage of      victims' rights legislation is of paramount importance in      realizing just one of LEAA's many goals.       Paradoxically, criminals' rights are inherently included in      America's most supreme document while crime victims,      historically, have not had a place and/or a voice within the      criminal justice system. In fact, to add insult to injury,      the majority of victims are violated and betrayed a second      time by the system. S.J. Res. 3 will secure basic rights for      countless victims of crime throughout our nation as they      struggle to survive their victimization.       Under this legislation, victims would have a right to      receive notice of public proceedings related to the crime      perpetrated against them, notice of the offender's escape or      release from custody, as well as notification of parole      hearings and a voice at these hearings. As the President's      Task Force on Victims reported in 1982, ``The criminal      justice system is absolutely dependent upon the cooperation      of crime victims to report and to testify. Without their      help, the system cannot hold criminals accountable and stem      the tide of future crime.''       LEAA feels it is imperative to pass legislation to protect      the country's violent crime victims. The high number of      victims in this country (including the tens of thousands of      officers assaulted each year and dozens murdered) indicates      that we cannot afford to overlook this proposed amendment.      Another reason to endorse this amendment is that in the 18      years we've discussed this provision, 32.4 million Americans      have been victims of violent crime. And they simply deserve      better treatment in the criminal justice system.       Once again, we urge you to take an active role in passing      this very important legislation. If there is any information      LEAA can provide on S.J. Res. 3, please don't hesitate to      call me or LEAA's Crime Victims Advocate Darlene Hutchinson      at (703) 847-2677.           Sincerely,                                                   James J. Fotis,     Executive Director.                                  ____                                                        WEAVE,                                   Sacramento, CA, April 21, 2000.     Senator Dianne Feinstein,     Senate Hart Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: On behalf of Women Escaping a      Violent Environment, Inc. (WEAVE), I am happy to lend our      support of your Crime Victims Rights Constitutional Amendment      (Senate Joint Resolution 3). This amendment is supported      throughout our nation by 49 of 50 governors as well as      Mothers Against Drunk Driving, Parents of Murdered Children      and the National Organizational for Victim Assistance.       While criminal defendants have almost two dozen separate      constitutional rights, fifteen of which specifically provided      as constitutional amendments, victims of crime have no      constitutional rights. The Crime Victims Rights Amendment      brings much needed balance to our justice system by granting      victims the right to be informed, present and heard at      critical stages throughout trials.       We should not forget that justice is an attempt to give      back to victims the sense of closure and fairness taken by      their perpetrators. This amendment is a long overdue step      toward justice for victims.       Please convey WEAVE's strong support to your colleagues in      the U.S. Senate. Thank you for your advocacy efforts on      behalf of victims and victim advocacy organizations.           Sincerely,                                                      Mary Struhs,                                               Associate Director.                                       ____                                           Federal Law Enforcement                                         Officers Association,                               East Northport, NY, April 21, 2000.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: On behalf of the National Executive      Board of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association and      out more than 17,000 members across America, I want to      formally announce FLEOA's strong support for S.J. Res. 3, the      ``Crime Victims' Rights Constitutional Amendment.''       FLEOA, the voice of America's federal criminal      investigators, agents, and officers, is the largest      professional association in the nation exclusively      representing the federal law enforcement community. FLEOA, a      non partisan, volunteer organization comprised of active and      retired federal law enforcement members from the agencies      listed on the left side of this document is dedicated to the      advancement of the federal law enforcement community.       We are an organization comprised of individuals who have      dedicated their lives to protecting and serving the American      public. It is our belief that the time is right to amend the      Constitution to correct the injustice that that has developed      in this area. This amendment will ensure that those who have      been touched by crimes of violence are not further victimized      by laws that may prevent them from being notified, and      provided the opportunity to be present and heard at critical      stages of their cases. We believe that the Founders created      the Constitution to be a living document and this proposed      amendment is consistent with that principle.       FLEOA looks forward to working with Congress and the States      in securing passage of the Crime Victims' Rights      Constitutional Amendment. Please do not hesitate to contact      me on this issue or on any other legislative matter impacting      federal law enforcement. I can be reached at (202) 258-7884.           Respectfully,                                               Brian M. Moskowitz,     Legislative Director, National Executive Board Member.                                  ____                                               National Center for                                 Missing & Exploited Children,                                    Arlington, VA, April 25, 1996.     Senator Dianne Feinstein,     Hart Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am writing on behalf of the      National Center for Missing and Exploited Children to      formally express our support and endorsement of the Victim's      Rights Amendment you have introduced with Senator Kyl and      Congressman Hyde. The passage of this resolution will go far      to helping victims nationwide begin and continue the      difficult healing process necessary after victimization.       The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children      spearheads nationwide efforts to locate and recover missing      children, and raise public awareness about ways to prevent      child abduction, molestation and sexual exploitation. As you      continue your work in support of children and others      victimized by criminal offenders, please do not hesitate to      contact us if we can be of assistance in any way.       Again, we strongly commend your efforts and thank you for      your dedication to the interests of America's millions of      criminal victims.           Sincerely,                                              Teresa Klingensmith,     Manager, Legislative Affairs.                                  ____                                          California Police Chiefs                                             Association, Inc.                                   Sacramento, CA, April 18, 2000.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     Senate Hart Office Building,     Washington, DC.     Re: Crime Victims Rights Constitutional Amendment       Dear Senator Feinstein: The California Police Chiefs      Association fully supports your Crime Victims Rights      Constitutional Amendment (Senate Joint Resolution 3). This      amendment is very much needed as demonstrated by the support      of Mothers Against Drunk Driving, Parents of Murdered      Children and the National Organization for Victim Assistance      as well as 49 of 50 Governors.       Law Enforcement has long recognized that crime victims      deserve to have a rightful place in our justice system. While      criminal defendants have almost two dozen separate      constitutional rights, fifteen of them specifically provided      as constitutional amendments, victims of crime have zero      constitutional rights. The Crime Victims Rights Amendment      brings much needed balance to our justice system by granting      victims the right to be informed, present and heard at      critical stages throughout trials.       While many could claim that this legislation places burdens      on the justice system, we should not forget that the spirit      of justice is to attempt to give back to victims the sense of      closure and fairness taken by their perpetrators.      Unfortunately, we as a nation have often forgotten the      victims of crime. With today's population increasingly living      longer, we are seeing more and more victimization of our      elderly. They, along with our children, are the least able to      fight back against the criminal element and therefore need      this amendment.       The California Police Chiefs Association is very pleased to      stand with you on this amendment and fully supports your      efforts.           Respectfully,                                                Craig T. Steckler,       Chief, Fremont Police Department and President, California      Police Chiefs' Association.                                  ____                                               California Narcotic                                        Officers' Association,                                Santa Clarita, CA, April 24, 2000.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     Hart Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.     Re: Crime Victims Rights/Constitutional Amendment       Dear Senator Feinstein: The membership of the California      Narcotic Officers' Association is in strong support of your      Crime Victims Rights Constitutional Amendment (Senate Joint      Resolution 3). As members of law enforcement community, we      recognize that crime victims must have voice in the criminal      justice system. Traditionally, they have been treated with      less respect than those accused of terrible crimes.       The California Narcotic Officers' Association is very      pleased to stand with you on this very important amendment      and fully support your efforts.           Sincerely,                                                     Walter Allen,     President.                                  ____                                      California Police Activities                                                 League (PAL),                                    Oakland, CA, February 8, 2000.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, Washington DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: The California Police Activities      commends you on your efforts to protect the rights of crime      victims. The California Police Activities League supports      your Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. As      law enforcement personnel, we understand the importance of      this Constitutional Amendment to the many victims of crime      that we meet during a criminal investigation. In many cases,      it is youth, which are the victims. They should have the same      rights as every citizen of the United States of America. A      victim of a violent crime should have the following rights:       To reasonable notice of public judicial proceedings       To attend all public proceedings.       To be heard at crucial stages in the judicial process.       To receive reasonable notice of the offender's release or      escape.       To consider in the interest of the crime victim that the      trial is free from unreasonable delay.       To receive restitution from the convicted offender.       To consider for the safety of the victim any conditional      release from custody.       The California Police Activities is only asking that the      8.6 millions victims of violent crime in our country receive      fair treatment by the judicial system, which they deserve.      For those accused of crimes in our country, the Constitution      specifically protects them. However, nowhere in the text of      the United States Constitution does there appear any      guarantee of rights for crime victims.       The time has come for a Victim Bill of Rights. The      California Police Activities in the name of its members      support your drive for the passage of this Constitutional      Amendment. Please call us if we can be of help in your effort      to protect the rights of crime victims. CAL PAL commends you      for taking up this cause in the name of 8.6 million      Americans.           Sincerely,                                                        Ron Exley,     Government Relations Director.                                  ____         City and County of San Francisco, Office of the Sheriff,                                San Francisco, CA, April 24, 2000.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     Senate Hart Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: I write to lend my support to      Senate Joint Resolution 3, the proposed amendment to the      Constitution intended to protect the rights of crime victims.       As Sheriff of San Francisco, I have witnessed the      empowerment experienced by victims of crime when given the      opportunity to speak about how their lives were impacted by      violence. I have also witnessed the effect on violent      offenders of hearing how their crimes harmed individuals and      the entire community. As part of our Resolve to Stop the      Violence Project, an in-custody treatment program for men      with violent criminal histories, victims come to the jail to      tell how the violence done to them changed their lives. For      the first time, many offenders realize that their actions      have serious and harmful consequences, and this is often the      catalyst for real change. Not only does the experience give      voice to crime victims, it gives both victim and offender the      opportunity to work toward the common goal of the eradication      of violence.       Participation of victims in the criminal justice dialogue      is essential to their well being and that of the entire      community. I am proud to support the Crime Victims Rights      Constitutional Amendment.           Sincerely,                                                Michael Hennessey,                                                          Sheriff.                                       ____                                                  San Diego County                                         Sheriff's Department,                                    San Diego, CA, April 24, 2000.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: It is with great pleasure that I      add my support to S.J. Res. 3, to provide constitutional      rights for crime victims. There are rights articulated in the      U.S. Constitution to provide rights for crime victims.      Criminal defendants have almost two dozen separate      constitutional rights, fifteen of them provided by amendments      to the U.S. Constitution.       Your proposed Crime Victims' Rights Amendment will bring      balance to the justice system, by giving crime victims the      rights to be informed, present and heard at critical stages      throughout their case.       The need for this measure is evidenced by the forty-two      bipartisan senators who have agreed to cosponsor this      amendment. I look forward to working with you on this and      other legislation that we mutually agree upon.       If I might be of further assistance, please don't hesitate      to call me.           Sincerely,                                              William B. Kolender,     Sheriff.                                  ____                                                 Sacramento County                                         Sheriff's Department,                                   Sacramento, CA, April 21, 2000.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     Senate Hart Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am writing to offer my support      toward your efforts in sponsoring the Crime Victim's Rights      Constitutional Amendment. Your proposed amendment would fill      a void in the rights guaranteed to citizens in our      Constitution by providing basic, essential rights to victims      of crimes all across our nation.       Law Enforcement has long recognized that crime victims      deserve a rightful place in the criminal justice system.      While criminal defendants have nearly two dozen separate      constitutional rights, fifteen of which are specifically      provided as constitutional amendments, crime victims have no      constitutional rights as it relates to being the victims of      crimes. The Crime Victims Rights Amendment will bring much      needed balance to our justice system by providing victims the      right to be informed, present and heard at all critical      stages throughout their respective trials.       The opponents of this legislation claim that the amendment      would place burdens on the justice system, we cannot afford      to forget the intent of justice is to give back to victims,      the sense of security, closure and fairness, taken by the      perpetrators of their crimes.       I applaud you for your efforts and I stand with you as you      pursue this important issue. Please do not hesitate to call      on me if I can provide any assistance. I can be reached at      (916) 874-7146.           Sincerely yours,                                                       Lou Blanas,                                                          Sheriff.
