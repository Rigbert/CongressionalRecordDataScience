President, I spoke earlier this month about the continuing problems for Federal law enforcement caused by the so-called McDade law, which was slipped into the omnibus appropriations law at the end of the last Congress. I discussed how the interplay of the McDade law and a recent attorney ethics decision by the Oregon Supreme Court is severely hampering Federal law enforcement efforts in Oregon. Oregon's Federal prosecutors will no longer use federally authorized investigative techniques such as wiretaps and consensual monitoring, and by the end of this week, the FBI will shut down Portland's Innocent Images undercover operation, which targets child pornography and exploitation. This is just the latest example of how the McDade law has impeded important criminal prosecutions, chilled the use of traditional Federal investigative techniques and posed multiple hurdles for Federal prosecutors.  Due to my serious concerns about the adverse effects of the McDade law on Federal law enforcement efforts, I introduced S. 855, the Professional Standards for Government Attorneys Act, on April 21, 1999. The Justice Department has called this legislation ``a good approach that addresses the two most significant problems caused by the McDade Amendment--confusion about what rule applies and the issue of contacts with represented parties.''  Since that time, I have conferred with a number of lawmakers from both sides of the aisle about crafting an alternative to the McDade law. Together, we worked out a proposal based on S. 855, which would address the problems that have caused by the McDade law, while adhering to the basic premise of that law-- that the Department of Justice should not have the authority it long claimed either to write its own ethics rules or to exempt its lawyers from the ethics rules adopted by the Federal courts. Based on these discussions, I am filing this substitute amendment to my bill, S. 855.  I regret that we have squandered opportunities to move any corrective legislation through the Congress. The consequences of our inaction have been severe, as I have discussed, and it is clear that Federal law enforcement efforts will continue to suffer if we do not act now.  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the substitute amendment and a section-by-section summary be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Summary of the Professional Standards for Government Attorneys Act of                                   2000                              1. overview       The Professional Standards for Government Attorneys Act of      2000 adheres to the basic premise of section 801 of the      omnibus appropriations act for fiscal year 1999 (Pub. L. 105-     277), commonly known as the McDade law: the Department of      Justice does not have the authority it has long claimed to      write its own ethics rules. The proposed legislation would      establish that the Department may not unilaterally exempt      federal trial lawyers from the rules of ethics adopted by the      federal courts. Federal courts are the more appropriate body      to establish rules of professional responsibility for federal      prosecutors, not only because federal courts have traditional      authority to establish such rules for lawyers generally, but      because the Department lacks the requisite objectivity.       The first part of the proposed legislation embodies the      traditional understanding that when lawyers handle cases      before a federal court, they should be subject to the federal      court's rules of professional responsibility, and not to the      possibly inconsistent rules of other jurisdictions. By      incorporating this ordinary choice-of-law principle, the      proposed legislation would preserve the federal courts'      traditional authority to oversee the professional conduct of      federal trial lawyers, including federal prosecutors. It      would thereby avoid the uncertainties presented by the McDade      law, which subjects federal prosecutors to state laws, rules      of criminal procedure, and judicial decisions which differ      from existing federal law.       The second part of the proposed legislation addresses the      most pressing contemporary question of government attorney      ethics--namely, the question of which rule should govern      government attorneys' communications with represented      persons. It asks the Judicial Conference of the United States      to submit to the Supreme Court a proposed uniform national      rule to govern this area of professional conduct, and to      study the need for additional national rules to govern other      areas in which the proliferation of local rules may interfere      with effective federal law enforcement. The Rules Enabling      Act process is the ideal one for developing such rules, both      because the federal judiciary traditionally is responsible      for overseeing the conduct of lawyers in federal court      proceedings, and because this process would best provide the      Supreme Court an opportunity fully to consider and      objectively to weigh all relevant considerations.                             2. short title       Section one is the short title of the bill.                    3. amendments to 28 u.s.c. 530b       Section two supersedes the McDade law with a new 28 U.S.C.      530B, consisting of four subsections.       Subsection (a) codifies the definition of ``attorney for      the Government'' in the current Department of Justice      regulations, and also includes in the definition any outside      special counsel, or employee of such counsel, as may be      appointed by the Attorney General under 28 CFR 600.1 or any      other provision of law.       Subsection (b) establishes a clear choice-of-law rule for      government attorneys with respect to standards of      professional responsibility, modeled on Rule 8.5(b) of the      ABA's Model Rules of Professional Conduct. An attorney who is      handling a case in court would be subject to the professional      standards established by the rules and decisions of that      court. An attorney who is conducting a grand jury      investigation would be subject to the professional standards      of the court under whose authority the grand jury was      impanelled. In other circumstances, where no court has clear      supervisory authority over particular conduct, an attorney      would be subject to the professional standards established by      rules and decisions of the United States district court for      the judicial district in which the attorney principally      performs his official duties, except that the Act does not      apply to government attorney conduct that is unrelated to the      attorney's work for the government.       Thus, for example, an Assistant United States Attorney for      the Eastern District of New York would ordinarily be subject      to the attorney conduct rules prescribed by the E.D.N.Y.      courts, as interpreted and applied by those courts. If the      attorney handled a government appeal in the United States      Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, the attorney's      conduct in connection with the appeal would be subject to the      local rules and interpretive decisions of the Second Circuit.      If cross-designated to handle a prosecution in another      judicial district, e.g., the District of New Jersey, the      attorney's conduct with respect to that prosecution would be      subject to the local federal district court rules. Similarly,      if the attorney were to handle a matter for the government      before a New York State court, the attorney would be subject      to the professional standards established by the rules and      decisions of that court, in the same manner and to the same      extent as other New York State practitioners.       This provision anticipates that the Supreme Court might      promulgate one or more uniform national rules governing the      professional conduct of government attorneys practicing      before the federal courts. In this event, the terms of the      uniform national rule would apply.       Subsection (c) codifies the predominant practice with      respect to state disciplinary proceedings against government      attorneys. A government attorney whose conduct is subject to      the professional standards of a federal court may be      disciplined by state authorities only if referred to state      authorities by a federal court. No referral is needed when      the applicable professional standards are those of a state      court (which may occur, under subsection (b), if the attorney      is handling a matter before a state court). This gatekeeping      provision ensures that federal courts will have the first      opportunity to interpret and apply federal court rules to      government attorneys, while leaving substantial enforcement      authority with state disciplinary bodies. This provision also      specifically promotes federal uniformity in the application      of professional standards to government attorneys.       Subsection (d) clarifies the law regarding the licensing of      government attorneys, an issue that is currently addressed      through the appropriations process. Since 1979,      appropriations bills for the Department of Justice have      incorporated by reference section 3(a) of Pub. L. 96-132,      which states: ``None of the sums authorized to be      appropriated by this Act may be used to pay the compensation      of any person employed after the date of the enactment of      this Act as an attorney (except foreign counsel employed in      special cases) unless such person shall be duly licensed and      authorized to practice as an attorney under the laws of a      State, territory, or the District of Columbia.''       Subsection (d) codifies this longstanding requirement, and      also makes clear that government attorneys need not be      licensed under the laws of any state in particular. The      clarification is necessary to ensure that local rules      regarding state licensure are not applied to federal      prosecutors. Cf. United States v. Straub, No. 5:99 Cr. 10      (N.D. W. Va. June 14, 1999) (granting defense motion to      disqualify the Assistant United States Attorney because he      was not licensed to practice in West Virginia).       Subsection (e), like the McDade law, authorizes the      Attorney General to make and amend rules to assure compliance      with section 530B.           4. JUDICIAL CONFERENCE REPORTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS       Section three directs the Judicial Conference of the United      States to prepare two reports regarding the regulation of      government attorney conduct. Both reports would contain      recommendations with respect to the advisability of uniform      national rules.       The first report would address the issue of contacts with      represented persons, which has generated the most serious      controversy regarding the professional conduct of government      attorneys. See, e.g., State v. Miller, 600 N.W.2d 457 (Minn.      1999); United States v. McDonnell Douglas Corp., 132 F.3d      1252 (8th Cir. 1998); United States v. Lopez, 4 F.3d 1455      (9th Cir. 1993); United States v. Hammad, 858 F.2d 834 (2d      Cir. 1988).       Rule 4.2 of the ABA's Model Rules of Professional Conduct      and analogous rules adopted by state courts and bar      associations place strict limits on when a lawyer may      communicate with a person he knows to be represented by      another lawyer. These ``no contact'' rules preserve fairness      in the adversarial system and the integrity of the attorney-     client relationship by protecting parties, potential parties      and witnesses from lawyers who would exploit the disparity in      legal skill between attorneys and lay people and damage the      position of the represented person. Courts have given a wide      variety of interpretations to these rules, however, creating      uncertainty and confusion as to how they apply in criminal      cases and to government attorneys. For example, courts have      disagreed about whether these rules apply to federal      prosecutor contacts with represented persons in non-custodial      pre-indictment situations, in custodial pre-indictment      situations, and in post-indictment situations involving the      same or different matters underlying the charges.       Lawyers who practice in federal court--and federal      prosecutors in particular--have a legitimate interest in      being governed by a single set of professional standards      relating to frequently recurring questions of professional      conduct. Further, any rule governing federal prosecutors'      communications with represented persons should be respectful      of legitimate law enforcement interest as well as the      legitimate interests of the represented individuals. Absent      clear authority to engage in communications with represented      persons--when necessary and under limited circumstances      carefully circumscribed by law--the government is      significantly hampered in its ability to detect and prosecute      federal offenses.       The proposed legislation charges the Judicial Conference      with developing a uniform national rule governing government      attorney contacts with represented persons. Given the      advanced stage of dialogue among the interested parties--the      Department of Justice, the ABA, the federal and state courts,      and others--the Committee is confident that a satisfactory      rule can be developed within the one-year time frame      established by the bill.       While the ``no contact'' rule poses the most serious      challenge to effective law enforcement, other rules of      professional responsibility may also threaten to interfere      with legitimate investigations. The proposed legislation      therefore directs the Judicial Conference to prepare a second      report addressing broader questions regarding the regulation      of government attorney conduct. This report, to be completed      within two years, would review any areas of conflict or      potential conflict between federal law enforcement techniques      and existing standards of professional responsibility, and      make recommendations concerning the need for additional      national rules.                          ____________________
