President, just before we wrap up, I have heard Republicans talk constantly about how this process is being conducted by regular order. I have never seen in my time in public service, when talking about $10 trillion worth of tax policy changes and the biggest tax bill in three decades, something along the lines of the flimflam that we have been talking about, with handwritten changes in the margins about something that conceivably will affect vast sums of taxpayer money.  I yield the floor.
