That might not be an appropriate question on the floor of the House. But having said that, Mr. Leader, the chairman, again, being on the floor, I am on the Labor-HHS committee, and I have not attended any meeting of any conference committee on the Labor-HHS bill. You say it is in conference. Where?  Mr. DeLAY. If the gentleman will yield, I am not advised as to any meetings that are going on. I am sure I can convey the gentleman's interest in going to meetings. I know of his love for meetings. But we have encouraged the Committee on Appropriations to get these conference reports done.                              {time}  1445  All we can do on our side: our Members are ready to go. The other body has their own problems that I cannot discuss here, but as soon as we can get the two sides together, hopefully, they will have those meetings and the gentleman will be invited.
