 I would point out to my colleagues, in 2006 President Bush made a commitment to double the budget for the Office of Science over a decade. The commitment to double funding for research and development by President Bush in science and technology was a response to stark warnings from a group of government experts and business leaders that warned in their report, known as ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm,'' that the scientific and technological building blocks critical to our economic leadership are eroding at a time when many other nations are gathering strength.  I would certainly share the gentleman's concern about some of the myriad programs and ensuring that they do communicate with one another. He had mentioned the hubs. I had been critical of hubs in my past comments.  He has talked about management. I have been very critical of the Department of Energy as far as their project management.  But I would also point out that in relative terms, I believe that the Office of Science, and particularly given the leadership under President Bush by Dr. Orbach, who is now at the University of Texas, has done a very good job in getting a handle on the Department, improving its management skills and trying to do their very best as far as the expenditure of these funds.  For those reasons I do, again, strongly oppose the gentleman's amendment.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Broun).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it.
