Speaker, due to a hearing on future energy policy by the House Resources Committee, which I served as chairman, I was unavoidably detained, and thus unable to vote for final passage of H.R. 2924.  Had I been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on the Social Security Guarantee Act--H.R. 2924. I feel it is absolutely imperative to express Congress' intention to pass legislation increasing the public debt limit before March 1, 1996, and ensure that March Social Security benefits will be paid on time.  Senior citizens should not be held hostage on account of the budget deliberations we are holding today. I will continue to fight for a balanced budget by the turn of the century, and at the same time, protect America's obligations to its seniors.                          ____________________
