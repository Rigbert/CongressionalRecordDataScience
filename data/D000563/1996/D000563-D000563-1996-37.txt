Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to acknowledge as well that the gentleman from California offers an excellent amendment. In fact, it looks very similar to an amendment I was considering, and now I will not have to offer that amendment and give a very good speech in support of it, which I am sure would have won the gentleman from California over.  But I can tell Members that this effort to restore the $300 million in CDBG funds is one that is bipartisan and it is one that is supported, obviously, at the Federal level by the President and by the administration, but I think of equal force, Governors and mayors across the country feel very strongly about the CDBG program.  Mr. Chairman, I received a letter from the mayor of the city of Chicago, Mayor Daley, recently elected head of the Mayors' Conference nationwide, and he made it clear how important these funds are for the city of Chicago. This block grant program will allow Chicago to fund programs as diverse as daycare, senior services, economic development, and housing.  I salute the gentleman from California for this amendment. I happily support it, and I am glad that we have come together.
