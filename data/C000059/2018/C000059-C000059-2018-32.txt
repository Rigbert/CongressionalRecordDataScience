Chair, I appreciate the Dean of the House's amendment and his dedication to the sound management of natural resources on behalf of constituents in his State.  Obviously, mining, and certainly placer mining, is unique to Alaska. Alaska certainly has a unique history when it comes to mineral extraction, probably more than any other State in the Union. It is certainly a big part of Alaska's economy and the economy of the United States. It is a mutually beneficial enterprise.  This amendment is similar to the ones adopted by voice vote in FY17 and FY18, so I certainly urge my colleagues to adopt it by a voice vote yet again.  Mr. Chair, I support the amendment.
