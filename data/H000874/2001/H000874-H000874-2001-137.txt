Chairman, I thank the chairman for yielding, and I want to join him, my colleague from Oklahoma, in underscoring the importance of the funding for the security of the 2002 Winter Olympic games. This primary component of our public safety and anti-terrorism policy is essential to uphold public confidence and to ensure that no situation ever develops that would require the services of the FBI or FEMA.  My friend the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Matheson) has been talking to me about this, and I know that you, Mr. Chairman, as well as the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Hansen), who will be next speaking, have expressed great concern about this issue. I share that. I will continue to work with the gentleman from Oklahoma (Chairman Istook) and the gentleman from Florida (Chairman Young) to see that this funding is provided in a timely fashion.
