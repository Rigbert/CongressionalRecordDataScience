Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1018, I call up the bill (H.R. 6095) to affirm the inherent authority of State and local law enforcement to assist in the enforcement of immigration laws, to provide for effective prosecution of alien smugglers, and to reform immigration litigation procedures, and ask for its immediate consideration.  The Clerk read the title of the bill.  The text of the bill is as follows:                               H.R. 6095       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Immigration Law Enforcement      Act of 2006''.TITLE I--STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT COOPERATION IN THE ENFORCEMENT                          OF IMMIGRATION LAW ACT     SEC. 101. FEDERAL AFFIRMATION OF ASSISTANCE IN IMMIGRATION                    LAW ENFORCEMENT BY STATES AND POLITICAL                    SUBDIVISIONS OF STATES.       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law      and reaffirming the existing inherent authority of States,      law enforcement personnel of a State or a political      subdivision of a State have the inherent authority of a      sovereign entity to investigate, identify, apprehend, arrest,      detain, or transfer to Federal custody aliens in the United      States (including the transportation of such aliens across      State lines to detention centers), for the purposes of      assisting in the enforcement of the immigration laws of the      United States in the course of carrying out routine duties.      This State authority has never been displaced or preempted by      Congress.       (b) Construction.--Nothing in this section may be construed      to require law enforcement personnel of a State or political      subdivision of a State to--       (1) report the identity of a victim of, or a witness to, a      criminal offense to the Secretary of Homeland Security for      immigration enforcement purposes; or       (2) arrest such victim or witness for a violation of the      immigration laws of the United States.                TITLE II--ALIEN SMUGGLER PROSECUTION ACT     SEC. 201. EFFECTIVE PROSECUTION OF ALIEN SMUGGLERS.       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:       (1) Recent experience shows that alien smuggling is      flourishing, is increasingly violent, and is highly      profitable.       (2) Alien smuggling operations also present terrorist and      criminal organizations with opportunities for smuggling their      members into the United States practically at will.       (3) Alien smuggling is a lucrative business. Each year,      criminal organizations that smuggle or traffic in persons are      estimated to generate $9,500,000,000 in revenue worldwide.       (4) Alien smuggling frequently involves dangerous and      inhumane conditions for smuggled aliens. Migrants are      frequently abused or exploited, both during their journey and      upon reaching the United States. Consequently, aliens      smuggled into the United States are at significant risk of      physical injury, abuse, and death.       (5) Notwithstanding that alien smuggling poses a risk to      the United States as a whole, uniform guidelines for the      prosecution of smuggling offenses are not employed by the      various United States attorneys. Understanding that border-     area United States attorneys face an overwhelming workload, a      lack of sufficient prosecutions by certain United States      attorneys has encouraged additional smuggling, and      demoralized Border Patrol officers charged with enforcing our      anti-smuggling laws.       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress      that the Attorney General should adopt, not later than 3      months after the date of the enactment of this Act, uniform      guidelines for the prosecution of smuggling offenses to be      followed by each United States attorney in the United States.       (c) Additional Personnel.--In each of the fiscal years 2008      through 2013, the Attorney General shall, subject to the      availability of appropriations, increase by not less than 20      the number of attorneys in the offices of United States      attorneys employed to prosecute cases under section 274 of      the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1324), as      compared to the previous fiscal year.

(c) Settlements.--       (1) Consent decrees.--In any civil action pertaining to the      administration or enforcement of the immigration laws of the      United States, the court may not enter, approve, or continue      a consent decree that does not comply with subsection (a).       (2) Private settlement agreements.--Nothing in this section      shall preclude parties from entering into a private      settlement agreement that does not comply with subsection (a)      if the terms of that agreement are not subject to court      enforcement other than reinstatement of the civil proceedings      that the agreement settled.
