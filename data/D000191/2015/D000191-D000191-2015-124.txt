Speaker, I must say it is one of the most bizarre and fanciful things I have ever heard. There never was a viable plan to go to year-end. The Republicans never proposed the revenues.  They just recently found revenues under couch cushions to get us through to December 18th. And they have not meaningfully addressed any long-term funding, despite having been in charge 4\1/2\ years, and he wants to blame us.  They just held the first hearing ever in Ways and Means on revenues just a couple of weeks ago, and the chairman started by saying, ``No user fees.''  Well, you have now ruled out the traditional way of paying for infrastructure. So they are going to have to come up with something else. But that was totally bizarre.  I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Maryland (Ms. Edwards).
