Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3448. As chairman of the Committee on Veterans Affairs, I am pleased that the legislation recognizes the vital role that the Department of Veterans Affairs can and should play in helping our Nation prepare for future biological attacks.  As many Members know, the VA owns and operates the largest integrated health care network in the world, consisting of 172 medical centers, over 800 outpatient clinics, and 90 major research programs and are ideally suited to try to work, in collaboration with other agencies of government, on trying to respond to one of these terrorist attacks.  I would also point out to Members that the anthrax letters originated in my district in Trenton and Hamilton Township, New Jersey. And as all of the different bodies came together, CDC, Department of Health and the others, the VA stood ready and was able to provide, if it was necessary, Cipro and other antibiotics, because they are a major stockpiling of those pharmaceutical assets. I am happy that the chairman include in section 101(c) a requirement for the Secretary of Health and Human Services to evaluate the feasibility of using biomedical research and development capabilities of the VA in developing a comprehensive national response to bioterrorist attacks.                              {time}  2300  Again, the VA is ideally suited for this. I have introduced a number of bills that would try to further that. I think we really need to make sure that they have a very prominent seat at the table.
