 President, I am going to make a longer speech about Pat Moynihan, who was a close personal friend. That sounds almost presumptuous to say. He was such a towering intellect and profound political figure, to claim a personal friendship with him seems to be somewhat presumptuous. But he was.  Of all that I recall Pat Moynihan said and did, there is one thing that sticks in my mind that seems particularly appropriate on the day after his passing.  He once said, and I am paraphrasing but it is close to a quote, about John Kennedy's death:       There is no sense in being Irish unless you understand the      world is eventually going to break your heart.  I want Mrs. Moynihan to understand that there are a lot of us--Irish and non-Irish--who have a broken heart today because of the passing of a man who was truly, truly a giant in 20th-century American politics.                          ____________________
