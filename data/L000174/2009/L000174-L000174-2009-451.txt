President, I don't know if there are other Members are coming. While the Senator from Alabama is on the floor, let me note that I heard there may be one or two more Members coming over. I hope they will come soon. I am going to be here, as I have a series of meetings until well after 6, but I know a number on both sides have flights to catch.  Once everybody has spoken, I will suggest that we yield back all time and have a vote. I know the Senator from Alabama had specific time set aside and didn't use all of it. I hope he might join me in calling for other Senators who wish to speak to come over. If they are to speak, it would be better to do it sooner rather than later. It would be a great help to a number of Senators on both sides of the aisle.
