Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Carolyn Alford, an outstanding citizen and educator in Southwest Michigan. A dedicated and committed individual, Carolyn first arrived in Southwest Michigan in 1969 as a recent high school graduate from Montgomery, Alabama. She came to visit her sister for a couple of weeks and, 36 years later, she has yet to leave! Carolyn is retiring from a long, industrious term of almost 16 years with the Kalamazoo Public Schools Board of Education.  Throughout Carolyn's tenure with the Board she wore many ``hats,'' including President, Vice President, Secretary and Treasurer, among others. In her leadership roles, Carolyn continually went above and beyond the call of duty and could always be found outside of the office talking to parents and students regarding their concerns, attending open houses, or representing the board at graduation ceremonies, retirement dinners, awards presentations and, especially, sporting events.  However, Carolyn's community work didn't stop with the Kalamazoo Public Schools. As someone who always felt a ``calling to be in public service,'' she is very active in her church, has served in numerous leadership positions with the NAACP, and tirelessly participates in the Northside Association for Community Development, YWCA Domestic Assault Program, the Douglas Community Association, Kalamazoo Northside Non-Profit Housing Corporation and many other organizations throughout Kalamazoo and Southwest Michigan. All this while working full time as an administrator at Kalamazoo Valley Community College.  We in Southwest Michigan are forever indebted to Carolyn Alford for the good she has done in our community. Her lifelong contributions to students and families throughout the Kalamazoo area have had great impact and will never be forgotten. I wish Carolyn and her family all the best in retirement, and I sincerely hope she enjoys the extra time with her grandchildren.                          ____________________
