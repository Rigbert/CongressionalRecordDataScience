 President, I rise today to recognize Elder E.E. Cleveland, a civic and religious leader for over 50 years with the Seventh-day Adventist Church. A graduate and an eventual professor at Oakwood College in Huntsville, Alabama, Elder Cleveland is a shining example of a man whose devotion to principle and belief can serve to inspire and influence others. In honor of the new Bradford Cleveland Institute for Continuing Education located at Oakwood College, I wanted to take this opportunity to recognize a man who has been a pioneer in religious and community involvement.  After graduating from Oakwood College in 1941, and being ordained in 1946, Elder Cleveland embarked on a remarkable path which has taken him all over the United States, across 6 continents, and 67 countries. He has conducted over 60 public Evangelism campaigns, trained over 1,100 pastors world-wide, and held scores of church revivals. In fact, Elder Cleveland was the first black church leader sent to Asia, Europe, South America and Australia, and has preached to integrated audiences in Cape Town and South Africa. He has authored sixteen published books and two Sabbath School Lesson Quarterlies, and served as a Contributing and Associate Editor to numerous religious journals and publications. In fact, Elder Cleveland was presented with an award by Governor Guy Hunt in 1989, for being the most distinguished Black Clergyman in the State of Alabama.  It can truly be said that Elder Cleveland has touched the lives of many throughout the world. This broad sense of community is demonstrated in his involvement in many areas. Elder Cleveland participated in the First March on Washington in 1957 with Dr. Martin Luther King, and organized the NAACP Chapter for students on the Oakwood College Campus. He also was a member of the Washington, D.C. Branch of the Organizing Committee of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference's ``Poor People's March'' on Washington in 1968. In addition, he has conducted ``Feed the Hungry'' programs in over 20 cities in the U.S. and helped to establish a feeding depot in Washington, DC.  Elder Cleveland remains a great Evangelist, teacher, author, and leader. He has received over 100 awards, honors and citations for his various achievements. Currently, Elder Cleveland lives with his wife, Celia Abney Cleveland, in semi-retirement in Huntsville, Alabama. I would like to take this opportunity to commend Elder Cleveland for his commitment to his moral principles and his unwavering dedication to helping those less fortunate.                          ____________________
