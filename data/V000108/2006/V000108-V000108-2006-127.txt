Speaker, it is with great respect and admiration that I wish to congratulate the members of the East Gary Memorial American Legion Post #100 as they celebrate their 75th Diamond Jubilee Birthday. To commemorate this special occasion, Post #100 will be having an anniversary dinner on Saturday, March 11, 2006 at the Post #100 American Legion Hall in Lake Station, Indiana.  The East Gary Memorial American Legion Post #100 was chartered in 1931. Since its inception, the members of Post #100 have dedicated themselves to the mission of serving veterans and the community. Post #100 members go above and beyond to serve veterans, as evidenced by their continued work with the Indiana Veterans Home in Lafayette, Indiana; the Knightstown Soldiers and Sailors Home in Knightstown, Indiana; and the Hines VA Hospital in Hines, Illinois, where they provide visitation and assistance to veterans in need. In addition, Post #100 has always been very active in various POW/MIA programs. Post #100 has also taken an active role in promoting local public service by sponsoring a law enforcement officer/firefighter/EMT competition, of which present Commander John Wrolen serves as District Chairman and State Co-Chairman.  Currently, Post #100 and its members also support the following youth programs: American Legion Baseball, Boy Scouts of America, Girl Scouts of America, the Special Olympics, and several programs that focus on patriotism and American government. In particular, they are active in Hoosier Boys' and Girls' State, a program that aims to educate high school juniors on the structure of American government and its processes. Post #100 also provides flag etiquette classes for grade-school children and sponsors the Americanism in Government program, as well as oratorical programs. These competitions test the knowledge and public speaking abilities of tenth, eleventh, and twelfth grade students, allowing the winners to advance to compete at district, State, regional, and national levels.  Throughout the past 75 years, American Legion Post #100 has installed 37 commanders, 4 of which have gone on to serve as first district commanders. These men are: Ralph Becktel (1934), Jay Hott (1968), Hank Cook (1992), and John Wrolen (2001). At their 75th anniversary celebration, Post #100 will honor all living past commanders for their service. They are: Robert Pifferitti, Albert Kinsey, Alfred Hanson, Jr., Robert Wilson, John Wrolen, Terry Szostek, Richard Davies, Ronald Blaney, and Evin Eakins. All of these past commanders and district commanders should be honored for their service and dedication to veterans and the community.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating the members of the East Gary Memorial American Legion Post #100 on the 75th anniversary of their noble organization. These giving and selfless individuals continue to dedicate their time and unrelenting efforts to serve local veterans and their community. I am proud to represent them in Congress.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Page E205]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]         TRIBUTE TO EAST GARY MEMORIAL AMERICAN LEGION POST 100                                 ______                                                         HON.
