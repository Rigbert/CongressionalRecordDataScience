Speaker, I rise today in support of the conference report to H.R. 775, the Y2K Act. This bill, while markedly different from when it was first introduced, has retained several key core principles: The establishment of uniform legal standards for all businesses and users of computer-related technologies; the encouragement of alternative dispute resolution to avoid costly and time-consuming lawsuits; the lessening of the burden on interstate commerce by discouraging frivolous lawsuits while preserving the ability of individuals and businesses who have suffered injury to obtain relief.  The year 2000 computer problem, commonly referred to as the Y2K bug, presents grave challenges to both the private and public sectors throughout the United States. H.R. 775 has had a difficult history in Congress. Substantial changes were made during every step of the process, in committees, on the House floor, in the other body, and finally in conference committee in an effort to deal with this pressing issue in a way that is fair and equitable to all parties involved, both potential plaintiffs and defendants in Y2K-related disputes.  The reason we are here today is because of the persistence of the House and the other body to enact legislation far enough in advance of the year 2000 to stem the potential litigation explosion over the Y2K bug, one that has been estimated as costing our economy a potential $1 trillion. Throughout this whole process, the administration has remained cool to the idea of passing any legislation dealing with Y2K liability. In addition, the administration was noticeably absent at every junction of this debate.  The White House was invited to testify before the House Committee on the Judiciary on this legislation but declined. Instead of active participation, the administration chose to issue veto threats to even the amended bipartisan Senate-passed version of the bill with only general descriptions on which provisions they found to be objectionable. In all, the administration sent five veto threats, with the fifth being issued on June 24 by the President's chief of staff just prior to the conferees meeting on that day.  At the first meeting of the House-Senate conference, the House conferees accepted the Senate amendments to H.R. 775 and added two additional amendments. It was at this conference after the train had already left the station that the White House finally got serious and requested additional time to work out a compromise. The chairman of the conference postponed further proceedings until the drop-dead date of June 28 in a good-faith effort to see this bill enacted without the potential of a White House veto. Finally, the administration gave specifics on what they found to be objectionable and suggestions on how to change these provisions in order for the President to support it.  Fortunately, the administration's differences with Congress were resolved, which allows the conference report to be brought to the floor today without the uncertainty of a veto. The conference report has the support of the broad-based Year 2000 Coalition and the Information Technology Industry Council.  The conference report includes the following key provisions which warrant its adoption by the House of Representatives:  It allows class action suits for Y2K claims to be brought into Federal courts if they involve $10 million in claims or at least 100 plaintiffs. It creates a proportionate liability formula for assessing blame so companies would be penalized for their share of any Y2K damage. This formula would make whole individual consumers even if one of the defendants went bankrupt. It caps punitive damages at $250,000, or three times the amount of compensatory damages, whichever is less, for individuals with a net worth of up to $500,000 and for companies with fewer than 50 employees. And it applies current State standards for establishing punitive damages instead of creating a new preemptive Federal standard.  In addition, the conference report requires plaintiffs to mitigate damages, defines the term ``economic loss,'' but does not place caps on directors and officers liability.  In summary, while H.R. 775 has been whittled down by the administration's efforts to accommodate trial lawyers, enough substantial provisions remain to warrant support by the House of Representatives.                              {time}  1445
