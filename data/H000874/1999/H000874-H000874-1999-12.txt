Speaker, almost one year ago today, October 20, 1998, the then-speaker Newt Gingrich came on this House floor and chided the Republican perfectionist caucus. Two disastrous government shutdowns and rhetoric hot enough to heat this building on a cold winter day taught him one thing, government is the art of compromise; but he is not here. That lesson has been lost on today's House leadership. The perfectionist caucus, the crowd that says it is my way or no way, rides on.  The majority whip says the leadership will negotiate with the President on his knees. The Republican leadership rammed an irresponsible tax cut through the House, even though it would suck the Social Security surplus dry, and now they claim they will not spend one dime of that Social Security surplus. They have already dipped into that surplus to the tune of $17 billion and it is going to be well over on their way to spending $30 billion plus.  Let us get real. Let us do the people's business.                          ____________________
