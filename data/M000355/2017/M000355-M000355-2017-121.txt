 President, today the Senate will continue another historic week confirming more of President Trump's impressive judicial nominees to the Federal bench--Steven Grasz, confirmed; Don Willett, confirmed. And soon we will add James Ho to the list by confirming him to serve on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.  He is an exceptionally well-qualified nominee whose career in both public service and the private sector has garnered respect from both sides of the aisle. The former Democratic mayor of Dallas supported his nomination, calling him ``among the most brilliant appellate lawyers in the United States.''  When we vote to confirm Mr. Ho, we will be adding another fair and impartial judge to the Federal bench, and by doing so, the Senate will take another important step to ensure that the Federal judiciary fulfills its proper role in our constitutional system. Each of them will be an asset to our Nation's courts.  Under Chairman Grassley's leadership, the Senate Judiciary Committee has done outstanding work to move these judicial nominees to the floor. I am grateful for his efforts, and I urge all of my colleagues to join me in voting to confirm Mr. Ho soon.                          Funding Our Military  Mr. President, on another matter, our Nation faces a myriad of threats from around the globe, and it is the Senate's responsibility to provide the service chiefs with the resources to train and equip our warfighters and to provide them with the resources they need to keep us safe.  The diverse challenges posed by Iran, China, Russia, North Korea, ISIL, al-Qaida, and its affiliates span the spectrum of warfighting, and our force must be trained and prepared to operate on sea, air, land, and in cyber space. These challenges were only compounded by the Obama administration's focus on reducing the size of our conventional force, withdrawing our forward presence, and placing an unrealistic reliance upon allies and Special Operations forces.  In stark contrast to the previous administration, this Republican-led Congress and the Trump administration have taken the initial steps to rebuild our military. We are working to ensure that the needs of the force are met and our servicemembers have the tools and training necessary to fulfill their missions.  In our ongoing discussions surrounding government funding, we must continue to prioritize our Nation's men and women in uniform. It is illogical for this Senate to repeatedly vote to pass National Defense Authorization Acts at one level of authority and not meet that commitment with the necessary appropriations act; and this funding cannot be held hostage to the Obama-era demand that increases in defense funding be matched by equal increases in nondefense spending. Congress ignored that demand earlier this year, and we must do it again now.  The reason is simple: Under the Budget Control Act, the Department of Defense has received a disproportionate funding cut--and will again if Congress fails to come to an agreement. That type of blow would unacceptably diminish our military's readiness and damage our national security.  I hope that Members can work together to provide the necessary fundsto our military--and to all parts of our government--so that the men and women of our all-volunteer force can continue to keep our country safe.                         Tax Cuts and Jobs Bill  Now, on a final matter, Mr. President, yesterday, Congress moved closer to delivering much-needed tax relief to American families and small businesses as Members of the House and the Senate held a public meeting of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act conference committee. The conferees discussed the best way to provide tax reform to families and small businesses across our country. Throughout this process, we have focused on the middle class and on those left behind by the Obama economy--like many of the families in Kentucky who I represent.  By overhauling our broken and outdated Tax Code, we are working to seize this once-in-a-generation opportunity to grow paychecks, create more jobs, and help our economy reach its full potential. The plan before the conference committee will also end many of the perverse incentives for corporations to ship American jobs overseas. We want to bring those jobs and investments home and keep them here.  Once the committee completes its work to reconcile the differences between each Chamber's bill, every Member of Congress will have the opportunity to cast a vote to provide meaningful tax relief to middle-class Americans. That should be something we all can support. And when Congress does, this bill will go to the President's desk to become law.  I would like to thank every Member who has contributed to making tax reform a reality, following years of hearings and proposals and a multitude of amendments as this legislation proceeded through regular order.  This is a chance to work together to get the economy going again and lift up the families that the Obama Administration's policies left behind. I hope that we can take this opportunity to move beyond partisanship to deliver real tax reform for the middle class. Many of the provisions of this bill are based on ideas that our friends across the aisle used to say they supported. I hope our friends will support them again.  I would like to once again commend the conferees for their work, and I look forward to voting on the committee report soon.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
