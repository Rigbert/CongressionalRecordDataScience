Mr. Chairman, I deeply respect my good friend that has offered this amendment, but I have a couple questions.  One, I have had the privilege of visiting a private company; it has developed a truck stop process whereby the trucks do have the same thing my colleague wants. What I understand his amendment does is he wants to raise the weight of the truck 400 pounds of added equipment to the truck so they do not have to stop at a truck stop. Is that correct?
