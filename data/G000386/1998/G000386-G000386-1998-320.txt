  First, Section 401 would authorize DOD to pay bills without receipts--with no dollar limit.  Second, Section 401 would require only random after-the-fact verification of some receipts.  Third, disbursing officials would be relieved of all responsibility for erroneous or fraudulent payments that could result from this policy.  Mr. President, this is a terrible idea. Section 401 says it's OK to pay bills without receipts. Just do it--$50,000; $500,000; $1 million; $10 million; or $100 million. The sky's the limit. It doesn't matter how big the bill is. Just pay it! And if you make a mistake, that's OK, too. Not to worry.  Nobody can be held accountable for erroneous or fraudulent payments. This proposal could not have come at a worse time. All reports from the General Accounting Office (GAO) and Inspector General (IG) clearly indicate that DOD's internal controls are weak or non-existent.  Not only do weak or non-existent internal controls make for easy embezzlement, they invite it. And it seems like embezzlers are on a rampage. That's the subject of a recent article entitled ``Embezzlement Growth is Dramatic.'' The article was written by Mr. Gary Strauss and appeared on page 1 of USA Today on January 13, 1998.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have this article printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                    [From USA Today, Jan. 13, 1998]                  Embezzlement Growth is ``Dramatic''                           (By Gary Strauss)       Wendell Doman wasn't your typical embezzler. A Mormon and      father of seven, Doman didn't steal from corporate coffers to      fund a wild spending spree, trophy mistress, gambling or drug      addition. Instead, the 37-year-old chief financial officer of      New Age music company Narada Media was thinking long term.       Sure, he spent $37,000 on a BMW he judiciously kept away      from the office. And there was the $243,500 Minneapolis home      to which he moved after quitting Milwaukee-based Narada in      February. But the bulk of the $1.13 million federal      prosecutors say he stole was squirreled in Vanaguard's Growth      and Income stock mutual fund.       It's unclear how many Wendell Domans lurk in the offices of      Corporate America. Only a fraction of embezzlement cases are      reported--the prime reason the Justice Department has      difficulty gauging the white-collar crime that can be among      the most troubling for businesses.       But judging from anecdotal accounts from prosecutors,      insurers and fraud specialists, 1997 may go down as a record      year for corporate embezzlement.       ``There's been a dramatic increase in embezzlement across      the board, everything from small mom-and-pop shops to major      corporations,'' says Chris Franklin, who manages embezzlement      claims for Chubb, a major provider of fidelity insurance,      which covers businesses' embezzlement losses.       High six-figure and low million-dollar thefts such as      Doman's are increasingly common, says Tom Harrington, head of      the FBI's economic crimes squad in the agency's Philadelphia      office. ``I talk to my counterparts all across the country.      The amounts being embezzled are growing.''       The FBI estimates 15,700 workers were arrested for      embezzlement in 1996, up almost 25% since 1993. But the FBI      numbers probably account for just 10% of embezzlers, says      Frank Hagan, a criminology professor at Pennsylvania's      Mercyhurst College and co-author of White Collar Deviance, to      be released next year. ``These numbers aren't accepted by      criminologists because embezzling is grossly under-     reported,'' he says.       Most companies are too embarrassed to report such white-     collar crimes for fear of appearing inept, spurring more      employee theft or angering sharesholders, clients or      customers, says Sharon Parker, who's prosecuted numerous      white-collar crime cases as an assistant U.S. attorney in      Indiana. Nor are companies legally bound to report      embezzlement. Only banks are required to notify authorities.       Yet based on a recent, first-of-its kind survey of 2,600      fraud investigators. U.S. businesses lose more than $400      billion annually to fraud, nearly a third of that from      embezzlement, says Joseph Wells, head of the 20,000-member      Association of Certified Fraud Examiners.       ``This reality is a problem, particularly among mid- and      upper-level managers,'' says Wells, author of Occupational      Fraud and Abuse. Wells cites decentralized operations, mid-     level management layoffs, rising computer use and a booming      economy.       The flourishing cottage industries of fraud investigation,      forensic accounting and white-collar criminal defense law      underscore embezzlement's growth.       ``Business is booming,'' says Howard Silverstone, a      forensic accountant with Lindquist Avey Macdonald      Baskerville, a financial fraud investigator. ``It's up 300%-     400% since the start of the decade. And the cases we hear      about are just the tip of the iceberg. Most of the time, it's      luck that this kind of crime is even discovered.''       Hard statistical evidence aside, embezzlers are getting      more brazen.       At his recent sentencing on federal wire-fraud charges,      Doman contended he was entitled to keep about $206,000, the      earnings on the stolen money in his Vanguard account. U.S.      District Judge Charles Clevert scoffed at Doman's request,      sentenced him to 33 months in prison and ordered him to pay      Narada $1.34 million. Doman, serving time in a federal prison      in Oxford, Wis., could not be reached.       Wednesday, former Los Angeles Times editorial business      manager Charles Boesch was sentenced to four years in prison      federal charges of embezzling almost $780,000 over four      years.       Prosecutors say Boesch, 53, took the money--intended as      payments to freelance writers--over four years by submitting      bogus invoices for payment to accomplices, including his      former son-in-law.                             undone by time       Doman and Boesch's thefts look like chump change compared      to the $12.5 million Francis Vitale Jr. stole from specialty      chemicals maker Engelhard over nine years.       Vitale, Engelhard's former vice president of strategic      development and corporate affairs, used the money to      accumulate one of the world's most extensive collections of      rare and antique clocks. Most of the collection was housed at      his Spring Lake, N.J., antique clock shop. It was auctioned      for $8 million to repay Engelhard's insurer.       At Engelhard, where he earned a six-figure salary and was a      member of the management committee. Vitale was ``extremely      well-respected'' until a routine audit uncovered the thefts,      says corporate spokesman Mark Dresner.       Vitale had sole discretion to approve international      marketing expenses, so he was able to fabricate more than 150      invoices for his clock shop's purchases into bills Engelhard      ``owed'' for expenses. Vitale, 53, is to be sentenced      Thursday.       It's not uncommon for embezzlers to go undetected for      years, largely because managers have few supervisors holding      them accountable, says Silverstone, the forensic accountant.       That's precisely what happened at Day-Lee Foods, a      Japanese-owned meat-exporter in Santa Fe Springs, Calif. In      what may be the largest U.S. embezzlement case ever reported,      Chief Financial Officer Yasuyoshi Kato stole $95 million.       Until the scheme was uncovered by federal tax investigators      in March, Kato stole by issuing company checks to himself for      seven years. He covered the missing funds by securing      corporate loans to Day-Lee from California subsidiaries of      Japanese banks, according to court filings.       Kato, who earned $150,000 a year, had sole control over      Day-Lee's finances. That also enabled him to pay earlier      loans by arranging even more loans.                           doing the cha-cha       Prosecutors contend Kato went through money like water,      buying beachfront condominiums, citrus ranches, even a      nightclub named Club Cha-Cha. Money also went to his ex-wife,      who bought a rare car dealership, jewelry and animal      menagerie that included miniature horses and sharks.       In October, Kato was sentenced to 63 months in prison. Day-     Lee's parent, Nippon Meat Packers, estimates losses,      including interest on the loans at $100 million.       What motivate embezzlers? Usually any one of a number of      vices, although experts paint a portrait of a compulsive,      obsessive person in a position of power.       Insiders at Engelhard joke about Vitale's clock fetish.       Attorneys involved in the Doman case point to a      conservative, tightly wound CPA who was paying nearly a third      of his $75,000 salary to support his ex-wife and children.      Doman also may have felt a sense of entitlement. According to      court records, he felt his bosses had reneged on a purported      offer of a 5% stake in the company before it was to be sold.       Kato's attorney, John Yzurdiaga, says Kato was merely      trying to satisfy his ex-wife's insatiable spending appetite.       But, notes Chubb's Franklin, the pilferer could be anyone.      ``We've seen cases where daughters have ripped off their      father's firms,'' he says. ``You can't trust anybody.''       In virtually all cases, there are systemic problems, such      as lax internal controls, that make it all too easy to steal,      says Bart Schwartz, CEO of fraud investigator Decision      Strategies/Fair-fax International. ``In a booming economy,      everyone's looking at business opportunities. They aren't      looking internally,'' he says. ``That can allow schemes to go      on for years.''       Increasingly, companies are initiating countermeasures.      Barnes & Thornburg, a 200-member South Bend, Ind., legal      firm, formed a white-collar unit a year ago. They've advised      clients to implement compliance programs and improve internal      accounting procedures, such as requiring more than one      employee to sign checks, says unit chief George Horn.       But even Barnes & Thornburg wasn't immune. Longtime partner      Ernest Szarwark was indicted in July for mail fraud. He's      charged with stealing $500,000 over eight years by taking      fees clients paid him and not submitting them to the firm. He      also wrote himself checks from the firm's trust account.                       where there's a will . . .       Ronald TerMeer, on probation after spending 18 months in      prison for embezzling $225,000 from Ohio-based Huntington      National Bank, says even with beefed up controls, greedy      employees will try to circumvent the system.       ``You can probably always find a way to steal. But it      usually takes someone with obsessive, compulsive behavior to      embezzle,'' says TerMeer, the bank's former controller. ``In      my case, it was compulsive gambling and alcohol addiction.''      TerMeer has written a self-published book: From Doing Federal      Time, A Handbook for Businessmen Who are Facing Federal White      Collar Criminal Charges.       Experts fear corporate embezzlement is likely to become      more pervasive and the thefts even greater.       ``Individuals believe they can perpetrate these crimes and      get away with it,'' says Chuck Owens, chief of the FBI's      financial crimes unit. ``Corporate insider fraud will remain      a substantial problem. There's a fairly high greed level out      there.''
