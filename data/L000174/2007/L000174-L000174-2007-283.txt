President, I commend Senator Gregg for his opening statement. I associate myself especially with his comments and concern related to corruption at the World Bank and the U.N. and in our assistance programs in Iraq. We have serious and nonpartisan concerns. These go across the spectrum in this body. We intend to address them. I commend the Senator from New Hampshire for raising them in his statement.  We are trying very much to work out amendments. I hope we can go to third reading.
