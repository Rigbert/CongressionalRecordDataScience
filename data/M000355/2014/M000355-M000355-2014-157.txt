 President, I certainly want to thank my good friend, the chairman of the Finance Committee, for his observation. He is moving in the right direction. As everyone is clearly aware, the issue of not allowing amendments is a highly sensitive matter. The Senate has been changed dramatically in recent years.  The time to have a negotiation over amendments is before cloture is invoked, not after. If there is an indication on the other side that we are willing to have that negotiation, the time to do it is now because our experience postcloture with the ability to offer amendments has not been good, to put it mildly.  So I think the chairman of the Finance Committee is headed in the right direction. The timing is a little off. We would like to have this negotiation over amendments before cloture is invoked on the bill.                          ____________________
