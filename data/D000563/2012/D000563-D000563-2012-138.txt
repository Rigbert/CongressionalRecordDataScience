President, I have listened closely in this debate because it literally affects my career, my life, and the lives of all the Members of the Senate. It is worth a minute or two to understand what we are talking about in the context of history.  It was President Woodrow Wilson who said to the Congress: We want to arm the Merchant Marine of the United States, to put guns on Merchant Marine ships, before we were engaged in World War I, to protect those ships from being destroyed or sunk by the warring parties in World War I. He sent that request to Congress, and it was stopped by one Senator. One Senator in those days could stand up and say: I object. End of story. But President Wilson said: That is an outrage, that one Senator can say that and stop even the consideration of a measure to protect American lives and our Merchant Marines. And he created this firestorm of public opinion. So they created a Senate rule called the cloture rule, and the cloture rule said that if two-thirds of the Senators voted in disagreement with that objector, then the Senate would go to the measure. So what was originally an objection by one Senator, characterized as a filibuster, could be cut off and the Senate could resume its activity and its business by a two-thirds vote.  That was passed by the Senate in 1917, almost 100 years ago. Over the span of time since, there have been some changes in that. In the 1960s, during the civil rights debate, it was decided to reduce that number from two-thirds of the Senate--67 in those days--to 60. So 60 votes were needed in order to successfully file a cloture motion to end the filibuster. It was an interesting exercise but one that happened very rarely. I asked the staff to send me a list of all the cloture motions that were filed to stop filibusters since 1917. In the first 50 years after 1917, there were about 50 cloture motions--50 years, 50 motions, averaged about one a year. What has happened in the most recent years? In the 2007-2008 Congress, there were 139 cloture motions in that 2-year period; the next 2-year period, 2009-2010, 137 cloture motions; and in this current session, 2011-2012, 110. So what used to happen once a year is now happening over 120 times a year on average. What used to be a rare occurrence has become commonplace, and it is destroying this institution.  I am told people across America who have cable television and who have C-SPAN of the Senate are calling the cable operators asking for a refund because nothing is happening on the Senate channel. They are hearing the melodious, mellifluous voice of the great clerk of the Senate reading Senator Akaka's name every once in a while in a quorum call, and they are wondering: Why am I paying a cable TV carrier for this? Why isn't the Senate working? Why aren't they doing something?  It is because we are stuck in a filibuster--time after time after time.  I go home, and I bet the Senator does, too, when he goes home to Delaware, and they say: What about that Jimmy Stewart movie, ``Mr. Smith Goes To Washington''? I saw that movie. Didn't that poor man have to stand at his desk and hold the Senate floor until he crumpled in exhaustion? Why don't we see that anymore?  The honest answer is there was some artistic license in that movie. The more honest answer is we have reached the point now with the filibuster where one Senator can stand and object to what is about to occur in the Senate and stop the Senate from what it is doing for at least 30 hours until there is a vote to resume business.  Let me give two examples in my recent memory of how this played out. It was only a couple of years ago when we were closing a weekly session and a last-minute request was made to extend unemployment benefits to millions of Americans. We thought we had an agreement, Democrats and Republicans. We were ready to leave town.  The junior Senator from Kentucky--not the majority leader, Senator Bunning--stood when this measure came up to extend unemployment benefits and said ``I object.'' By saying ``I object'' he stopped the payment of unemployment benefits to millions of Americans.  At that point I came to the floor and said: Explain it.  He said: I just don't think we should do it.  I said: Shouldn't we just go to a rollcall and you can vote no?  No, I object to it.  And they were about to expire over the weekend.  So I said to the Senator from Kentucky: I am staying on the floor, and I am going to keep renewing the request, and you better stay, too, because when nobody is here to object we are going to extend those unemployment benefits.  Members came to the floor to support me. At one point, late in the evening, the Senator said: It is 10 o'clock. I want to get home and see the University of Kentucky Wildcats basketball game. Why do you keep me here?  It is true. Check the Record.  Another time, a Republican from South Carolina, a Republican Senator, said: I object going to a vote on the Senate floor--forcing us to stay in session through Friday and vote on Saturday morning. This was Thursday night.  I don't disagree with the Senator from Kentucky. There is nothing wrong with our working 6 days a week and working nights too. So we did. We stuck around.  Then came the Saturday vote, and we looked for the objector, and the Senator who objected did not return for the vote. He said he had to stay home, that there was a wedding he had to attend. So the rest of us had to stay and show 60 votes.  One of the rules changes that Senator Reid is proposing would basically eliminate that. Here is what it boils down to: If you think it is important enough to stop the business of the Senate, if you think your objection is sufficiently serious to stop the business of the Senate, park your fanny on the floor of the Senate and object and don't get up and go out to dinner, don't get up and go to a basketball game, and don't go home for a wedding. Stick around and show us how serious youare about this. If it is not worth your time, then it is not worth it for the Senate to stop its action and its business.  The talking filibuster rule says if the majority of the Senators vote to go forward with the debate, but it does not hit the 60-vote level, then if you are the objector, stay on the floor. If it is important enough for you to stop the Senate, stay here or get an ally, a colleague, to stay with you to cover the floor because when you leave we are going to renew the request to go back to that measure. If it is not worth staying on the floor to object, then it is not worth stopping the business of the Senate.  I think that is pretty reasonable. Yes, I would say to the Senator from Kentucky, I would live by that rule in the minority, which would mean I would not object unless it really meant something, unless it were worth my time and the time of the Senate to stop that action.  That is what this is about. How mindless it has been to watch this Senate lurch from one cloture vote to another, from one filibuster to another, 386 times in the last 6 years. What a colossal waste of time and energy and talent.  I am one of those Senators who believes that I came here to debate and vote, even to vote on tough amendments. I think that is part of the job. I often quote a former Congressman and great friend of mine, Mike Synar from Oklahoma, who used to say: If you don't want to fight fires, don't be a firefighter; and if you don't want to vote on controversial issues, don't run for the Senate.  That is what this is about. I agree with him. But for goodness' sake, lurching from one tedious, mind-numbing filibuster to the next is no demonstration of the strength of this Constitution and the value of the Senate.  Yes, we need to change the rules. We need to change the rules so there is more accountability, so that those who would stop the Senate and force a filibuster would at least have the decency and courtesy to stay on the floor and state their case and not believe they can do this in absentia. That is what this is about. I think it is important.  I have a bill called the DREAM Act. Some people have heard of it. I introduced it 11 years ago, I say to the Presiding Officer. I think it is one of the most important things I have ever tried to do. But I have never passed it. I called it two or three times on the floor of the Senate. Every time I got a majority, every time I got a majority, always a bipartisan majority, but it never passed. Why? It was being filibustered. A Republican filibuster required 60 votes. So for 11 years literally millions of young people across the country have had their fate unresolved because of this Senate procedure.  I think at some point a majority of the Senate should speak on this issue and that should decide the law of the land. The House passed it 3 years ago. We should pass it here too. The filibuster has stopped it over and over.  Let me make one more point. I see two of my colleagues on the Senate floor. The Senator from Kentucky came to the floor and talked about the deficit that we face and the issues that challenge us with the fiscal cliff. I see the Senator from Virginia. Senator Warner and I have spent more time together in his office sitting around a bowl of popcorn with some Diet Cokes talking about this deficit and what we can do about it than I can even total. I have no idea of how many hundreds of hours we spent together in a bipartisan meeting, four Democratic Senators, four Republican Senators. We have tried to take the Simpson-Bowles Commission, on which I served, and their basic idea and turn it into an agreement that we can enact into a law to avoid the fiscal cliff.  We have come close. We have not closed the deal, I am sorry to say. We have come close. There is a feeling on both sides, as the Simpson-Bowles Commission said:       Everything should be on the table, revenue, taxes--I can      say taxes; they can't say that on the other side of the      aisle--revenue, taxes. That accounted for 40 percent of      deficit reduction in Simpson-Bowles--40 percent. What we are      talking about is making sure any deficit reduction package      going forward has a substantial portion of revenue and taxes      in it. But we cannot tax the wealthiest people in America and      balance the budget. I know that is true. There have to be      spending cuts. There also have to be changes in entitlement      programs.  I happen to agree with the majority leader. Social Security does not add a penny to the deficit--not one penny. It is a separate trust fund. But it only has about 22 years of life left in it. That is pretty good by Washington standards, but we can do better.  I think many of us agree on a bipartisan basis we should make some small changes in Social Security today to guarantee it will be here for 50 years or 75 years. We can do that, but that is a separate debate. The debate on the fiscal cliff is about entitlement programs.  I watched some of my friends on the left, on the Democratic side, say: Don't touch the entitlement programs. They are ignoring the obvious. Medicare untouched, unchanged, unamended, runs out of money in 12 years. I plan on being around for 12 years. A lot of folks who are seniors do too, and a lot of folks who anticipate retirement expect it to be there beyond 12 years. We have to do something. To say we are not going to touch Medicare is to ignore the obvious.  I don't want to go the Paul Ryan voucher route, voucherizing it, making it so expensive seniors cannot pay for it. But if we do not put our best talents together and make Medicare a program that lasts more than 12 years, we are not meeting our obligation to the offices for which we ran.  The last point: Medicaid. What is Medicaid? Insurance, health insurance for the poor. One out of three children in the State of Illinois, their only health insurance is Medicaid. For more than half of the births in Illinois the prenatal care and well-baby care is all paid for by Medicaid. But that is not the majority of what Medicaid is spent on in my State. Sixty percent is spent on the frail elderly and those with mental and physical disabilities who are in institutional settings and they are broke. They have Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid to keep them alive.  When the Paul Ryan budget suggested cutting 37 percent out of Medicaid, my question to him is, Which group are you going to cut, Paul? The children, the mothers having babies, or the frail elderly?  Yes, we have to look at this program and find ways to save money so it is there when we need it--and we do need it. That needs to be part of this discussion.  I was heartened over the weekend--I will close with this--on a television show with Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina who said publicly: Regardless of this Grover Norquist pledge, my pledge is to the people--I am paraphrasing--my pledge is to the people of America. We are going to solve this problem. We need more on both sides of the aisle to step up in that spirit to avoid this fiscal cliff. We can. With the President's leadership and the cooperation of the Speaker, we can get it done.  For 10 days not much has happened. There has been a big Thanksgiving break, a lot of turkey and stuffing, but now let's get back to business. We are back in session, House and Senate. Let's roll up our sleeves. Let's get it done. We can address this fiscal cliff and set up a plan with the President that is reasonable. We need to do that on a bipartisan basis.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
