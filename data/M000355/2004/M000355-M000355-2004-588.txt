 President, let me say in response to my good friend from Nevada, as he knows full well, we have already voted on this once. We voted on it last year. Having continuing votes on the same subject strikes some Members in the Senate, on this side of the aisle, as not exactly the best way to move forward. But even if it is insisted by the other side that we have repetitious votes on the same issue, I say to my friend from Nevada there will be other authorizing bills coming along shortly after the JOBS bill which will be open to such amendments, and this underlying bill happens to be one I believe Senators on both sides of the aisle think needs to pass. In fact, the imposition of penalties against U.S. companies has already begun--my understanding is March 1.  I think we all understand the need to pass this bill to prevent the escalation of those penalties against U.S. business here in the coming months.  If there were not another opportunity, I say to my good friend from Nevada, to have further repetitious votes on the same issue, I might understand it. But there will be other authorizing bills coming up shortly that will give the other side an opportunity to offer and insist on more votes on the very same subject.  I hope cloture will be invoked. The right of the minority is still there to offer these nongermane or irrelevant amendments on other authorizing bills that will be coming along very shortly.                          ____________________
