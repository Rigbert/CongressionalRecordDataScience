Speaker, it is with great pride and enthusiasm that I take this time to recognize the 2006 Kenwood Elementary School Robotiacs. The team, which competes as part of the FIRST LEGO League (FLL), recently finished in first place for robot design and second place overall at the local competition held in Hammond, Indiana on November 11, 2006. With their success, the Robotiacs have advanced to the State competition, which will be held at Indiana University--Purdue University in Fort Wayne, IN on December 9, 2006.  The FLL is the result of an alliance between For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology, FIRST, and the LEGO Company. The purpose of the FLL is to allow students to be creative and, with the assistance of mentors, solve real-world engineering challenges, develop important life skills, and learn to make positive contributions to society.  Kenwood Elementary School has been no stranger to success in this competition. This is the 4th consecutive year they have won first place awards at the regional level, which includes awards for research and robot design,as well as an overall championship. They advanced each of these years to compete at the State level, each time competing against more than 45 other teams. One of these State competitions resulted in the team being honored with the distinguished Judge's Award.  The 2006 Robotiacs team consists of: Lena Colon, R.J. Groszewski, and Antonio Rosa, all sixth grade students, and two new members, third grade student Christopher Tucker and fifth grade student Connor Westerfield. With this year's theme being centered on nanotechnology, the team was given the task of creating a way to use existing technologies or to create a new product utilizing nanostructures. The result of their research and innovation was a quite impressive roofing system, which produces hydrogen that is compressed, stored, and used in the future by a fuel cell found in a home, thus eliminating the need for dependence on natural gas, oil, and coal. This, which the team is quick to point out, is very different than a solar panel that uses the sun's energy to produce electricity.  The Robotiacs are coached by Mrs. Alicia Madeka, a third grade teacher at Kenwood Elementary School. Mrs. Madeka, who has coached the team for the past 4 years, is a shining example of what it means to be a teacher. She is dedicated to educating tomorrow's leaders, and she encourages these students to realize that through hard work and self-sacrifice, they can make a significant contribution to the future.  Mrs. Madeka and these amazing students are truly an inspiration to their school and the community. The Robotiacs' commitment to furthering their knowledge in math, science, and technology, and then using this knowledge in ways that can benefit society is truly remarkable. The tireless efforts of all involved in such endeavors are a source of pride for the community and the First Congressional District.  I would be remiss if I did not take a moment to offer a word of praise to all of the faculty, administrators, and supporters who play a special role in enriching these young lives with the desire to learn and succeed. Finally, special recognition is due for the parents and guardians of these gifted students. It is clear that these individuals have been raised in an environment where character and work ethic are instilled at an early age, and for that, they are to be commended.  Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride that I congratulate the Kenwood Robotiacs, Mrs. Alicia Madeka, and Principal Mary Beth Nickolaou on their success, and I wish them continued success as they go on to participate in the State competition this weekend. These gifted young students possess the work ethic and dedication that will make them successful leaders and contributing members of society throughout their lives. I hope that the rest of my colleagues will join with me in applauding the Kenwood Robotiacs for their commendable efforts.                          ____________________
