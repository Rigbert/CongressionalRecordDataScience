Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 1218, a bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to issue to the Landusky School District in the State of Montana a patent for the surface and mineral estates of certain lots, totaling 2.06 acres.  Landusky is a small agricultural community in north central Montana. An oversight in the original transfer of land from the Bureau of Land Management did not convey the surface and mineral estates on the two lots that the Landusky Elementary School has now occupied for a lengthy period of time. This legislation corrects that oversight.  Mr. Speaker, S. 1218 was introduced on June 14, 1999, by Senator Burns. A legislative hearing was held where the assistant director of the Bureau of Land Management testified on behalf of the administration in support of the bill with certain amendments.  Today, we take up a bill fully supported by the administration and the other body. The estimated fair market value of the parcels is only $30,300. I urge my colleagues to support it.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
