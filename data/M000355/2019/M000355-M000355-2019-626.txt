  Over there, it seems as though a far-left socialist ideology is increasingly becoming mainstream Democratic Party doctrine, and rather than roll up their sleeves and work with the Republicans and with the White House on proposals that could actually become law, the House continues to promote one dangerous leftwing policy after another.  The Senate has already voted on the Green New Deal, the Democrats' socialist wish list that seeks to outlaw affordable energy and transportation, eliminate the jobs many Americans rely on, and even empower government bureaucrats to redesign families' homes. Needless to say, it didn't do too well. Here in the real world, out of the college campus atmosphere that seems to characterize the House Democrats, the Senate voted it down. I have already discussed the recent House-passed bill that would have cut down on our domestic energy and American energy independence.  We also all know about Medicare for None, which is the plan the Democrats' Presidential candidates are rushing to embrace, that would literally outlaw the existing health insurance 180 million Americans currently get on the job and throw everyone into an untested, one-size-fits-all government plan.  Just last week, Speaker Pelosi expanded on the Democrats' Medicare for None philosophy by introducing a bill to micromanage Americans' medicine and start trying to have Washington, DC, run the prescription drug industry because, if there is anything that has been proven to increase competition and affordability for American families, it is huge, new doses of heavyhanded Washington, DC, interference.  No, we will not let the Democrats take us down the path that embraces the socialist concept of starting to nationalize an industry with people devoted to finding cures and saving lives. The life sciences sector is driving the search for cures to Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis, and countless other diseases that impact millions of Americans.  The Speaker and her caucus may be content to spend their majority passing leftwing messaging bills, but in this Senate, we take the American people's priorities more seriously, and we will stick to getting their business done.                          ____________________
