Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to F/Lt. Joseph P. Zangaro, who is approaching the end of a long and distinguished career in law enforcement. The Battle Creek native began his law enforcement career in 1976 with the Calhoun County Sheriff Department in Marshall, MI as a road patrol deputy. After a brief stint with the Battle Creek Township Police Department, Zangaro entered the 94th Michigan State Police Recruit School. He has served the residents of southwest Michigan with great distinction ever since.  F/Lt. Zangaro's contributions to our community over the last 27 years have been tremendous. From post to post, he consistently received accolades and recognition along the way including. Among the highlights of his storied career include being named Benton Harbor Exchange Club Trooper of the Year in 1985 and in 1994 Zangaro earned a ``Professional Excellence'' award for his part in an armed robbery investigation.  He has been successful keeping drugs away from our children and keeping drunk drivers off the road. Just this year he was on the ground, restoring the peace after the uprising in Benton Harbor.  From overseeing one of biggest undercover drug operations in SWET history dismantling the Rainbow Farms drug operation in Cass County or keeping drunk drivers off the streets, F/Lt. Joseph P. Zangaro contributions to our community have been many, and we are all better off from his service.  Our community is in debt to F/Lt. Joseph P. Zangaro for his 27 years in law enforcement, 25 of which were with the Michigan State Police. I wish him and his family all the best in retirement. He will truly be missed by the folks in southwest Michigan.                          ____________________
