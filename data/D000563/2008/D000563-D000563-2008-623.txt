President, at the risk of asking someone on the Republican side, isn't there such a thing as a motion to strike? Could we not bring this bill up and you could move to strike the provisions you don't like, and we could have a debate on the floor and actually have a vote and actually get this bill moving forward? Isn't that where we were last week when this ground to a halt and nothing has changed? What is wrong with, if you don't like a provision of the bill, moving to strike it? I ask that question through the Chair if any Republican is willing to respond.
