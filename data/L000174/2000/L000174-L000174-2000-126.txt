President, one of the joys in living in a State as small as Vermont is that you get to know where all the treasures are. One such treasure is Villa Tragara in Waterbury Center. My family and I have gone there for so many years and have become friends of Tish and Tony DiRuocco. When my mother was alive, she knew that she could call Tony when the Italians won soccer matches and have someone she could speak with in her native tongue, while they both toasted Italy's victory.  Recently Debbie Salomon, Vermont's foremost chronicler of epicurean delights, wrote about the DiRuocco's Restaurant and I ask that the article from the Free Press be printed in the Record at this point.  The article follows:            [From the Burlington Free Press, Sept. 12, 2000]    Strong Marriage Is Secret Ingredient to Villa Tragara's Success                          (By Debbie Salomon)       Behind every great restaurant chef/owner stands a spouse.      If the spouse is a woman, chances are she'll put on a nice      outfit, slap on some makeup and stand in front taking      reservations, dispatching servers, running credit cards,      remembering names, smoothing ruffled feathers and smiling,      smiling, smiling through aching feet, a throbbing head and      sore back.       That's if the baby sitter shows up.       That's Tish DiRuocco. Tish and Tony DiRuoccco, owners of      Villa Tragara in Waterbury Center, are old-timers in an      industry where almost 75 percent of newcomers fail the first      year. Villa Tragara recently celebrated its 20th anniversary;      in June, Tony was named Restaurateur of the Year by Vermont      Lodging & Restaurant Association.       Should have been ``Restaurateurs . . .''       ``Did you see (the Stanley Tucci film) `Big Night?' Tish      asks. ``Tony's like the chef and the brother is me.''       ``They are a very strong family, a wonderful team,'' says      Joan Simmons of Craftsbury, a 20-year devotee, who celebrates      most family occasions at Villa Tragara, including her      mother's 90th birthday.       Simmons describes their entrance: ``You would have though      Queen Victoria was arriving.''       I thought of Tish as I watched Hadassah Lieberman's rave at      the Democratic National Convention. The motto of these      strong-willed spouse-partners seems to be Stand By Your Man      and Help!       Perhaps Tish and Tony cling so tenaciously to each other      and their business because getting there wasn't half the fun.       They met when 19-year-old Tish, a Montrealer, lived with a      family in Switzerland to improve her French. The small Swiss      town had only one nightspot. Tony--born and educated in      Capri, Italy--was the showy bartender.       ``He threw bottles into the air and caught them.'' Tish      recalls, still misty-eyed at 48. ``I had no money but he made      me the perfect drink at the perfect price.       They fell in love. Tony followed her back to Montreal. They      married in 1976.       Tish's family had a ski house in Vermont. Her dream was to      live here, despite Tony's growing success in cosmopolitan      Montreal. They scoped out the Italian restaurant scene in the      Stowe vicinity and decided a market existed for Tony's      painstakingly elegant (pasta, bread, desserts made in-house)      Northern Italian preparations. They found a charming 1820      farmhouse on Vermont 100 in Waterbury Center, which became      the restaurant. Tish's parents helped financially, but the      complications of non-citizens opening a business in the      United States would fill the phone book.       ``We were young and naive,'' Tish admits.       Add ``fanatically hard-working'' The charming location      proved less than ideal, since vacationers driving north to      Stowe didn't want to drive back for dinner.       ``We had to be creative the first 10 years, until word-of-     mouth got around, ``Tony says.       Finally, the Stowe Montrealers who had adored Tony's      cuisine at home rediscovered him and oh, did he cater to      their tastes. ``They want it special, not off the menu,'' he      says.       ``Tony's so intent on pleasing that he's flexible to a      fault,'' Tish adds.       But bumps along the way, including an exhausting foray into      retail refrigerated pasta that Tish delivered to gourmet      shops between caring for two children and running Villa      Tragara, might have derailed a less-committed couple. The      Stowe restaurant scene was exploding with competition.      Attitudes toward food were changing. ``We were a sinking      ship but we were going down fighting,'' Tish admits. Once,      things got so bad they closed the door and fled to      Martha's Vineyard for a week.       Tony was forced to make changes, to lighten sauces with      vegetable purees, to initiate cabarets, dinner theater, jazz,      a moderately priced tapas menu and early-bird discounts.      Redecoration turned the farmhouse--particularly the mountain-     view solarium--into a lively, informal trattoria. Herbs grow      along the path to the front door; zucchini clog the compost-     enriched garden plot out back.       And, somehow, their marriage has not only survived, but      flourished. How? ``We drop the restaurant when we go home,''      Tish says. ``If we have an argument, it keeps until the next      day.''       Watching them you fee the connection. ``She is my partner,      120 percent,'' Tony affirms, touching Tish's shoulder. They      have led student tours to Italy. They provide food for      Odysesy of the Mind and March of Dimes events. On Christmas,      Tony contributes lasagna (of all things) to a Christmas      dinner at a Waterbury church and donates food to a retirement      home.       No wonder, in March of 1999, Tony was one of 59      restaurateurs worldwide (nine in the U.S.) to receive the      Insegna Del Ristornate Italiano, which honors chiefs who      leave Italy but ``keep the good name alive.''       The award was presented by Italian president Oscar      Scalfaro. The Pope recognized the honorees during a public      audience.       Simmons was happy but not surprised at the recognition.      ``When you walk in that door you feel special. Tony and Tish      are genuinely glad to have your business,'' she says. The      Simmonses drive almost an hour once a month to eat at Villa      Tragara. ``I'm a schoolteacher, not a rich woman, but we      would rather eat at a place we know is good.''       Because, Simmons concludes, ``Anything else is going out to      get some food. This is going out to dinner.''       What a nice story.                          ____________________
