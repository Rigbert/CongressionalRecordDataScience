Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.  I would also like to ask my friend for sure, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith), that I would love to add his name as a cosponsor of our bill because in fact what it does is that it replaces section 110 with a feasibility study, and when and if a feasibility study could be proven that would work, we will be glad to take a look at it, but until then this section 110 will shut down traffic, particularly in the border that I know best, the Canadian-U.S. border. And as I have been a member of the U.S.-Canadian Interparliamentary Group the last number of years, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Houghton), my colleague who spoke in favor of my motion earlier tonight, the gentleman from New York (Mr. LaFalce), a number of other Members, this is the number one issue. We know, our two countries know, that we cannot exist as we do today with the trade opportunities that both countries are having and have this section 110 come into place.                              {time}  1915  Therefore, it needs to be refined in a major way, and that is why we are suggesting it be repealed.  I would also thank my Senator, Spencer Abraham, the leader of this effort in the Senate. He has done a terrific job in making sure that that is passed, as my colleague from New York indicated, five times, I believe, by unanimous vote. My governor, John Engler, has led the effort of the National Governors Association in drafting this strong letter in support of what we are trying to do tonight and has certainly helped the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers and lots of groups around the country that are very interested in this.  At the end of the day here, we are going to be denied a vote on a procedural effort and that is sad, because I do believe that we could win on this issue had we been allowed to have a vote of the full House on this issue that would certainly be bipartisan. Though they have been able to have the vote in the Senate, we have not been able to have the vote in the House. Unless by some chance, as I look to my friend from Kentucky, they do not file today or tomorrow; we would love to have this vote. We have alerted the leadership that this cannot stand, that this has to be resolved, that we need a vote to repeal this. Again, I think our side can win.  I would ask my colleagues to join me in instructing the conferees before they report this bill out to join with us in repealing section 110 and receding to the Senate.
