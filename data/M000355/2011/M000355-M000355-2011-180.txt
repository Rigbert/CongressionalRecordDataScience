 Mr. Jim Moore was born and raised in Laurel County, KY, and takes pride in the many changes he has witnessed over the past 80 years. One of 12 children, Jim grew up on a small farm on McWhorter Road and recalls the tears and triumphs of growing up in Laurel County.  Jim's parents, John and Lillie, provided food from the family farm as well as occasionally peddled on Main Street to make ends meet. Jim's parents set up a booth every year at the Laurel County Fair and sold everything from corn stalks and tobacco to canned goods and bakery products.  Jim, along with his siblings, attended school in a one-room schoolhouse where one teacher taught all subjects to 60-70 students at a time. Jim recalls being expelled from the school on his very first day; Jim's teacher wrote a note to his mother after he deliberately disobeyed the teacher's orders to not leave school grounds. Jim returned to school the next year and began first grade.  Jim also remembers the time when one of the first cars appeared in Laurel County. Jim was in school one afternoon when everyone heard the unfamiliar sound of a car coming down the road. Everyone, including the teacher, ran outside to get a glimpse of it as it drove by. To Jim's surprise, the car was in his driveway when he returned home after school--Jim's Uncle Leslie was the proud owner of the vehicle and had driven it all the way from Oregon. Jim reminisces how his family thought that his uncle was rich because he would make multiple trips to get all 16 members of the family to the Reda movie theater and paid 10 cents per person to get everyone in.  Jim eventually joined the U.S. Army and served for several years before being discharged. Once out of the military, Jim drove a freight truck for 35 years before eventually retiring. Like countless other Kentuckians, Jim cherishes his childhood memories and is very fond of his deep roots in our great Commonwealth.

He was born and raised in Laurel County on a farm on      McWhorter Road. There were 12 children in his family and only      one, besides him, Bill, is still living.       ``We raised most of what we needed on our land,'' he said.      ``People who lived in big cities had to wait in soup lines      two times a day because they didn't have any land to farm.''       His parents peddled what they could at the Laurel County      Fair, which was on south U.S. 25 about where Tincher-Williams      is now.       ``Every year they would set up a booth at the fair,'' Moore      recalled. ``They would take corn stalks, tobacco, canned      goods, and bakery products. Mom got two or three blue ribbons      about every year for her canning.''       Moore's father, John, and mother, Lillie, also peddled on      Main Street.       ``I've seen it when the wagons were lined up and down Main      Street and people sold watermelons, cantaloupes, whatever      they had to sell. Watermelons sold for a nickel, dime or      quarter depending on the size.''       The family also went to the Laurel County Homecoming every      year.       ``One year someone was selling R.C. Cola and dad bought      some bottles for about a nickel each and we would take a      drink and pass it around.''       The Moore children all went to school in a one-room      schoolhouse and one teacher taught all the classes. There      were about 60 or 70 students.       ``I got expelled the first day I went to school,'' Moore      laughed. ``I disobeyed the teacher. The teacher told two of      the guys to go to a neighbor's house and carry buckets of      water to the school. I started to go with them and she told      me not to. I thought, `Who are you to tell me not to go      somewhere.' I went and she wrote a letter to my mom.''       Moore went back to school the next year and started first      grade. He said he was too young the previous year anyway.       Moore said hardly anybody had a car back then.       ``One day at school we saw a car coming down the road,'' he      said. ``All of us, the teacher too, went to the banks along      the road to the schoolhouse to wait on the car. When the car      came by, we were all waving.''       When Moore got home from school, the car was sitting at his      house.       ``It was my dad's brother, Uncle Leslie, and his wife. They      drove that Model A all the way from Oregon. One day he took      us to the movies at the Reda Theater in town. The car had a      rumble seat. There were 16 of us altogether including grandma      and grandpa. I don't know how many trips he took to take us      up there and then going back and getting the rest. He paid 10      cents for each of us to see the movie. We thought he was a      rich guy.''       His father gave up some of his land so that Johnson      Elementary School could be built.       ``He gave the school board 10 acres,'' Moore recalled. ``He      might have gotten $2,000 or $3,000 out of it. I don't know      back then. It was in the corner of the farm. We had a one-     room schoolhouse and a church on McWhorter Road. That was in      the Maplesville district. The school and church were both      called Macedonia. Up the road, they had a Johnson School      there on the corner of Old 80 and Johnson Road before they      built the one on McWhorter.''       There was someone on the school board by the name of      Johnson at the time so that is where the school got its name,      Moore said.       Because Moore's father had 12 children, he was not drafted      into WWII.       ``That's the only way you got out was to have an extra-     large family,'' Moore said.       One day Moore's mother loaded up five of her children and      took them to Dr. H.V. Pennington to have their tonsils taken      out. He had an office above Begley Drug Store, where Pocket      Park is today. They came back home that evening.       ``They didn't want us to eat anything that day, but I      wanted a biscuit and molasses. I cried my eyes out. I thought      they were going to starve me to death.''       ``That amazes me,'' said Mildred, Moore's wife. ``She took      five kids to get their tonsils take out at one time. Can you      imagine taking care of five? One's bad enough.''       ``They put a cloth over my face and then sprinkled ether      over it until you fell asleep,'' Moore said. ``I can still      smell that ether now.''       Moore also recalled there used to be a Poor House in London      at the location of Laurel Heights Home for the Elderly. He      said whole families could stay there, much like the Christian      Shelter for the Homeless on Fourth Street.       Moore remembered the first radio to come into his      neighborhood. His grandfather bought it.       ``It had a dry battery and a wet battery and had a wire      going through the garden to pick up signals. Everyone would      come in on Saturday night and listen to the radio, especially      the Grand Ole Opry. I think it's the oldest radio station in      the nation.''       ``They also had the ring-a-ding telephones,'' he continued.      ``Your ring might be two short, one long, or one long, two      short. Everybody had a different ring. You could pick up the      phone and hear anybody talking. It was a party line.''       When he was 16 or 17, Moore joined the U.S. Army. He stayed      in the army for three or four years and after he was      discharged, he drove a freight truck for 35 years before      retiring.       Moore was married to his first wife, Ethel, for 51 years      before she passed away. Mildred, his second wife, said they      will be married for three years this December. They both had      been widowed for several years when they met at the VFW Club      while going to one of their dances.       Moore said he has had a good life overall, but the best      time is the present.       ``We have running water. No more getting up in the cold      morning and having to build a fire.''                          ____________________
