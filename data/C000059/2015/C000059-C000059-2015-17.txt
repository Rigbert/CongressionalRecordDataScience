Chairman, we have a clear choice before us today. We can continue to listen to those who oppose investing in California's water infrastructure and we can believe we can restrict our way out of this problem, or we can recognize that California's situation today is far worse than it should be precisely because of our failure to build adequate water storage and restore more science and commonsense into our water policies that are operating today.  I encourage all my colleagues to support the Western Water and American Food Security Act so that we can avoid being back here on the House floor during California's next drought having these very same arguments.
