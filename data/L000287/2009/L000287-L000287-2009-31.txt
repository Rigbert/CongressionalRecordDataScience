I yield an additional 1 minute.  Mr. McDERMOTT. Many of our economists, as well as the stock market, believe our economy is now turning the corner to more prosperous days. Helping the unemployed has been a crucial part of the path to that recovery. But millions of jobs will not be restored overnight. We will continue to ensure a real safety net for the jobless Americans, and I expect Congress will continue this work in the fall.                              {time}  1600
