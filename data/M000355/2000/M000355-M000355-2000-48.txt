 President, I would like to make just a few comments about the legislation that is before the Senate.  First, everyone in the Senate supports disclosure by any group that: contributes to a federal candidate, or expressly advocates the election or defeat of a federal candidate. And, I might add that currently every organization set up under section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code that contributes to federal candidates, or expressly advocates the election or defeat of a federal candidate does, in fact, publicly disclose their contributions and expenditures.  So, let's be clear: nearly every 527 organization in America publicly discloses its donors and its expenditures.  Second, the narrow legislation before this body would target a handful of tax-exempt organizations established under section 527 of the tax code that do not make contributions to candidates, or engage in express advocacy, and thus, are not required to publicly disclose contributors or expenditures.  Although these 527 groups are small and few, the constitutional questions are real. The caselaw demonstrates that there are serious questions as to whether the government can require public donor disclosure of groups that are not engaging in express advocacy. In fact, the Supreme Court has rejected public disclosure of membership lists and contributors to issue groups as a violation of the First Amendment in landmark cases like Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 80 (1976) and NAACP v. Alabama, 357 U.S. 449, 462 (1958). And, less than two weeks ago, yet another federal court--the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit--struck down an attempt to regulate groups that do not engage in express advocacy. I would like to have two items printed in the Record that explain in detail the constitutional concerns with this legislation. The first item is a letter from the American Civil Liberties Union, and the second item is testimony by election law expert, James Bopp, Jr., of the James Madison Center for Free Speech. Mr. Bopp's testimony from a Senate Rules Committee hearing this year cites a long string of court decisions striking down this type of regulation over the past quarter century.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the material be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                               American Civil Liberties Union,                                     Washington, DC, June 8, 2000.       Dear Senator: I am writing to communicate the American      Civil Liberties Union's opposition to the McCain Amendment      No. 3214 concerning disclosure by organizations covered by      Section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code.       The American Civil Liberties Union supports certain methods      of disclosure for tax exempt issue organizations and for      organizations that engage in express advocacy. However,      different methods of disclosure are appropriate for express      advocacy groups that are not appropriate for groups that      engage in issue advocacy. It is appropriate to require a 527      group to provide the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) with the      name and address of the organization, the purpose of the      organization and other information that is now required of      other issue advocacy organizations such as 501(c)(4)s,      501(c)(3)s and 501(c)(5)s.       However, it is certainly inappropriate and unconstitutional      to require issue organizations to report donor lists and      membership lists to the IRS, as they would be required to do      under the McCain Amendment. This is not about protecting      secrecy, this is about preserving the rights of all people to      express their opinions on issues without requiring them to      report to the government in order to do so. By participating      in groups that elevate a particular issue, citizens are      exercising their much cherished free speech rights. It would      greatly chill free expression if the IRS or the Federal      Election Commission (FEC) required donor lists of groups that      represent unpopular viewpoints, minority viewpoints or views      that are highly critical of government policies.                        this is not a new issue       Three years after it passed the Federal Election Campaign      Act of 1971, Congress amended the Act to require the      disclosure to the Federal Election Commission of any group or      individual engaged in: any act directed to the public for the      purpose of influencing the outcome of an election, or . . .      [who] publishes or broadcasts to the public any material      referring to a candidate (by name, description, or other      reference . . . setting forth the candidate's position on any      public issue, [the candidate's] voting record, or other      official acts . . . or [is] otherwise designed to influence      individuals to cast their votes for or against such      candidates or to withhold their votes from such candidates.       Such issue advocacy groups would have been required to      disclose to the FEC in the same manner as a political      committee or PAC. They would have to make available every      source of funds that were used in accomplishing such acts.      This unconstitutional regulatory scheme is the template for      the McCain amendment now before you.       The ACLU challenged this provision of the 1974 amendments      as part of the Buckley v. Valeo case. When the challenge came      before the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, the law      was unanimously struck down because it was vague and imposed      an undue burden on groups engaged in activity that is, and      should be, protected by the First Amendment. The DC Circuit      Court ruling stated: to be sure, any discussion of important      public questions can possibly expert some influence     on the outcome of an election . . . But unlike contributions      and expenditures made solely with a view to influencing the      nomination or election of a candidate, issue discussions      unwedded to the cause of a particular candidate hardly      threaten the purity of the elections. Moreover, and very      importantly, such discussions are vital and indispensable to      a free society and an informed electorate. Thus the interest      group engaging in nonpartisan discussions ascends to a high      plane, while the governmental interest in disclosure      correspondingly diminishes.       Because of the Court's unanimous and unambiguous ruling,      the FEC did not even attempt to appeal this aspect of the      courts ruling concerning issue group regulation disclosure,      and that defective section of the Act was allowed to die.       The ACLU urges members of the Senate to vote against      Amendment No. 3214, the McCain Amendment on 527 group      disclosure.           Sincerly,                                                  Laura W. Murphy,                                                         Director.  Testimony of James Bopp, Jr., April 26, 2000, Senate Rules Committeethe reformers' attack on issue advocacy has another front--section 527                       of the internal revenue code       There is another bill that I want to discuss today that is      also part of the unrelenting attack on citizens' ability to      participate in public discourse. Not content with a frontal      assault through the FECA, reformers have turned their      attention to the Internal Revenue Code. HR 4168 proposes to      amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to require that      federal election rules apply to groups formed under Sec. 527      of the Internal Revenue Code.       Before I talk about the specific effects of House      Resolution 4168, some clarifying background information about      Sec. 527 and the FECA is necessary. Section 527 was added to      the Internal Revenue Code in 1974 to resolve long-standing      issues relating to inclusion of political contributions in      the gross income of candidates. Drafters were concerned that      candidates would use their campaign committees to earn      investment income free of tax, and so a tax on investment      earnings became the major limitation on the exemption      available under Sec. 527.       Section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code provides an      exemption from corporate income taxes for political      organizations that are organized primarily to intervene in      political campaigns. Thus, to qualify for the tax exemption,      the organization must be a ``political organization'' that      meets both the organizational and operational tests under      Sec. 527.       A ``political organization'' is a party, committee,      association, fund, or other organization organized primarily      for the purpose of directly or indirectly accepting      contributions or making expenditures for an exempt function      activity. Section 527(e)(1) of the Code defines the term      ``exempt function'' to mean, in relevant part, the function      of influencing or attempting to influence the selection,      nomination, election, or appointment of any individual to any      Federal, State, or local public office or office in a      political organization, or the election of Presidential or      Vice-Presidential electors, whether or not such individual or      electors are selected, nominated, elected or appointed. A      ``political organization'' meets the organizational test if      its articles of incorporation provide that the primary      purpose of the organization is to influence elections. Under      the operational test, a ``political organization'' must      primarily engage in activities that influence elections but      it need not do so exclusively.       The IRS has issued no precedential guidance in this area,      but it has issued private letter rulings which provide an      indication of what constitutes evidence of political      intervention for purposes of Sec. 527. Activities that are      intended to influence, or attempt to influence, the election      of individuals to public office may include encouraging      support among the general public for certain issues, policies      and programs being advocated by candidates and Members of      Congress.       Thus, the IRS has found that expenditures for issue      advocacy could qualify as intervention in a political      campaign within the meaning of Sec. 527(e)(2). Moreover, the      distinction between issue advocacy activities that were      educational within the meaning of Sec.  501(c)(3) and issue      advocacy activities that were not educational and      therefore qualified as Sec. 527(e)(2) expenditures      intended to influence the outcome of elections, was not      based on major differences in the nature of conduct of the      activities. The IRS instead pointed to the targeting of      the activities to particular areas, the timing of them to      coincide with the election, and the selection of issues      based on an agenda. As will be discussed in a moment,      these factors have been rejected by the courts as      irrelevant to any determination of whether an      organization's speech, regardless of its tax status, is      express advocacy.       In a recent private letter ruling to an organization under      Sec. 527, made public on June 25, 1999, the IRS determined      that a wide range of programs qualified as ``exempt      functions'' for a Sec. 527 political organization. The IRS      found a political nexus even though some of the materials to      be distributed, and techniques to be used, resembled issue      advocacy and other materials and techniques often used in the      past by charitable organizations without violating section      501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. However, because the      materials and techniques were designed to serve a primarily      political purpose and would be inextricably linked to the      political process, the political nexus was substantiated.       Of particular interest is the IRS's conclusion that voter      education, which may include dissemination of voter guides      and voting records, grass roots lobbying messages, telephone      banks, public meetings, rallies, media events, and other      forms of direct contact with the public, can be apolitical      intervention when it links issues with candidates. Whether an      organization is participating or intervening, directly or      indirectly, in a political campaign, however, depends, in the      view of the IRS, upon all of the facts and circumstances.      Thus, while voter education may be both factual and      educational, the selective content of the material, and the      manner in which it is presented, is intended to influence      voters to consider particular issues when casting their      ballots. This intent was seen by the evident bias on the      issues, the selection of issues, the language used in      characterizing the issues, and in the format. The targeting      and timing of the distribution was aimed at influencing the      public's judgment about the positions of candidates on issues      at the heart of the organization's legislative agenda. These      activities are partisan in the sense that they are intended      to increase the election prospects of certain candidates and,      therefore, would appear to qualify under Sec. 527(e)(2).       It is the perceived intersection between the Internal      Revenue Code and the FECA that reformers want to regulate.      Section 527 organizations must convince the IRS that they are      organized and operated for the exempt function of influencing      elections as required under Sec.  527(e)(2). However, because      the organization is engaged in only issue advocacy and does      not make contributions to candidates or engage in express      advocacy, the organization is not subject to the FECA.      However, H.R. 4168 would treat them as if they engaged in      such activities and require them to register as PACs under      the FECA.       However, the Supreme Court has made it clear that an      organization cannot be treated as a PAC because it engages in      issue advocacy--which was one of the purposes of the express      advocacy test in the first place. The Supreme Court, in one      of its most oft-quoted footnotes, has provided an      illustrative list of which terms could be ``express words      of advocacy:'' ``vote for,' `elect,' `support,' `cast your      ballot for,' `Smith for Congress,' `vote against,'      `defeat,' `reject.' '' Since the Court's ruling in      Buckley, district and federal courts of appeal have      followed this strict interpretation of the express      advocacy test and have struck down any state or federal      regulation purporting to regulate based on intent or      purpose to influence an election. These courts have      unanimously required express words of advocacy in the      communication itself before government may regulate such      speech.       Furthermore, the organizations ``major purpose'' must be      making contributions and express advocacy communications to      be treated as a PAC. The FECA defines a ``political      committee'' as ``any committee, club, association, or other      group of persons which receives contributions aggregating in      excess of $1,000 during a calendar year or which makes      expenditures aggregating in excess of $1,000 during a      calendar year. In Buckley, the U.S. Supreme Court narrowly      construed this definition, holding that under the FECA's      definition of political committee, an entity is a political      committee only if its major purpose is the nomination or      election of a candidate.       An organization's ``major purpose'' may be evidenced by its      public statements of its purpose or by other means, such as      its expenditures in cash or in kind to or for the benefit of      a particular candidate or candidates. Even if the      organization's major purpose is the election of a federal      candidate(s), the organization does not become a political      committee unless or until it makes expenditures in cash or in      kind to support a person who has decided to become a      candidate for federal office.       Recently, the Fourth Circuit found a definition of      ``political committee,'' that included both entities that      have as a primary or incidental purpose engaging in express      advocacy, and those that merely wish to influence an election      (engage in issue advocacy), as being overbroad and      unconstitutional. The court found that the definition of      ``political committee'' could not encompass groups that      engage only in issue advocacy and groups that only      incidentally engage in express advocacy.       Thus, only an organization that engages primarily in excess      advocacy triggers FECA reporting and disclosure requirements.      Issue advocacy in the context of electoral politics does not      cause an organization to be deemed a political committee.      Merely attempting to influence the result of an election is      not enough. This classic form of issue advocacy, influencing      an election without express words of advocacy, does not cause      an entity to be subject to the reporting and disclosure      requirements of political committees under the FECA. Only      those expenditures that expressly advocate the election or      defeat of a clearly identified candidate do so.       Thus, it is perfectly consistent that an organization may      qualify for exemption under Sec. 527 of the Internal Revenue      Code yet not qualify as a PAC under the FECA. Tax law      provides for exemption from corporate tax and a shield      against disclosure of contributors. Election law mandates      PACs to report all their contributors and expenses, subjects      them to contribution limits, and prohibits     them from receiving corporate or labor union contributions.      These burdens on a PAC cannot be constitutionally applied to      an issue advocacy organization.       Therefore, as discussed above, Sec. 527 casts a wider net      than does the FECA. The FECA bases its requirements on      narrowly defined activities, not on tax status. Thus,      activities deemed political by the Internal Revenue Service,      for purposes of determining tax exempt status, are      not considered ``political'' under the FECA when there is      no express advocacy of the election or defeat of a federal      candidate.       With this background of how the provisions of Sec. 527 and      the FECA work, it is apparent that the reformers are yet      again attempting to regulate citizen participation in the      form of protected issue advocacy. As a result of the IRS's      amorphous definitions of ``social and welfare activities''      and ``political intervention,'' many Sec. 501(c)(4)      organizations are now forced to organize under Sec. 527 for      tax purposes. In fact, the Christian Coalition has filed suit      against the IRS challenging its overbroad interpretation of      what is political intervention which caused it to be denied      its Sec. 501(c)(4) exemption.       House Resolution 4168, however, would require issue      advocacy organizations exempt under Sec. 527 to be treated as      PACs under the FECA. However, it is unconstitutional to      require issue advocacy groups to register as PACs. What the      government may not do directly, it may also not do indirectly      by bootstrapping onto the Internal Revenue Code a requirement      of ``political committee'' registration and reporting      requirements. In other words, Congress may not condition a      tax exempt status on reporting and disclosure requirements of      issue advocacy when it may not constitutionally require in      the first instance.       The fact that issue advocacy groups may engage in      activities which influence an election, or even admit that      their purpose is to influence an election, is totally      irrelevant to the analysis. What is pertinent is whether      these groups engage in any express advocacy. The Buckley      Court left intact, as constitutionally protected, speech that      influences an election.       To make it clear that speech that only influences an      election, but does not contain express words of advocacy, is      completely free from regulation, the Supreme court explicitly      stated this both positively and negatively. First, the Court      stated that ``[s]o long as persons and groups eschew      expenditures that in express terms advocate the election or      defeat of a clearly identified candidate, they are free to      spend as much as they want to promote the candidate and his      views. Second, the Court explained that the FECA did ``not      reach all partisan discussion for it only requires disclosure      of those expenditures that expressly advocate a particular      election result.       Therefore, in order to protect speech, especially speech      that may influence an election, the Court drew a bright-line      so that the speaker would know exactly when he crossed into      regulable territory--the express advocacy realm. Anything on      the other side of the line, speech that may influence an      election, whether intentionally or not, was to be protected      from government regulation so as to promote the free      discussion of issues and candidates. Thus, speech free from      explicit words of advocacy, whether made with the intent to      influence an election or not, is perfectly appropriate and      legitimate.       This is not to say that Congress is completely without      power to lawfully regulate Sec. 527 organizations. The Joint      Committee on Taxation's recommendation that Sec. 527      organizations should be required to disclose tax returns      (except for donor information) would create parity between      Sec. 527 organizations and Sec. 501(c)(3) and Sec. 501(c)(4)      organizations. However, any disclosure that goes beyond the      public disclosure of tax returns violates the constitutional      protection of issue advocacy.  Mr. McCONNELL. The Senate has precious few legislative days this year to finish the important business of the American people, and there is no time for a meaningful debate on campaign finance reform. I think that even my colleagues on the other side would concede that there are not sixty votes on substantive issues like the antiquated hard money limits and the soft money question. In fact, after two weeks of discussions, neither the House nor the Senate could cobble together a majority for broad and meaningful disclosure.  But I do commend Senator Gordon Smith for his efforts to find a reasonable middle ground. His bill, the Tax-Exempt Political Disclosure Act, sought a compromise between the McCain-Lieberman 527-only bill and the broad bill reported out of the House Ways and Means Committee that went so far as to cover tax-exempt social welfare organizations like the AARP, the NAACP, and the Disabled American Veterans.  The Smith bill targeted the key tax-exempt groups in America: labor and business organizations set up under sections 501(c)(5) and (c)(6) of the tax code, like the Chamber of Commerce, the Teamsters and the National Education Association. Recent news stories underscored the need for meaningful disclosure of tax-exempt labor and business organizations. Documents reviewed by the Associated Press demonstrate that the National Education Association has spent millions of tax-exempt dollars to influence elections while simultaneously reporting to the IRS that the organization has spent no money on political activities. This gross reporting disparity has prompted the filing of formal complaints with the IRS and the Federal Election Commission against the NEA. And, I think we all can agree to the obvious: neither the National Education Association nor any labor union will be covered or affected in any way by this legislation. They can continue to spend millions of dollars on political activity with no meaningful disclosure.  Nevertheless, I have chosen to allow this matter to move forward for a vote without offering amendments or extended debate. The Senate needs to focus on the important business of the American people and return to our first priority of ensuring that all of our appropriation bills are passed on time.  I plan to vote against this legislation because I believe that the best and most constitutionally sound solution is to require 527 issue advocacy organizations to file public returns with the IRS similar to those filed by issue advocacy organizations organized under section 501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code. Such public returns would include, among other things: the name and address of the organization, including an electronic mailing address; the purpose of the organization; the names and addresses of officers, highly-compensated employees, members of its Board of Directors, a contact person and a custodian of records; and the name and address of any related entities.  I also would require the Secretary of the Treasury to make this information publicly available on the Internet within 5 business days after receiving the information. However, Mr. President, I would not cross the constitutional line of requiring that the organizations' confidential donor lists be made public.  Again, Mr. President, I think this is an important debate, but respectfully disagree with my colleagues on the constitutional propriety of requiring public disclosure of confidential donor lists for groups that do not contribute to federal candidates or engage in express advocacy.  With that, I yield back the remaining amount of time.
