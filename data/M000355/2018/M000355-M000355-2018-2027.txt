 Funding for the government expires in just a few hours. A bipartisan agreement before us funds our troops at the level requested by the Pentagon. It addresses the opioid crisis, which is extremely big in the Commonwealth of Kentucky and around the country. It funds our veterans and many other shared priorities. The Speaker of the House supports the bill. He is waiting for it to pass the Senate. The President of the United States supports the bill and is waiting to sign it into law.  I understand my friend and colleague from Kentucky does not join with the President in supporting the bill. It is his right, of course, to vote against the bill, but I would argue that it is time to vote.
