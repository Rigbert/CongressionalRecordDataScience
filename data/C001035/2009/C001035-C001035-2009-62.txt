President, today I wish to recognize Camp Agawam boys' summer camp in Raymond, ME, which is celebrating its 90th year on August 14, 2009. Agawam has an exceptional history as one of the Nation's oldest summer camps.  Founded in 1919, Agawam was owned and operated continuously by the Mason family until 1985. Throughout its history, Camp Agawam has provided a unique and exciting summer camp program for boys from Maine and from across the country. The talented staff and counselors at Agawam continue to carry on the Mason family's vision of providing a safe, positive environment for boys to make lifelong friends and foster skills through outdoor recreation and activities.  Agawam has made significant contributions to youth in Maine's local communities. Strongly supported by camp alumni and parents, the camp's Maine Idea program highlights the impressive commitment by Agawam to provide free campership opportunities to Maine boys. This is truly a meaningful investment in Maine's most precious resource--our children.  I congratulate and commend Agawam's talented staff, counselors, council members, camp alumni, parents, and campers on a remarkable 90 years.                          ____________________
