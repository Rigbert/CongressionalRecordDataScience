 President, in 1982, Congress required the Federal Government to find a permanent repository for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel. Now, 20 years later, we are finally taking the necessary action to move ahead with this plan.  Yucca Mountain was recently designated as a suitable site for development as the Nation's permanent repository, with over 24 years of Federal research and scientific evaluation. The Secretary of Energy, after thoroughly examining the relevant scientific and technical materials, concluded that the site is scientifically and technically suitable for construction of a repository. Now, it is up to Congress to ensure that we provide a safe, permanent storage facility.  In this time of heightened terrorist threats, it is absolutely necessary that the Government provide safe and secure permanent storage for our spent nuclear fuel. Currently, spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste is stored at 131 sites in 39 States.  We can no longer afford to continue storing nuclear waste in temporary sites that are too often located near densely populated areas and water supplies. It seems only logical to want to safeguard public health and safety by storing nuclear waste at a site thatwould be highly guarded against any terrorist activity.  Even in my home State of Iowa, spent nuclear fuel from the Duane Arnold plant is stored just outside of Cedar Rapids near the town of Palo. Like too many other facilities in the United States, the plant is being forced to construct temporary storage because of the Federal Government's lack of action on a permanent facility.  And, just 10 miles from the Iowa border, at a plant that ceased operation in 1987, sits 42 tons of nuclear waste in a waterpool that is designed for temporary storage during operation, not permanent storage. It's for these reasons that it is crucial the Senate move forward in designating Yucca Mountain as a permanent storage facility. Storing nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain would protect public safety, health and the Nation's security.  Opponents continue to raise questions concerning the safety of the transportation of this material to Nevada. For over 30 years, there have been 2,700 shipments of spent nuclear fuel without a single release of radioactive material harmful to the public or the environment. It is important to remember that because spent fuel is stored at over 100 temporary sites across the Nation, shipments of spent fuel will cross the country whether or not Yucca Mountain is approved.  Secretary Abraham has assured that the Department of Energy will develop a transportation plan and work with State and tribal governments regarding shipments to Yucca Mountain. Iowa's Governor, Tom Vilsack, has also shared with me his support for designating Yucca Mountain, based on the outstanding record of safely transporting nuclear material. Given Iowa's geographic position across major transportation routes, Governor Vilsack relayed that Iowa has consistently met its responsibilities in this regard.  Lastly, those who oppose the transportation of the waste across the country because it could be a terrorist target have clearly disregarded the fact that spent fuel in secure transit to a permanent repository is far less of a target than the spent fuel scattered across the country at over 100 temporary, stationary sites.  With over 2,000 tons of spent nuclear fuel in Iowa or on it is borders, it's imperative that the Senate take the necessary action today to finally begin the process of developing a permanent repository. To protect our national security, enhance our energy security, and ensure the safety of the public, we must support this resolution and move ahead on this project.  I request that a copy of Governor Vilsack's letter to me dated May 8, 2002, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                    State of Iowa,                                       Office of the Governor,                                          Des Moines, May 8, 2002.     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,     U.S. Senator, Hart Senate Office Bldg., Washington, DC.       I am writing to encourage your support for the recent      decision to go forward with development of Yucca Mountain,      Nevada as a permanent repository for our nation's used      commercial nuclear fuel and defense nuclear fuel and defense      nuclear waste. The State of Nevada has exercised its right to      object to the decision. As a result, it is now your      responsibility, as a member of Congress, to evaluate,      considering the effects on national interest, the decision      and affirm its wisdom.       In 1982 Congress established our nation's policy on      managing used commercial nuclear fuel and defense waste,      i.e., interim storage by commercial reactor operators at      their sites and permanent storage at one or more national,      geologic repositories by the Federal government. Further,      Congress provided for the collection of a fee, levied on      customers of electricity generated by nuclear power plants,      to be paid into the Federal Treasury and appropriated by      Congress for the study and development of a permanent      repository. In 1987, Congress, acting to focus the U.S.      Department of Energy's efforts, instructed the DOE to      exclusively study the site at Yucca Mountain, Nevada.       The DOE acting in accordance with Congress' instructions,      studied the Yucca Mountain site in extensive detail. This      study validated the scientific wisdom that led to focusing on      the Yucca Mountain site in 1987. We should now move on to the      next phase of activities and begin the processes of design,      licensing, construction and operation of a permanent      repository. This is with the full understanding that the      licensing and operation of Yucca Mountain still must      withstand the detailed scrutiny and additional questioning by      the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission which is charged by      law to decide whether or not to issue a license to the DOE      before a single bundle of used nuclear fuel can move to Yucca      Mountain.       Used nuclear fuel is currently stored at commercial reactor      sites within and on the borders of the state of Iowa. While      this storage has been and continues to be accomplished      responsibly, these facilities were never intended as sites      for permanent storage and are operated on the presumption      that the Federal government will go forward with its      responsibility for providing a permanent repository. These      same reactor sites provide nearly 25% of Iowa's electric      energy.       Customers have paid into the federal fund for the purposes      of developing a repository. Study is but a single step      towards the final end of developing a useful facility. With      the completion of that study there is a ``light at the end of      the tunnel'' for those same customers who are bearing the      expense of the interim storage within or on the borders of      our state.       Congress, in 1982, when it enacted the policy of a national      repository, recognized that used nuclear fuel and defense      nuclear waste must be transported to that repository. History      provides us an outstanding record of transportation of      nuclear material. The state of Iowa, with its geographical      position across major transportation routes, has consistently      met its responsibilities in this regard. The same 1982 act      provides for federal support to states to insure that the      safety record of future transportation is equally good, if      not better.       The decision to move forward on Yucca Mountain and the      subsequent objection by Nevada have turned the issue back to      Congress to fulfill the national policy it established in      1982: providing a permanent Federal repository for used      nuclear fuel and defense nuclear waste. Science affirms the      wisdom of Congress' decision in 1987 to focus on Yucca      Mountain. Customers and our nuclear reactor operators have      provided money and interim storage while waiting for a      permanent repository.       It is now time for Congress to stand behind its original      decision and vote to move forward with Yucca Mountain. I ask      for your support on this important issue.           Sincerely,                                                Thomas J. Vilsack,                                                         Governor.
