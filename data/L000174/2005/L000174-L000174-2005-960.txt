President, in the waning days, weeks and months of the 108th Congress, my colleagues on both sides of the aisle were working hard to pass important bipartisan legislation that would have protected America's innovators and artists, made more spectrum available for broadband services, enhanced 911 services, and fixed a technical glitch that was threatening the Universal Service Fund. Unfortunately, others were apparently working just as hard to obstruct these measures. This obstruction was intended only to force the Senate into passing legislation that everyone knew was doomed in the House. It was a flawed plan that was destined to fail. And fail it did, but not before it also prevented enactment of critically important and bipartisan intellectual property legislation.  The Family Entertainment and Copyright Act will go down as a victim of this obstructionism. This was an uncontroversial intellectual property bill that would have protected the rights of those who lead the United States' intellectual property industry. That industry makes the United States the global leader in innovation, and it deserves our support. Protecting these individuals from the theft of their work appeared to mean little to some of my colleagues. A Republican plan to hijack this important legislation, which lasted until the very last moment of the 108th Congress, ensured that it would not pass in time for the House to take it up and pass it. They succeeded in preventing the bicameral passage of the most important intellectual property legislation before the Congress this year. This was wrong.  The Family Entertainment and Copyright Act of 2004 contained important and uncontroversial measures. The ART Act, a bill that passed the Judiciary Committee and then the full Senate by unanimous consent, would have provided new tools in the fight against bootleg copies of movies snatched from the big screen by camcorders smuggled into theaters. And it would have adopted a creative solution developed by the Copyright Office to address the growing problem of piracy of pre-release works. The Film Preservation Act would have helped ensure that the Library of Congress is able to continue its important work in archiving our nation's fading film heritage. Some of America's oldest films--works that document who we were as a people in the beginning of the 20th Century--are literally disintegrating faster than they can be saved. The Preservation of Orphan Works bill would have allowed greater access to certain works in the last years of their copyright term. The Fraudulent Online Identity Sanctions Act would have protected against online trademark infringement by prohibiting the use of fraudulent Internet addresses to commit such infringement. Finally, FECA would have clarified that services allowing home viewers of prerecorded movies to skip objectionable content does not violate the copyright laws. Obstructionism from certain Republicans has ensured that all of these problems are left unresolved by the 108th Congress.  Thankfully, two provisions of this bill were able to pass as stand alone bills. Thanks to the hard work of Senator Biden, the House version of critical anti-counterfeiting legislation passed. Unfortunately, additional language on which Senator Biden worked tirelessly was passed too late for House action. Again, the Republican obstruction was at work and to blame. The Cooperative Research and Technology Enhancement Act also passed both houses, largely because a Senate version had passed earlier in the year, and the Republican obstructionists in the Senate could not subvert that bill.  There is other legislation that has fallen to this ill-conceived plan to hijack popular legislation. The bipartisan Junk Fax bill would have protected both consumers and many industries, by placing reasonable limits on senders of unsolicited faxes. That bill, too, was passed too late for House action on account of the Republican roadblock.  Thankfully, at the last minute, another important and bipartisan piece of legislation was allowed through the roadblock. The telecommunications package contained critically important provisions that will enhance 911 service, allow spectrum reallocation, and preserve the ability of the Universal Service Fund to do its important work. These are not controversial or partisan provisions. E911 will ensure that first responders can provide an essential public service. The spectrum reallocation trust fund will free more space forwireless broadband services. This will help the American economy by promoting jobs and education. The Universal Service Fund provision will fix an accounting glitch that if left unattended will seriously impede the USF as it goes about its critical work. Again, these uncontroversial provisions were held up and almost failed because of this obstructionism.  All of these bills were hijacked and sidetracked, in order to coerce the passage of a bill that everyone knew would not pass the House. I am thankful that the telecommunications legislation was eventually able to pass, but what does it mean that the telecommunications bill became law, while the intellectual property bill is left unfinished? It seems those responsible for this obstruction do not take the needs of America's innovative leaders very seriously. That attitude will undermine the American economy, and threaten America's leadership in the creative industries. So, because of this Republican roadblock, America's innovators and artists will have to struggle through more uncertainty, without the tools they need to defend their rights. That is a shame.                          ____________________
