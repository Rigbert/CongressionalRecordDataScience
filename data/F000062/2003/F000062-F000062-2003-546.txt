 President, as an appropriator, I come to the floor this afternoon to express my opposition to this omnibus appropriations bill.  The $385 billion omnibus appropriations bill cuts almost $10 billion from what the Senate Appropriation Committee approved last year.  On top of these Draconian cuts, the bill before us includes a 2.9 percent across the board cut, to nonmilitary programs, and will affect critical programs such as homeland security, education, and job training.  This bill is a major mistake and represents a short-sided approach to solving our Nation's problems.  What is happening is the administration's effort to starve domestic programs in order to save dollars for a $674 billion tax cut. If this effort is successful, we will see interest rates rise, the deficit balloon, and a 10-year cumulative deficit of $2 to $3 trillion.  Americans don't know it yet, but soon will learn that this bill makes a house of cards out of homeland security, which loses $1 billion which were already requested, authorized, and appropriated.  How many Americans know that this bill will likely cut 1,175 FBI agents, 490 food safety engineers, and 1,600 customs inspectors who are vital if we are to protect our homeland from contraband and those that would do us harm.  How many Americans know that the Head Start cut of $107 million could prevent 2700 youngsters from a Head Start experience, or leave 224,000 needy individuals without the meals provided by WIC, or 230,000 veterans without medical services.  To make matters worse, this bill is being offered at a time when our Nation continues to face significant challenges in protecting homeland security, increasing school achievement, and strengthening our workforce.  Essentially what this bill does is cut the money from a number of critical projects so this body can pass a tax cut of $674 billion, which will lead to a $2 trillion deficit over the next 10 years.  Every day this body is faced with tough choices. But in my decade in the Senate, I believe that this bill represents one of the worst pieces of legislation to pass this Senate.                          ____________________
