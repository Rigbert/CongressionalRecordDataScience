 President, the Senate has considered the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch for many weeks now. We have seen his impressive credentials. We have reviewed his incredible record. We have heard glowing praise on a nearly daily basis from colleagues and students, from judges and newspaper editorials, from Democrats and from Republicans.  Judge Gorsuch is independent, and he is fair. He is beyond qualified, and he will make a stellar addition to the Supreme Court.  Hardly anyone in the legal community seems to argue otherwise, and yet, our Democratic colleagues appear poised to block this incredible nominee with the first successful partisan filibuster in American history. It would be a radical move, something completely unprecedented in the history of our Senate and out of all proportion to the eminently qualified judge who is actually before us. But then again, this isn't really about the nominee anyway.
