Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment. This amendment undoes a carefully crafted compromise that was done during conference with the other body. I want to see a bill passed. Most of the people in this House who voted on this issue want to see a bill passed. I will say very practically that the adoption of the Sherman amendment will make it more difficult for a bill to be passed and signed into law by the President of the United States.  On the merits, there are two reasons why we do not have need to have a change in the venue laws. First of all, title XXVIII, which I referred to during the general debate, gives the district court the opportunity to approve a change of venue to another jurisdiction for the convenience of the parties and the people who have business before the court. This is not a bankruptcy judge that is interested in fees. This is a Federal district judge who is able to order a change in venue. So it is out of the bankruptcy court, and it is into the district court.  The second reason why this amendment is not good policy on the meritsis the fact that there are certain jurisdictions where the bankruptcy courts are overloaded. One of the things that people who file for Chapter 11 or Chapter 13 want to see happen is they want to see their reorganizations to be approved quickly so that they could get out of bankruptcy and thus continue on with their business; and if there is a huge backlog in the court, that is going to be delayed and perhaps delayed an inordinate amount of time before the court can get to approving reorganization plans to get the corporation out of bankruptcy. So I think from a practical standpoint, corporations that want to get to Chapter 11 quickly will not go to the overloaded courts. The current venue statute gives them the flexibility of choosing where they are going to file. It ought to be maintained.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
