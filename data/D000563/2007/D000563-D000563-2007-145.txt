President, I wish to thank Senator Reid and Senator Leahy, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, for bringing Robert Dow up for a vote this morning in the Senate. I enthusiastically support his nomination. If confirmed, he will fill a Federal District Court vacancy in Chicago that has been pending for over a year.  Robert Dow is an outstanding lawyer and an outstanding person. We have a process in Illinois that has worked almost flawlessly for the last 11 years, where we have bipartisan cooperation in screening judicial candidates. We have had the cooperation of the White House and leaders on both sides of the aisle, and we have not run into a problem. Robert Dow is the latest example.  Mr. Dow was recommended for this position by former Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert, the Republican leader in our delegation, with the understanding he faced a veto from myself or Senator Obama if we objected. Having met the man, having reviewed his background, there is no objection. He is an extraordinarily gifted and talented person.  He is a partner at one of Chicago's largest and most prestigious law firms--Mayer Brown--and he has been named as one of the 21 leading lawyers in the United States in the field of telecom, broadcast, and satellite.
