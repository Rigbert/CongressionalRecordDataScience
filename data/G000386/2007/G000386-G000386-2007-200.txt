J. Res. 44, which will renew the import ban we first imposed on Burma in 2003.  The Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act was our response to the reprehensible attack on the National League for Democracy which occurred on May 30, 2003, and the arrest of many NLD officials, including their leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.  I worked with my colleagues, Senator McConnell and Senator Baucus, to develop and pass that legislation. We authorized a ban on imports from Burma, subject to annual renewal by Congress.  As Senator Baucus and I noted after the Senate passed that legislation, the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act contains a guarantee of ongoing congressional oversight. We felt it was important that the Congress revisit the issue of trade sanctions on Burma each year. That way, Congress can consider whether, in light of any changed circumstances, it is appropriate to renew the ban on Burmese imports for another year.  Unfortunately, the situation in Burma has not improved. The human rights record in Burma remains extremely poor. There is a pattern of government policies that suppress liberties. The abuses have been extensive and the trend continues to worsen. There are reportedly over 1,000 political-prisoners in jail. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has spent 11 out the past 18 years under house arrest.  In December 2006, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution expressing its grave concern over human rights violations in Burma. In addition, Burma poses serious risks to peace and security in the region. This is not the time to reward the bad actions of the illegitimate Burmese Government.  We should send a strong signal to the military junta that their ongoing behavior is unacceptable. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of continuing the trade sanctions against Burma for another year.
