 President, because of OMB's involvement, EPA never conducted the planned outreach to warn people about Zonolite. NIOSH's guidance to workers about how to protect themselves was never finalized.  In response to these shocking reports, on January 3, 2003, I wrote to EPA Administrator Whitman and OMB Director Daniels to get some answers.  Mr. Daniels has not yet responded to the allegations that his office blocked the announcement.  Ms. Whitman wrote that she is responding on behalf of OMB. I can only ascribe this to OMB's desire to remain unaccountable and to hide the role it played in these decisions.  Ms. Whitman's response was woefully inadequate. She failed to explain the nature or the substance of OMB's involvement. She also wrote that it is not possible to know how many homes contain vermiculite insulation even though HER OWN AGENCY has estimated it may be between 15 and 35 million homes, schools, and businesses.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Administrator Whitman's letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                U.S. Environmental                                            Protection Agency,                                 Washington, DC, January 16, 2003.     Hon. Patty Murray,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Murray: Thank, you for your letters dated      January 3, 2003, to me and Mitch Daniels, Director of the      Office of Management and Budget (OMB), regarding EPA's      efforts to address asbestos contamination in the town of      Libby, Montana. I am responding for both OMB and the      Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).       I assure you that since my tenure at the Agency, every      action regarding Libby, Montana has been taken with the goal      of protecting the health of Libby residents from further      harm. After visiting with the residents of Libby Montana in      September 2001, I committed to have EPA do everything as      quickly and comprehensively as possible to remove the      multiple sources of asbestos exposure of Libby residents. The      Action Memo signed on May 9, 2002, authorized significant      additional measures in Libby, including the removal of attic      insulation. Cleanup work has proceeded at an aggressive pace      and substantial sources of exposure have already been      removed.       While enclosed are EPA's Office of Solid Waste and      Emergency Response detailed responses to your questions, I      want to make it clear that neither OMB nor any other Federal      agencies directed EPA to take a specific course of action      regarding whether to employ the public health emergency      provision of the Comprehensive Environmental Response and      Liability Act (``CERCLA'', or the Superfund Law). The Agency      made its decision regarding the removal of asbestos      contaminated vermiculite attic insulation from Libby homes in      order to reduce the cumulative exposure to residents as      quickly as possible. EPA based this decision on many factors,      including legal, scientific, and practical considerations.      The Agency concluded that asbestos contaminated vermiculite      insulation found in homes in Libby could be removed without a      public health emergency. Ultimately, EPA chose not to rely      upon CERCLA's health emergency provision, in part, to      minimize the possibility of removal work being delayed by      possible legal challenges to this untested approach, and      instead relied upon more traditional removal authorities.       Additional, I want to clarify that the decision to proceed      with the cleanup in Libby is unrelated to the larger issue of      whether asbestos contaminated vermiculite insulation poses a      risk outside of Libby, Montana. Several questions in your      letter imply that invoking the public health provision in      CERCLA for the situation in Libby would give the Agency      additional authority or impose additional requirements to      inform the public nationwide about the health risks      associated with asbestos contaminated vermiculite attic      insulation. This is not the case. While the experience and      data collected in Libby are important to a larger national      evaluation, the Libby cleanup and the Agency's national      evaluation of the potential risks of asbestos contaminated      attic insulation are on parallel but different tracks.       Again, thank you for your support of EPA's cleanup efforts      in Libby, Montana and your commitment to making sure that      people nationwide are not at risk from asbestos. The Agency      looks forward to working with you and your staff to continue      our mutual goal to protect the health and welfare of the      residents of Libby, Montana, and of the United States. If you      have further questions or concerns, please contact me, or      your staff may contact Betsy Henry in the Office of      Congressional and Intergovernmental Relations at (202) 564-     7222.           Sincerely yours,     Christine Todd Whitman.                                  ____Enclosure: EPA Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response and Office              of Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances Detailed Responses to Senator Patty Murray's Questions on Vermiculite             Attic Insulation and the Libby, Montana Clean-Up     What were EPA's recommendations on formation of a policy to          inform consumers of potential dangers from exposure to          Zonolite insulation?       The Agency's activity in Libby reflects a unique situation      where citizens have been exposed for many years to      widespread, high levels of asbestos contamination, and suffer      unprecedented rates of asbestos related illness. After      extensive consideration of scientific and health-related      information, the Agency concluded that residents in Libby      were a sensitive population, and asbestos exposure which      would otherwise present an acceptable risk to a healthy      population may cause an increase in disease for a highly      impacted community like Libby. EPA decided to remove all      potential sources of exposure to asbestos in Libby, including      asbestos contamination in yards, playgrounds, parks,      industrial sites, the interiors of homes and businesses, and      vermiculite attic insulation.       The Agency's guidance to consumers outside of Libby has      consistently been to manage in place asbestos or asbestos      containing products found in the home. Based on currently      available information and studies the Agency continues to      believe that, absent the unique conditions present at Libby,      vermiculite insulation poses minimal risk if left      undisturbed. If removal of the insulation is desired, the      Agency recommends that this work be done professionally.       To better understand the potential risks of asbestos      contaminated vermiculite attic insulation, EPA's Office of      Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances (OPPTS) initiated      the first phase of a limited study to evaluate the level of      asbestos in vermiculite attic insulation in homes in the      Spring of 2001. The study included six homes in Vermont and      simulations in an enclosure. This preliminary study will be      used to help the Agency design the next phase of a more      comprehensive study and to help determine whether the      Agency's guidance in place for many years--to manage asbestos      contaminated material in place or hire professionals to      conduct removals--is still appropriate or should be revised.      Formal external peer review is finished for the first phase      of the study. The Agency's Office of Research and Development      (ORD), as well as others, are currently reviewing the      preliminary study.       Based on the findings from this study, EPA will revise or      supplement the existing guidance and outreach materials as      necessary, and further inform the public about how best to      manage vermiculite attic insulation.     2. Top what extent were OMB and other federal agencies and          departments involved in the decision whether to declare a          public health emergency in Libby or to notify people          nationwide of the dangers potentially posed by exposure          to Zonolite?       EPA consulted extensively with other federal and state      partners in determining the best course of action to address      all sources of asbestos contamination in Libby. This included      the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the Department of      Health and Human Services, the Center for Disease Control,      the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, U.S.      Geological Survey, Occupational Safety and Health      Administration, the State of Montana, and many others.      These consultations focused on scientific issues      associated with asbestos contaminated vermiculite      exposure, not to discuss public health emergency      declarations. The Agency was also contacted by several      members of Congress who wished to express the depth of      their concern and share their views regarding this matter.      In general, EPA tries to share information and discuss      potential response decisions with interested parties,      especially those with expertise in the area, so it can      make the most informed decision.       After consulting broadly with experts in the field, the      Agency determined a course of action regarding both the      removal of asbestos contaminated vermiculite attic insulation      and the public outreach to be conducted beyond Libby,      Montana. These decisions were made by the Administrator, in      close consultation with the Office of Solid Waste and      Emergency Response, the Office of Enforcement and Compliance      Assurance, the Office of General Counsel, the Office of      Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances, and EPA Region      8.     3. What process did the Administration use in making these          decisions? Specifically what roles did individual          agencies play and who in these agencies was involved in          the process?       EPA's primary focus was on protecting the residents of      Libby by removing the multiple sources of asbestos exposure      as quickly as possible. EPA considered many factors,      including the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution      Contingency Plan. Ultimately, the Agency chose not to rely      upon CERCLA's health emergency provision, in part, to      minimize the possibility of removal work being delayed by      possible legal challenges to this novel approach, and instead      relied upon more traditional removal authorities. EPA      concluded that homes in Libby contained vermiculite attic      insulation that did not constitute a ``product.'' The Agency      therefore could clean up the insulation without addressing      the question of whether it constituted a public health      emergency.       In making its response decisions in Libby, EPA engaged in a      major effort to discuss and consider the issues associated      with its approach to cleaning up asbestos contamination, both      in Libby and at more than 20 contaminated sites out of the      241 domestic vermiculite processing facilities. Although 175      of these sites had processed Libby vermiculite, EPA's      sampling confirmed that contamination only remained at 22      sites. To date, EPA or the responsible parties have cleaned      up or have cleanup underway at 10 of these sites and the      remaining 12 sites are either being addressed or are under      further investigation and response planning. This effort has      been one of the most significant actions ever taken under the      Superfund program, and has involved the participation and      collaboration of a great many people and organizations at the      local, state and federal level.     4. Which outside parties, such as corporations, non-         governmental organizations or associations, did EPA          consult with on these decisions?       During the more than two years in which EPA has been      working on Libby, Agency officials have met with the Libby      community and its Technical Assistance Group, other agencies,      businesses in Libby and international corporations, various      associations, the State and subcommittees of both houses of      the U.S. Congress. Community members, the Vermiculite      Association, and W.R. Grace Corporation have all corresponded      with the Agency to state their opinions or to ask for      information about our work at the site.     5. What was OMB's final recommendation to EPA? What          recommendations, if any, did EPA receive from other          federal agencies and departments?       Neither OMB, nor any other federal agency directed EPA to      use a specific course of action regarding whether to employ      the health emergency provision of CERCLA. As stated      previously, EPA consulted extensively with other federal      partners, including OMB, in determining the best course of      action to address all sources of asbestos contamination.     6. Who ultimately directed EPA not to issue a public health          emergency in Libby last spring nor to proactively notify          the public in a proper manner?       No one directed the Agency. The decision was made by EPA.      After searching broadly for input from the many agencies      within the Executive Branch with expertise to inform our      thinking, the Agency decided to perform the cleanup under      traditional Superfund program removal authorities.      Furthermore, regarding outreach on the Libby decision, the      Agency has conducted many public meetings concerning the      Libby cleanup, and testified before Congress in July, 2001.      Since the Agency's first removal actions, the On-Scene      Coordinator in Libby has been in regular contact with the      citizens of Libby discussing the progress of the cleanup and      communicating about the issues of the vermiculite attic      insulation. The Administrator also spoke extensively on      issues concerning vermiculite contamination during her visit      to Libby, Montana in September of 2001.     7. What are EPA's most current estimates of how many homes,          businesses and schools still contain Zonolite? How did          EPA derive these numbers?       Over the years several attempts have been made to estimate      the number of homes that may contain vermiculite attic      insulation. While numbers have been included in at least one      study conducted for the Agency in 1985, the Agency does not      believe that these estimates are reliable. EPA recently again      tried to estimate the number of homes, businesses and schools      that may still contain vermiculite attic insulation but again      determined that this task was virtually impossible to      complete because there is little information about how many      homes contain vermiculite insulation (outside of Libby) as      well as little data about what happens to homes after they      are built. Any numbers derived from such an effort would be      inaccurate and misleading.       In the Libby valley, the Agency is identifying which homes      contain asbestos contaminated vermiculite insulation in the      attic and wall space by visually inspecting homes. The good      news is that EPA is finding vermiculite insulation in fewer      homes than the Agency anticipated in this region.
