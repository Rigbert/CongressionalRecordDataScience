Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of Ukrainian independence. Twenty years ago Ukraine succeeded from the Soviet Union and on August 24, 1991 asserted its independence. For the first time since 1921, Ukraine was once again free. The Western world and in particular the United States welcomed Ukraine's sovereignty and its pursuit of democratic ideals.  Ukraine as a new nation has achieved much in the short time. Ukrainians enjoy the ability to share with the world their language, culture, history, and heritage without fear of persecution. During the Orange Revolution of 2004 the world saw Ukrainians united to uphold the sacred belief that in a democracy the will of the people must be fulfilled.  As we look back, we must remember that the path to democracy faces difficulties. Ukraine still struggles with its past, both inside and outside its borders. Legacies of the Soviet Union can still be seen in Ukrainian politics today. Political opponents have been intimidated and journalists harassed. Ukraine struggles to maintain civil liberties and the national identity of Ukraine has been endangered. Russia continually attempts to subjugate Ukraine by threatening Ukrainian territorial integrity, attempting to create Ukrainian reliance on Russian energy, and threatens Ukraine's pro-European ambitions. There are many challenges in democratization, but with the will of the Ukrainian people and the support of the world they can be realized.  On this twenty-year anniversary of independence I would like to offer my best wishes to all Ukrainians around the world who join us in celebrating this great milestone. It is important that we all reaffirm our strong commitment to Ukraine's independence as well as our tireless efforts to help democracy live strong in Ukraine.                          ____________________
