This is a chart showing U.S. imports of oil since 1973, where America is more vulnerable in every succeeding decade. We know that if gas prices in this country go over $4 a gallon, we go into deep recession.  We live at the edge every year, and we've seen what happens. So I repeat what I've said in prior debates today: either you live in the past or you attempt to live in the future and build a future.  I think that the gentleman's amendment, though it might be well intentioned, is moving America backwards. We simply have to address the fact that we are not energy independent as a country, and the renewable energy accounts are part of that future. We must embrace it. We must move our Nation away from complete dependence on foreign sources of energy and stand on our own two feet here at home.  I oppose the gentleman's amendment, ask my colleagues to do the same, and I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Broun).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it.
