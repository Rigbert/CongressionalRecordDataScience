 Ultimately I will not object, either. But both of us believe that we have put together a proposal that should have been the base bill. I think I can speak for the Senator from Texas and myself: We have some direction from the administration now as to what kind of legislation they might ultimately sign. I have in my hand a letter addressed to the Republican leader, signed by the Secretary of the Treasury, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Director of the National Economic Council, and the Council of Economic Advisers indicating that a bill that makes the victims of terrorist attacks a subject of punitive damages and that opens up this whole area for further predatory lawsuits will not be signed by the President. They will recommend to the President a veto.  I share the view of the Senator from Texas that the amendments to this bill certainly ought to be germane to the subject. The amendments that this Senator is going to offer will certainly be germane to the subject. Just so everybody will know what the Senator from Texas and I had put together, what we thought would be the best way to go as the best bill that will be available to everyone, I ask unanimous consent to have two things printed in the Record: First, the letter signed by the Secretary of the Treasury, dated June 10.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                   Department of the Treasury,                                    Washington, DC, June 10, 2002.     Hon. Trent Lott,     Senate Republican Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Lott: The War on Terrorism must be fought on      many fronts. From an economic perspective, we must minimize      the risks and consequences associated with potential acts of      terror. No measure is more important to mitigating the      economic effects of terrorist events than the passage of      terrorism insurance legislation.       Last November 1, the Administration publicly agreed to      bipartisan legislation negotiated with Chairman Sarbanes,      Chairman Dodd, Senator Gramm and Senator Enzi. While the      House of Representatives quickly responded to this urgent      need by passing appropriate legislation, the Senate did not      act and has not passed any form of terrorism legislation in      the intervening seven months.       The absence of federal legislation is having a palpable and      severe effect on our economy and is costing America's workers      their jobs. In the first quarter of this year, commercial      real estate construction was down 20 percent. The disruption      of terrorism coverage makes it more difficult to operate,      acquire, or refinance property, leading to diminished bank      lending for new construction projects and lower asset values      for existing properties. The Bond Market Association has said      that more than $7 billion worth of commercial real estate      activity has been suspended or cancelled due to the lack of      such insurance. Last week, Moody's Investors Service      announced that 14 commercial mortgage-backed transactions      could be downgraded due to a lack of such insurance.       Without such insurance, the economic impact of another      terrorist attack would be much larger, including major      bankruptcies, layoffs and loan defaults. While we are doing      everything we can to stop another attack, we should minimize      the widespread economic damage to our economy should such an      event occur.       One important issue for the availability of terrorism      insurance is the risk of unfair or excessive litigation      against American companies following an attack. Many for-     profit and charitable entities have been unable to obtain      affordable and adequate insurance, in part because of the      risk that they will be unfairly sued for the acts of      international terrorists.       To address this risk at least two important provisions are      essential. First, provisions for an exclusive federal cause      of action and consolidation of all cases arising out of      terrorist attacks, like those included in the Air      Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act, are      necessary to provide for reasonable and expeditious      litigation.       Second, the victims of terrorism should not have to pay      punitive damages. Punitive damages are designed to punish      criminal or near-criminal wrongdoing. Of course such      sanctions are appropriate for terrorists. But American      companies that are attacked by terrorists should not be      subject to predatory lawsuits. The availability of punitive      damages in terrorism cases would result in inequitable relief      for injured parties, threaten bankruptcies for American      companies and a loss of jobs for American workers.       It is also clear that the potential for massive damages      imposed on companies that suffer from acts of terror would      endanger our economic recovery from a terrorist attack.      Indeed, the added risks and legal uncertainty hanging over      the economy as a result of last September 11th are major      factors inhibiting a business willingness to invest and to      create jobs. It makes little economic sense to pass a      terrorism insurance bill that leaves our economy exposed to      such inappropriate and needless legal uncertainty.       The bipartisan public agreement reached between the      Administration and Chairman Sarbanes, Chairman Dodd, Senator      Gramm and Senator Enzi last fall provided these minimum      safeguards. We would recommend that the President not sign      any legislation that leaves the American economy and victims      of terrorist acts subject to predatory lawsuits and punitive      damages.       The American people and our economy have waited seven      months since our public agreement on legislation. The process      must move forward. Prompt action by the Senate on this      vitally important legislation is needed now.           Sincerely,     Paul H. O'Neill,       Secretary of the Treasury.     Mitchell E. Daniels,       Director, Office of Management and Budget.     Lawrence Lindsey,       Director, National Economic Council.     R. Glenn Hubbard,       Director, Council of Economic Advisors.  Mr. McCONNELL. We would like also to include the bill that Senator Gramm and I had hoped would be the base bill that we took up, one that we are confident the President would have embraced and signed. I ask unanimous consent that be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. --       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Terrorism Risk Insurance Act      of 2002''.     SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--       (1) property and casualty insurance firms are important      financial institutions, the products of which allow      mutualization of risk and the efficient use of financial      resources and enhance the ability of the economy to maintain      stability, while responding to a variety of economic,      political, environmental, and other risks with a minimum of      disruption;       (2) the ability of businesses and individuals to obtain      property and casualty insurance at reasonable and predictable      prices, in order to spread the risk of both routine and      catastrophic loss, is critical to economic growth, urban      development, and the construction and maintenance of public      and private housing, as well as to the promotion of United      States exports and foreign trade in an increasingly      interconnected world;       (3) the ability of the insurance industry to cover the      unprecedented financial risks presented by potential acts of      terrorism in the United States can be a major factor in the      recovery from terrorist attacks, while maintaining the      stability of the economy;       (4) widespread financial market uncertainties have arisen      following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001,      including the absence of information from which financial      institutions can make statistically valid estimates of the      probability and costs of future terrorist events, and      therefore the size, finding, and allocation of the risk of      loss caused by such acts of terrorism;       (5) a decision by property and casualty insurers to deal      with such uncertainties, either by terminating property and      casualty coverage for losses arising form terrorist events,      or by radically escalating premium coverage to compensate for      risks of loss that are not readily predictable, could      seriously hamper ongoing and planned construction, property      acquisition, and other business projects, generate a dramatic      increase in rents, and otherwise suppress economic activity      and       (6) the United States Government should provide temporary      financial compensation to insured parties, contributing to      the stabilization of the United States economy in a time of      national crisis, while the financial services industry      develops the systems, mechanisms, products, and programs      necessary to create a viable financial services market for      private terrorism risk insurance.       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to establish a      temporary Federal program that provides for a transparent      system of shared public and private compensation for insured      losses resulting from acts of terrorism, in order to--       (1) protect consumers by addressing market disruptions and      ensure the continued widespread availability and      affordability of property and casualty insurance for      terrorism risk; and       (2) allow for a transitional period for the private markets      to stabilize, resume pricing of such insurance and build      capacity to absorb any future losses, while preserving State      insurance regulation and consumer protections.

(C) Pro rata share.--If, during the period described in      subparagraph (A) (or during the period described in      subparagraph (B), if the Program is extended in accordance      with section 6), the aggregate insured losses for that period      exceed $10,000,000,000, the Secretary shall determine the pro      rata share for each participating insurance company of the      Federal share of compensation for insured losses calculated      under subparagraph (A).

(6) In-force reinsurance agreements.--For policies covered      by reinsurance contracts in force on the date of enactment of      this Act, until the in-force reinsurance contract is renewed,      amended, or has reached its 1-year anniversary date, any      Federal share of compensation due to a participating      insurance company for insured losses during the effective      period of the Program shall be shared--       (A) with all reinsurance companies to which the      participating insurance company has ceded some share of the      insured loss pursuant to an in-force reinsurance contract;      and       (B) in a manner that distributes the Federal share of      compensation for insured losses between the participating      insurance company and the reinsurance company or companies in      the same proportion as the insured losses would have been      distributed if the Program did not exist.     SEC. 5. GENERAL AUTHORITY AND ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.

TERMINATION OF PROGRAM; DISCRETIONARY EXTENSION.       (a) Termination of Program.--       (1)  In general.--The Program shall terminate at midnight      on December 31, 2003, unless the Secretary--       (A) determines, after considering the report and finding      required by this section, that the program should be extended      for one additional year, until midnight on December 31, 2004;      and       (B) promptly notifies the Congress of such determination      and the reasons therefor.       (2) Determination final.--The determination of the      Secretary under paragraph (2) shall be final, and shall not      be subject to judicial review.       (3) Termination after extension.--If the program is      extended under paragraph (1), the Program shall terminate at      midnight on December 31, 2004.       (b) Report to Congress.--Not later than 9 months after the      date of enactment of this Act the Secretary shall submit a      report to Congress--       (1) regarding--       (A) the availability of insurance coverage for acts of      terrorism;       (B) the affordability of such coverage, including the      effect of such coverage on premiums; and       (C) the capacity of the insurance industry to absorb future      losses resulting from acts of terrorism, taking into account      the profitability of the insurance industry; and       (2) that considers--       (A) the impact of the program on each of the factors      described in paragraph (1); and       (B) the probable impact on such factors and on the United      States economy if the Program terminates at midnight on      December 31, 2003.       (c) Finding Required.--A determination under subsection (a)      to extend the program shall be based on a finding by the      Secretary that--       (1) widespread market uncertainties continue to disrupt the      ability of insurance companies to price insurance coverage      for losses resulting from acts of terrorism, thereby      resulting in the continuing unavailability of affordable      insurance for consumers; and       (2) extending the program for an additional year would      likely encourage economic stabilization and facilitate a      transition to a viable market for private terrorism risk      insurance.       (d) Continuing Authority to Pay or Adjust Compensation.--     following the termination of the Program under subsection      (a), the Secretary may take such actions as may be necessary      to ensure payment, reimbursement, or adjustment of      compensation for insured losses arising out of any act of      terrorism occurring during the period in which the Program      was in effect under this Act, in accordance with the      provisions of section 4 and regulations promulgated      thereunder.       (e) Repeal; Savings Clause.--This act is repealed at      midnight on the final termination date of the Program under      section (a), except that such repeal shall not be construed--       (1) to prevent the Secretary from taking, or causing to be      taken, such actions under subsection (d) of this section and      sections 4(e)(4), 4(e)(5), 5(a)(1), 5(c), and (e) (as in      effect on the day before the date of such repeal), and      applicable regulations promulgated thereunder, during any      period in which the authority of the Secretary under      subsection (d) of this section is in effect; or       (2) to prevent the availability of funding under section      9(b) during any period in which authority of the Secretary      under subsection (d) of this section is in effect.       (f) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress      that he Secretary should make any determination under      subsection (a) in sufficient time to enable participating      insurance companies to include coverage for acts of terrorism      in their policies for 2004.       (g) Study and Report on Scope of the Program.--       (1) Study.--The Secretary, after consultation with the      NAIC, representatives of the     insurance industry, and other experts in the insurance field,      shall conduct a study of the potential effects of acts of      terrorism on the availability of life insurance and other      lines of insurance coverage.

(2) Reports forwarded.--The NAIC shall promptly forward      copies of each report submitted under paragraph (1) to the      Secretary, the Secretary of commerce, the Chairman of the      Federal trade Commission, and the Comptroller General of the      United States.       (3) Agency report to congress.--       (A) In general.--The Secretary, the Secretary of Commerce      and the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission shall submit      joint reports to Congress and the Comptroller General of the      United States summarizing and evaluating the reports forward      under paragraph (2).       (B) Timing.--The reports required under subparagraph (A)      shall be submitted--       (i) 9 months after the date of enactment of this Act; and       (ii) 12 months after the date of submission of the first      report under clause (i).

(b) Payment Authority.--This Act constitutes payment      authority in advance of appropriation Acts, and represents      the obligation of the Federal Government to provide for the      Federal share of compensation for insured losses under the      Program.
