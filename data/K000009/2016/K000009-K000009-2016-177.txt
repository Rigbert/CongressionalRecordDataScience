Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the life of Anne Molnar, who passed from this life on Thursday, August 11, 2016 in her adopted home town of Lorain, Ohio. Anne was a dynamo and her spirit remains so.  I came to know Anne well in the Fall of 2012. An elected leader in Lorain, she proved an able guide in what was then a new part of Ohio's 9th District. Together, we shared a vision to make life better for the people of Lorain, with special attention to its senior citizens. In all the time I have known her, Anne was a good friend to me and to the people of Lorain.  Anne Bokulic was born May 30, 1926 in McKeesport, Pennsylvania. She was a graduate of the Morton School of Nursing in Pennsylvania and moved to Lorain, Ohio in 1947. She pursued her career as a staff nurse at Amherst Hospital, retiring after 44 years of service.  Having practiced public service as a nurse, after retiring Anne began her new career as an elected official. She served on Lorain City Council in her later years, four terms as Ward 6 Council Member from 1998 to 2005 and again as an at large member for three terms from 2008 through 2013. Her tenure was marked by careful attention to the needs of people at both ends of life: older adults and children. She passionately and deeply cared for both, even while ably serving all of Lorain's citizens.  In addition to her nursing and political careers, Anne was dedicated to a number of organizations meeting the needs of the community's most vulnerable people. She offered her services as a Guardian Ad Litem for children and Voices for Children, speaking up for children involved in the court system. She was a member of the Retired Senior Volunteer Program and the Lorain Citizens League. She served as a member of the Northeast Ohio Areawide Coordinating Agency and the People's Coalition for Better Housing. For a decade she was a member of the Lorain Mayor's Citizens Participation Committee. She served as Treasurer for several school levies. In 1992 Anne was honored to serve as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention.  Anne was a member of St. Vincent de Paul Catholic Church in Elyria and St. Frances Xavier Cabrini Church in Lorain. Croatian-American by heritage, Anne was proud of her ancestry and continued its traditions and language through her life. Many a fine meal was shared at her hospitable table.  Always gracious and grandmotherly, nonetheless Anne Molnar fought the good fight for her constituents. A mentor and friend to many, she was always interested in leading new people to public service and working in collaboration with colleagues. Anne Molnar leaves a long legacy of service in her community. Her spirit and perseverance brought a measure of stability and hope to the people she served and she never gave up in pursuing what she knew was right.  Anne Molnar was one of a kind. She was an endless dynamo for her family and community. She never stopped giving or advocating, even in the most nettlesome situations. Anne leaves to cherish her memory her children Michael, Joseph, Robert and Lisa, nine grandchildren and three great-grandchildren, her sister Mary and brother Peter, nieces, nephews and countless friends. We wish for her loved ones peace and some small measure of comfort in remembering this remarkable woman and the gift of her life.                          ____________________
