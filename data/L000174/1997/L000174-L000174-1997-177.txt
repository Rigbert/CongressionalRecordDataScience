President, I also want to compliment Robin Cleveland and Will Smith of the committee staff and Billy Piper of Senator McConnell's staff, and, of course, as he has already mentioned, Tim Rieser of my staff, who has done so much on this, Emily East from the appropriations staff; Lesley Carson, who is a Javits scholar with the appropriations subcommittee; Dick D'Amato, a long-time member of the appropriations staff, and John Rosenwasser from the Budget Committee. There is an awful lot that goes on among staff to make this possible. We do not have the expertise of the staff. We cannot move a bill this quickly no matter how hard we Senators may try, and I commend the staff on both sides of the aisle in this case.
