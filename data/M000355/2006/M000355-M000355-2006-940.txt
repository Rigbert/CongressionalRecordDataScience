 President, in spite of unprecedented shocks to oureconomy, terrorist attacks, corporate accounting scandals, rising energy prices, and natural disasters, our economy is incredibly strong. It is not an accident that our economy is so strong; it is a byproduct of policies proposed by President Bush and the Republican Congress that encourage Americans to work hard, keep more of their own money, and invest in the economy.  Let's look at the facts. One of the most important components of this Tax Increase Prevention Act that Congress initially passed in May of 2003 was the tax relief on capital gains and dividends. Since enactment of that important tax-reduction measure back in 2003, we have seen absolutely remarkable economic growth and job creation. More Americans are working than ever before, the economy has created over 5.2 million jobs since August of 2003, and we have witnessed 32 straight months of job growth.  Take a look at this chart. It is no accident.
