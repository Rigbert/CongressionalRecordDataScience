 I have also worked hard on helping to encourage collaboration between the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Department of Education to ensure the best services possible for homeless youth. Is it the Senators' intent that the Department of Housing and Urban Development should do everything in its power to coordinate with the Department of Education on serving homeless youth, and to ensure that no lapse in services under the Education of Homeless Children and Youths program occurs for students as any new HEARTH Act definition of homelessness is implemented?
