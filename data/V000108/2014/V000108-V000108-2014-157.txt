Speaker, it is with great respect that I recognize Saint Sava Serbian Orthodox Church as the congregation joins together in celebration of the church's 100th anniversary. The parishioners, along with Parish Priest, Reverend Father Marko Matic, and Parish President, Mr. Mike Ajder, will be commemorating this momentous occasion with a special 3-day celebration taking place from November 21 through November 23, 2014. The event will honor all who have contributed to the success of Saint Sava Serbian Orthodox Church.   Founded in Gary, Indiana, Saint Sava Serbian Orthodox Church is now located in Merrillville and is one of the oldest churches in the Midwest. In 1914, the church's founders declared their mission before the Secretary of the State in Indianapolis: ``The purpose of this parish is to preach the Word of God (the Lord Jesus) and take spiritual care of its members; to spread goodness, justice, brotherly love and respect among its members.''   In 1914, Saint Sava's first church-school congregation was organized. It was named after Saint Sava, the first Archbishop of the Serbian Church. The church was built on 20th Avenue and Connecticut Street in Gary. After a devastating fire in 1978, Saint Sava relocated to their previously built chapel and parish hall located in Hobart, where the congregation held services until 1991. Very Reverend Father Jovan Todorovich led committed efforts in the construction of their current place of worship in Merrillville, which was completed in May of 1991. Today, the parishioners and church leaders gather together in this magnificent building to worship, celebrate, and continue the mission of the founding fathers.   Saint Sava Serbian Orthodox Church continues to touch the lives of countless individuals through its compassionate service and charitable work. Most recently, parishioners and church leaders participated in a relief effort to raise funds and collect needed supplies to help the victims in Serbia and surrounding communities recover from devastating floods. In addition, the members of this parish continue to preserve the traditions of the Serbian culture and the Orthodox faith through the church's historical society.   Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring and congratulating Saint Sava Serbian Orthodox Church in Merrillville, Indiana on its 100th anniversary. The members and church leaders have dedicated themselves to upholding Serbian heritage, tradition, and the Orthodox faith. For their noteworthy commitment to serving so many in need, the congregation is worthy of the highest praise.                          ____________________
