Speaker, the Senate on a voice vote yesterday, kind of pathetic, voted to borrow $87 billion from the American people for the conflict in Iraq. A substantial portion of that is to go to rebuild, or build, not rebuild, build the infrastructure of Iraq. As the gentlewoman from Ohio said, some of it is going to pay Iraqis for make-work or no-show jobs when we cannot get unemployment benefits for Americans here. If we took that money and we divided it up, there are 435 of us here in the House of Representatives, and we divided it up among our congressional districts, that would be $220 million per congressional district.  Now, my district has just about the highest rate of unemployment in the United States. My State has the highest rate of unemployment, my district and the gentleman from Oregon's (Mr. Walden) are unfortunately right up there in the State. Mr. Speaker, $22 million could mean a lot for us. It could put a lot of people to work.  Albany, Oregon, under Federal mandate, is going to borrow money to build a new water system. Of course, we are going to give $50 million to Iraq to build a new water system for one city. Sweet Home, Oregon, same thing. Federal mandate. They can borrow some money, but we are going to give money to Iraq to build them new water systems.  My port of Port Orifice sewage system, fell into the ocean after a big storm. Problem. The Federal Government says this depressed little coastal community, they will lend them some money to help them do that project; lend them some money. But, in Iraq, we are going to give them new sewer systems. The American people are borrowing money to build these projectsin Iraq with no prospect of being repaid under the leadership of President Bush.  We could also, with the same $220 million, guarantee my coastal ports, which were zeroed out in the President's budget for continued dredging maintenance, we could dredge those ports for 5 years. We still have not spent $220 million yet. We are working on it. This is just one district. Just imagine what this would mean across the United States of America if every Member of Congress got to take that $220 million home instead of sending it over to this deep pit in Iraq.  We could give 1,000 students full tuition, room and board at the University of Oregon or Oregon State in my district; 10,000 community college scholarships. Instead of them having to borrow money from the Federal Government, we could have given them scholarships. This is just one congressional district. We could give thousands, more than 10,000 students full tuition, a free ride for the year. We could put thousands to work on infrastructure projects meeting Federal mandates. That is just one congressional district. Imagine if that were repeated across the United States of America. If only the President would borrow money to invest here, or even spend money like the unemployment trust fund.  Now, since this $87 billion that was borrowed or authorized yesterday by the Senate, the President will probably sign the bill soon, following the $79 billion that we borrowed last April which is not yet spent, we have to wonder, what is the plan? The plan was to vote on borrowing another $87 billion before they spent the $79 billion. And so what are we going to do to bring stability? Well, now they say what they are going to do is train Iraqis. Now, on September 5, Donald Rumsfeld said there were 55,000 Iraqis all told, including security guards, et cetera, trained. Since then the estimates of the Iraqi forces have grown at the rate that would mean they have trained 1,000 people a day. Wow. Must be some program. Unfortunately, they have not yet begun the $1.2 billion program to train Iraqis in Jordan to become police and security. Yes, that is right. We are going to pay $1.2 billion. The French and the Germans offered to do it for free, and they are good at training people do to that, but God forbid that we should save the American taxpayers $1.2 billion and take something from the French and Germans that they are good at. So the Jordanians and, of course, we know they are really good at this, are going to be training the Iraqis to become police. But somehow, magically the numbers keep going on up. It is like zip, zip, zip.  Then last week Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz speaking in Georgetown raised that figure to 90,000. Three days later Rumsfeld said 100,000.  Now, how is this happening? Do we think this is really happening? Do we think we can believe these folks? Now remember, these are the same people who told us, this is a country that can afford to rebuild itself and pay for its own reconstruction, and soon. That is what we were told. That is what the American people were told. They would be waving little flags, welcoming us as victors. Our kids do not have the flak jackets they need because Rummy said there would only be 30,000 Americans there by now, and we have more than 30,000 flak jackets. They have planned miserably.  I would recommend to my colleagues and everybody, Blueprint for a Mess from the New York Times on Sunday, November 2, New York Times magazine, the best compilation of the total abysmal failure to plan and, in fact, to reject planning for the postwar Iraq by this administration.                          ____________________
