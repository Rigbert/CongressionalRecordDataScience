Speaker, I would like to congratulate the Croatian Catholic Union of the United States of America and Canada [CCU] as it celebrates its 75th anniversary and legacy of accomplishment for Croatian-Americans. The celebration will begin this Saturday, May 4, during a luncheon at the Croatian Catholic Union home office in Hobart, IN. The celebration will continue on Sunday in Chicago, with a mass at the Sacred Heart of Jesus Parish. The CCU is honored to have His Eminence Cardinal Franjo Kuharic, the archbishop of Zagerb, Croatia, and Msgr. Valdimir Stankovic, the director of pastoral care for Croatians aboard and director of Croatian Caritas, preside over the anniversary celebration. In addition, Melchior Masina, the national president of the CCU, and Myrna Jurcev, the national secretary treasurer of the CCU, will be speaking. Both the residents of Indiana's First Congressional District.  The CCU is a fraternal benefit society incorporated in 1921 under the laws of the State of Indiana as a nonprofit organization. This organization provides life insurance and other benefits to its members and promotes religious, civic, charitable, educational, social, and cultural programs for the enrichment of its members. Furthermore, the CCU promotes the values of its members' Croatian Catholic heritage.  In 1970, through its religious programs, the CCU erected two Marian Chapels, which make up the Croatian Marian Shrine in the Basilica of the Immaculate Conception in Washington, DC. This Croatian Marian Shrine offers a place to worship and it serves as a symbol of Croatian-American contributions to the New World. Moreover, it unites all visiting Croatian-Americans in a strong bind of mutual solidarity and identity. Each year, the CCU organizes a national pilgrimage to the shrine.  While the CCU's programs are civic in nature, the CCU participates in all events sponsored by the National Fraternal Congress. For example, the CCU raised significant funds to restore the Statue of Liberty, and it also made donations to Habitat for Humanity. In fact, many charitable donations have been made throughout the CCU's history, especially at times of great disasters. The CCU has raised millions of dollars in cash donations, medical supplies, food, and clothing for the refugees and orphans in the Balkans.  According to the CCU, the purpose of the organization is service to God. The center of the CCU's mission is service to Croatian-American people. The core of their vision is service, solidarity and love for one another.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in honoring the Croatian Catholic Union of the United States and Canada during its 75th anniversary celebration. All the CCU's members should be commended for their dedication to preserving their culture, as well as assisting Croatian-Americans and others in times of need.                          ____________________
