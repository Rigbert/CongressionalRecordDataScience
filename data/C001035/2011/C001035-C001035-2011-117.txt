President, I rise today to introduce with Senator Lieberman the Securing Terrorist Intelligence Act. Last Congress, the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee heard testimony from the three top U.S. intelligence officials about the errors the Federal Government made in handling the unsuccessful 2009 Christmas Day terrorist plot. We dodged a bullet that day when Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, a Nigerian-born terrorist, failed to detonate a bomb on Northwest flight 253 in the skies above Detroit.  While critical information was not shared prior to Abdulmatallab boarding that plane, a significant error also was committed by U.S. officials after that foreign terrorist had already been detained in Detroit, an error that may well have prevented the collection of valuable intelligence about future terrorist threats to our country. The error became clear during my questioning of the top intelligence officials at the committee's hearing held in response to this failed attack.  I was stunned to learn that the decision had been made to place this captured terrorist into the U.S. civilian criminal court system after just 50 minutes of interrogation--and without any consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, the Director of the National Counterterrorism Center, or the Secretary Homeland Security. That decision was critical. The determination to charge Abdulmutallab in civilian court likely foreclosed the collection of additional intelligence information. We know that the interrogation of captured terrorists can provide critical intelligence and save American lives, but our civil justice system, as opposed to the military detention and tribunal system established by Congress and the President, encourages terrorists to ``lawyer up'' and to stop answering questions.  Indeed, that was what happened in the case of Abdulmutallab. He had provided some valuable information to law enforcement officials immediately after his capture, and we likely would have obtained more information if we had treated this foreign terrorist as an enemy belligerent and had placed him in the military tribunal system. Unfortunately, once he was read his Miranda rights and given a lawyer at our expense, he was advised to cease answering questions, and that is exactly what he did.  That poor decision-making may well have prevented us from finding out more of the plot's organizers, planners, financiers, logistics support, and other key players. In addition, we may have found out more about future plots originating in Yemen targeting American citizens--possibly even the thwarted October 2010 printer cartridge attacks. Good intelligence is critical to our ability to stop terrorist plots before they are executed. We know that lawful interrogations of terrorist suspects can provide valuable intelligence. Deciding to charge Abdulmutallab in the civilian criminal system without even consulting three of our nation's top intelligence officials simply defies common sense.  It has been over a year since the arrest, and we are all very thankful that there has not been a successful terrorist attack in America since then. We all know, however, the threat persists. That is why we must redouble our efforts and ensure that when the next terrorist is captured, proper action is taken so we do not miss another opportunity to gain valuable intelligence that could save American lives.  To correct this failure and to ensure that our nation's senior intelligence officials are consulted before making the decision to try future foreign terrorists in civilian court, I am reintroducing a bill that would require this crucial consultation. I am very pleased to be joined by the Chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, Senator Lieberman, who has been such a leader in this area.  Specifically, our bill would require the Attorney General to consult with the Director of National Intelligence, the Director of the National Counterterrorism Center, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Secretary of Defense before initiating a custodial interrogation of foreign terrorists or filing civilian criminal charges against them. These officials are in the best position to know what other threats the United States is facing from terrorists and to assess the need to gather more intelligence on those threats.  If there is a disagreement among the Attorney General and these intelligence officials regarding the appropriate approach to the detention and interrogation of foreign terrorists, then the bill would require the President to resolve the disagreement. Only the President would be permitted to direct the initiation of civilian law enforcement actions--balancing his constitutional responsibilities as Commander in Chief and as the nation's chief law enforcement officer.  To be clear, this legislation would not deprive the President of any investigative or prosecutorial tool. It would not preclude a decision to charge a foreign terrorist in our military tribunal system or in our civilian criminal justice system. It would simply require that the Attorney General coordinate and consult with our top intelligence officials before making a decision that could foreclose the collection of critical additional intelligence information.  This consultation requirement is not unprecedented. Section 811 of the Counterintelligence and Security Enhancements Act of 1994 requires the Director of the FBI and the head of a department or agency with a potential spy in its ranks to consult and periodically reassess any decision to leave the suspected spy in place so that additional intelligence can be gathered on his activities.  As the Senate Intelligence Committee noted in its report on the legislation that added the espionage consultation requirement:       While prosecutorial discretion ultimately rests with the      Department of Justice officials, it stands to reason that in      cases designed to protect our national security--such as      espionage and terrorism cases--prosecutors should ensure that      they do not make decisions that, in fact, end up harming the      national security.  The committee got it right. The committee went on to explain:       [T]he determination of whether to leave a subject in place      should be retained by the host agency.  The history of the espionage consultation requirement is eerily reminiscent of the lack of consultation that occurred in the case of Abdulmutallab. In espionage cases, Congress has already recognized that when valuable intelligence is at stake, our national security should trump decisions based solely on prosecutorial equities. This requirement must be extended to the most significant security threat facing our Nation--terrorism.  I encourage the Senate to act quickly on this important legislation. The changes proposed are modest. They make common sense. But the consequences of a failure to act could be a matter of life and death.                                 ______                                       By
