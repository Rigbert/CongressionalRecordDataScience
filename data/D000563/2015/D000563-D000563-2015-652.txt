President, let me thank my colleague from Rhode Island. He and I did travel to Havana, Cuba, earlier this week. Interestingly enough, we sat down with the scientists and the people responsible for the oceans and other natural benefits in Cuba to discuss global warming, and the conversation started at the same place. Even with these scientists, there is no question they can see the impact, and they started their predictions about the rise of the ocean levels--and the Senator from Rhode Island knows this far better than I do--with their anticipation that the ocean levels will rise over a foot in just 10 or 20 years and then twice that over a period of 50 years or more. That will have a profound impact on the island, the archipelago of Cuba, and the United States.  Senator Whitehouse of Rhode Island, more than any other Senator, has really brought this issue home--not just to his home but to the Atlantic Coast States--and has reported on the impacts they face. Now, I live smack dab in the middle of the country--in Illinois. I can tell you we appreciate there are changes taking place on this planet that are not in our best interests--nor will they leave our children and grandchildren a better place to live.  The obvious question we face is what will we do in this generation. This bill, S. 1, which has been chosen by the Republican majority, has given us a venue finally to raise some important environmental issues which have been ignored for too long.  I know the object of this bill was to build a pipeline. TransCanada, a Canadian company, wants to build a pipeline through the United States. They may or may not sell any oil from it in the United States. We had a vote on that yesterday, and the Republicans overwhelmingly said they would not require them to sell their oil in the United States. They may or may not use American steel to build their pipeline. We had that amendment yesterday, and the Republicans voted overwhelmingly that there is to be no requirement to use American steel to build this pipeline. Yet it is characterized as an American jobs bill. It is hard to understand that characterization.  If nothing else, whatever happens to this bill--and it may not have a great fate ahead of it, if it is not changed significantly because the President has already threatened to veto it--what the Senator from Rhode Island said is significant. After years of denial from the other side of the aisle about the issues of global warming, we may have just reached a point where we are finally, on a bipartisan basis, going to acknowledge the obvious--the scientific facts which have been given to us over and over and over. That is a step in the right direction, and so I want to thank my colleague from Rhode Island.                            Amendment No. 69  Let me take 2 minutes to say a word about my pending amendment, which may come up for a vote shortly. It is amendment No. 69.  What I have said on the floor is there is a dirty little secret about the Keystone Pipeline. You don't take Canadian tar sands and turn them into gasoline and diesel fuel without filtering and refining out some pretty horrible things. What is filtered out is called petcoke, and petcoke is going to be produced in the refining process if this pipeline is ultimately built--over 15,000 tons a day of petcoke, the byproduct of this refining process.  If you look at it and you think to yourself what impact will that have, it could have a very negative impact. In my city of Chicago, which I am very proud to represent, as well as in other communities, petcoke piles have become a challenge to the public health and the people in the community. I am asking in my amendment that we establish a standard of safety when it comes to petcoke--that we establish a standard of transportation and storage of petcoke to protect American families and children from the hazards of breathing petcoke dust.  This is a simple public health amendment, and I hope my colleagues will support it.  I yield the floor.
