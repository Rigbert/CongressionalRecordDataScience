 Mr. LaHOOD. Reclaiming my time, Mr. Chairman, I would just say to the gentleman that this amendment says the Secretary of the Navy cannot pay the bill. That is not the amendment that was offered by the administration. You know that.  This amendment is being offered to try and embarrass the Vice President because some people around here think the administration does not have an energy policy. Well, we do have an energy policy, and we are going to debate it next week.
