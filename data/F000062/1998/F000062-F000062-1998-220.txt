 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a man who has brought joy and laughter to countless Americans during his nearly fifty years in entertainment, Bob Barker. Next week, Mr. Barker, who is the host and executive producer of the legendary game show CBS' ``The Price is Right,'' celebrates airing the 5,000th episode of his series. I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing his achievements.  In his 26th season, ``The Price is Right'' is the longest running game show in American history and continues to be America's highest rated daytime game show. Beyond the fact that most Americans have watched the show at some point in their lives, more than 42,000 people have been contestants on the program, while an approximate 1.3 million have participated in the studio audience. Both the show's spontaneity and Mr. Barker's effortless rapport with contestants have given ``The Price is Right'' its unique popularity. Bob has repeatedly said over the years, ``The Price is Right'' is not just a television show, it is an event. Today I commend Mr. Barker not only for reaching this impressive milestone with the show, but also for his longstanding ability to entertain the American people.  Mr. Barker was born in Darrington, Washington, and spent most of his youth on the Rosebud Indian Reservation in South Dakota where his mother was a school teacher. His family eventually moved to Springfield, Missouri, where he attended high school and Drury college on a basketball scholarship. When World War II intervened, he became a Navy fighter pilot, but the war ended before he was assigned to a seagoing squadron.  Following his discharge, Mr. Barker returned to Drury College and took a job at a local radio station to help finance his studies. It was there that he discovered that what he did best was to host audience participation shows. After graduating summa cum laude with a degree in economics, he went to work for a radio station in Palm Beach, Florida. A year later he moved to Los Angeles, and within a week, he was the host of his own radio program, ``The Bob Barker Show.''  Bob Barker's career was forever transformed in 1956 when he debuted as the host of the television show, ``Truth or Consequences.'' It was his 3,524 consecutive performances on ``Truth or Consequences'' over its eighteen-year run that won him the title of ``Most Durable Performer'' in the Guiness Book of World Records. During his forty-one years on network television, he has taped more shows than any other individual for a network series. Between ``Truth and Consequences,'' ``The Price is Right,'' and his 21 years as host of both the Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants, he has hosted more than 8,500 shows in the course of his career. According to CBS, he has made more appearances on television in general than anyone else in the entire history of the medium. Bob has won 12 Emmy Awards, ten of which were for his performances as a game show host and represent the largest number of Emmys given to a single television performer.  Bob is an outspoken and eloquent supporter of animal rights, and has consistently used his celebrity to help to control the animal population, thereby reducing the number of needless animal deaths. Each day he closes ``The Price is Right'' with a reminder to spay and neuter your pets. He has established the DJ Foundation to provide funding for free spay and neuter clinics across the nation. In recognition of his efforts, he received the International Society for Animal Rights' highest honor, the Henry Salt Award, in 1995.  Therefore, as Mr. Barker commemorates the 5,000th episode of ``The Price is Right,'' I thank him for his special lighthearted touch. As he told the Los Angeles Times in 1996, ``We don't solve the world's problems. But hopefully we help a lot of people to forget their problems for an hour * * * We're there to entertain, laugh, and have fun.'' On behalf of the people of the state of California, I congratulate you, Bob, and thank you for entertaining us and making us laugh.                          ____________________
