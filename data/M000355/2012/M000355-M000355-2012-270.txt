 President, I stand before you today to commend and pay tribute to a Kentuckian who spent time with the Marines serving in Afghanistan in 2009. Although he was far from home and a visitor in a foreign land, LCpl David Mays of London, KY, treated the Afghan people with the utmost respect, proving that he exemplified the characteristics the U.S. Marine Corps upholds: character, compassion, honor, courage, and the integrity to always do what is right. Lance Corporal Mays enlisted during his senior year of high school at the age of 18.  In May of 2009, just 2 days before his second deployment with the Marines, David's firstborn son, Landon, came into the world. David left for Afghanistan before his newborn son was able to leave the hospital in London. Although David was greatly saddened about having to leave his baby boy behind, he proudly answered the call of duty, and for the second time David returned to the Middle East. However, this time around, David was a different man: he was a father now. Fatherhood caused him to take an interest in the local Afghan children. David felt that interacting with the children helped him to not miss his own son as much.  David missed his boy back home terribly, but he would play with the Afghan children and buy them gifts. In turn, the children would offer David and his fellow marines fruit as a token of their gratitude. The kinship David and his men built with the local children was the foundation of a successful relationship with the local Afghan tribe leaders.  During his time overseas, David had limited contact with his family in Kentucky, but his mother, Wanda Caudill, sent letters and care packages as frequently as possible. She would also send photos of Landon. The gifts from home and the relationships David made with the local people, local children, and fellow marines all helped to console him until he finally returned home just before Christmas in 2010.  It had been almost a year since David had seen his son Landon, who was only 2 days old at their last meeting, There was no way that the little boy could have remembered his father's presence. But when David first saw his son Landon at the airport that December, Landon reached for him as if he had never left and kissed him three times.  David has since joined the London-Laurel County Rescue Squad and London Fire Department. He is still in the Marines Active Reserve, but he plans to stay as involved as he can in his 2-year-old son's life. David decided that missing 1 year of his son's life is enough, and he is not missing any more.  Mr. President, an article appeared in the Laurel County publication the Sentinel-Echo: Silver Edition in November 2011 that profiled the upstanding character of LCpl David Mays. I ask unanimous consent that said article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:                  [From the Sentinel Echo, Nov. 2011]                      Finding Family Far From Home                          (By Magen McCrarey)       He left his first-born son, Landon, at the hospital in May      of 2009, born two days before his second deployment. David      Mays, a lance corporal of the 1st Battalion, Fifth Marines,      hoped to take Landon home for a warm welcome; instead he      arrived in Afghanistan with one of his own.       ``As we landed we heard bullets ricocheting off the      helicopter,'' Mays said. ``We were there, and there was no      turning back.''       The sweltering desert heat was in excess of 115 degrees as      Mays and his squad walked three days with more than 100      pounds strapped to their backs heading towards Helmand      Province. Their compound was far off from any city and water      was limited.       With a shovel-like tool in hand, Mays began digging a hole      for his bed and covered it with a tarp.       ``Everybody dug their own hole, scattered, in case we got      attacked by mortars,'' Mays said. ``I told my buddy if we're      worried about mortars, we dug our graves right here so it      don't matter.''       Mays always wanted to be a Marine. When Mays was in fourth      grade at Cold Hill Elementary, his class received a visit      from a U.S. Marine, a pilot shot down behind enemy lines and      a Kentucky native. The Marine's recollection of brotherhood      and camaraderie influenced Mays in more ways than just      portraying an intriguing narrative.       ``It was like a family away from your own family, and I'd      get to see the world and meet people,'' Mays said.       He and a group of friends enlisted in the Marines their      senior year of high school at 18 years old. They knew they      may not be placed in the same company throughout their      service, but they all had the same objective.       ``We all had one thing on our minds: to become Marines      together,'' Mays said.       The objective of the Marines within the Helmand Province      was to win the hearts and minds of the Afghans. With the      British recently vacating the country, Afghans were      apprehensive about the Marines' arrival.       Tribe leaders would only converse with Marine commanders.      They'd offer tips about the Taliban's whereabouts and when      they were arriving in the area. The Taliban had a reputation      for entering into towns at night.       Mays and his squad of four would respond to the information      given and perform night operations to keep watch over a town.      Walking 20 miles and back again to keep watch for suspicious      travelers was a frequent and meticulous task.       ``We did what we had to do. We were doing our job      protecting each other,'' Mays said, ``just like anybody      around here will protect their family.''       Contact with family via satellite while in Afghanistan was      few and far between, but they received mail often. Mays's      mother, Wanda Caudill, sent a letter every chance she got,      and many care packages.       ``She sent me newspapers and I knew exactly what was going      on in London,'' he said.       Caudill also sent photos of Mays's son so he wouldn't feel      as if he was missing out on his child's life. Away from his      own child, Mays often thought about the children in      Afghanistan.       ``We'd give the kids rides on our shoulders, and we'd buy      them stuff,'' Mays said.       The Afghan boys would offer fruit to the Marines and even      allowed them to participate in their Muslim holiday of      Ramadan. As the sun set, the day of fasting would cease and      they would enter in an evening feast. They had offered a goat      for slaughter to the men, and taught them how to give it a      death without suffering.       ``I think it made me think about when my son was going to      get that age, and didn't make me miss him as much. But, of      course, I missed him because he was my boy,'' Mays said.       After days of patrolling a foreign country, battling an      unseen enemy, and losing men that were a part of his family      away from home, Mays returned to his own. Days before      Christmas 2010, Mays arrived at the Louisville airport      greeting his family with one gripping hug after another,      saving his son for last.       ``I was scared he was going to cry and not recognize me,''      Mays said.       But Landon came right to him as if he never missed a beat.      He reached for Mays and kissed him three times.       ``My mom started crying and said, `He never kissed nobody,'      Mays recalled. ``It was like I was gone only a minute or      so.''       After returning from deployment, Mays has learned to      appreciate the small things in life and take advantage of      every opportunity to serve the public, he said. He's joined      the London-Laurel County Rescue Squad and London Fire      Department. Mays has completed four years of active duty in      the Marines and is currently in the four-year active     reserve program. He said if he didn't have his son before he      began active duty, he would have made a career out of the      Marines.       ``I decided one year's enough,'' Mays said. ``I'm not      missing any more of his life.'' Landon is now two years old.                          ____________________
