 The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 minutes.  There was no objection.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I consume. I actually rise in support of the amendment, and I particularly want to congratulate my colleague, Dan Lipinski, who serves on both the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, for his work on this amendment.  I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Lipinski).
