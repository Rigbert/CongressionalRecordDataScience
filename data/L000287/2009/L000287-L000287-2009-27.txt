I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, transportation is one of the most important issues in our country, so I am proud to have served on both the Ways and Means Committee and on what was then the Public Works and Transportation Committee.  I would like to thank Chairman Rangel and Chairman Oberstar for their leadership on this important issue.  The bipartisan bill before the House today will provide the necessary funds to keep important transportation projects operating in States around the country. As we all know, the Highway Trust Fund will run out of funding by September. We must act, and we must act now.  In 1998, Congress passed a highway bill that took more than $8 billion out of the trust fund and put it in the Treasury. In addition, Congress stopped the Highway Trust Fund from earning interest on its investment. If these steps had not been taken, the balance in the Highway Trust Fund would be nearly $20 billion more than it is now.                              {time}  1545  Last year we transferred $8 billion back, and the legislation we are considering today would transfer $7 billion more.  I want to be clear, Mr. Speaker. No new money is spent under this bill. This bill should keep the Highway Trust Fund fully funded until 2009. If we fail to act today, our people, our States, and our economy will be harmed. In Georgia, where unemployment is already above 10 percent, we cannot afford to lose another 8,500 jobs because of failure to act.  Last year, all sides understood how critical highway funding is to our economy. I hope the legislation we are considering today will enjoy similar bipartisan support. I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this important legislation.  I reserve the balance of my time.
