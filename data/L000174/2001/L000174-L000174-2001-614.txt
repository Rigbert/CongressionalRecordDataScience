Just in the last Congress, we were able to pass the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act, the Patent Fee Integrity and Innovation Protection Act, the Trademarks Amendments Act, the Satellite Home Viewers Improvements Act, and the American Inventors Protection Act. These significant intellectual property matters were preceded by our work together forging a consensus on the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the Copyright Term Extension Act, the PTO Reauthorization Act, the Trademark Law Treaty Implementation Act, and many others. We and the other members of the committee have worked to ensure that divisive partisanship stays clear of this important area.  The proof of what we in Congress can accomplish when we put partisan differences aside, roll up our sleeves, and do the hard work or crafting compromises is demonstrated by our record of legislative achievements on intellectual property matters.  I hope all Senators will look at what Senator Hatch and I have been able to do when we set aside partisan differences and make sure we do things that work.  This bill makes technical corrections to and various non-substantive changes in our intellectual property laws. Introduction and passage of this bill is a good start for this Congress, but we must not lose sight of the other copyright, patent and trademark issues requiring our attention. The Senate Judiciary Committee has a full slate of intellectual property matters to consider. I am pleased to work on a bipartisan basis with the chairman on an agenda to provide the creators and inventors of copyrighted and patented works with the protection they may need in our global economy, while at the same time providing libraries, educational institutions, and other users with the clarity they need as to what constitutes fair use of such work.  We have to realize things have changed. There has been a lot in the press in the past couple days about the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision in Napster. I suggest that if anyone thinks this is the end of the whole issue, they are mistaken.  It is clear that creators and owners of copyrighted property should have their copyrights protected, and they should certainly be compensated for their artistry and their work.  Those who distribute or produce copyrighted material, including movies, music, and books, have to realize their own business practices may well have to change and be a lot different. Profit margins may change, depending upon how it is done. Artists are not going to be beholden just to a few mega distributors. With the Internet, they are going to be able to work out their own way of distributing their material. They are going to be able to get themselves known if they want, even if it is by distributing their music, movies, or books for free.  It is a different world out there, but it is just one example of the kinds of issues we have to look at. Applying copyright principles to new situations should not be done just by court-made law which is imprecise, at best, because a court is limited to the factual situation before it rather than a full panoply of circumstances, but can be done here, recognizing we have a whole new way of doing things.  I remember when I was growing up in Montpelier, VT, my parents owned a small printing business. We used either moveable type or hot lead type. It was a laborious process. One thing I learned was not only to proofread in a hurry, but to read upside down and backward, as well as right side up and forward, because that is the way the letters work. It is a matter of consternation sometimes. People do not realize I am reading what is before me.  Now I look at the business, and there has been enormous change. It is less labor intensive in the setting up--it is not even type anymore, now it is offset. It changes the whole economy, but opens up a whole new world, all using different kinds of copyrighted material.  Among the things we should look at is protection from State infringement. In response to the Supreme Court's decisions in the Florida Prepaid and College Savings Bank cases, I introduced in the last Congress legislation to restore Federal protection for intellectual property to guard against infringement by the States.  This is a reaction to an activist U.S. Supreme Court which held that States and their institutions cannot be held liable for patent infringement and other violations of the Federal intellectual property laws, even though those same States can and do enjoy the full protection of those laws for themselves.  Basically, the Supreme Court--it seemed to me anyway--seems to be willing to rewrite the rule of law with regard to the Constitution, certainly when it comes to telling States what they cannot do. We know they are not hesitant to do that. The legislation I sponsored would condition a State's ability to obtain new intellectual property rights on its waiver of sovereign immunity in future intellectual property suits.  It would also improve the limited remedies available to enforce a nonwaiving State's obligations under Federal law and the U.S. Constitution. This is a critical area in which the Congress should act.  Then we have distance education. The Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing in the last Congress on the Copyright Office's thorough and balanced report on copyright and digital distance education, something that can be very important to those of us from rural States where there may be small schools.  While the distinguished Presiding Officer has metropolitan areas in her State, she also has very rural areas. Schools in rural areas may not be able to hire the top math teacher, the top language teacher, or the top science teacher, even though all these may be needed, but three or four of them together can do so if they are connected in such a way that they can utilize this.  We need to address legislative recommendations outlined in the Copyright Office's report to ensure our laws permit the appropriate use of copyrighted works in valid distance learning activities. I know Senator Hatch shares my goal for the schools in this country, particularly in rural areas. We can use this technology to maximize the educational experiences of our children.  It is an important area for the Judiciary Committee to examine. Not everybody comes from large schools. I had about 30 in my high school graduating class. Interestingly, every 4 years, all 500 of those 30 students show up at my door saying they were a high school classmate; could they please have a ticket to the Presidential inauguration.  We have the Madrid Protocol Implementation Act. I introduced legislation in the last two Congresses to help American businesses, and especially small and medium-sized companies, protect their trademarks as they go into international markets. The legislation would do so by conforming American trademark application procedures to the terms of the Madrid protocol.  The Clinton administration transmitted the protocol to the Senate for its advise and consent last year. I regret we did not work on it promptly. I hope the new President will urge that action because ratification by the United States of this treaty would help create a one-stop international trademark registration process, an enormous benefit for American businesses.  Next we have business method patents. The PTO has been subject to criticism for granting patents for obvious routines which implement existing business methods. The patent reform law that Senator Hatch and I worked out in the last Congress addressed one aspect of this matter: The prior user defense at least protects those who previously practiced that particular art. We should hold a hearing and engage the PTO in a dialog about this important issue to find out what you do with initial patents.  Frankly, I find patenting electronic business practices not that far removed from the situation where two competing hardware stores in the spring put the seeds, the Rototillers, and whatnot out front and in the winter put the snowblowers out front. Should one be allowed to patent that process so in the summer its competitor would have to have its snowblowers out front and could not put out lawn items? I think not. That is what we are looking at, except now in a digital age.  The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development criticized the PTO for granting overly broad biotechnology patent protections. This area, as well as the international protection of patent rights, warrants examination and careful monitoring.  Then we have the issue of rural satellite television and Internet service. It is important to the State of Vermont. It is important to every rural community. It is certainly important to mine. I live in a house where I cannot get any television. I used to joke that I would get one and a quarter. I do not even get the quarter anymore. I cannot get anything, but I can if I have satellite television, and I can get my Internet service the same way. Senator Hatch and I worked together to address this issue in the major Satellite Home Viewers Law passed last Congress.  We authorized a rural loan guarantee program to help facilitate deployment in rural areas. That law included a priority for loans that offered financing for high-speed Internet access. That is a great tool in eliminating the digital divide between urban and rural America.  So we want to make sure that gets done and done right.  The job of this Congress is to ensure that the administration gets the job done so that those goals are met and the programs we have established are fully implemented.  The ninth circuit's ruling in the Napster case on Monday highlights the tensions between new online tools and services and protection of intellectual property rights. In the long term, where it counts the most, both sides--copyright holders and advocates for advances in new technology--can find victories in this ruling.  Nothing should stop the genius of a Shawn Fanning or those who come up with new online technologies like Napster.  While Napster customers may not initially see it that way, the availability of new music and other creative works--and its contributions to the vibrancy of our culture and in fueling our economy--depends on clearly understood and adequately enforced copyright protection. The Court of Appeals has sent the case back to the district court to ensure that the rights of creators are protected and that the online marketplace is just that, and not a free-for-all.  The exponential growth of Napster has proven that the Internet works well to distribute music, but this case is a warning that copyrights may not be ignored when new online services are deployed. The Internet can and must serve the needs not only of Internet users and innovators of new technologies, but also of artists, songwriters, performers and copyright holders. The Judiciary Committee should examine this issue closely to ensure that our laws are working well to meet all these needs.  Last Congress I introduced the Drug Competition Act of 2000, S. 2993, to give the Justice Department and the FTC the information they need to prevent anticompetitive practices which delay the availability of low-cost generic prescription drugs. I intend to re-introduce this bill soon and work with my colleagues to enact it this year to help assure that the availability of lower cost prescription drugs.  I noted upon passage of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act in 1998 that there was not enough time before the end of that Congress to give due consideration to the issue of database protection, and that I hoped the Senate Judiciary Committee would hold hearings and consider database protection legislation. Despite the passage of time, the Judiciary Committee has not yet held hearings on this issue.  I support legal protection against commercial misappropriation of collections of information, but am sensitive to the concerns raised by the libraries, certain educational institutions, and the scientific community. This is a complex and important matter that I look forward to considering in this Congress.  Product identification codes provide a means for manufacturers to track their goods, which can be important to protect consumers in case of defective,tainted, or harmful products and to implement product recalls. Defacing, removing, or tampering with product identification codes can thwart these tracking efforts, with potential safety consequences for American consumers. We should examine the scope of, and legislative solutions to remedy, this problem.  Senator Hatch and I worked together to pass cybersquatting legislation in the last Congress to protect registered trademarks online. This is an issue that has concerned me since the Congress passed the Federal Trademark Dilution Act of 1995, when I expressed my hope that the new law would ``help stem the use of deceptive Internet addresses taken by those who are choosing marks that are associated with the products and reputations of others.'' (Congressional Record, December 29, 1995, page S19312).  The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (I-CANN) has recently added new top-level domain names and is negotiating contracts with the new registries. Senator Hatch and I followed these developments closely and together wrote to then Secretary of Commerce Norman Mineta on December 15, 2000, for the Commerce Department's assurances that the introduction of the new TLDs be achieved in a manner that minimizes the abuses of trademark rights. The Judiciary Committee has an important oversight role to play in this area.  We also will need to pay careful attention to the increasing consolidation in the airline, telecommunications, petroleum, electric, agriculture, and other sectors of the economy to ensure that consumers are protected from anticompetitive practices. The Judiciary Committee has already held one hearing on airline consolidation in this Congress and I stand ready to work with my colleagues on legislation to address competition problems.  I have already joined with the Democratic leader and several of my colleagues on the Securing a Future for Independent Agriculture Act, S. 20, to address the growing serious problem of consolidation in the agriculture processing sector. In addition, we need to carefully monitor international efforts to harmonize competition law to ensure that American companies and consumers are fairly treated and that our antitrust policies are not weakened.  This bill represents a good start on the work before the Senate Judiciary Committee to update American intellectual property law to ensure that it serves to advance and protect American interests both here and abroad. The list of addititional copyright, patent, and trademark issues that require our attention shows that we have a lot more work to do.                               Exhibit 1                                           Register of Copyrights,                                          Library of Congress,                                Washington, DC, February 12, 2001.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: I understand that you will be      sponsoring legislation in this Congress that will incorporate      last year's proposed Copyright Technical Corrections Act of      2000, H.R. 5106.       The Copyright Office proposed the technical corrections      that were included in H.R. 5106 to address some minor      drafting errors in the Intellectual Property and      Communications Omnibus Reform Act of 1999 and to correct some      other technical discrepancies in Title 17. None of these      proposed corrections are substantive.       I believe that it is important that the provisions of Title      17 be clear, and therefore I thank you for your leadership on      this legislation and hope that you will be successful in      obtaining its passage.           Sincerely,                                                  Marybeth Peters,                                           Register of Copyrights.
