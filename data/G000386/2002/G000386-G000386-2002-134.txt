 I believe this legislation will help America's law enforcement go after the latest methods drug dealers are using to push drugs on our kids. As drug dealers discover new drugs and new methods of pushing their poison, we must make sure our legal system is adequately structured to react appropriately. I believe this legislation does that.  Many young people perceive Ecstasy as harmless and it is wrongly termed a recreational or ``kid-friendly'' drug. This illegal substance does real damage to real lives. Although targeted at teenagers and young adults, its use has spread to the middle-aged population and rural areas, including my own State of Iowa. Ninety percent of all drug treatment and law enforcement experts say that Esctasy is readily accessible in this country. We cannot continue to allow easy access to this drug or ignore the consequences of its use.  The sale of illicit narcotics, whether on a street corner here in Washington, D.C., or a warehouse in Des Moines, IA, must be confronted and halted wherever possible. One of the new, ``trendy'' illicit narcotics is Ecstasy, an especially popular club drug that is all too often being sold at all-night dance parties, or raves. Ecstasy is an illegal drug that has extremely dangerous side effects. In general, Ecstasy raises the heart rate to dangerous levels, and in some cases the heart will stop. It also causes severe dehydration, a condition that is exacerbated by the high levels of physical exertion that happens at raves. Users must constantly drink water in an attempt to cool off, a fact that some rave promoters take advantage of by charging exorbitant fees for bottles of water. Too often, users collapse and die because their bodies overheat. And even those who survive the short-term effects of Ecstasy use can look forward long-term problems such as depression, paranoia, and confusion, as scientists have learned that Ecstasy causes irreversible changes to the brain.  The legislation that we introduce today is the result of information gathered during a series of hearings held by the Caucus on International Narcotics Control. It will help U.S. attorneys shut down raves and prosecute rave promoters who knowingly maintain a place where drugs are used, kept, or sold by expanding the existing statute that allows the closure and prosecution of crack house operators.  The statute would only be applicable if the rave promoters or location owners ``knowingly and intentionally'' either use or allow to be used space for an event where drugs will be ``manufactured, stored, distributed, or used.'' This legislation will not eliminate all raves. Provided rave promoters and sponsors operate such events as they are so often advertized, as places for people to come dance in a safe, alcohol-free environment, then they have nothing to fear from this law. But this legislation will give law enforcement the tools needed to shut down those rave operators and promoters who use raves as a cover to sell drugs. Innocent owners or proprietors will remain exempt from prosecution.  This legislation is an important step, but a careful one. Our future rests with the young people of this great nation and America is at risk. Esctasy has shown itself to be a formidable threat and we must confront it on all fronts, not only through law enforcement but education and treatment as well. I hope my colleagues will join us in supporting the RAVE Act, and help us work towards its quick passenge.                                 ______                                       By
