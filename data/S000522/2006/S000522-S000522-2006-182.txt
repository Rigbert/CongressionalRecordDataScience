Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the Senate bill (S. 1184) to waive the passport fees for a relative of a deceased member of the Armed Forces proceeding abroad to visit the grave of such member or to attend a funeral or memorial service for such member.  The Clerk read as follows:                                S. 1184       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. PASSPORT FEES.       Section 1 of the Act of June 4, 1920 (41 Stat. 750, chapter      223; 22 U.S.C. 214) is amended in the third sentence by      striking ``or from a widow, child, parent, brother, or sister      of a deceased member of the Armed Forces proceeding abroad to      visit the grave of such member'' and inserting ``or from a      widow, widower, child, parent, grandparent, brother, or      sister of a deceased member of the Armed Forces proceeding      abroad to visit the grave of such member or to attend a      funeral or memorial service for such member''.
