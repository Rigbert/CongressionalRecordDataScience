President, today I want to say a few words about one of the most admired members of my staff, Katharine ``Kappy'' Scates. Kappy is retiring at the end of the year. I don't know what we will do without her. Oftentimes, public servants are in it for the accolades--not Kappy. She, in her own quiet way, just wanted to make a difference in people's lives.  Since 1996, when I first ran for the U.S. Senate, Kappy has been my eyes and ears in southern Illinois. She is a retired elementary school teacher and a friend of my predecessor and mentor Senator Paul Simon. Kappy joined our campaign as a volunteer, and we all fell in love with her. She not only knew everybody, she was happy to drive the wheels off her car to be everywhere. In 1999, Kappy came to work for us in our Marion, IL, offices. She quickly became indispensable.  When it comes to southern Illinois, Kappy is a human rolodex. From Carmi to Cairo, Kappy Scates is a household name. On my behalf, Kappy met with countless people. She listened to their ideas and concerns--and did her best to help solve problems. And whatever the task, there isn't a town in southern Illinois that Kappy can't recruit a few folks to pitch in and help. People know that when you are on Kappy's side, you are on the right side.  Let me give just one example. In Ridgway, IL, Kappy helped a dental clinic. It wasn't easy; there were hurdles every step of the way. But Kappy would not take no for an answer. She got all the equipment and convinced hygienists and a part-time dentist to help out in this severely underserved community. I got the credit, but it was Kappy's vision, hard work, and determination that made it happen.  I could go on about all those Kappy has helped, but let me tell just one story--about a housekeeper at a motel where I often stay. Years ago, at 62 years old, she told me that she had never in her life had health insurance--not for a single day. She had worked as a cook, waitress, and housekeeper, but had never known the security of having health insurance. She hadn't even seen a doctor in over 20 years. Enter Kappy Scates. Kappy spent hours meeting with her and helping her figure out a solution. Finally, because of the Affordable Care Act and Kappy's help signing her up--she was able to afford health insurance for the first time in her life. But that is not the end of the story.  You see, after my friend saw a doctor for the first time in more than two decades, she was told she was diabetic. Fortunately, Kappy had stayed in touch. She drove her to doctor appointments and helped get the critical medications she needed. It probably saved her life. That is who Kappy is--always going above and beyond the call of duty. She has a great heart and pours it into everything she does.  I want to thank Steve--Kappy's husband of more than 56 years--their children: Steve, Carole, Tim, Susie, and 18 grandchildren--for sharing so much of their wife, mother, and grandmother with the community. I also want to thank the entire Scates family, who have lived in the Shawneetown area since the early 1800s. You can't set foot in southern Illinois without running into a member of the Scates family. They are the heartbeat of one of the best parts of our State. The Scates family farm is a well-known and respected family operation. In fact, it is not only one of the largest family farms in Illinois, it is known as one of the best. Throughout the years, the Scates family support and generosity have meant more that I can express in words.  I will close with this. I believe in the role of public service to make a difference. Kappy's years of service reflect that, too. Our Nation needs more people like Kappy Scates. I couldn't be more proud of the work she has done--and the person she is. I am honored to congratulate her on a job well done, and I am lucky to count her as a friend. I wish Kappy, Steve, and her family all the best.                          ____________________
