President, I was going to speak on a different subject, but I will speak further about our dear colleague Senator Lautenberg. I look at the flowers on his desk--it seems in the years I have been here I have seen too many colleagues' flowers there. Of course, every day Frank Lautenberg was here, I had the privilege of serving with him, a dear friend. I missed him when he left the Senate and was overjoyed when he came back to the Senate. He was a man who cared about his country, cared about the Senate, cared about the people.  He was a man who came from humble beginnings and became extremely wealthy. He spent a lot of time giving that wealth away. He was the last combat veteran--in fact, the last veteran from World War II serving in this body. Those of us who got to know him and spent time hearing of those horrendous times in Europe during World War II are better for it. We realized a person who had served the country during that time did more than any of the rest of us.  I will speak further about my friend Frank Lautenberg. I know Marcelle and I extend our love to Bonnie and his children, his family.  I ask consent to speak as in morning business.
