The Senator from Nevada is absolutely right, to answer his question. We have been available to everybody. Since the bombing, I have been able to go back a couple of times to Vermont, mainly to tell Vermonters what has happened. I do not know the number of faxes and calls I had from Senators around the country who had questions, and we tried to get answers to them. I sometimes get e-mails at 2 a.m., going back and forth. So I do not know any Senator who could say they have not had an opportunity.  The Senator from South Dakota is absolutely right; as I said, I have tried to keep him briefed. I know Senator Hatch tried to keep Senator Lott briefed. I say to my friend from Wisconsin, is it moving faster than I would like to see such legislation move? Yes. Are we facing other threats in this country today? I believe we are.  I also might say this bill does not answer all of those threats. We will at some appropriate time go back and look at the number of things that were probably overlooked by the Department of Justice or the FBI or others, things that might have prevented the bombings in the first place that were overlooked, things that have been gathered under the current law.  Having said all of that, and notwithstanding the fact the current law was not used as well as it should have been by the Department of Justice and others, we have made some improvements, but the House has also made changes.  I ask my friend from Nevada, who is the distinguished deputy majority leader, would it not be his assumption that ultimately the final version of this bill will come out of that conference between the Senate and the House? But we cannot get to conference until we get the bill off the floor.
