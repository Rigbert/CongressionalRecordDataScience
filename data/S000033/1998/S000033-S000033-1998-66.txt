 Chairman, I thank the gentleman from South Dakota for his comments.  Mr. Chairman, the Starbase program is a chance for Members in the House to support their National Guard and to fund an educational program that represents just the kind of policy initiatives we need in this country. It is endorsed by the National Guard Association of the United States and cosponsored by the gentleman from South Dakota (Mr. Thune), the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Bonior) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Bentsen). I would just conclude by thanking the gentleman from Florida very much and the other Members for their support for this important initiative.                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Bentsen
