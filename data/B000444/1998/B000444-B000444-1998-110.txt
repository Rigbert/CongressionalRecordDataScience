 President, let's stop being hypocritical. We just passed an amendment saying safety is important; the NRA is eligible for Federal funds to teach safety. If the ultimate safety of children is what we are concerned about, why are we so upset about the idea that trigger locks will be placed on guns? How can you vote, as I will and have, to give the NRA eligibility to teach gun safety, which I want them to do, and say that is important, but it is not important to take the one step we can that will at least incrementally increase safety of children in the United States of America?  Please vote no on the motion to table.
