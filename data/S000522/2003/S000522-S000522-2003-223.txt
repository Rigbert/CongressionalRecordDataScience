Mr. Speaker, we have no further requests for time. In conclusion, I would like to thank Walker Roberts on our staff, and the other unsung heroes of this legislation and other bills that come before this body. The staff who painstakingly work on the details. I thank Peter Smith, who worked very hard on this bill, and George Phillips on my personal staff who has been a real honcho, pushing this bill through to final passage.  Thank you to all of our staff and the staff of the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos) as well who have worked very hard. It has been a great product of cooperation, and the poorest of the poor will benefit when this is enacted in the law.
