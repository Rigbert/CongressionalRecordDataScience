Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me.  Mr. Speaker, I have not listened to all of the debate, but I know the substance of I think all the debate. There has been some discussion about dishonesty, misrepresentation that existed on the pro-choice side, and I suggest to Members that exists on the pro-life side of this issue.  Mr. Speaker, I will oppose this bill, and will offer at the appropriate time legislation which will in fact speak to stopping late-term abortions.  Will it have exceptions? Yes, it will. I think the overwhelming majority of Americans support exceptions. In fact, the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Hyde] supports exceptions, rape and incest. As I have pointed out to the Committee on Rules, rape and incest is not a physical competition, it is a mental health exception.  I think, in fairness to the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Hyde], he intellectually does not believe that ought to be accepted. I think he is intellectually honest in that position. We have legitimate differences.  This bill deals with one procedure, as if to say that this procedure ought to be eliminated. My good friend, the gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. Smith], for whom I have great respect and affection, will tell us, I think, that none of the alternative procedures are humane, are appropriate, are anything but murder. I think that is his position.
