 Mr. President, this proposal of the Senator from Illinois is very similar to a provision of the post-Katrina Stafford Act reforms that were reported by the Homeland Security Committee. The Senator from Illinois is absolutely right that we need to do a far better job in this country of developing comprehensive plans for the evacuation of individuals with special needs before, during, and after a disaster.  When we look at the experience with Hurricane Katrina, what we find is those who were left behind were predominantly elderly and disabled. Those were the characteristics that caused people to not be able to evacuate. Another factor was they tended to be lower income individuals, too. But the disabled individuals of the area, in Louisiana in particular, also actually had the experience of going to Red Cross shelters and being turned away, which is something I have discussed with the Red Cross.  So I think it is a good idea to require State and local governments to develop these kinds of plans, and I am happy to accept the amendment. I urge adoption of the amendment.
