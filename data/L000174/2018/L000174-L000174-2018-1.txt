President, I would like to take a moment to recognize the career and service of Senator Joe Donnelly. Senator Donnelly has spent more than a decade steadfastly representing the State of Indiana in both Chambers of Congress. He has resisted labels and rigid partisanship, consistently proving that he is open to any policy solutions that benefit Hoosiers.  I have been particularly moved by Senator Donnelly's commitment to defending fairness in the workplace. He has fought for sustainable minimum wages and helped pass crucial protections for victims of pay discrimination. His work in Congress has made the workplaces of Indiana and the Nation fairer.  I was proud to work with Senator Donnelly in 2015 to expand the resources available to victims under the Violence Against Women Act. We have also worked together to pass legislation to ensure that law enforcement have access to funds to purchase adequate body armor.  Senator Donnelly's presence and his desire to bridge partisan divides will surely be missed in this Chamber. I know he will continue to do all he can to serve Hoosiers and our Nation, and I wish him and his wife, Jill, all the best.                          ____________________
