Not later than 2 years after the date of the enactment of      this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in      consultation with the Attorney General, shall prepare and      submit a report to the Judiciary Committee of the House and      Senate, and to the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the      House, evaluating the health risks associated with dietary      supplements not scheduled under the amendments made by this      Act which contain substances similar to those added to the      list of controlled substances under those amendments. The      report shall include recommendations on whether such      substances should be regulated as anabolic steroids.
