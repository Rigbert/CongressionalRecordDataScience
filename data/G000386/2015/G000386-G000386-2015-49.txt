  Senator Leahy has been a stalwart Member of this body since joining the Senate at the age of 34 in 1975. Four decades later, Senator Leahy continues to serve his State and our Nation with great passion and conviction.  Senator Leahy has been a good friend as we work together in leading the Senate Judiciary Committee.  So, Senator Leahy, congratulations on this tremendous milestone. I hope we can cast many more votes together as we continue to work in a bipartisan way on the committee.  I applaud the Senator from Vermont for his great commitment to service, and I wish him many more votes in the future.  (Applause, Senators rising.)
