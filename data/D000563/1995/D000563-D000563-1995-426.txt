Speaker, yesterday the new 104th Congress launched a new beginning, a new spirit of openness. In the name of that spirit of openness I am calling on Speaker Gingrich to make a full disclosure of not only all of the contributors to his multi million-dollar GOPAC, but also a full disclosure of the contributors to the Progress and Freedom Foundation.  This foundation enjoys preferential Federal tax treatment. The foundation raised $1.6 million in 1993 and 1994 from 95 donors. Over $400,000 from this foundation went to pay for the Speaker's college courses.  This morning the Roll Call newspaper, published in Washington, DC, has a front page story about contributions made to the Progress and Freedom Foundation by a biomedical company which then asked for help from the Speaker's office in terms of approval for a new home AIDS test with the FDA.  I think it is time for the Speaker to really fully disclose what is behind the Progress and Freedom Foundation and GOPAC. In this new spirit of openness the Speaker should open the books on both of these organizations. That I think would launch a real new beginning, real new openness, and full disclosure.                          ____________________
