 Mr. DeLay said in another quote, ``Those who want to regulate through government the participation in the political process, I respect them trying to do that; I disagree with it.'' That is the way he voted, as you have pointed out. ``We ought to let the voters decide through instant disclosure to be able to tell and see while people are collecting their money and spending it to decide.'' In other words, disclosure. These are disclosed.  My view is, in light of the fact they are disclosed, you will vote ``no'' on this bill. My obvious supposition is you are not going to do that.  Today, this bill is about politics. You have changed your principle, in my opinion. You have changed your point of view. That is why you are voting differently than you did on campaign finance reform.
