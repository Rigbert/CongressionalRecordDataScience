Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I congratulate Bethlehem A.M.E. Zion Church in Gary, IN, as it celebrates its 84th anniversary as a parish. The church will begin its three spirit-filled days of celebration with a banquet on Friday, November 19, 1999, and culminating with a service at 3:30 p.m. on Sunday, November 21, 1999. I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate Reverend O.C. Comer, minister, on this glorious occasion.  On November 19, Bethlehem A.M.E. Zion Church opens its 84th anniversary celebration with a dinner at 6 p.m. in the Banquet Hall of Unity A.M.E. Zion Church in Merrillville, Indiana. Dr. Sandra Gadson will be the guest speaker at this gala occasion. Dr. Gadson is the second vice president of Woman's Home and Overseas Missionary Society of the A.M.E. Zion Church. On November 20 the celebration continues with the church's second annual ``Back to Church Parade.'' A motorcade will leave the church at 10 a.m. on a ``ride to help bring people back to the church.'' The three-day celebration will conclude on November 21 with two special services of praise and worship. Reverend Comer will deliver the message at the 11 a.m. service followed by the 3:30 p.m. service with special guest and speaker, The Right Reverend Enoch B. Rochester, Presiding Bishop of the Midwest Episcopal District of the A.M.E. Zion Church.  A church of humble beginnings, Bethlehem African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church is the oldest A.M.E. Zion Church in the city of Gary. In November 1915, 15 people assembled in a storefront in the 1600 block of Washington Street in Gary, IN. The parishioners decided that Bethlehem A.M.E. Zion Church needed a permanent home, thus a frame building located on two lots at West 19th Avenue and Jackson Street were purchased. Later the frame structure was moved to the rear of the lots and used as a parsonage. A brick structure was eventually built on the lots at 560 West 19th Avenue, where the current church stands today. The congregation labored and toiled in the basement structure for over 40 years, but in 1962, under the direction of Reverend Arthur W. Murphy and the parishioners at Bethlehem A.M.E. Zion Church, theupper edifice of the church was constructed and stands today as a monument of faith and spiritual enrichment to both the church membership and the Gary community.  Over the years, the church has experienced some changes and was led by a variety of pastors. In spite of its many changes, the loyal parishioners continued to grow and prosper. On June 24, 1994, the Reverend O.C. Comer was appointed pastor of Bethlehem A.M.E. Zion Church. Under Reverend Comer's guidance, the church has started two new ministries including the Bus Ministry and the Street Ministry.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in congratulating the parish family of Bethlehem African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, under the guidance of Reverend O.C. Comer, as they prepare to celebrate their 84th anniversary. All past and present parishioners and pastors should be proud of the numerous contributions they have made with love and devotion for their church throughout the past 84 years.                          ____________________
