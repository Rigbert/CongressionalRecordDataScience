President, I have spoken several times this year about the so-called McDade law, which was slipped into the omnibus appropriations bill at the end of the last Congress, without the benefit of any hearings or debate in the Senate. I have described the devastating effects that this ill-considered law is having on Federal law enforcement efforts across the country. Recent articles in the Washington Post, the Washington Times and U.S. News & World Report also describe how the McDade law has impeded Federal criminal investigations.  For over a year, I have been proposing legislation to address the problems caused by the McDade law. My corrective legislation would preserve the traditional role of the State courts in regulating the conduct of attorneys licensed to practice before them, while ensuring that Federal prosecutors and law enforcement agents will be able to use traditional Federal investigative techniques. Although the bill does not go as far as the Justice Department would like--it does not establish a Federal code of ethics for government attorneys, nor does it authorize the Justice Department to write its own ethics rules--nevertheless, the Justice Department has supported the bill as a reasonable, measured alternative to the McDade law.  Congress's failure to act on this or any other corrective legislation this year means more confusion and uncertainty, more stalled investigations, and less effective enforcement of the Federal criminal laws. I regret that wehave not made more progress, and hope that we can work together in the next Congress, on a bipartisan and bicameral basis, to resolve the situation.  I ask unanimous consent that these articles be included in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, Oct. 19, 2000]                         Repeal the McDade Law       Two years ago, Congress approved a seemingly innocuous      requirement that federal prosecutors observe the ethical      standards of the state bars that gave them their law      licenses. Members probably didn't think that, in supporting      the proposal, they would be harming important federal      investigations. They thought rather to stand against      prosecutorial excess and show support for retiring Rep.      Joseph McDade, who had once been prosecuted unsuccessfully by      the Justice Department. Yet even as Congress was moving ahead      with the bill, many people--including in the Justice      Department and on the Senate Judiciary Committee--warned of      unintended consequences. Now the warnings are coming true.      The so-called McDade law has compromised Justice Department      investigations on matters ranging from airline safety to      child pornography.       State bar rules are generally not written with      investigative concerns in mind--and are sometimes written to      hamper prosecutors. Lawyers, for example, are generally      forbidden from contacting directly people whom they know to      be represented by counsel. The rule makes sense as a general      matter, but figuring out how it should apply to investigative      work is exceptionally difficult. A prosecutor investigating a      corporation who wants to talk with company employees could be      read to violate this ethical stricture if the corporation's      lawyers are not present. Such a rule would make federal      investigations of corporations dependent on the corporation's      consent. According to a Justice Department report, this      precise issue hampered an investigation of an airline--which      press reports identify as Alaska Airlines--for allegedly      falsifying maintenance reports. Unable to have agents      interview key witnesses, the department had to bring them      before a grand jury--a process that involved lengthy delays.      ``When the witnesses finally appeared before the grand jury,      they had trouble remembering anything significant to the      investigation,'' the report notes. ``After about a year of      investigation, one of the airline's planes crashed.''       In Oregon, the U.S. Attorney's Office recently notified the      FBI that it would not participate further in an undercover      program that targets child pornography. The Oregon Supreme      Court has interpreted state ethics rule to prohibit      dishonesty or deceit in investigations--with no exception for      law enforcement. That makes undercover work of any kind the      stuff of potential bar discipline for lawyers who get      involved. In a letter to the FBI field office, Portland's      U.S. attorney announced that, under the rule, ``the attorneys      in our Criminal Division cannot approve or authorize any      undercover operations or consensual monitoring'' at all. Such      an outcome has nothing to do with prosecutorial ethics but      will harm law enforcement.       The McDade problem needs to be fixed, and Sen. Patrick      Leahy is pushing a bill that would do that. Federal      prosecutions and investigations cannot be held hostage to      whatever rules 50 state bars choose to pass.                                  ____               [From the Washington Times, Oct. 10, 2000]               Federal Prosecutors Hostage to State Codes                            (By Bruce Fein)       If you think United States Secret Service protection of the      president should be held hostage to state law, then you      should love the 1-year-old ``McDade'' statute. Ditto if you      think FBI attempts to thwart or investigate presidential      assassinations or corruption of Members of Congress also      should be held hostage. But you might think the McDade law      reflects federalism run riot, and thus champion its overhaul,      like Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, Vermont Democrat, and Sen. Orrin      G. Hatch, Utah Republican and chairman of the Senate      Judiciary Committee.       Without hearings, the law was tucked into an appropriations      bill in a fit of congressional disenchantment with aggressive      investigative tactics symbolized (rightly or wrongly) by      Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. It subjects all federal      government attorneys in conducting federal criminal or civil      investigations to state professional disciplinary rules in      the state in which they operate. On its face, the McDade law      seems unalarming. Why shouldn't federal attorneys conform to      the same ethical standards required of their professional      colleagues whether in private practice of state government?       The answer is that the parochial perspectives of states may      discount or overlook broader and compelling federal law      enforcement interests. The state of Oregon sports a typical      disciplinary rule prohibiting attorney dishonesty, deceit or      misrepresentation. It has been interpreted to prohibit      federal prosecutors from either authorizing or supervising      undercover operations of the FBI or consensual monitoring of      conversations by informants. Under the McDade law, for      instance, suppose the United States Attorney in Oregon and      the FBI suspect an attempted assassination of President      Clinton during a fund-raising visit to Portland by      extremists. A plan is devised to infiltrate an informant into      the suspected circle of conspirators with an electronic      recording device to forestall the villainy. it would be      frustrated by Oregon's disciplinary code coupled with the      McDade law.       Federal terrorism investigations or prosecutions are      likewise jeopardized in Oregon. Suppose a terrorist suspect      pleads guilty to a federal conspiracy offense and agrees to      cooperate in the apprehension and trial of co-conspirators in      exchange for a lenient sentence. The United States Attorney      contemplates the terrorist-informant's use of an electronic      recording or transmitting device to prove the guilt of the      conspirators from their own words. The U.S. Supreme Court      held in United States vs. White (1971) that such      investigatory deceit is no affront to the Constitution, and      added: ``An electronic recording will many times produce a      more reliable rendition of what a defendant has said than      will the unaided memory of a police agent. It may also be      that with the recording in existence it is less likely that      the informant will change his mind, less chance that threat      or injury will suppress unfavorable evidence, and less chance      that cross-examination will confound the testimony.''       Under the McDade law in Oregon, however, the United States      Attorney would be required to forgo his impeccable plan for      electronic monitoring to ensnare a nest of terrorists.       Its mischief is not confined to these troublesome      hypotheticals, but handcuffs the investigation of every      federal crime and has thrown a spanner in real cases. The FBI      initiated an ``Innocent Images'' investigation in Portland      spurred the burgeoning problem of child pornography and      exploitation in Oregon. The United States Attorney shut down      the operation because fearful that the involvement of      undercover agents and the monitoring of telephone calls with      the consent of but one party could be deemed deceitful by the      State Bar.       During a recent Oregon drug trafficking investigation, the      FBI located a cooperating witness willing to use an      electronic monitoring device to record the conversations of      drug trafficking suspects. The United States Attorney nixed      the idea because of the McDade law.       In 1980, the FBI's Abscam investigation employed undercover      agents to implicate six House members and one senator in      corruption. One videotape captured Rep. John W. Jenrette Jr.,      South Carolina Democrat, confessing to an agent, ``I've got      larceny in my blood.'' Abscam would have been problematic if      the McDade law had then been in effect.       A recurring impediment in all states are codes that      prohibit federal attorneys and their agents from contacting      and interviewing corporate employees without the consent and      presence of corporate counsel. In California, the FBI's      investigation of Alaska Airlines maintenance records through      separate interviews of employees was thwarted by a company      attorney's claiming to represent all. After a Jan. 31, 2000,      crash of an Alaska Airlines jet killing everyone on board,      FBI agents were blocked from questioning ground mechanics for      the same reason. Sen. Leahy, a former seasoned prosecutor,      lamented: ``[T]hose interviews that are most successful      simultaneous interviews of numerous employees could not be      conducted simply because fear that a [state] ethical rule . .      . might result in proceedings against the prosecutor.''       The Supremacy Clause of Article VI of the Constitution that      when legitimate federal interests are at stake, state law      should bow. It was underscored by the Supreme Court's ruling      in In re Neagle (1890), which denied California authority to      prosecute a federal deputy marshal for killing an attacker in      the course of defending Supreme Court Justice Stephen J.      Field.       An ethics code to ensure that federal government attorneys      turn square corners is admittedly necessary. But shouldn't it      be drafted by federal authorities sensitive to federal needs      rather than consigned to the whims of 50 different states?                                  ____             [From U.S. News & World Report, Oct. 16, 2000]               Federally Speaking, A Fine Kettle of Fish                          (By Chitra Ragavan)       Two Octobers ago, Congress passed a funny little law. It      was named after its sponsor, Pennsylvania Republican Joseph      McDade, but for the congressman, there was nothing funny      about it. The Justice Department had spent eight years      investigating McDade on racketeering charges. He was finally      acquitted by a jury in 1996, but by then McDade's health and      spirits were broken. The McDade bill was his payback to      Justice. It simply requires federal prosecutors to comply      with state ethics laws.       No big deal? Not quite. In August, the Oregon Supreme Court      forbade all lawyers in the state to lie, or encourage others      to lie, cheat, or misrepresent themselves. Under McDade, the      ruling now applies to Oregon's federal prosecutors. ``We've      handcuffed the agents,'' says senior FBI official David      Knowlton, ``not the criminals.'' The U.S. attorney for the      Oregon district, Kristine Olson, has informed the FBI and      other federal investigative agencies that she cannot     OK agents or informants to assume false identities, wear body      wires, or engage in undercover activities. ``In effect,''      says David Szady, special agent in charge of the FBI's      Portland office, ``we now have to go to a drug dealer and      say, `FBI! Would you sell us some drugs, please?' '' The FBI,      Szady says, has had to suspend 50 investigations, including      probes of Internet child pornographers, A Russian organized-     crime group, and a massive check-fraud ring.       Federal prosecutors despise the McDade law. David Margolis,      a senior Justice Department official and a veteran organized-     crime prosecutor, says McDade has had a major chilling      effect. ``Even I wouldn't go out on a limb,'' he says.      Justice officials are trying to gut the law before Congress      goes out of session this week. The department warned      lawmakers in 1998 that prosecutors would be lost in a morass      of quirky state ethics laws--especially during complicated      multistate investigations. But defense lawyers won the day.      ``Why should prosecutors be exempt from rules that apply to      all other lawyers in that state?'' says Mark Holscher, lawyer      for former Los Alamos scientist Wen Ho Lee. So far, no court      has dismissed a case or excluded evidence on the basis of      McDade. ``These are crocodile tears,'' says veteran defense      lawyer Irv Nathan.       Major headache. The biggest headache for prosecutors is the      American Bar Association's controversial Model Rule 4.2,      adopted by many states. It prohibits prosecutors from      contacting people represented by lawyers without first      talking to the attorneys. Remember when Kenneth Starr's      prosecutors ignored Monica Lewinsky's tearful entreaties to      call her lawyer? They got away with it because, since 1989,      Justice had defied Rule 4.2.       No more. Prosecutors now say adhering to 4.2 has hurt      white-collar probes, where securing the cooperation of      informers in often vital. In an investigation of Alaska      Airlines last year, company lawyers barred federal agents      from questioning employees. Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont      says, ``The pendulum has swung too far in the other      direction.'' But House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry      Hyde of Illinois says he's not inclined to repeal McDade.      ``That doesn't mean I'm for crooks,'' Hyde says. ``I'm for      ethical behavior both by law enforcement and by defense      counsel.'' Watching the fight from the sidelines in Joe      McDade, now 69. ``I didn't read about it. I lived it,'' he      says, of prosecutorial zealotry. ``The effort is not justice.      The effort is to break a citizen.''                          ____________________
