President, years ago, a friend from Chicago went out and bought hamburger meat at a local grocery store. She took it home, cooked it, and gave it to her five-year-old boy. That poor boy was exposed to E. coli and died a few days later, a gruesome, horrible death.  In 1992, four children died and 700 people were sickened by an E. coli outbreak that was traced to hamburgers served at Jack in the Box restaurants. That outbreak proved to be a pivotal moment in the history of the beef industry. The Federal Government revamped the meat inspection program which has led a decline in the number of illnesses from beef since 2000.  The E. coli outbreaks from fresh produce that occurred at the end of 2006 may prove to be the critical events for the produce industry as the Jack in the Box outbreak was for the meat industry. Three people died and nearly 200 were sickened in 26 States due to E. coli that was traced back to packaged spinach.  The breadth of the problem of foodborne illness is stunning. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that as many as 76 million people suffer from food poisoning each year. Of those individuals, approximately 325,000 will be hospitalized and more than 5,000 will die. Children and the elderly are especially vulnerable to foodborne pathogens. Despite these statistics, our food supply is still the safest in the world; however, there are widening gaps in our food safety system due to the fact that food safety oversight has evolved over time and is spread across several agencies.  As the number of foods imported from outside the United States continues to increase so do concerns that terrorists could easily attack our food supply and distribute a harmful product widely. It is more important now then ever to reinforce any potential weak spots in our food safety system.  Last month, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) designated the Federal oversight of food safety as a high-risk area. In order to achieve greater effectiveness and accountability, there needs to be a broad-based transformation of our federal food safety oversight. GAO concluded that the fragmented federal system, with 15 agencies collectively administering at least 30 laws, has caused inconsistent oversight and an inefficient use of resources. An accidental or deliberate contamination of the food supply could undermine consumer confidence and cause severe economic consequences. It is not a surprise that GAO placed food safety oversight on its high-risk list this year. GAO has been calling for a single food safety agency for the past 30 years.  Here is one example of where our current food safety system doesn't make sense. Take a pre-packaged ham and cheese sandwich that's available at your local convenience store. The way the sandwich is regulated depends on how it is presented. USDA has jurisdiction if the sandwich is a packaged open-face meat or poultry sandwich that contains one slice of bread. If the sandwich is a closed-face meat or poultry sandwich, meaning it has two slices of bread, FDA inspects it. USDA inspects the open-face sandwiches that are sold in interstate commerce on a daily basis while FDA inspects closed-face sandwiches an average of once every five years.  Here's another example that illustrates the inefficient use of resources. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) both inspect shipments of imported food at 18 U.S. ports-of-entry; however the two agencies do not share inspection resources at these ports. USDA import inspectors are assigned to USDA-approved import inspection facilities at these ports and some of the ports also handle FDA-regulated products. USDA does not have jurisdiction over the FDA-regulated products. USDA has inspectors assigned to these facilities every day while the FDA-regulated products may remain at the facilities for some time awaiting FDA inspection. In fiscal year 2003, USDA spent nearly $16 million on imported food inspections and FDA spent over $115 million. This is just one example of where millions of dollars could have been saved if one agency oversaw the inspection process.  Please join me in sponsoring the Safe Food Act of 2007, which addresses our Nation's fractured food safety system. The Safe Food Act of 2007 would create a single, independent Federal food safety agency to administer all aspects of Federal food safety efforts, including inspections, enforcement, standards-setting and research, in order to protect public health. The agencies and sub-agencies now charged with protecting the food supply, primarily housed at the Food and Drug Administration and the Department of Agriculture, would be transferred to this new agency.  A single food safety agency with authority based on sound scientific principles would provide this country with the greatest hope of reducing foodborne illness, and would also prevent or minimize the harm of a bioterrorist attack on our food supply. The Safe Food Act of 2007 would put authority for imported and domestic food in the hands of one Food Safety Administrator. The Administrator would oversee one science-based food safety law that would harmonize the various authorities that currently govern food safety regulation.  Our food distribution system has undergone many changes over the years. For example, in the past, it was likely that produce that ended up in a local grocery store came from a farm not too far from the retailer. Fast forward to today produce grown on a single farm in one state could end up on dinner tables in many states across the country. We cannot continue trying to use a 1950s food safety model to oversee a 21st Century food distribution system. That's like asking a propeller plane to keep up with an F-18. We need to change, to shed the old bureaucratic shackles that have tied us to the overlapping and inefficient ad hoc food safety system of the past and create a system fit for the 21st Century.

(a) Findings.--Congress finds that--       (1) the safety of the food supply of the United States is      vital to the public health, to public confidence in the food      supply, and to the success of the food sector of the Nation's      economy;       (2) lapses in the protection of the food supply and loss of      public confidence in food safety are damaging to consumers      and the food industry, and place a burden on interstate      commerce;       (3) the safety and security of the food supply requires an      integrated, system-wide approach to preventing food-borne      illness, a thorough and broad-based approach to basic and      applied research, and intensive, effective, and efficient      management of the Nation's food safety program;       (4) the task of preserving the safety of the food supply of      the United States faces tremendous pressures with regard to--       (A) emerging pathogens and other contaminants and the      ability to detect all forms of contamination;       (B) an aging and immune compromised population, with a      growing number of people at high-risk for food-borne      illnesses, including infants and children;       (C) an increasing volume of imported food, without adequate      monitoring and inspection; and       (D) maintenance of rigorous inspection of the domestic food      processing and food service industries;       (5) Federal food safety standard setting, inspection,      enforcement, and research efforts should be based on the best      available science and public health considerations and food      safety resources should be systematically deployed in ways      that most effectively prevent food-borne illness;       (6) the Federal food safety system is fragmented, with at      least 12 Federal agencies sharing responsibility for food      safety, and operates under laws that do not reflect current      conditions in the food system or current scientific knowledge      about the cause and prevention of food-borne illness;       (7) the fragmented Federal food safety system and outdated      laws preclude an integrated, system-wide approach to      preventing food-borne illness, to the effective and efficient      operation of the Nation's food safety program, and to the      most beneficial deployment of food safety resources;       (8) the National Academy of Sciences recommended in the      report ``Ensuring Safe Food from Production to Consumption''      that Congress establish by statute a unified and central      framework for managing Federal food safety programs, and      recommended modifying Federal statutes so that inspection,      enforcement, and research efforts are based on scientifically      supportable assessments of risks to public health; and       (9) the lack of a single focal point for food safety      leadership in the United States undercuts the ability of the      United States to exert food safety leadership      internationally, which is detrimental to the public health      and the international trade interests of the United States.       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--       (1) to establish a single agency to be known as the ``Food      Safety Administration'' to--       (A) regulate food safety and labeling to strengthen the      protection of the public health;       (B) ensure that food establishments fulfill their      responsibility to produce food in a manner that protects the      public health of all people in the United States;       (C) lead an integrated, system-wide approach to food safety      and to make more effective and efficient use of resources to      prevent food-borne illness;       (D) provide a single focal point for food safety      leadership, both nationally and internationally; and       (E) provide an integrated food safety research capability,      utilizing internally-generated, scientifically and      statistically valid studies, in cooperation with academic      institutions and other scientific entities of the Federal and      State governments, to achieve the continuous improvement of      research on food-borne illness and contaminants;       (2) to transfer to the Food Safety Administration the food      safety, labeling, inspection, and enforcement functions that,      as of the day before the effective date of this Act, are      performed by other Federal agencies; and       (3) to modernize and strengthen the Federal food safety      laws to achieve more effective application and efficient      management of the laws for the protection and improvement of      public health.
