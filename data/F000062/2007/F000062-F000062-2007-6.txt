 President, I am pleased that the Senate overwhelmingly passed the Federal Housing Administration, FHA, Modernization Act today. This bill would make much-needed improvements to this important program to give more homebuyers the option to get a FHA government-backed loan instead of the more risky products that have contributed to the current mortgage crisis.
