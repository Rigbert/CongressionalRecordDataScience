Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from New York. I enjoyed working with him on this bill. There being no more speakers, I will close, Madam Speaker.  Madam Speaker, H.R. 5719 is good. It is good. It is good for the taxpayers. And today, when so many people are filing their tax return, we should let them know that we are looking out for them, giving them protections they need and support that they deserve.  This is a good bill. This is a necessary bill.  The private debt collection program is an insult to the American taxpayers and our Federal tax system. It violates the public trust, and this bill will bring it to an end. It must end.  I urge all of my colleagues to support this important bill.
