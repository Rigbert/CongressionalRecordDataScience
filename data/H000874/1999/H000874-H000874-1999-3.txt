Chairman, I thank the distinguished majority leader for yielding to me.  Mr. Chairman, might I inquire of the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Armey) that in the event that the appropriations bills are not ready to be voted upon on Friday, does the majority intend to have the Members come back on Friday to vote on the suspension bills?
