  Mr. President, shortly the Senate will vote on whether to confirm Michael Mukasey as the next Attorney General or whether to leave the Department of Justice without a real leader for the next 14 months.  I believe that is the issue. I will vote to confirm Judge Mukasey.  For me, the Department of Justice has always been the beacon of law enforcement and justice around the world. I have always truly believed we had a state-of-the-art system of justice that functioned independently of whoever happened to hold the White House or whoever was in the Congress. This beacon has been dimmed in the last 7 years, and I am one who finds the Department in disarray today.  I think the real issue before us today is: Can this nominee be a strong and independent leader of the Justice Department in the remaining time of this administration? Can he depoliticize the Department? Can he restore its morale? Will he be independent from the White House?  If your answer is yes, then I believe we should vote for him. If it is no, then you don't mind an Acting Attorney General for the next 14 months.  Ten of the most important positions in the Department today have no permanent person serving but are either acting or interim. Mr. President, 21 out of 93 U.S. Attorney positions are vacant, and only two nominees are pending before the Senate for confirmation.  Cases have been brought based on partisan considerations instead of the facts and the law. U.S. Attorneys who did not initiate partisan prosecutions were summarily fired.
