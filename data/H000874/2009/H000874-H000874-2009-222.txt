Prior to that, I intend to have on the floor a provision dealing with statutory PAYGO.                              {time}  1345  We have not yet determined exactly whether that bill will be free standing or whether it will be on another bill that would be reported to the House. In addition, the food safety bill is possible. The committees are still working on other matters, and we hope to have the food safety issue resolved. That came out of the Energy and Commerce Committee, but there are a number of other committees, including the Ag Committee and your own committee, Ways and Means, that have expressed interest in that.  Those are essentially the items that we intend to deal with between now and the August break.
