Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that we are considering H.R. 3460, a noncontroversial bill that will renew the Governing International Fishery Agreement with the Republic of Latvia, and reauthorize the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Convention Act of 1995 and the Atlantic Tunas Convention Act of 1975 until September 30, 2001.  H.R. 3460 was introduced by Jim Saxton, the chairman of the Subcommittee on Fisheries Conservation, Wildlife, and Oceans on March 12, 1998.  The Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Convention Act delineates the involvement of the United States in NAFO, which is responsible for managing and conserving fishing resources from North Carolina to Baffin Bay, Canada. The Atlantic Tunas Convention Act is the implementing legislation for the International Convention for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas, and international treaty for the conservation and management of highly migratory tuna and tuna-like species of the Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, and Mediterranean.  In addition, language from H.R. 3498, the Dungeness Crab Conservation and Management Act, has been incorporated within this bill. The Dungeness crab language will allow the States of Washington, Oregon, and California to continue to jointly manage the Dungness crab fishery in the Exclusive Economic Zone adjacent to their States.  The Pacific Fishery Management Council has unanimously voted to urge Congress to extend the interim management authority that was granted to the States by the Sustainable Fisheries Act of 1996. This bill specifically states that if the Pacific Council, at any time, determines there is a need for and approves a Federal fishery management plan for this fishery, then the authority given to the States would be terminated.  This legislation is time-sensitive because the temporary authority given to the States will soon expire and Members should vote for this innovative conservation and management measure.  I urge an ``aye'' vote on H.R. 3460.
