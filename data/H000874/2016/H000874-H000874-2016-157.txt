 I would simply say with respect to one of these bills, the Debt Management and Fiscal Responsibility Act, I don't know whether that bill requires the House to do the same, but certainly both the executive and the legislative branches of government need to have a responsible fiscal program and analysis so that, in fact, we can move toward fiscal balance. I look forward to having that discussion next week on the floor.  Mr. Leader, we had a prayer breakfast this morning. It was a moving and very, I think, unifying time here in Washington where we had Republicans and Democrats and a lot of people from around the world attending. We talked about coming together. We talked about respecting one another, talking to one another, and serving our country and our people in a way consistent with our various faiths.  In that context, I am going to ask the gentleman some questions on the scheduling, but I am hopeful that the Speaker has indicated that he wants to consider some broad issues. He refers to five in particular: national security, jobs and economic growth, health care, poverty and opportunity, and restoring the Constitution. I am not sure exactly what that last phrase means, but in any event, I think all of us want to make sure the Constitution is honored and certainly adhered to.  However, it also appears--and we had this discussion last week--that substantive legislation--that is, translating thoughts and objectives and visions into legislation--may not occur in 2016. I don't know that to be the case, but I fear that to be the case, that we will not offer to the American people in this critically important election year specifics as to what we might do.  I mention specifically the Affordable Care Act, which I know the gentleman's party believes is not good policy, whether or not we were going to consider an alternative to do what your party has said it is going to do for the last 5 years, and that is repeal, but replace with policies. I think that would be a useful discussion for us to have and do so in a way that respects the integrity of each person's view as to what the best interests of our country are.                              {time}  1230  In addition, one of the pieces of legislation would be the Voting Rights Act amendment. I bring that up now because Speaker Ryan said yesterday, as I understand it, that he was in favor of doing a voting rights bill. I don't know that he went into specifics.  We believe that we need to address this bill because we believe it was substantially undermined by the recent decision of the Supreme Court some few years ago. He indicated that that was not going to be brought to the floor because of Mr. Goodlatte's opposition to that or, perhaps, the failure of Mr. Goodlatte to address that in committee.  I bring that up specifically because I know, Mr. Leader, you made the observation, and I think you are quoted as saying you believe the two parties can achieve consensus on that legislation, but we may not be able to move it forward this year.  Excuse me. That speaks to criminal justice system reform, not to voting rights. I think we can reach consensus on the criminal justice reform. I think both parties believe that there are substantial areas that need to be addressed in criminal justice reform. Senator Cornyn has certainly indicated that. Republicans and Democrats in this House have indicated that.  My question to you is with respect to the issues that I think we have all discussed and that the Speaker has discussed, such as: jobs and economic growth; health care; poverty and opportunity, which we believe is a very important issue; criminal justice reform; job creation; long-term fiscal agreements so that we can replace the sequester with a permanent rather than an every-2-year resolution; comprehensive tax reform, which almost all of us have said we are for--Mr. Camp brought a bill forward on that--comprehensive immigration reform; restoring voting rights, which I mentioned; taking action to address gun violence, which we are in favor of, and I think clearly your side has indicated that mental health is very much a component of that and you want to address that; and addressing our national security challenges, which I agree with the Speaker that is a primary responsibility and concern of, I think, everybody on the floor of this House.  My question, therefore, Mr. Leader, is: Do you expect any substantive legislation, rather than simply ideas that both parties might express and put out to the public, that would be transparent, specific, and on which we could have debates on alternative policies? Do you expect, in the relatively short time we have this year, to have legislation on the floor dealing with one or more of those subjects?  I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  I did take notes because you raised a lot of different issues.  The first point, you talked about Congressman Kenny Marchant's bill asking the administration to set a path forward. I agree with you. That is why I believe that any budget that comes before this floor should balance in the 10-year window. I am proud of the fact that, on this side of the aisle, we have been able to do it, because that shows you the path to solvency and how you deal with this debt through big changes.  You talked about what Speaker Ryan laid out. These are big, bold, new ideas. The Speaker says that they are going to go through committee. Every Member of this body, your side and ours, will be able to participate. The legislation will come through committee.  Knowing these are bold ideas and the time we have here, some will get done and some may not get done by the end of this calendar year, but that doesn't mean that we can't finish the job.  If we want to save this country and put us on a path of solvency and increased growth, these are areas that we find need to get done. We look forward to you working with us on all of these areas.
