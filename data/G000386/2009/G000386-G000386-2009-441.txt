 President, I would like to pay tribute to Edythe Salzberger, who passed away at the age of 99 last month. Edythe devoted her life to the belief that the creative process is both healing and life enhancing. An interest in art created by psychiatric patients led her to the Hillcrest Children's Center, a home for emotionally disturbed children, where she began her years of service to the disabled and distressed. A pioneer in the field of art therapy, Mrs. Salzberger wrote numerous articles, trained clinicians and other mental health professionals, established an art therapy program at Chaim Sheba Medical Center in Israel, and helped found the Washington chapter of what later became the American Art Therapy Association. Art therapy is based on the belief that the creative process involved in artistic self-expression helps people solve problems, develop interpersonal and conflict resolution skills, manage behavior, reduce stress, increase self-esteem and self-awareness, and achieve insight. It is used to treat patients of all ages dealing with a host of problems related to emotional and mental disorders, substance abuse, trauma, loss, neurological injuries, and psychosocial difficulties resulting from medical illness. A life-long painter, Edythe Salzberger combined her desire to create with her desire to help. She will be missed not only by friends and family but by all the patients and practitioners of the field she helped pioneer and the respected professional association she helped create.  I ask unanimous consent to have the obituary of Edythe Salzberger from the December 15, 2008, edition of the Washington Post printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From washingtonpost.com, Dec. 15, 2008]             Edythe Salzberger, 99; Pioneer in Art Therapy       Edythe Woolf Polsby Salzberger, 99, one of the first art      therapists in the Washington area, died Dec. 5 of anemia at      her home in Chevy Chase.       Mrs. Salzberger was a painter in her early years who      received an associate's degree from the Rhode Island School      of Design in 1931. She studied painting at the Museum of Fine      Arts in Boston and later with artists Robert Brackman and      William Shulgold.       She developed an interest in art created by psychiatric      patients and in 1950 began to study projective drawings under      the direction of Fritz Wengraf in New York.       ``I always struggled between painting as an end in itself      and practicing art therapy,'' she once wrote.       Moving to Chevy Chase in 1950, she began working as an art      therapist in 1957 at Hillcrest Children's Center, a      residential treatment facility for emotionally disturbed      children. The center, located on Nebraska Avenue NW on the      site of what is now the National Presbyterian Church, later      closed for lack of funding and was incorporated into the      psychiatric services offered by the National Children's      Medical Center. She also provided training to clinicians at      D.C. General Hospital on the use of art therapy, and      established an art therapy program at Chaim Sheba Medical      Center at Tel Hashomer in Israel.       Art therapy was a relatively new discipline when Mrs.      Salzberger began her career, and she became one of the      founders of the Washington chapter of what later became the      American Art Therapy Association. She published numerous      articles in professional journals and produced one of the      first films demonstrating the use of art therapy. Titled      ``Michael,'' the film was designed for use in university      classes.       She was born Edythe Woolf in Providence, R.I. In 1931, she      married her college sweetheart, Daniel Polsby II, and lived      in New Haven and Norwich, Conn., where her husband was a      businessman and farmer. She worked on the family farm during      World War II, when agricultural workers were hard to find.      The farm produced as many as a thousand eggs daily; they were      sold under contract to an Army camp on Cape Cod.       Her husband died in 1946, and she moved to Chevy Chase with      her three sons. She was one of the founders of Temple Sinai      in the District and was active in a number of Jewish      charitable organizations.       She completed requirements for her undergraduate degree at      RISD in the late 1950s.       In 1966, she married Henry X. ``Hy'' Salzberger, a recently      retired Texas department store executive, and moved to      Dallas. She helped her husband in the two organizations he      founded, Dallas Taping for the Blind and a local radio      station for the blind. She also lectured on art therapy at      hospitals and at the University of North Texas, and      supervised therapists-in-training.       When Mrs. Salzberger's husband died in 1994, she returned      to Chevy Chase to be closer to family and friends. She also      resumed painting.       Her son, Nelson W. Polsby, died in 2007.       Survivors include two sons, Allen I. Polsby of Bethesda and      Daniel D. Polsby of Fairfax County; eight grandchildren; and      two great-grandchildren.                          ____________________
