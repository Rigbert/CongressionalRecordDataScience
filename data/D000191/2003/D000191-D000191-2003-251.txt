Speaker, I am voting yes on H. Con. Res. 141, a hortative resolution with no legally-binding impact, but which has a lot of predictable political rhetoric about the need to reform the enormously complex and loophole-ridden federal tax code.  I am voting yes because the ``whereas'' clauses in the resolution are by and large inoffensive, if deliberately vague about the true intention behind the rhetoric, which is to fundamentally reform the U.S. tax code in a way that eases the tax burden on the rich and corporations and raises the burden on middle and lower-income Americans.  I agree that the federal tax code is too complex. Billions are spent trying to comply with its provisions. Though, I would also point out that the wealthiest Americans and most profitable corporations also spend billions in an effort to avoid their fair share of the federal tax burden.  The resolution is also correct to say the tax code is full of loopholes and special interest exemptions. Though, I would point out that these loopholes and exemptions, which largely benefit the most powerful in our society, did not get into the tax code by accident or osmosis. They were put there by Members of Congress at the behest of wealthy campaign contributors.  Although I am voting yes, I want to go on the record in opposition to the second ``resolved'' clause of the resolution, which in my opinion is too deferential to the tax reform concepts laid out in the February 2003 Economic Report of the President.  The President's report lays out its utopian vision of reduced, or ideally zero, taxes on corporations, reduced taxes on capital, and increased taxes on consumption and wages, which would hurt middle and lower-income Americans.  Mr. Speaker, if the U.S. tax code is going to be overhauled, I believe it should be made more progressive than it is today. That would mean eliminating special interest loopholes for corporations and wealthy Americans. Cracking down on tax dodging by powerful individuals and businesses. Doing so would allow us to relieve some of the tax burden on middle and lower-income Americans. Further, any overhaul of the federal tax code must not add to the crushing burden of debt we are leaving to the next generation.  Like Adam Smith, author of the pro-capitalism tome ``The Wealth of Nations,'' I believe in progressive taxation. Adam Smith wrote, ``The subjects of every state ought to contribute toward the support of the government, as nearly as possible, in proportion to their respective abilities; that is, in proportion to the revenue which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the state ... [As Henry Home (Lord Kames) has written, a goal of taxation should be to] `remedy inequality of riches as much as possible, by relieving the poor and burdening the rich.'
