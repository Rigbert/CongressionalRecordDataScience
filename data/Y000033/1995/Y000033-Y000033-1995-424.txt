Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to introduce today, at the request of six villages of the Cook Inlet region, a bill to address a long standing unfulfilled obligation of the Federal Government under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act to six Alaska Native villages within Cook Inlet region.  Nowhere in Alaska were the competing interests for land so fierce as in southcentral Alaska. Nearly 20 years ago, Cook Inlet region and its six villages entered into a series of agreements with the Department of the Interior that were intended to address the competing land interests in southcentral Alaska and, at the same time, provide for the fulfillment of the Federal Government's obligation to them under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act.  This bill that I introduce is intended to fulfill the ANCSA entitlement to the Cook Inlet villages.  The villages within Cook Inlet region have worked diligently to secure from the Bureau of Land Management 29,900 acres of high priority lands selected over 20 years ago. Starting in 1979, BLM had issued a number of decisions and had taken a number of administrative steps towards conveyance of these lands. In spite of this long track record of moving toward conveyance, the Department has now indicated to the villages that it lacks authority to make the conveyances.  I am convinced that the villages of Cook Inlet have an equitable argument that the conveyances are proper, and that further delay in conveyance will cause them unnecessary economic hardship.  My legislation provides the additional authority to the Department and directs that these conveyances be made with no further delays.                          ____________________
