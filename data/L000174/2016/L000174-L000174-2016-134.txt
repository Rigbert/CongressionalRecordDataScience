President, if the Senator will yield for a question without losing his right to the floor, we know that a person can go to a gun show or go online and buy a gun without being subjected to a background or identification check.  One of our local newspapers had an article about a reporter who communicated with an individual online--they had never met before--and then met that person in a parking lot and bought an assault weapon for cash. The person selling the weapon insisted on cash. When the reporter was asked if he had any identification, he said that he preferred not to give him any. The seller of the weapon said: OK. You look old enough. The seller sold the weapon to him for $500 from the trunk of a car.  I ask the Senator from Connecticut, through the Chair, if we made universal background checks mandatory and made it illegal to sell guns without a universal background check, might that make a difference?
