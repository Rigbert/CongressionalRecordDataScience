I am happy to have the statement from the Senator from Utah. I do not consider it an interruption.  Let me say as an aside, I think it is healthy for us to have this kind of dialog on the Senate floor, and I have made it a policy both in the House and in the Senate to always yield for questions. I think if this is truly a deliberative body, then opposing points should be expressed on the floor, and there isn't enough of it, there isn't enough real debate on the floor.  I thank the Senator from Utah for coming here in good faith and stating his position. I may disagree with it, but for the sake of the Record and for the sake of public debate, I am glad that he is here. I am glad that he asked the question. And I know he feels as I do, he opens himself to questions when he comes to the floor. And I think that is part of our responsibility.  I have been advised by my staff--I did not realize this--that when White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales replied to our request about the documents related to Miguel Estrada, they did not claim a privilege, which surprises me; I thought that was what they would say, that there was some legal privilege here or some executive privilege. Instead, the White House Counsel's Office insists that we already have enough information about this nominee, that they don't need to provide this.  So we had a nice discussion about privilege and whether or not that applies. It appears the White House has said: We are not going to argue that--because they know they have produced this kind of information in the past.  But let me go on for a moment and try to get to the heart of why this is an important debate. This goes way beyond any particular nominee. As I saidearlier, I have no personal animus against this man, Miguel Estrada. I admire him personally. He was an immigrant to the United States. My mother was an immigrant to the United States. I think immigrants bring a great deal to this country. They bring an energy and creativity and a courage that really makes this a great nation.  Miguel Estrada fits that category. He came here as a teenager from Honduras. He learned the English language, went on to be accepted, I believe, at Columbia University, where he distinguished himself as a student. And that is no mean feat for a person who is new to the English language. Then he went on to Harvard Law School, where again he distinguished himself as a law student. So in each and every one of these categories, this is a man whom you would move toward as a good potential nominee for the Federal court.  But despite all of this knowledge and all of this experience, when it came time to ask him who he was, legally what he believed, he just refused to answer. And the question is, at that point, Should the Senate have said: Well, I guess we tried our best; let's put him on the bench for life; let's hope for the best?  We cannot do that. And I will tell you why we cannot do that. Because under the Constitution, which we have sworn to uphold, and which we take very seriously, in article II, section 2, it says:       The President. . . . shall nominate, and by and with the      Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint . . . Judges      of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United      States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided      for. . . .  This tells those who are watching that what is at stake here is not just a discretionary decision by the Senate as to whether or not we will investigate a judicial nominee. We have a constitutional obligation. And if we believe in that investigation that a nominee is wanting, might not be a person suited to serve in the Federal judiciary, I think we are duty bound to vote against him.  Let's look at the record with George W. Bush, a Republican President, and the Senate, which for 16 or 17 months was under Democratic control. What happened? Did the Democratic Senate say to the White House: You cannot have Federal judges? We are Democrats. You are a Republican. Stop sending us Republican nominees? No. No. That did not happen.  In the course of that period of time, 100 judges, nominated by President Bush--Republican nominees--were approved by the Democratic Senate Judiciary Committee. I sat on that committee. I voted on virtually every one of those nominees in committee and on the floor. Those nominees were approved, knowing full well that the President had his right as the President to name his judges.  How many were rejected? If 100 nominees of the Bush White House were approved, how many were rejected by the Democrats when they were in charge of the Judiciary Committee? Two. One hundred approved; two disapproved--Judge Pickering of Mississippi and Judge Owens of Texas. Of the 100 that were approved, trust me, overwhelmingly, these were people of a conservative political philosophy, people who reflected the President's political philosophy and probably his legal philosophy. We knew it going in. That is the name of the game. The President has that authority. We asked the basic questions, were satisfied with the answers; the nominee moves forward. Two were rejected.  Now Miguel Estrada comes before us. Last Monday three more of President Bush's nominees were approved unanimously by the Senate, but Miguel Estrada still is on the calendar.  The question that has been raised on the Republican side is, why are you asking these difficult questions of Miguel Estrada? It is interesting to look at statements made by Republican Senators who are now arguing on behalf of Miguel Estrada. The first, of course, comes from Senator Orrin Hatch, a friend of mine, my colleague in the Senate, chairman of the committee. When he led the fight to oppose a Hispanic nominee, Rosemary Barkett, this is what he said:       I led the fight to oppose [Judge Rosemary Barkett's]      confirmation because . . . [her] judicial records indicated      that she would be an activist who would legislate from the      bench.  Senator Hatch is entitled to that decision whether she is Hispanic or not. But when we ask similar questions today about Miguel Estrada, we are being called unfair. He could ask questions and have doubts in his mind about whether this judicial nominee by President Clinton would be an activist. We are not allowed to ask the same questions about Miguel Estrada without being accused of being unfair to Hispanics. This is by any measure a double standard.  Let me give you another quote from Senator Hatch, who quoted Alexander Hamilton when he said:       The Senate's task of advise and consent is to advise and to      query--ask questions--on the judiciousness and character of      nominees.  It isn't just the character, it is the judiciousness, the judicial judging of nominees. That is a reasonable thing to ask. I could see a person with the most outstanding legal credentials, academic credentials and personal integrity, bring a philosophy to the bench which I think would be damaging to the country and our Constitution. Should I ignore it? I can't. I am dutybound because I have sworn to uphold the Constitution, to put men and women on the bench who will uphold it as well, and make decisions which are consistent with our values. Senators may see those values differently, but at a minimum we should be able to ask the questions of the nominees: What do you believe? What is important to you? When we asked those questions of Miguel Estrada, he evaded them completely.  Senator Schumer from the State of New York, on the Judiciary Committee, asked him a question similar to the one I referred to earlier, when Miguel Estrada refused to name one single Federal judge living or dead who he admired or would try to emulate. Senator Schumer decided to take a different approach. He asked Miguel Estrada to name a Supreme Court decision with which he disagreed. First he asked within the last 40 years and then he said, just in general, any Supreme Court decision you would disagree with?  Miguel Estrada, having served as a law clerk at the Supreme Court, in the Solicitor General's Office in the Department of Justice, with all of his background, having argued cases 15 times before the Supreme Court, refused to name one case in the history of the Court with which he disagreed.  What springs to mind? You don't need to be a lawyer. The Dred Scott decision, decided by the Court in the 1850s, which institutionalized slavery and led to the Civil War. Was that a wrong decision by the Supreme Court? I don't know of anyone who argues it was not. Miguel Estrada, who wants to go to the second highest court in the land, wouldn't name Dred Scott as a wrong decision.  Let's take another, Plessy v. Ferguson. This was a case which said when it came to race relations in the United States, the standard would be separate but equal, leading to a pattern of segregation in America finally broken by Brown v. the Board of Education in the 1950s and the civil rights laws. I don't know of a single person, other than some of the strangest and most radical, who wouldn't argue that Plessy v. Ferguson was a bad decision by the Supreme Court. Miguel Estrada, despite all of his background, wouldn't name Plessy v. Ferguson as a bad decision.  So to those who say the Democrats are nitpicking, you are really holding this man to an impossible standard, think about that.  I failed to add this. The same question about Supreme Court decisions you disagree with is a common question asked of judicial nominees. In fact, Republican Senator Sessions of Alabama asked that exact question of a Hispanic nominee, Richard Paez, nominated by President Clinton. When he asked the question, Democrats didn't stand up and say, that is unfair, that is a foul ball, you can't ask that question. Not at all. Paez answered the question, and for his forthrightness and candor before the Republican-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee, his nomination was held up over 4 years before finally a cloture motion was filed and it was brought to the floor.  For those who are following this, the standard being applied to Miguel Estrada is one that has been time tested on both sides. His response, sadly,does not meet the measure of what we should expect nominees for a lifetime appointment to the Federal bench.  Senator Larry Craig has also commented about this process. He is a conservative Republican. He would be proud of that description. He said:       Any notion that there is a rebuttable presumption on behalf      of a nomination--that the Senate ought to be basically pliant      in response to a nomination--is altogether unconstitutional,      even anticonstitutional.  These were arguments made by Republican Senators when the nominees came from a Democratic White House. Now with this one nominee being questioned as to whether he is going to answer the basic queries, we are being told we are unfair. Senator Craig said to do otherwise is to avoid our constitutional responsibility.  What is this approach we are seeing by judicial nominees where they are unresponsive to questions? It is not new. If you followed the televised hearings involving Clarence Thomas, you can recall when he was asked and replied that he had no opinion on the issue of abortion. Clarence Thomas, no opinion on abortion, this man who had been a Catholic seminarian, who had been a law student when Roe v. Wade was decided, said he had no opinion. He was allowed to get away with that answer. I think we learned a lesson there. We have learned it over and over. If nominees won't be open and honest with us when it comes to their beliefs, it puts us at a disadvantage in terms of trying to understand what they will do on the bench. It was predictable what Clarence Thomas was likely to do on the Supreme Court as a Justice. We have seen that has been borne out in more cases than not. The fact he would say to the Judiciary Committee with a straight face, I have no opinion on the issue of abortion, raises in my mind a question of his candor and a question of the Judiciary Committee's meeting its responsibility.  This is a statement or a quote from the Legal Times newspaper last year. This was Larry Silberman, who is a DC Circuit Court judge. It says:       President George W. Bush's judicial nominees received some      very specific confirmation advice last week: Keep your mouth      shut. Scalia called DC Circuit Judge Silberman at one point,      the latter recalled, and told him he was about to be      questioned about his views on Marbury v. Madison, the nearly      200-year-old case that established the principle of judicial      review. ``I told him that as a matter of principle, he      shouldn't answer that question either.''  When you start law school, if not the first day, the second day, we study Marbury v. Madison because unless you understand Marbury v. Madison, you don't understand why there is a Federal court system and why it has the power to review legislation passed by Congress. It is so basic. It is like saying, read the Constitution before you come to constitutional law class.  Here we have a man aspiring to sit on the Supreme Court who is being instructed, don't say a word about Marbury v. Madison, a 200-year-old court case. So it is a tactical strategy, used by nominees as often as they can get away with it, to say as little as possible.  Let me also go to the question of Hispanic nominees. Here we have a statement made on the floor that Mr. Estrada should be approved because he is of Hispanic origin. I am proud of the fact that, as a Senator from Illinois, I was able to appoint the second Hispanic district court judge in our district's history to the court in Chicago. He is from Puerto Rico. He has done a great job, and I am sure he will continue to. We have a growing Hispanic population in our Nation, and certainly in my home State. They bring great value to our country and to my State. I think it is reasonable--in fact, advisable--for us to bring to the bench men and women of diverse backgrounds so that when defendants and plaintiffs and their lawyers come before that bench, they see represented in the court the diversity of our Nation. I think that is a good thing to do.  When the White House has decided to act affirmatively to bring Hispanics to the Federal bench, I think they are doing the right thing. I applaud that. I think we should bring as much diversity as we can with qualified individuals to the bench. But the arguments being made that because we have questioned Miguel Estrada in whether or not he has been forthright in his answers has something to do with the Democrats' view of Hispanics' contribution to America doesn't hold up.  One of the Republican Senators said in the Dallas Morning News earlier this year:       If we deny Estrada a position on the DC Circuit, it would      be to shut the door on the American dream of Hispanic      Americans everywhere.  But the reality is this. Until last week, Mr. Estrada was the only Latino nominated by President Bush to any of the 42 vacancies that have existed on the 13 courts of appeal. In contrast, President Clinton nominated 11 Latinos to our appellate courts. He nominated 21 Latinos to the district courts. Sadly, when the Republicans controlled the Judiciary Committee, and President Clinton was in the White House, they blocked several well-qualified Latinos from getting hearings, including Enrique Moreno, Jorge Rangel, and Christina Arguello.  I recall the Moreno nomination. Enrique Moreno was born in Juarez, Mexico, under the poorest of circumstances. His family emigrated to El Paso, TX, where they worked as blue-collar workers. He grew up under the toughest of circumstances, but he went on to great distinction in law school. And he was sent before the Judiciary Committee and wasn't even given the dignity of a hearing--without being given a hearing and, certainly, no vote. When asked on the floor, Senator Hatch said that is because the two Republican Senators from Texas didn't approve him. Well, that is their right. Under the blue slip process--an arcane, but important process we have followed in the past--they could stop him, and they did.  I don't recall the hue and cry then from any Republican leaders that somehow it was discriminatory against Hispanics that two Anglo Republican Senators from Texas would stop a well-qualified Hispanic nominee. But they did.  The same thing was true for Jorge Rangel, nominated to the circuit court of appeals, who finally, after waiting and not receiving the approval of the two Senators from Texas, said: I give up, I am throwing in the towel. This is all about politics, and no matter what I say or do, they are not going to approve me.  He walked away from that process. That is an unfortunate example of what can happen.  Mr. Estrada was given a hearing and an opportunity to answer questions, and he has been given repeated opportunities to provide legal writings so we can make a decision on him. I stand before the Senate today, as I have in the past, to say if he is open and honest and cooperative with the committee, he deserves a vote. If we receive the legal memoranda and writings and have a chance to ask questions related to those in some areas he has not answered in the past, and he gives open and honest answers, then his nomination should move forward.  I see my friend and colleague from Ohio, Senator DeWine, in the Chamber. Not 2 or 3 weeks ago, several nominees from his State came before the Senate Judiciary Committee with Senator Hatch as chairman. Two of them were fairly controversial. The hearing, I am sure Senator DeWine recalls, went on for 12 hours. It was one of the longest I have ever seen. One nominee, Mr. Sutton, was given a lot of questions by a lot of different members and he answered them. Though I didn't agree with his answers, I have to say in all candor that he didn't avoid the questions, as we have seen with Miguel Estrada under the circumstances. So I think that is an important difference to be made.                         The Danger of Ephedra
