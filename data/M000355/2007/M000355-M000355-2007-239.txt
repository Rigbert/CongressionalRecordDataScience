 President, reserving the right to object, and I will not object, I want to take a brief opportunity to thank the senior Senatorfrom Tennessee, who was the brains behind this effort on the Republican side. It did enjoy broad bipartisan support. But the leader clearly on our side in developing and pushing for this accomplishment was the senior Senator from Tennessee. I just want to, on behalf of all of us who were enthusiastic about this piece of legislation, congratulate him for a spectacular job.
