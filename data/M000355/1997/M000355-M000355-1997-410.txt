  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Chair recognizes the Senator from Kentucky.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Nebraska for his very important contribution to this debate. He is, indeed, correct: What we have before us is an effort to amend the first amendment for the first time in the history of this country to give to the Government the power to control the speech of individuals, groups, candidates and parties. In short, a complete takeover of political discourse in this country by the Government.  I thank the Senator from Nebraska for his important contribution to this debate. This amendment needs to be defeated, and defeated soundly, in the name of protecting the first amendment. I am sure the Senator from Nebraska is as pleased as I am that even the reform group, Common Cause, is against this. Even the Washington Post is against this. Even the New York Times is against this. I mean, even the reformers think this is a bad idea. So this should be rejected and rejected firmly.  The good thing about this debate is it finally focuses the campaign finance debate where it needs to be focused. This is all about political speech. I thank the Senator from Nebraska for his important contribution.
