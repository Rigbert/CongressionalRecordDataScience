Speaker, I rise today to recognize a milestone in the long life of the City of Znin, Poland, of which I am proud to be an honorary citizen. June 3, 2015 marks 25 years of local self-government for the nearly 15,000 people of Znin.  Znin, originating from the Polish word for harvest, is nestled on the river Gasawka in Poland. Though the region has been settled for far longer, the city itself is nearly 900 years old and was once a major town on the trade route known as the Amber Road. King Casimir the Great of Poland visited many times and it was also a favorite of bishops through the latter half of the 14th Century. Fires destroyed much of Znin in the later 15th Century, but the town was rebuilt and boasted the first windmill, orchards, breweries and businesses. The 17th and 18th centuries brought disease and more fires from which the town did not recover well. During the First Partition of Poland in the 1770's, Znin was annexed by Prussia. The town was liberated in 1794 through the Kosciuszko Uprising. It became part of the Duchy of Warsaw a few years later, but was returned to Prussia in 1815. The town's economy developed through the 19th Century, with modern infrastructure and its population growing to 4,500 citizens.  Znin's residents successfully participated in the 1919 Greater Poland Uprising. A new town council was elected and Polish was reestablished as the official language of the town's nearly 5,000 residents. Between the two World Wars, the economy perked up once again and Znin boasted two colleges and both daily and weekly newspapers.  On September 1, 1939, the Nazi Luftwaffe bombed Znin to start World War II. Nine days later, German troops overtook the town and once again Znin was wiped from the map of Europe. The Germans renamed the town and its streets, the children could not go to school and hundreds of people were deported or shot.  After the war, with Poland under the brutal thumb of the Soviet Union as a result of the Yalta Conference, the people of Znin again faced repression and fear. Soviet industrialization brought development to Znin, but its citizens were forced to live under the Soviet regime while Poland was under the sphere of Soviet Communism. The people of Poland never gave up, though, and the ensuing decades saw uprisings as the people tried to liberate themselves. Finally, a group of shipyard workers in Gdansk brought light to the people of Poland. Over the course of a decade between 1980 and 1989, Solidarity moved forward culminating in the election of its leader Lech Walesa in 1990 and a free Poland.  Thus, on its 25th anniversary of return to self-governance, the citizens of Znin look forward. The fires of the past drive them forth, but the light of the future carries them to new possibilities. I am so pleased to stand with my compatriots in Znin as together we celebrate 25 years of freedom. Naprzod!                          ____________________
