  Let us also mention, especially those of us from the cold weather States, that they propose to eliminate, cut completely, the fuel assistance program, LIHEAP, of which 40 percent of the recipients of senior citizens. That means in the State of Vermont or in the State of Michigan, when the weather gets pretty cold and we have low-income senior citizens who need help to pay their fuel bills, it is gone. What happens to those people?  We should also point out that such wonderful programs as RSVP are eliminated. The Foster Grandparent Program is eliminated. Also, we should understand that at a time when everybody in America understands that this Nation needs to be competitive in the global market, that we need to have the best educated work force in the world, major, major cuts in education.  What a stupid approach, cutting your nose off to spite your face. Among other things, what this Republican proposal does is cut student loans by $33 billion. In the State of Vermont right now we have thousands of families, and I have had hearings on this, people are working 50 or 60 hours a week to send their kids to college. The cost of college is going off the wall.  If we cut back on those student loans, there will be hundreds of thousands of young people all over America who will never have the opportunity to go to college. To do this in order to give tax breaks to the wealthiest people in America is very wrong.
