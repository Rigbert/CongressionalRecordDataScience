President, I said earlier that I have never seen a time in my 22 years here when those who control the majority of the Senate would schedule a resolution of this nature as a President was leaving for a summit meeting--even some of the less significant summits, and certainly not for a summit with the leader of a nation that is, militarily, a nuclear superpower.  I can think of a number of times when there were issues that were as troublesome to Democrats, who had controlled the majority of the Senate, as this is to Republicans, or as they say it is--so long as it is limited just to investigate the Democratic President and not themselves. There were times when I was here in the majority with Republican Presidents, including President Ford, President Reagan, and President Bush, and time and time again we held off matters that we were thinking of bringing to the floor, even legislation, that might be a matter of some contention while the President was abroad at a summit meeting. At no time would even the most junior member of the Democratic Party, when the Democrats were in the majority, consider bringing up something like this while a Republican President was abroad.  I think it shows one of the most egregious breakdowns of any bipartisan comity in this body, to see this come up as the President is about to go to Helsinki. I think certainly in my 22 years of experience, it is completely unprecedented. I think it is outrageous. I think it is inexcusable. It does not mean that this whole issue could not be debated when the President came back. It might mean that we would have to delay our 2-week vacation by a couple of days to do it. But we might present a better face to the rest of the world.  It has become so partisan around here that we look first to partisan advantage and not for the advantage of the country. Some in Congress simply cannot avoid the temptation to jump the gun and demand another costly, time-consuming, largely unaccountable, potentially destructive independent counsel--provided it is only to investigate a Democratic President. Certainly, there is no effort to go and look at any activities of the Republican Party.  Senate Joint Resolution 22 does not advance the administration of justice. It was drafted and introduced before the Republican and Democrat members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and those of the House Judiciary Committee sent letters to the Attorney General. Those letters are congressional actions contemplated by the independent counsel law. This resolution is not and does not take those actions into account. We have begun a process that will yield the reports from the Attorney General that are allowed by the statute. We ought to give that process a chance to work.  This resolution, if it was a law, would probably be found unconstitutional. It certainly is not authorized by the independent counsel law. In my view, it isan inappropriate effort to pressure the Attorney General and to prejudge these matters. One of the main reasons this kind of a resolution is not contemplated in the law is to keep political and partisan pressure off the Attorney General. It perverts the independent counsel process.  The independent counsel law was passed to ensure that investigative and prosecutorial decisions are made without regard to political pressures. This resolution would subvert that purpose by subjecting the critical initial decisions about invoking the law to such political pressures.  It is not Congress' place to determine when to bring criminal charges. This body is ill-suited to that purpose. The administration of justice is ill-served by efforts to intimidate a prosecutor to begin a case.  The resolution of the distinguished Republican leader will serve only to undermine the investigation that the Attorney General now has underway and will undercut the independent counsel law. It will further erode public confidence in the Government's ability to do its job.  We ought to do our job up here and let the Attorney General do hers. We are having a hard enough time doing our own job. We have yet to see 1 minute of debate on the budget resolution which has to be passed by mid-April. We have not seen one single judge get confirmed. We have been voting them out of the committee at the rate of three-quarters of a judge a month, and none has come to the floor, not in 6, 7, or 8 months, and there are 100 vacancies in our Federal judiciary. The Chief Justice calls it a crisis. Yet, even though we are paid and elected to do that, to consider and confirm judges, we have not confirmed a single judge. We have not brought up the budget. We have a chemical weapons treaty which is languishing.  But we can break all precedent and bring up a resolution attacking the President as he leaves on a summit with the President of Russia, the other nuclear superpower, something that has never been done before, something that any Democrat, when we have been in the majority and leading this body, would have been ashamed to do to a Republican President because we know it was so much against the best interests of the United States. Even though it might further our own short-term political gains, we would not want to damage the United States, the President's credibility or the President's ability to represent the United States abroad, so we would not have done it and did not do it.  There are a lot of issues the Senate could be considering that are within our responsibilities, do reflect our duties in this Government and do reflect what is in the best interests of the country. This is not one of them. It is an affront to the constitutional separation of powers established by the Founders. Investigation and prosecution of crimes is left to those experienced in the use of that awesome power, not matters for a political body.  When I was a prosecutor, I knew as a prosecutor I had the power to bring or to withhold prosecution. It was not anything I was willing to share with any legislative body. I hoped I would resist that temptation if I were ever a legislator and not a prosecutor.  It makes as little sense as the call by some in the Republican Party for the Congress to be able to overturn any judicial decision of any Federal court by just a majority vote. This concept would have been laughed down by the Founders of our country. They wanted three independent branches of Government: The executive branch, the legislative branch, and the judicial branch. Government 101--in most schools, you learn it in the first or second grade.  What they are now saying, even though part of the strength of our democracy and the protection of our democracy is an independent Federal judiciary, even though we have a Federal judiciary that is the envy of all other countries because of the quality of the men and women in it and their integrity and their independence, we now have some who say, ``Well, cut out the independence, we will have the Congress stand up and vote to decide whether a decision is right or wrong in a court. We will just overturn it. We will become a super court of appeals.''  As though we don't have enough to do. We can't bring up a budget. The chemical weapons treaty isn't before us either to be voted up or down. We haven't even found time to vote to confirm 1 single judge when there are 100 vacancies in the Federal courts. But somehow we are going to have time to start reading judicial opinions and decide whether to vote to overturn them? I wonder how many judicial opinions most Members of this body have read since they have been here. I wonder how many are prepared to sit down and read the thousands delivered every year. This is balderdash of the first order.  Then, yes, the other thing they are going to do, there are now Members in the other body who suggest that if we don't like a decision, impeach the judge. Now, some who were saying that, I will grant you, have read--I have suggested that some don't read enough in this body--but some of those who say ``just impeach the judge'' when we disagree, they have at least read something. Unfortunately, they read Lewis Carroll's ``Alice in Wonderland'' and got stuck in the part where the queen says, ``Off with their heads.'' Every time the queen disagrees with something, ``Off with their heads.''  Well, we are a gentler and kinder nation, so some say, ``I disagree, impeach him, impeach him.'' My goodness, it sounds like the chipmunk chorus, like we hear in some of the songs at Christmas time.  This country was made by giants. Let us not have it torn down by pygmies. Let us respect our three branches of Government. Let us respect the independence of our judiciary. Mr. President, I have tried a lot of cases. Some I won; some I lost. But if I lost them and felt the case wrongly decided, I would appeal them. If somebody on the other side lost, they could appeal. That is what you do. I can imagine the hoots if somebody in one of these cases who lost, immediately said that we have to impeach the judge. We have appellate courts--appeal it. What are you going to do if you disagree with the appellate courts? Are you going to impeach them? Suppose they are upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court. I can see a delegation of us going right out that door, Mr. President, straight across the street with our torches held high, our pitchforks brandished, our tumbrels ``tumbreling''--the reporter of debates will have fun with that one--saying, ``We are here to impeach the Supreme Court, you naughty boys and girls. You voted differently than we think you should have.''  You know, I was reminded today of the first time that I saw a billboard to impeach the Supreme Court was when I was 18. I made my first trip down here. Some were upset that the Supreme Court didn't want to uphold segregation, so ``impeach the Supreme Court'' was their slogan. How laughable, in hindsight. How acceptable is the repeal of our segregation laws today. How laughable, in retrospect, were those billboards of that time. But at the time they were popular with a group. They were popular with a segment of the political society, and so that was why the billboards were there.  Well, I have no question in my mind that it may be popular today for some to say ``impeach judges'' when we disagree with them--but not for the high crimes and misdemeanors the Constitution speaks of, not for the only ground the Constitution allows for impeachment, but simply because we disagree with their decision. It may be popular with some.  In retrospect, it will be seen as laughable.  But at the moment it is dangerous. It is dangerous, Mr. President, because a democracy exists only if we have respect for the institutions of a democracy. A democracy exists only if we follow our traditions and our laws and our best instincts. This does none of that. It doesn't follow tradition, and it doesn't follow any laws or our best instincts. Most importantly, it does not follow the Constitution, the remarkable instrument that has maintained this Nation for over 200 years. It has turned us into the most respected, most powerful democracy known to history.  I urge all Senators, all House Members, all of us who have the responsibility, who have taken the oath to uphold the Constitution, to step back a moment, stop the foolishness of these calls for impeachment, stop the irresponsibility of refusing to fill judicialvacancies, stop the attacks on the President as he moves from his hospital bed to one of the most important summits he will have of his Presidency.  This does not mean we cannot criticize. Everybody is free to vote for or against any proposal of the President. Any one of us is free to vote for or against any amendment of mine or anybody else's.  But what we are not free to do is, for short-term political gain, is tear down the best things that make this country run. We are not free to tear down the Constitution on issues of judicial appointments or independence just because it may sound good in a speech back home or to a fundraising group. We are not free to try to design the timing of resolutions to embarrass a President when he is about to go into a major summit.  Frankly, I will put my money on the President handling that summit with all of the issues involved, from the democracy movements within the former Soviet Union to our own nuclear security. Maybe the President is better off to have some in this body distracted by voting on this, rather than thinking of other things they could do to try to meddle into the foreign policy leadership of the President.  Mr. President, I suggest that this extreme partisanship--and that is what it is--is something I have never seen in my time in the Senate, and it is time that we back off. It does not help the Senate. If somebody wants to state a selfish reason, it won't help any one of us either. Most importantly, it doesn't help the country. I have always believed that all the men and women in here are true patriots who have, or should have, the interests of the country first and foremost above their own political well-being or the political well-being of any special interest group on the left or the right.  Maybe they want to back off. Maybe it might be good that some would acknowledge that they picked a poor time to bring this up, that it really does jump the gun. I am willing to give the benefit of the doubt that it might even have been a mistake to bring it up now. I realize the possibility is very, very slim but I will even accept the possibility that it might not even have been brought up with the intention of embarrassing the President. I assume it was. But I will accept even the possibility.  I ask the same question that so many others have asked me: Why in Heaven's name? What have we come to that we try to send the President to a summit to represent everyone of us but knowing all the headlines will be ``Senate Debating Resolution to Investigate the President of the United States?'' We know that for some this is being done for short-term political gain for upcoming fundraising or fundraising letters. But the people who read the headlines in the newspapers around the world do not, and certainly those who will be at the summit do not.  So I think it is a mistake. We ought to get on to other things.                        antipersonnel landmines  In fact, I could suggest one thing that we could go to, something on which Democrats and Republicans could join is the question of antipersonnel landmines. Today there are over 100 million antipersonnel landmines buried in the ground in around 70 countries. Some of them are as small as a can of shoe polish.  Every few minutes somebody is killed, maimed, or injured from these antipersonnel landmines. Invariably the person killed, maimed, or injured is a civilian. The injuries tend to go almost in an inverse ratio to the age of the person. Some are children who are killed, or hopelessly crippled for life. In one country, I was told by their leaders that they cleared their landmines ``an arm and a leg at a time.''  This Senate has supported legislation on antipersonnel landmines that I have written, the Leahy ban on the export of landmines. That was something, in a rare show of unity, where Republicans and Democrats across the political spectrum came together and the United States has been able to take the high road of banning the export of landmines as a result. In this body, Republicans and Democrats across the political spectrum, including at that time the two leaders, Senator Dole and Senator Daschle, came together and supported legislation of mine to ban for 1 year the use of these antipersonnel landmines by the United States, the first time we have ever unilaterally banned such a weapon. Our hope was that when we demonstrated that it was possible for us to do it for 1 year, we could certainly do it for every year thereafter and again give us a leadership position with the world.  I urge the administration now to consider making that a permanent ban and to consider joining with Canada and others who want to seek such a ban throughout the world.  My legislative efforts have been very simple. It would ban production of antipersonnel landmines, ban the export of antipersonnel landmines, and ban the use of antipersonnel landmines. Country after country after country has now adopted similar steps. Country after country after country has notified me through their prime ministers, or through their presidents, or the head of their parliaments, and said, ``We have adopted this legislation.''  I must admit to a growing sense of satisfaction of seeing this done, but at the same time a sense of apprehension that not enough are doing it, and it is not being done quickly enough because every year more--sometimes millions more--landmines are put into the ground, and every year thousands and thousands more children and civilian men and women are injured. More and more years in vast parts of countries they can't raise their crops, they can't graze their animals, and their children can't go to school because of the landmines, Mr. President.  I have visited critical sites all over the world where the Leahy War Victims Fund is used where we buy prosthetics, provide wheelchairs, and give training and rehabilitation to people who have lost arms or legs from landmines.  My wife is a registered nurse, and she has gone with me when she was able to get away from her own duties at the hospital. She has gone with me to these various sites. She has helped people with the fitting of prosthetics. She has helped with the care of those in the hospitals.  I remember one time, especially, in the country of Uganda, after we had visited this site. We had American volunteers and others at one of the first sites at which the Leahy War Victims Fund was used. She came to me because there was a little boy horribly malformed and terribly crippled. She and the other nurses there had helped to bathe and clothe the child. She asked what was wrong with him. He was crippled by polio. She had hardly ever seen in her years as a nurse a polio victim, unless it was somebody who had polio decades ago. She asked how could this be because, as the distinguished Presiding Officer who is a physician knows, polio is one of the easiest things protected against. For everyone of us who has children, they automatically get their polio vaccination. We don't think of it anymore. She said, ``Wasn't a polio vaccination available for this young boy?'' And there was. The country had a polio vaccination program. But they could not get to his village with it because of all the landmines around.  So this young boy was never injured by a landmine, but he is crippled for life in a country where he is unable to work and grow his food, and in all probability will not live long because of the presence of landmines. So if the landmine doesn't get you, the landmine still gets you.  That is why, Mr. President, the only way you get rid of landmines is to get rid of them. Every single country has to ban them. And those of us who have the resources, the power and the technology should join together and start removing mines. This is true whether it is in Bosnia, where the mines are the one major threat to American peacekeepers, or throughout Africa, Central America, every place that landmines exist.  They serve no real military benefit--clearly not for our Nation, the most powerful nation that history has ever known. They serve as a terrible, terrible weapon to the children who pick up the little piece of metal thinking that it is a toy and have their face torn off, or are left with other terrible problems. They pose a terrible threat to a woman who goes to the well to get water for her family and has her legs blown off. They pose a terrible problem to the man who is out trying to harvesthis crops to feed his family, and he touches a landmine and his family no longer has a father.  That is why we should ban them.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
