President, today I join with Senator Cochran to introduce a bill that will provide parity between the retirement benefits granted to assistant U.S. attorneys and those granted to other Federal law enforcement officers.  There are 5,500 assistant U.S. attorneys in 93 offices throughout the United States, all of whom are serving on the front lines to uphold the rule of law. Having served as a prosecutor for many years in Vermont, I know well the integral role prosecutors play in the administration of justice. Prosecutors are a crucial component of our justice system, and should be recognized as such when they reach the end of their careers.  Probation officers, deputy marshals, corrections officers, and even corrections employees not serving in a law enforcement role receive enhanced benefits greater than those received by assistant U.S. attorneys. This is an inequity that should be remedied. By correcting this disparity, Congress would also help the Federal justice system retain experienced prosecutors. Of all the prosecutors who leave the government for the private sector, 60 to 70 percent do so with experience of between 6 and 15 years. With the Department of Justice's rapidly expanding role in combating terrorism, we cannot afford to lose the experienced men and women who serve in this vital role.  This legislation also addresses concerns about the cost to the Federal Government of providing enhanced retirement benefits to assistant U.S. attorneys. Proponents of the bill have helped craft provisions that would assist the Department of Justice in recovering money owed to the Federal Government as a result of judgments and other fines. By bolstering the Department's ability to collect the funds it is owed, resources would be freed up to provide the parity in retirement benefits sought by assistant U.S. attorneys. The result of the creative efforts to fund these benefits in an alternative manner is that the Department of Justice will, through its duties as the Nation's law enforcement agency, be able to provide the benefits its employees deserve at little or no cost to the taxpayer.  By passing this legislation, we will signal the Federal Government's recognition that prosecutors in our society fulfill a critical role. Congress can send the message that the service of these prosecutors is a valued and indispensable component of our Federal justice system. I hope all Senators will join us in supporting this legislation to ensure that Federal policy equally respects the contributions of all members of the law enforcement community in keeping our society safe and secure.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1729       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
