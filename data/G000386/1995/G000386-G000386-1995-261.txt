 President, with the seemingly never-ending stories of urban decline, I thought it would be a welcome change to tell about a community that has bucked this downward trend. River Bend Neighborhood Association is a community on the north side of Des Moines, IA. River Bend is unique in that it has taken control of its own future. Of course, there have been helping hands along the way, but the true reason behind their success is the desire and motivation of the community members to attain a better life.  The background of River Bend will sound familiar to many. The neighborhood consists of approximately 4,000 residents and the average household income is $11,880. Increasingly, River Bend was succumbing to the problems of crime, drugs, disinvestment, and abandoned property. Businesses were moving out, and corruption started to take over.  The key to halting this decline was the formation of the Designated Neighborhood Action Plan. The goal of the plan, which was started in 1990, is to better meet the needs of Des Moines' communities, with the emphasis on housing and infrastructure. The logistics are the tricky part. The plan involved the Des Moines government, Polk County government, and the financial services industry to invest in the Neighborhood Finance Corporation, the NFC for short. Due to this investment, the NFC is able to provide mortgage capital at low rates and planning services to keep private investment in local communities. This allows for low income families, even families earning as low as 30 percent of median income, to own their own homes, a goal most Americans share.  To date, over $35 million in private capital has been raised by the NFC--all from the local financial services industry. One notable figure is The Principal Financial Group, which has provided investments of over $3 million, continuing funding for operating costs, and leadership to keep the NFC in the right direction. Financial institutions like the Principal and others in Des Moines make it possible for communities such as River Bend to become productive and attractive.  Mr. President, I think the example of River Bend is an important one. The successes of River Bend are tangible: the fact that 161 homes have either been constructed or salvaged and new families are moving into these homes, the fact that crime has decreased, and the fact that over $4 million has been invested in the area. These successes are proof that something like the Designated Neighborhood Action Plan can work if it is given a chance. The key is to make more urban communities aware of such possibilities, and show that these goals are indeed within reach. State and local governments need to support partnerships like that of River Bend and the financial institutions of Des Moines. Having cleaner, safer, and more productive neighborhoods is beneficial to everyone in a large urban area, and this is the necessary common denominator that makes these partnerships work.                          ____________________
