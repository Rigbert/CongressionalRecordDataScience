 This amendment would eliminate questionable practices that have emerged since passage of Hatch-Waxman. I applaud the responsible intent of this amendment.  This amendment reduces the possibility for drug companies to play games and prevent competition. These drug companies have not been accountable to consumers. Simply stated, this bill helps to ensure that consumers have access to low-priced drugs. This is a good thing.  This amendment reduces the cost of prescription drugs.  I can't think of a better time to enact these improvements. The underlying bill, S. 1, will provide drugs to seniors and this amendment will ensure access to lower priced drugs to everyone.  I support this amendment and appreciate the efforts of the HELP Committee on this issue.
