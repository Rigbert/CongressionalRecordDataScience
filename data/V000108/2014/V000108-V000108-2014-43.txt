 The fact is the gentlewoman has mentioned this authorization is very dated. The world has changed. It needs to be reconsidered.  I deeply appreciate her efforts not just today on the floor, but in committee and over the years to essentially force the issue and to ask this institution to reconsider what the authorities should be going forward.  I certainly support her effort.
