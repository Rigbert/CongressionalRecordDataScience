 President, as I just indicated, we are here. We have been notified by the other side that they wish to have a lengthy discussion. We are here and prepared to do that and fully intend to talk about what we view as the flaws in the health care proposal that will be voted on in the House apparently sometime later this week. Therefore, I object.
