 I know that Congressman Regula and I, along with all of our delegation, feel this loss as deeply as we feel the others. I wanted to just mention to our colleagues that Congressman Vanik served from 1955 until 1981 and was affectionately known as Ohio's third Senator.  He is probably most remembered for his landmark legislation, the Jackson-Vanik amendment, that continues to connect U.S. trade policy to human rights. We in Ohio will always remember him as a true champion and leader on Medicare, Social Security and the plight of the poorest Americans.  I would like to yield to my colleague, my beloved friend, Ralph Regula, now for some words.
