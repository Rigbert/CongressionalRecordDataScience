Speaker, it is my distinct pleasure to announce that the Asian-American Medical Association will be hosting the 28th Annual Asian-American Charity Ball on Saturday, November 13, 2004, at the Avalon Manor in Hobart, Indiana. Each year, the Asian-American Medical Association honors prominent, extraordinary citizens for their contributions to the community. In recognition of their tremendous efforts, they are honored at a banquet and awarded the prestigious Crystal Globe Award.  The Asian-American Medical Association is a great asset to Northwest Indiana. This organization has dedicated itself to providing quality service to the residents of Indiana's FirstCongressional District in the medical community and has demonstrated exemplary service in its cultural, scholastic, and charitable endeavors.  At this year's annual charity gala, the Asian-American Medical Association will present Mr. Feisal Istrabadi with the Crystal Globe award. Feisal is a resident of Valparaiso, Indiana. He was born in Iraq and he has spent almost 16 years as an Attorney in Valparaiso. Feisal was recently chosen as Iraq's interim ambassador to the United Nations. He was nominated in January 2004 by the President of the Iraqi Governing Council. In June 2004 he was re-nominated, and he was then appointed by the President of Iraq. Feisal returned to Iraq within the past two years at the request of the government, to help rebuild the country. He helped write the interim constitution that is now in place and he also helped author the interim bill of rights. I am honored to commend Feisal for his commitment and dedication to the well being of those who seek his knowledge and leadership. His efforts and hard work are worthy of the highest recognition.  Although Feisal's career consumes much of his time, Feisal has never limited the time he gives to his most important interest, his family. He and his wife, Juliet have two daughters.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in commending the Asian-American Medical Society and Feisal Istrabadi for their outstanding contributions. Their commitment to improving the quality of life for the people of Northwest Indiana and throughout the world is truly inspirational and should be recognized and commended.                          ____________________
