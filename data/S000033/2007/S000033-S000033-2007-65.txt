 President, I thank the Senator from Michigan. I know his heart is in the right place. He will agree that we can spend zillions of dollars, but it doesn't do any good if it doesn't reach the people we want to reach. And we cannot turn our backs on people who fought in another war which is not in the newspaper today.
