 President, I will be somewhat repetitive of what Senator Reid has said, but I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be laid aside, and that the Senate now proceed to amendment No. 2515, and following the reporting by the clerk, the amendment be modified with the text I now send to the desk, and that the amendment be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.
