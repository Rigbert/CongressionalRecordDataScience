President, I was listening intently as the majority leader expressed a concern over the lack of progress that we are making; and certainly we are not making progress.  I also listened intently yesterday to the very distinguished Senator from West Virginia, as he quoted history and he quoted many of our Founding Fathers, concerning the subject at hand of unfunded mandates.  I have felt that unfunded mandates are the product of an assertive, greedy Government that has arrogantly injected itself into the dictatorial position that was feared most by our Founding Fathers.  And, you know, we deal with these subjects as if they are contemporary subjects, Mr. President, and they are not. Because in all of these subjects that we have been discussing that might be associated with the Contract With America, but certainly those things that 70 to 80 percent of the Americans want, our Founding Fathers dealt with these issues.
