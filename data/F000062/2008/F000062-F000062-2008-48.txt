 President, I rise today on behalf of myself and my colleague Senator Boxer to introduce the Brower Palisade Designation Act and honor the life of one of our Nation's most influential environmental stewards, the late David Brower.  The Brower Palisade Designation Act renames the North Palisade--a prominent peak in the Sierra Nevada--``Brower Palisade'' in his honor.  David Brower dedicated his life to environmental advocacy and helped shape the conservation movement in California and across the Nation.  His efforts raised public awareness about the environment and the need to preserve our resources for future generations.  Former Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall once referred to David Brower as the ``giant of 20th Century conservation in the United States.''  In 1952, David Brower was named the first executive director of the Sierra Club, one of the most prominent environmental and conservation organizations in the U.S. He held this position for nearly 2 decades.  David Brower's leadership led to the creation of many units of the National Park System, including North Cascades National Park, Redwood National Park and Point Reyes National Seashore.  He also played a significant role in helping to draft the Wilderness Act, which has preserved much of the Sierra Nevada, including his favorite group peaks, the Palisades.  Renaming the North Palisade peak ``Brower Palisade'' will be a lasting reminder of David Brower's leadership and invaluable contributions to the environmental community for generations to come.  I encourage my colleagues to support the Brower Palisade Designation Act and join me in honoring the achievements of one of our most notable environmental advocates, David Brower.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3304       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
