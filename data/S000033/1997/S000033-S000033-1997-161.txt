 Speaker, the good news is that Congress has made real progress in reducing the deficit in the last 4 years from $290 billion down to $65 billion. That is good. The bad news is that the budget agreement voted upon last night gives huge tax breaks to the wealthiest people in this country, the people who do not need it, and at the same time lowers the quality of health care for our senior citizens by cutting Medicare over a 5-year period by $115 billion. That is wrong.  Mr. Speaker, we must move this country toward a balanced budget, but in a way which is fair, in a way which helps the middle class and the working families of this country, and not just the wealthy.  While targeted tax breaks for the middle class are appropriate, it makes no sense that over half of the proposed tax cuts go to the highest earning 5 percent. Not only is that wrong, but it is bad economics. With huge tax breaks for people who do not need them, we run the danger of going through the 1980's all over again and seeing the deficit explode.  Let us move this country toward a balanced budget, but let us do it in a way that is fair.                          ____________________
