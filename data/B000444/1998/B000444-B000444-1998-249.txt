 President, several points. One, this is superfluous. In the actual resolution of ratification, we make it clear in paragraph 7 it requires prior consultation by the President before the United States can support even the invitation of any new member, No. 1. No. 2, we have the advise-and-consent requirement. They have to come here and get our votes to begin with. No. 3, this has nothing to do with cost, nothing to do with cost. It doesn't mention cost at all. No. 4, to say now there is an artificial pause is going to put on hold all those actions taking place in other countries to meet the criteria from border disputes to ethnic disputes that exist within those countries that would be necessary to be solved before they could be invited. It is absolutely superfluous, and I would argue it is dangerous in that it will send a signal that there is an artificial pause that really means no one else will be considered.  I urge my colleagues to vote against it. It is totally unnecessary.
