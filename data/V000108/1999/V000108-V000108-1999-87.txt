Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Moakley) for the recognition.  Mr. Speaker, I would want to use this time not only to express my support for the rule but to make a number of thank you's in all sincerity. I think the coming together of Members in this case in a very bipartisan fashion, to work together selflessly over a period of nearly 8 months, to engender the support again in a bipartisan fashion of this House, can lead the way to the legislative calendar for the next 2 years and simply want to again thank the Speaker of the House, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hastert), and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Armey) particularly for their consideration. I know they have reservations about this legislation.  I want to make sure that the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Bonior) is thanked and particularly the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Gephardt), the minority leader, for their inestimable help in this matter, and finally the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Archer) and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Crane) who I again know have very serious reservations about the legislation, as well as the gentleman from New York (Mr. Rangel) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Levin).  I would finally want to thank the steelworkers everywhere who have worked diligently throughout this crisis to make sure that the voice of workers in this country is heard, and those who have participated in the steel working group.
