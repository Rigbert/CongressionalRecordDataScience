 Mr. Speaker, it is high time that Congress starts to do what it asks everyone else to do: Live under its own laws. When I walk into a restaurant in my home town in Michigan, the owners of that restaurant must abide by a litany of Federal laws. The kitchen is regulated by OSHA, the doors and tables and chairs must abide by the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the employees and managers are protected by the Fair Labor Standards Act, Age Discrimination in Employment Act, and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to name just a few. Each year we pass more and more regulations on American businesses. It is time for us to start practicing what we preach, and walk the walk.  The House passed this bill before during the 103d Congress. Elements of this measure were approved by a whopping margin of 348 to 3. However, it was the last vote of the very last day of the 103d Congress. We have an opportunity to act again on the issue on the very first day of the 104th Congress. Let us [[Page H99]] take advantage of this special time as all of America watches and send a message back home that we are willing to live under the laws that we make. On the day we perhaps cut Congress' budget by $50 to $100 million, let us do the same thing, impose the same rules on us as on everyone else, the same laws that we ought to live under.
