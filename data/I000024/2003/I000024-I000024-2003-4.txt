President, I rise today to honor the memory of a courageous young Oklahoman who diedwhile defending his Nation. Private Jason M. Ward grew up in the great State of Oklahoma, and was a 1997 graduate of Broken Arrow High School.  Private Ward joined the military in April 2002, although he had been seriously considering military service for years. He married his high school sweetheart after graduating, and when Jason and Jordan welcomed their first son shortly thereafter, the duties of fatherhood took priority. After having another son 4 years later, Jason and Jordan began discussing Jason's longtime military aspirations and decided that it would be a good time for him to pursue a lifelong career in the military.  Private Ward was a member of the 1st Armored Division, stationed at Fort Riley, KS. His unit was sent to the Middle East in March to protect the freedom of this fellow Americans, and he was highly involved in the outstanding and courageous work of that unit. Unfortunately, Private Ward fell ill, and was scheduled to return to the U.S. for treatment when he unexpectedly passed away. His sudden death has left his young family with questions that none of us can answer, but we can tell them with confidence that Private Ward was serving his Nation with honor until this tragedy took his life.  Private Ward was only 25 years old when he died. I hope his friends and family know that he died a true hero, worthy of the respect and gratitude of every American because of his contribution to defending his country. His loved ones will miss him dearly, and our thoughts and prayers are with them today. And though we are all grieved by the loss of this man, we will never cease to be proud of him--Oklahoma's son and America's hero--Private Jason M. Ward.                         spec dustin k. mcgaugh
