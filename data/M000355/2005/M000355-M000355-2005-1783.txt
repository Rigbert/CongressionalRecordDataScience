 President, tomorrow, following morning business, the Senate will begin consideration of the nomination of Alberto Gonzales to be Attorney General. There are a number of Senators who wish to speak on this nomination, but it is our hope that we can reach an agreement for a reasonable time for debate and a vote on the Gonzales nomination. We will continue working with our colleagues on the other side of the aisle to lock in a consent agreement on the nomination. I encourage all Members looking for floor time to contact either the chairman or the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee as soon as possible so that we can have orderly debate with respect to the nomination.  I also remind all of our colleagues that the President's State of the Union Address will be on Wednesday evening of this week. Senators are asked to be in the Senate Chamber by 8:30 p.m. on Wednesday in order to proceed as a body to the House Chamber at 8:45 p.m. for the 9 o'clock address.                          ____________________[Page S677]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                                PROGRAM  Mr. McCONNELL.
