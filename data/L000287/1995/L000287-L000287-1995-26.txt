Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to a fallen soldier, a warrior, a warrior for peace * * * Yitzhak Rabin.  Today our condolences and our hearts go out to the people and friends of Israel, the Rabin family, and lovers of peace.  Prime Minister Rabin was a great man, a great statesman and a great peacemaker. He lived his life protecting the people of Israel and gave his life trying to bring an end to the cycle of violence that has plagued his nation. He was a warrior for peace and that will be his legacy. No assassin's bullet can extinguish the flame, the dream, that Yitzhak Rabin ignited in the hearts and minds of his people. Yitzhak Rabin may no longer be with us, but his dream for a safe, secure Israel, an Israel at peace with itself and its neighbors, lives on.  We have all lost a great leader, a great man * * * a man of peace. Bless him.
