Mike Mansfield; the Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Robert C. Byrd; the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Howard Baker; the Senator from Kansas, Mr. Robert Dole; the Senator from Maine, Mr. George Mitchell. During that time, I do not recall a case where a majority leader, even though they have the ability to call up an amendment, has ever done that without giving notice first to the Senator who sponsored the amendment. That is during my now almost 26 years with all these distinguished, both Democratic and Republican, majority leaders. Has it been the experience of the distinguished Democratic deputy leader that if the leader is going to call up another Senator's amendment, that they give the sponsor notice?
