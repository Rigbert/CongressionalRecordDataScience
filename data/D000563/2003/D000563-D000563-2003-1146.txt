President, let me conclude by saying the following: On the organizing resolution, the Republicans should offer to the Democrats exactly what we offered to them under the same allocation of seats in the Senate, 51-49, Democrats over Republicans. We offered to the Republicans 45 percent of the funding for the Senate and they took it and said, thank you; that's only fair. That is all we are asking for now. It is not unreasonable.  Second, the President's economic stimulus package is not a stimulus because most of the benefits do not occur in the first year. It is not fair because most of the money is going to people in the highest income categories. And it is reckless in terms of the deficits it is creating for this generation of baby boomers who are going to need Social Security and for our children who will have to ultimately pay for this debt.  The final point I make is this. At a time of national sacrifice, facing a war on terrorism and the potential of atleast one other war in some other part of the world, we are allocating tax cuts and deeper deficits instead of saying to the American people: Stand with us; take care; let us go through this time of crisis together and then as the economy is restored we will stand together and prosper together. Instead, we are saying: Tax cuts for everybody--as long as you are wealthy in America.  That is not the best approach to get America moving again.  I yield the floor.
