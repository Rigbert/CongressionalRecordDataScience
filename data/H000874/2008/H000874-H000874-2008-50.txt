We're going to have discussions. I'm going to have discussions with your side--with you, in particular--on this issue.  Again, I think there's nobody who wants to shut down government. And there's nobody, frankly, that doesn't want to make sure--for instance, let me give you an example: Unemployment insurance. We're very concerned about people who are going to be running out of their unemployment insurance. If we're not here, we want to make sure that there is authorization for the dollars--that are available, obviously--to be spent for extension benefits for people that run out because they can't find employment in the context in which we are now finding ourselves. So yes, that is possible.
