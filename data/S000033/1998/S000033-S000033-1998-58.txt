 Chairman, they are over 100 percent. These people who are lending the money are running to the Congress and saying, fund the IMF. Give the money to Russia so that we can make sure we get back our money at 100, 125 percent. The gentleman is absolutely right.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, I thank the gentleman.  I also have a letter from a member of the PRD party in Mexico, and he goes on at great length about the conditions that came out of the Mexican bailout and the disaster it has been for the people of Mexico; the fact that it did only bail out a few very wealthy people in Mexico and banking interests and wealthy people in the United States and yet has caused 20,000 small businesses to collapse and, I am told, economic calamity.  We need to change these policies. If we do not adopt this amendment tonight, we will never get them changed.
