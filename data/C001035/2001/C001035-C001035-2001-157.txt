The use of advance appropriations would provide our federal agencies the flexibility to alternatively fund large capital investments. Specifically, I am aware that the Navy is currently studying advance appropriations as a means to reform the way it acquires its ship in an effort to stabilize the shipbuilding program, flatten out budget spikes, and potentially reduce costs through economic order quantity buys of ships and their systems. I believe that this funding alternative should be pursued, and I hope to see the Senate provision sustained in Conference.
