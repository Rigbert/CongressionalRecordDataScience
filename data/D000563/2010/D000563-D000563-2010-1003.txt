I certainly understand we are borrowing a lot of money from countries overseas, and we want to see that come to an end.  That kind of indebtedness leads to a dependency which is not healthy forour economy or our future or our children. I certainly would agree with the Senator from Alabama on that.  I was not here for his entire presentation, but there are several things I think should be made clear for the record. The point is, some 9 years ago, when President William Clinton left office, he left office with a national debt, total accumulated national debt throughout our history of about $5.7 trillion. But when he left office, we were in surplus. We were actually generating a surplus in the Federal Treasury, and the surplus was being used to extend the life of the Social Security trust fund. We were adding more and more years of solvency to Social Security because we were generating a surplus.  It is hard to imagine that this was the case only 9 years ago, and yet it was. The government was then handed over to President George W. Bush, a new administration, an administration that ran on a platform of fiscal conservatism and dealing with overspending and the national debt.  What happened at the end of 8 years? At the end of 8 years, the national debt had grown from $5.7 trillion, on the last day that William Jefferson Clinton was in office, to almost $13 trillion when President George W. Bush left office 8 years later. It more than doubled in that period of time.  What happened? First, the situation beyond President Bush's control: 9/11, devastating to our economy. We know what happened. People stopped purchasing, people stopped traveling. There was a general concern about the safety of our country and the certainty of our future, and that took its toll on our economy. There is no question about that. I am not going to go into any suggestion that President Bush was culpable in that regard. He was a victim as we were as a nation on 9/11. But conscious decisions were then made by this administration after 9/11: For instance, the decision to invade Iraq was a decision I did not share. I was one of 23 Senators who voted against the invasion of Iraq. I happen to think that was the right decision to stay out of that war.  But, as a nation, we deciding to go forward. Congress voted that way. President Bush said: We are going to wage this war, but we will not pay for it. We will take the cost of this war and add it to our national debt.  If you look back at history, World War II, for example, most of us remember either reading about or seeing some evidence of war bonds--borrowing from the American people to pay for war. Yet we incurred a massive debt at the same time. Wars are costly.  President Bush initiated this war in Iraq and Afghanistan and paid for neither one. That added to our national debt. He also did something that had never been done in the history of the United States. In the midst of a war, President Bush said we are going to cut taxes. It is counterintuitive.  We know that in a war we need more money, not just for the ordinary course of expenses of government but also because of war costs. Instead, the President cut taxes on the wealthiest Americans, adding to our national debt.  Then came a proposal to modify the Medicare Program for prescription drugs. I thought it was a positive thing. We could have saved a lot of money if we would have built into it competition for the pharmaceutical companies. But the pharmaceutical companies did not want that. They prevailed. We ended up passing the Medicare Pharmaceutical Program, and it cost us about $400 billion, added to the deficit.  Start adding those things up and we realize that at the end of 8 years, a President who had promised to be a fiscal conservative left us with twice the national debt that he had inherited and the weakest economy America had seen since the Great Depression.  When President Obama took the oath of office a little over a year ago, he inherited this weak economy and two wars. He inherited another $1 trillion in debt that came out of this weak economy as soon as he walked into the office. So when my Republican colleagues come to the floor of the Senate and talk about how insensitive Democrats are to our national debt, I have to remind them when they were in control and their President was in control we more than doubled the national debt. We had two wars, unpaid for; we cut taxes on the wealthiest people in America; we added a Medicare Program that was not paid for; we left the economy in shambles; and left the debt for the next President. It was not a welcome that most Presidents would like at the White House.  Now come the Republicans and say: Well, the thing we need to do at this moment in time, with all of our unemployed, is to cut government spending.  I have to say to them, I want to cut out wasteful spending. But if you ask any credible mainline economist, they will tell you that cutting government spending in general is exactly the wrong thing to do when the economy is in recession.  What we need to do is to infuse the economy with investments and spending that will keep aggregate demand growing for goods and services, keeping people in business, hiring people, who then pay their taxes and go on to buy products that help others. That is the nature of the kind of economic activity that brings us out of recession.  So when the Republicans argue to cut spending in the midst of a recession, they are going to dig the hole deeper. There will be less money spent in the economy. There will be less demand for goods and services. Fewer people will be working, fewer businesses surviving, and the recession will get worse instead of better.  So the bill before us is a bill that has several provisions in it, and one of them deals with providing unemployment insurance for those who have no work. Now, I will concede the fact that we never dreamed this recession would go on as long as it has. But for many people, some have been out of work for over a year, some 2 years. They are desperate. There are five unemployed people for every job in America. What we provide is about $1,100 or $1,200 a month--hardly a sum that one can live on comfortably for any length of time in most places in America. But that $1,200 a month keeps families together--barely.  Now the Republicans come to the floor and say this is a serious mistake. Providing unemployment insurance, according to the Senate Republican whip, Senator Kyl, creates a disincentive for people to look for work.  Well, I would challenge him. I have talked to the people who are out of work and have yet to find any who believe they are basking in the glow of unemployment insurance. It is barely enough to get by, and most people are exhausting their savings.  Second, this bill is going to provide for additional help to pay for health insurance for the unemployed. If you lose your job, the first casualty is your health insurance. So the President said, we need to have our government pick up 65 percent of the health insurance premiums for the unemployed.  How much do they run? It is $1,200 or $1,300 a month in my State, the average for a family, health insurance plan. So it would eat up virtually every penny of unemployment just to keep your health insurance plan. So we pick up two-thirds of the cost, and the people try to hang on, paying about $400 a month so they can keep their health insurance.  What difference does it make if they lose their health insurance? Well, two things are going to happen if they lose their health insurance. They may qualify for Medicaid, which is a government health insurance plan, which we will ultimately pay for as taxpayers. They will certainly lose their continuation of coverage, so that if someone in their family has a preexisting condition, they may find it difficult to ever qualify for insurance again until they find that job and get into a group policy. If they have a child who is asthmatic or who has a serious illness, they may find that child uninsurable because they have lost their health insurance.  So when Members of the Senate come before us and say they are going to vote against unemployment benefits and health insurance, they are literally voting against millions of Americans who are flat out of luck and have no place to turn and are merely trying to make it and trying to get by.  Part of this measure is paid for in offsets and sources of revenue. I certainly applaud that.  I thank the Senator from Montana, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. But then come the Republicans and say: Well, let's put moremoney into this for all of the things included and take it out of the stimulus package.  Remember, the stimulus package was the President's way of trying to keep this economy moving with tax cuts for working families, a safety net for those out of work, money for local units of government that have seen a downturn in revenues, and investments in America's future.  Now, I have seen some of those investments, and I will just say that I think those are investments that will pay off in jobs today and in assets in America and that will serve us for a long time to come.  Two weeks ago I was up on the west side of Chicago, in Austin, where they opened a new family care health center. It is a primary care clinic for those who do not have health insurance or do not have much money, where they can see a doctor. It is going to be the nicest building on the block. It is beautiful. One-fourth of the money came from the President's stimulus package. It put a lot of people to work building it and now has created an asset that will serve that neighborhood and that city for a long time to come.  Two days ago, I was down in Caseyville, IL, 300 miles away from Chicago. I saw another project with about $1.6 million of stimulus money that is going to build a community retirement home in this area. I saw the people out working on the jobs now just this week.  Ultimately, beyond the hundreds who will build this project, some 50 will be full-time employees. We are investing back in the community, in high-speed rail, in highways and bridges, in basic infrastructure, and in things that will serve us for a long time to come.  The Senator from Alabama says: Let's stop doing that. Let's stop putting that money into those investments.  I think that is shortsighted. I think what we need to do is to follow the President's lead and to make the investments in our economy today to get it chugging and moving forward. That, to me, is the first step in reducing our long-term deficit. Until we get out of this recession, get people back to work, paying taxes, the deficit will continue to grow.  What is the second thing we can do to deal with our deficit? Health care costs. Health care costs are going through the roof. I have said before that the mayor of Kankakee, IL, told me last week that she just got the health insurance bill for 2,900 city employees for next year, and the premiums are going up 83 percent. She is going to cut back on coverage, more copays, more deductibles, and hope to get it down to a 50-percent increase. It will mean that in a city that is hard-pressed to meet basic needs, there will be an additional million dollars in health insurance premium costs next year for even less coverage. That story is being repeated over and over across the United States.  On Sunday, at a press conference in Chicago with four small businesses, each one told the same story, that they had reached a point where they couldn't afford health insurance for themselves as owners or for their employees. They told of terrible situations where some of them had children who were literally dropped from coverage because they couldn't continue to pay the high premiums that went through the roof.  The Republican side of the aisle has told us: Stop this debate on health care reform. Let's stop and start over. As the President said the other day, the health insurance companies are not starting over. The health insurance companies are continuing to do what they know how to do, and that is to raise prices.  Goldman Sachs is a firm with which most people are familiar. They put out a report very recently about what they considered the best thing for the health insurance industry. Goldman Sachs said, in this article that was published in the Huffington Post:       What the firm sees as the best path forward for the private      insurance industry's bottom line is, to be blunt, inaction.       The study's authors [at Goldman Sachs] advise that if no      reform is passed, earnings per share would grow an estimated      ten percent from 2010 to 2019, and the value of the stock      would rise an estimated 59 percent. The next best thing for      the insurance industry would be if the legislation passed by      the Senate Finance Committee is watered down significantly.  This says that the best way to reach higher profitability for health insurance is for us to do nothing. The second best way is to do very little. That is what we are being asked to do by the Republican side of the aisle, either do nothing or do very little, take baby steps, don't really deal with the issue. That is not going to solve the problem.  If we are going to provide competition and choice for small businesses and people buying health insurance, we should offer them what we have as Members of Congress. If it is good enough for us, wouldn't it be good enough for the rest of America? Our plan is pretty good. It is called the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. Eight million Federal employees and their families are in there. It has been in existence for 40 years.  My wife and I each year have an open enrollment period to choose from nine different private insurance plans in my State of Illinois. These are plans that have to meet the basic requirements of Illinois so that they are not plans that are worthless and they are plans that we pick based on our state in life. My wife and I are at a point where we buy the biggest plan, the high-option plan. The Federal Government pays a share of the premium cost; we pay the rest. We would pay less if we had less coverage. But if we don't like the plan, next year we have open enrollment again. We can pick another one. What a great idea for consumers, to be able to pick and choose, go shopping just like one would for an automobile, to pick the one that is right for your family, the one you can afford, the one that gives you the coverage you need.  If that is good enough for Republican and Democratic Members of Congress, Senate and House, why isn't it good enough for America? Why don't we have exchanges just like that available for businesses and individuals to choose from, the best private health insurance plan that meets their pocketbook needs and their health needs? That is what our bill does. Many on the Republican side have condemned it as socialism. The government administers it, at least sets up the plans on the insurance exchange. Guess what. Every Senator's health insurance plan would be socialistic by that definition. I don't see them rushing down to the Secretary of the Senate to cancel their coverage. They love it. I do too. It is the best health insurance you could ask for. To require minimum requirements in terms of what coverage it will have, that is what our plans do. When we say, do that in the bill, they say, there it is, government-run health insurance. It is not. It is private health insurance plans.  There are 50 million Americans without insurance. We provide coverage for 30 million. Those are people who, when they get sick, go to the hospital, get taken care of, and the cost of their care is passed on to everybody else who has health insurance. That is not fair. It costs us a lot of money as individuals. We pay $1,000 a year in extra premiums for the uninsured. Our idea is to bring people under coverage so that when they go to the hospital, their care is paid for, not by us but, in this case, either by private health insurance or by Medicaid, the government health insurance plan.  When we asked the Republicans, if we cover 30 million in our approach, how many do you cover of 50 million uninsured, their answer is 3 million. That is not much of an effort, when you think about it. I can understand why we need to do more.  There are two last points I wish to make. One is that if we are going to deal with health insurance in an honest way, we need to at least tell the health insurance companies that the party is over. First, their antitrust exemption, which they have had for 65 years, has to come to an end. Should they be allowed to collude and conspire on prices and divide up the market at the expense of consumers? We ought to put an end to it. The House voted to do that. Secondly, we have to put an end to the awful practice by many health insurance companies to deny coverage to individuals because of preexisting conditions, for example, or to say, if you get really sick, they will just cut you off in terms of how much they will pay. Those things are gross abuses. They need to change. The Republicans have yet to offer a plan that deals with those gross insurance abuses. Their baby steps don't even deal with the serious issues.  Finally, when it comes to Medicare, 40 million Americans count on it, those who are seniors and disabled. It only has about 9 years of solvency left. Our bill doubles the life of Medicare, another 9 or 10 years of longevity. That is good for seniors and for all of us. We want to cut out the waste, and there is waste. We want to provide basic quality care. But doing nothing, as many Republicans counsel us to do on health care reform, means Medicare will go broke in 9 years. I don't want to be around to see that happen. I want to be part of the solution.  My final point is this: We started off talking about the deficit and debt. If we don't deal with health care costs and bringing them down, we can't raise enough money in taxes to keep up with this skyrocketing cost. State governments, local governments, and the Federal Government will all be faced with this kind of increased bill and increased debt and increased deficit each year. That is the reality of doing nothing on health care reform when it comes to deficit and debt.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a New York Times piece relative to the health care insurance industry, as well as this analysis of managed care by Goldman Sachs and several articles which outline exactly what is going to happen. The health care insurance industry is praying that we do nothing because their profits will continue to skyrocket. That is not fair to the families across America.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, Mar. 6, 2010]           Obama Wields Analysis of Insurers in Health Battle                       (By David M. Herszenhorn)       Washington.--To bolster the case for a far-reaching      overhaul of the health care system, the Obama administration      is seizing on a new analysis by Goldman Sachs, the New York      investment bank, recommending that investors buy shares in      two big insurance companies, the UnitedHealth Group and      Cigna, because insurance rates are up sharply and competition      is down.       White House officials on Saturday said that the Goldman      Sachs analysis would be a ``centerpiece'' of their closing      argument in the push for major health care legislation. The      president and Democratic Congressional leaders are hoping to      win passage of the legislation before the Easter recess.      Republicans remain fiercely opposed to the bill.       The Goldman Sachs analysis shows that while insurers can be      aggressive in raising prices, they also walk away from      clients because competition in the industry is so weak, the      White House said. And officials will point to a finding that      rate increases ran as high as 50 percent, with most in ``the      low- to mid-teens''--far higher than overall inflation.       The analysis could be a powerful weapon for the White House      because it offers evidence that an overhaul of the health      care system is needed not only to help cover the millions of      uninsured but to prevent soaring health care expenses from      undermining the coverage that the majority of Americans      already have through employers.       Republicans, however, could also point to the analysis as      bolstering their contention that Democrats should be focused      more on controlling costs and less on broadly expanding      coverage to the uninsured.       The research brief is largely based on a recent conference      call with Steve Lewis, an industry expert with Willis, a      major insurance broker.       In the call, Mr. Lewis noted that ``price competition is      down from a year ago'' and explained that his clients--mostly      midsize employers seeking to buy health coverage for their      employees--were facing a tough market, in which insurance      carriers are increasingly willing to abandon existing      customers to improve their profit margins.       ``We feel this is the most challenging environment for us      and our clients in my 20 years in the business,'' Mr. Lewis      said, according to a transcript included in the Goldman      brief. ``Not only is price competition down from a year      ago,'' he added, ``but trend or (health care) inflation is      also up and appears to be rising. The incumbent carriers seem      more willing than ever to walk away from existing business      resulting in some carrier changes.''       The report also indicated that employers are reducing      benefit levels, in some cases by adding deductibles for      prescription drug coverage in addition to co-payments, and      raising other out-of-pocket costs for employees as a way of      lowering the cost of insurance without increasing annual      premiums and employee contributions to them.       Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human      services, is expected to discuss the Goldman analysis on two      Sunday television talk shows, ``Meet the Press'' on NBC and      ``This Week'' on ABC.       In his call with Goldman, Mr. Lewis said beneficiaries were      feeling the brunt of the changes to existing policies.      ``Visually to employees, they're fairly significant,'' he      said.       But the report also sounded cautionary notes that the      administration will probably not want to highlight.       Asked by Goldman analysts about the effort to pass major      health care legislation, Mr. Lewis said many employers      experiencing increases in their insurance costs were      nonetheless apprehensive about the president's proposal.       ``They're very mixed in their reaction, quite candidly      consistent with what we're seeing in the polling numbers by      party lines,'' Mr. Lewis said. ``I think most people would      acknowledge that there's a need for health care reform;      employers continue to be very frustrated. So when they look      at what the Obama administration and the Democratic majority      state as their goals to increase access and lower cost and      rail at what may be termed oligopolistic behavior of carriers      in certain markets, I think employers really buy in to that      message and have much of that frustration and anger at our      lack of solutions.''       And yet, he said, there is little enthusiastic support from      employers for the Democrats' proposals.       ``Many of them still view the legislation and the      partisanship coming out of Washington as possibly the      medicine worse than the disease,'' he said. ``So many      employer groups that we're talking to feel like it would be a      shame to lose an opportunity to do something with respect to      health care reform. But many are starting to feel like maybe      nothing is better than something in this current      environment.''                                  ____                   [From Goldman Sachs, Mar. 3, 2010]  Americas: Managed Care--A Front-Line Perspective on 2010 Commercial                          Price & Product Trends         Transcript from our sixth annual call with Steve Lewis       We hosted our seventh-annual industry expert conference      call with Steve Lewis, regional leader for the employee      benefits practice of Willis, the third largest insurance      broker in the world. The call provided a front-line      perspective on 2010 industry pricing and product trends, with      a focus on the key middle-market segment of the industry.       A transcript of the conference call is provided in the body      of this report.           Industry price discipline has strengthened further       Two years ago, Lewis and his team were one of the few      industry sources pointing (correctly) to aggressive pricing      by the carriers in a lead up to severe margin deterioration      experienced in 1H2008. Then, a year ago, Lewis and his team      pointed to stronger pricing discipline by most of the public      companies (though with some outliers). Now, Lewis and his      team find price discipline has strengthened noticeably      further.          Our view is that the industry downcycle is bottoming       We note that the improvement in commercial industry pricing      discipline has emerged from multiple industry sources over      the past 18 months. Our view is that it reflects a recovery      from the severity of under-pricing during the recent industry      down-cycle that we think is now bottoming.       With the group, our favorite names are UNH and CI, both CL-     Buy rated. That said, ours is a sector call as we see a      ``rising tide lifting all boats'' as: (1) the cycle turn      shows in reserve building this year, with margin expansion      next year, (2) health reform uncertainty recedes, and (3) the      headwind to earnings from negative operating leverage eases      as we anniversary the severe member drop of 2009.               transcriipt of conference call with Willis     Matt Borsch, Goldman Sachs:       Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today for the      Goldman Sachs Managed Care Industry Expert Conference Call      with Steve Lewis of employer benefit consulting firm Willis.      This will represent our 7th annual conference call with Steve      Lewis.       Steve and his team have agreed to give us frontline      perspective on 2010 managed care pricing and product trends.      As background, Willis is the third largest insurance broker      in the world with approximately 350 million in employee      benefits revenues in North America with a focus on the middle      market employer segment.       That focus is particularly valuable given the lack of      visibility on the segment from the other health benefit      consulting firms. And let me just elaborate on that. The      context is that national employer benefit consultants such as      Hewitt, Mercer, Towers Perrin, and others really focus their      attention on the jumbo employer segment, which is      overwhelmingly a fee-based non-risk model.       However, the biggest earnings driver for the managed care      companies are the fully insured risk lives, and those are      mostly through the small and mid-size employers that buy      through health insurance brokers. And we found that the      brokers typically lack the scale and sophistication to have a      good perspective on macro industry trends.       However, as healthcare coverage has become more and more of      a significant outlay for employers, they've needed greater      expertise but are often under served by the national benefit      consultants that focused on     jumbo employers, so that's where Willis has built its focus,      serving as a high service benefit consultant for the middle-     sized employers.       With that as an intro, let me reintroduce our guest speaker      Steve Lewis, executive vice president at Willis and regional      practice leader. As background, Steve has 20 years of      experience in the employer benefits industry and previously      served as a national account executive with Oxford Health      Plans, and also worked previously as a consultant with Hewitt      Associates.       With that, I'll turn it over to Steve to kick it off.      Following that, I will serve as moderator for a series of      topical questions, and then, we will open it up to investor      Q&A.     Steve Lewis, Willis HRH:       Good morning, Matt. Thank you again, for hosting us on this      call. As always, I enjoy the opportunity to do this with you      each year. I also want to publicly acknowledge and thank our      team here for their support. The insight that I'll provide      today and have previously provided is largely the      amalgamation of information that's developed from our team      working day in and day out with clients throughout the      country.       I would add that my comments on this call will be directly      based on my team's experiences and do not necessarily reflect      the experience of my Willis colleagues from around the      country.     Borsch:       Thank you for that, Steve. Let me jump right in here with,      perhaps, the most important question from the standpoint of      institutional investors looking at the sector, and that is,      what are you seeing in terms of competition between the      carriers, specifically relative to last year or two years ago      or whatever you want to use as the baseline, has price      competition increased or decreased?     Lewis:       As a specific answer to that, we would say, price      competition is down from year ago. An overall theme that we      would characterize this year, meaning, when I say this year,      the just completed January 1 renewals, and continuing up and      through today. We feel this is the most challenging      environment for us and our clients in my 20 years in the      business.       Not only is price competition down from year ago (when we      had characterized last year's price competition as being down      from the prior year), but trend or (healthcare) inflation is      also up and appears to be rising. The incumbent carriers seem      more willing than ever to walk away from existing business      resulting in some carrier changes.       And that's a significant adjustment from last year where we      saw aggressive pricing on the renewal front but not so much      on the new business front. And then I'd say the other real      theme is we've seen some service levels that have gapped      among few of the major players which has further increased      switching of carriers.     Borsch:       Let me move on to the next question here. If you look at      the landscape, what role do you see Third Party      Administrators or TPAs playing in the competitive landscape?      And I guess this gets down to a related question if you could      address between the employer decision to self-fund or go with      the fully insured purchase, are employers shifting one way or      the other.     Lewis:       Yes, I think taking the Third Party Administrator piece      first, as in prior years, we've seen little to no new      penetration in our client base from the TPAs. There's still      an occasional place for them in the marketplace, but fewer      and farther between in our opinion.       The networks have expanded to the extent across the country      that there is now very significant overlap, and the TPA      discounts no longer really compete with what the major      managed care carriers have been able to do from a network      standpoint.       With respect to the second part of your question (related      to the self-funding versus fully insured question), our      clients primarily seem to want certainty in this economic      environment with respect to their healthcare spend.       So, unless they have either a reasonable track record of      consistent and relatively predictable claim patterns, clients      that we expect to be fully insured are still largely biased      in that direction, and those that are on the fence as to      whether they should be fully insured or self-funded seem to,      again, be biased more towards the fully insured product.       I would add that where we have had increased conversations      is with our smaller client segment that are increasingly      frustrated with what we call blind renewals, meaning, no      claims data, and experiencing large increases on top of no      claims data.       As a result, there's absolutely increased interest at the      smaller client segment in evaluating potential self-funding      with stop loss protection.     Borsch:       Getting back into the topic of the competitive dynamics,      can you touch on how criteria other than price play a role in      carrier competition, whether that's in fully insured or self-     insured or to the extent you draw a distinction, and to the      extent that maybe that's changed or not changed a little bit      versus a year or two ago?     Lewis:       Yes, I think, as we've talked about in prior calls, price      remains king in the middle market, and is probably queen as      well. Factors that can be a tie breaker other than price      would include network disruption to the specific population;      market perception of the competitive carrier's reputation;      product flexibility, meaning willingness to allow      prescription drug carve-outs; ability to provide detailed      reporting in a certain employee population level, and funding      arrangements offered. Not just the self-funded versus fully      insured argument but some of the hybrids or the more creative      solutions within the fully insured marketplace such as      minimum premium or participating contracts in the fully      insured environment.       Those things taken together can all factor in as tie      breakers with respect to how employers are evaluating      carriers. But even still, price certainly remained the most      significant driver.       I would add one thing; you asked how it's changed from      prior years. I think last year on this call, we talked      specifically about the playing field that was fairly level on      the service end of the equation and as I mentioned at my      opening comment, we have seen a bit of gapping with respect      to the services at some carriers. And that is driving      employers to certainly take a look at what's available on the      marketplace. Then again, finding that there's not a lot of      aggressive price competition, the service disruption would      have to be fairly significant for somebody to move knowing      that they're not going to be able to trade down pricing very      significantly.     Borsch:       Is it the case that the service disruptions that you've      seen in some instances are severe enough to reach the      threshold where they switch?     Lewis:       The short answer is yes. We have seen some of that, and I      think we've seen it at a lower price threshold than what we      would've seen in the past.     Borsch:       Let me move to a slightly different topic here, and      obviously, the background here is the severe recession that      was certainly having an impact when we talked a year ago.      But, now we've been through a lot more pain even though the      economy is showing signs of recovery. A lot of the impacts of      these types of things are lagged.       So, I guess, it's sort of a general question how      significant a role has the recession played in the clients'      product managed care strategies. And, what have you seen in      terms of the overall group enrollment changes related to      that? It's sort of a high level question there, but trying to      understand what the impact of the severe recession has been      on the way employers look at things, buy things, and on      enrollment?     Lewis:       Yes, I'd say, it's a great question and an interesting one      particularly as we look at this market. You mentioned the lag      factor and the timing of the stock market drop of mid-     September 2008 was fairly late in the game to impact many      employers' January 2009 strategies. So, most were not making      any significant benefit changes, and/or made the specific      decision to hold the line when it came to health benefits at      the end of the day due to the freezes or cutbacks in other      areas such as pay, 401K matches, and staffing levels.       So this year, I think, we saw a lot of employers saying,      they were not going to make that mistake again or very early      on in 2009 looking back and saying, if I had to do it over      again, I probably would've made more drastic changes and not      held the line with health benefits.       So, it is a bit ironic that they didn't--a lot of employers      chose not to make the change last year when we were in the      deepest part of the recession. But this past year the renewal      process started much, much earlier for employers even knowing      that the sooner they started, the more impact trend      uncertainty would have on their renewal.       Strategic planning just started much earlier, and employers      wanted to see just about every option under the sun both in      terms of pricing, plan design, extreme options, really      hedging themselves trying to get some clarity as to what      their options were with respect to health benefits, because      they didn't have clarity on either the direction of the      market, the economy, or even their own specific prospects.       So, as I mentioned at the outset, it was without a doubt      the most challenging renewal cycle in my 20 years of this      business with employers really struggling with how and what      was going to drive their decision combined with the lack of      aggressive and competitive pricing in the marketplace.       I think, to your last point about how that may have      impacted group enrollment, I'm not sure I have anything      significant statistically to share with you today. However,      anecdotally, I would say that enrollment is down across our      book of business. We looked at 2009 going into the year and      planned for the enrollment on our client base to be down      10 percent, and I would say that was fairly accurate.     Borsch:       You alluded to something I just wanted to clarify--it may      be that this isn't measurable, but on the question of adverse      selection (and, here, we're talking about the employer      market, not the individual market), you alluded to the      potential that some employees might be more likely not to      take up coverage or, in fact, to discontinue employer      subsidized coverage, because even though it is subsidized it     can be a very sizable chunk out of their pay for a benefit      package that may look less attractive after some of the      changes the employers have made.       So, to the extent you can infer if you're seeing any of      that (and, related to that, the COBRA uptake), has that been      something that you measure? Has it come up in how the      carriers have presented their pricing? Finally, do you have      any sort of visibility on whether that trend is increasing or      abating?     Lewis:       Let me take the first part on something I've alluded to      about the potential for adverse selection due to younger,      healthier folks dropping and/or not selecting coverage to      begin with. You know, I think it depends a bit on the      demographics of the population, the type of industry; our      clients really span just about every industry out there.       So is adverse selection on the rise in the group market? I      would say it is, but I don't have any data to back that up,      but just based on the fact that the population is down 10      percent across our book. And we look how the census in those      client populations has shifted. I would suggest that there      is: I don't want to overstate it because I'm not sure it's      significant at this point, but I certainly would see some      creep, if you will on adverse selection.       I think that ties to your second point about COBRA uptake.      We did not keep specific statistics on the extent of COBRA      uptake. But we certainly saw it across the board, in our      client base, and we certainly believe that it is impacting      the pricing that our clients are experiencing.     Borsch:       Given what you're facing from a more conservative      underwriting environment amongst the carriers, how are you      leveraging or seeking to leverage current market conditions      to your clients' advantage in renewal negotiations?     Lewis:       Well, as stated the outset, and probably ad nauseum at this      point and it's been a tough year.       Carriers were very selective in going after new business,      and incumbents were willing to walk away from existing      clients. So we had to be incredibly creative in our      negotiation tactics as well as in our strategic advice with      clients. And again, it was something that fortunately for us,      in the process, we did start early and while it consumed a      lot of energy from all of the stakeholders it was probably      the year of creativity.       With respect to negotiation tactics, one of the interesting      things is that we seemed to have seen a bit of a bifurcation      in the marketplace at the plus or minus 300-employee size.       In the groups under 300 employees, many of them don't have      or are unable to get control of their claims data either as a      result of the products they've purchased or just underwriting      guidelines at the carrier level where they don't have      complete control of their claims data. In that under 300-     market place, there was very little competition and very high      renewals right out of the gates.       However, in the over 300-employee market, if the claims      data was available and in a detailed way and you could make a      story about that claim's pattern and possibly make      adjustments for a spike--a one-time spike. Then, you would      see competition pick up. But again, it was very selective and      certainly not anything we would characterize as overly      aggressive.     Borsch:       This lead in to the next question: Can you generalize about      what is the average rate increase that you're observing: both      the initial carrier request and the final end point, post      negotiation and plan changes? And can you tell us about the      extent of plan benefit reductions in achieving final results      for your clients?     Lewis:       Averages are tough, you're right, and probably don't tell a      very good story and some clients look at that and say, wow,      how did you get that average? I must've been the high person.      But the range was all over the place and fairly extreme. I'd      say we settled in a range, on our book of business, from a 5%      reduction to a 50% increase.       But generally speaking, we were in low to mid-teens out of      the gates, and this is where the real challenges begin.      Because negotiations generated no more than one to one and a      half points with no plan changes. And so it's almost like you      were getting a first and final and you had to dig through the      renewals to find a mistake.       That's less movement than we've had in each of the prior      years and certainly, not turned in the right direction from      our clients' perspective.     Borsch:       But on the benefit plan changes that your clients have      implemented, would you say those are more substantial today      than what you saw a year ago?     Lewis:       I would say that incrementally the changes are more      substantial, but visually to employees, they're fairly      significant. You know, just about everybody did something      this year. And it did vary as you would imagine by the extent      of the renewal and the existing plan structure, but things      like 100% co-insurance are virtually gone.     Borsch:       Yes.     Lewis:       What we saw was a lot of tweaking, where we'd see the      employers bifurcating the primary and specialist co-payments,      adding prescription drug deductibles on top of co-payments,      and really focusing on plan changes first and foremost before      looking at impacting employee contributions.     Investor Question:       You talked about client renewal process starting earlier as      the planning process started earlier. Does that mean the      contracts are actually being signed earlier and therefore the      carriers will have more visibility into the premium yield      this year compared to previous years?     Lewis:       Great question. The answer is no. The contracts are not      renewing any earlier, just the negotiation process. So, in      our world, generally speaking, we would look to get a renewal      (depending on the size of the group) from 90 to 120 days      before the expiration of a renewal.       This year, clients were looking to us (and to a certain      extent from the carriers) to extend that to 6 months out:      where we start predicting where the renewal is going to end      up. And to the extent that the carriers were willing to      provide a preliminary renewal, they have to load in a lot of      trend because they have to make guesses on the claims going      forward.       And then as you move closer to the expiration date, they      offset trend with the wrong claims experience. So nobody was      renewing or signing contracts earlier, they were just      dragging the process out much, much longer from both the      carrier side and the employer side.     Borsch:       Let me ask a question, and hopefully, this is isn't      repetitive, but in the market studies that you've reviewed,      how wide have the gaps been between the different carriers?      Have you noted one carrier or groups of carriers relative to      the others that have been especially aggressive or perhaps      overly conservative that stand out?     Lewis:       The short answer is no. I think in particular situations,      we've seen a couple of carriers be more aggressive than      others. But I'm putting quotes around more aggressive because      we're generally in the three to five percent range between      pricing from where an incumbent renewal might be and what      might be considered aggressive.       Now, there were few exceptions on some of our larger middle      market clients, as I've mentioned earlier, with very clean      data, stable business, perhaps a one-year blip with the      incumbent that cause the incumbent to get skittish and want      to shut the business and a competitor to come in and price it      more aggressively. But as a general rule, Matt, we were in a      pretty tight range during the market study process.     Borsch:       We've talked in prior years about tracking the gradually      growing interest in the consumer-directed health plan      products. Where you would say we stand now? Have you seen the      uptake increase meaningfully as a result of all the pressure      of the last year? And, you know, if you can offer a little      bit of a forecast, do you think that may change going into      2011?     Lewis:       Yes. Surprisingly, we have not seen a significant shift      towards the consumer directive plan. Across the board, it's      now an option for most employer groups. And the clients that      have offered it for the longest period of time (call it      three-plus years) are now exceeding double-digits, but that's      the low double-digits for enrollment as an option.       New offerings continue to generate very low enrollments out      of the gates with still almost no full replacements at this      point. I think the one shift we have seen is a swing towards      health reimbursement accounts and away from health savings      accounts that more employer-friendly. And employers are doing      more to tie their wellness rewards and strategies to their      health reimbursements accounts.       So I'd say if you ask about a crystal ball, really the      tying of wellness and to focus on improving the health of a      population, then consumer health plans tied to an HRA account      is where we see this market moving and really the potential      for the biggest surge.     Borsch:       Let me just conclude with one last one I want to throw at      you here, Steve. This has been tremendous insight that you've      brought for us so I want to thank you. On health reform,      obviously, this is a huge thing in the background but it's a      practical matter, but it doesn't necessarily have that much      day-to-day impact on things.       But to what extent is health reform something that the      employers are looking at? Are they talking to you about it?      Have you got ``two cents'' on where opinions fall amongst      employers about what they would like to see happen relative      to what's been presented in Washington?     Lewis:       Yes, we are talking to our clients a lot about it. There is      a lot of what I would call academic interest at this stage of      the game. They're very mixed in their reaction, quite      candidly consistent with what we're seeing in the polling      numbers by party lines.       I think most people would acknowledge that there's a need      for healthcare reform,     employers continue to be very frustrated. So when they look      at what the Obama administration and the Democratic Majority      state as their goals to increase access and lower cost and      rail at what maybe termed oligopolistic behavior of carriers      in certain markets, I think employers really buy in to that      message and have much of that frustration and anger at our      lack of solutions.       But I would also say that many of them still view the      legislation and the partisanship coming out of Washington as      possibly the medicine worse than the disease. So, many      employer groups that we're talking to feel like it would be a      shame to lose an opportunity to do something with respect to      healthcare reform. But many are starting to feel like maybe      nothing is better than something in this current environment.     Borsch:       This is probably a good place to end our call. Steve, thank      you very much. This is really a great frontline perspective      on industry trends and I want to thank you and your firm      Willis, and also thank our investor clients who dialed in.     Lewis:       Thank you, Matt. I appreciate it.                                  ____                [From the Huffington Post, Mar. 8, 2010]   Goldman to Private Insurers: No Health Care Reform at All Is Best                             (By Sam Stein)       What's Your Reaction?       A Goldman Sachs analysis of health care legislation has      concluded that, as far as the bottom line for insurance      companies is concerned, the best thing to do is nothing. A      close second would be passing a watered-down version of the      Senate Finance Committee's bill.       A study put together by Goldman in mid-October looks at the      estimated stock performance of the private insurance industry      under four variations of reform legislation. The study      focused on the five biggest insurers whose shares are traded      on Wall Street: Aetna, UnitedHealth, WellPoint, CIGNA and      Humana.       The Senate Finance Committee bill, which Goldman's analysts      conclude is the version most likely to survive the      legislative process, is described as the ``base'' scenario.      Under that legislation (which did not include a public plan)      the earnings per share for the top five insurers would grow      an estimated five percent from 2010 through 2019. And yet,      the ``variance with current valuation''--essentially, what      the value of the stock is on the market--is projected to drop      four percent.       Things are much worse, Goldman estimates, for legislation      that resembles what was considered and (to a certain extent)      passed by the House of Representatives. This is, the firm      deems, the ``bear case'' scenario--in which earnings per      share for the top five insurers would decline an estimated      one percent from 2010 through 2019 and the variance with      current valuation is projected to be negative 36 percent.       What the firm sees as the best path forward for the private      insurance industry's bottom line is, to be blunt, inaction.       The study's authors advise that if no reform is passed,      earnings per share would grow an estimated ten percent from      2010 through 2019, and the value of the stock would rise an      estimated 59 percent during that time period.       The next best thing for the insurance industry would be if      the legislation passed by the Senate Finance Committee is      watered down significantly. Described as a ``bull case''      scenario--in which there is ``moderation of provisions in the      current SFC plan'' or ``changes prior to the major      implementation in 2013''--earnings per share for the five      biggest insurers would grow an estimated 10 percent and the      variance with current valuation would rise an estimated 47      percent.       The report, a Goldman official stressed, was analytic not      advocacy-based. Their job was to provide a sober assessment      of the market realities facing private insurers under various      versions of health care reform.       ``If no reform at all happens you would see the largest      rise in EPS,'' a Goldman official acknowledged. ``But what we      are doing is just analyzing what the stocks would do under      different scenarios.''       The study does note on the front page that the firm ``does      and seeks to do business with companies covered in its      research reports.'' Those companies include Aetna, Wells      Point and United Health.       In the context of the current health care debate, the      findings provide a small window into the concerns that have      driven the private insurance industry's opposition to reform      legislation. Simply put: health care reform is going to hurt      their bottom line. No less a prestigious voice than Goldman      Sachs is telling them so.       Some insurers, in the end, will be hit harder than others.      CIGNA is the lowest of the big five, for instance, because it      does little business providing insurance plans to Medicare      patients, individuals and families buying health plans      directly, or small employers that offer health plans to their      workers.       In addition, some reforms are going to hurt the industry      more than others. Regulatory changes--such as prohibiting the      prejudice against consumers with pre-existing conditions--     will have an impact across the board, as will the funding      cuts to Medicare Advantage.       Overall, Goldman calculates the probability of reform      passing Congress at 75 percent. Though the limitations of      Goldman's political prognostications were on full display      earlier in the document:       By mid-late October, we expect a cloture vote (60 votes) to      bypass a potential filibuster followed by several weeks of      debate over proposed amendments on the Senate floor (with a      similar process under way in the House). If both the Senate      and House are able to pass legislation (perhaps before the      Thanksgiving recess), a House-Senate conference negotiation      should produce combined legislation for final approval      (perhaps by mid-December).                                  ____                  [From Goldman Sachs, Oct. 19, 2009]           America's Managed Care--10 Years of Health Reform             We have published a new 10-year industry model       As we near the final weeks for health reform efforts in      Congress, we have published a new, interactive 10 year model      to forecast potential impact.     We now forecast 2010-2019 EPS growth of 5% under health reform       Under our ``base'' case scenario, we forecast core managed      care earnings growth would be cut by 50% over the next decade      under implementation of the current Senate Finance Committee      reform plan. Specifically, we see sector EPS growth at      approximately 5% per year under health reform (2010-2019) as      compared to 10% EPS growth with no health reform.       We also consider a ``bear'' case scenario for reform that      would drive declining EPS for the sector in aggregate over      the next decade. The reform measures that would most      negatively impact earnings growth are funding cuts to      Medicare Advantage and strict new regulations for the      individual and small group business. These would be partly      offset by the positive impact of expanded insurance coverage      under reform.         Under reform, 8% EPS growth for CIGNA, -2% for Humana       Under our ``base'' case scenario for reform, our company-     level forecasts for 10 year EPS range from a 2% decline per      year for Humana (owing to its Medicare Advantage exposure) to      growth of 8% per year for CIGNA and Aetna (owing to their      concentration of earnings from larger employers).          Neutral on managed care; CIGNA remains our favorite       We remain Neutral on core managed care although our bias is      increasingly for sector upside given the 20% fall in      valuations over the past 5 weeks. CIGNA remains our favorite      with by far the least downside risk exposure to health reform      even as the stock trades at a valuation discount to the      group. We also recommend UnitedHealth and Health Net (both      Buy rated).
