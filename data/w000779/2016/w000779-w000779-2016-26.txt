President, today I wish to express my frustration with the inaction of the Federal Communication Commission due to political reasons. The FCC's Chairman, Tom Wheeler, was forced to cancel a vote during their open meeting due to the inaction of one acting commissioner. That vote would have implemented a program to help rural Americans receive wireless broadband internet. I see no reason for the Commission to delay a vote, on a noncontroversial policy that would infuse universal service funding to the most high-cost rural communities across the country.  I regularly hear from Oregonians in rural counties that it is clear high costs are preventing private sector broadband investment in parts of rural Oregon. The FCC must fulfill its responsibility to provide a lifeline to rural communities and a connection to the global economy. Wireless cell service and broadband internet spur economic opportunity, improve public safety, and increase educational outcomes for rural Americans. Any delay causes these rural communities to wait even longer for help.  For these reasons, I am putting a hold on any confirmation vote for Jessica Rosenworcel to be a commissioner at the Federal Communications Commission.                            ____________________
