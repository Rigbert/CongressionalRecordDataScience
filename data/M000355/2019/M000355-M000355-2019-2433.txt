 President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation be discharged and the Senate proceed to the en bloc consideration of the following nominations: PN2642 and PN2641.  There being no objection, the committee was discharged, and the Senate proceeded to consider the nominations.  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate vote on the nominations en bloc with no intervening action or debate; that if confirmed, the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table en bloc; that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action; that no further motions be in order; and that any statements relating to the nominations be printed in the Record.
