Chairman, I thank my friend for yielding me this time.  I join the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Leach) in congratulating the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hyde) and the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos), ranking member, as well as the extraordinary work that has been done by the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee) as a Member of Congress and before she got to Congress.                              {time}  1115  Mr. Chairman, the great Dr. Martin Luther King, one of the world's great humanitarians, once said, ``We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly.''  Today, through this truly historic, bipartisan legislation authorizing $15 billion over the next 5 years for overseas care, treatment and prevention of AIDS, we recognize that our Nation has a moral obligation and a national security interest in combating the HIV/AIDS pandemic, as well as malaria and tuberculosis.  We ignore the world's increasing interdependence at our own peril, Mr. Chairman. And, frankly, while many of my colleagues have fought for many years to bring needed resources to bear on this problem, their call to arms has not, until now, been fully embraced.  The source scourge of AIDS knows no borders. It does not discriminate. It targets every one of us, infecting some 42 million people around the world, two-thirds of them from Africa.  As my good friend the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos), who has worked with the gentleman from Illinois (Chairman Hyde) to bring this legislation to the floor today, stated in the markup of this bill, this health care crisis ruins families, communities and whole nations, fueling violence and bloodshed across borders. It cannot be contained in one region or in one population. And, thus, it is a global challenge that demands a global, humanitarian response with the United States in the lead.  The ranking member, the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos), the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee), and certainly the gentleman from Illinois (Chairman Hyde), deserve our congratulations, our thanks and admiration for their leadership in crafting this bill's balanced approach to treatment and prevention. It is a real commitment to addressing the HIV/AIDS crisis.  I would hope that amendments to be offered later today that would upset this carefully crafted, balanced piece of legislation, that those amendments would be rejected. In particular, the Pitts amendment would upset the balanced HIV/AIDS prevention approach called for in the bill by requiring that one-third of the prevention funds be used solely for abstinence-only programs. Certainly we are supportive of abstinence, but not to wall it off for sole use resources.  This historic legislation reflects our values, protects our interests, and extends, Mr. Chairman, a handle of hope to millions of vulnerable people across the world.  We need not ask for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for us. This legislation is a response by us to reach out to save lives, to heal, and to make our Nation and our global community more secure.
