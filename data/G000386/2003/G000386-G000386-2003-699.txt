 President, I am pleased to submit a resolution, with my colleagues representing the Upper Mississippi River, expressing our support for the celebration in 2004 of the 150th Anniversary of the Grand Excursion.  In 1854, the Chicago and Rock Island Railroad became the first railroad to reach from the East Coast to the Mississippi River. To celebrate, Henry Farnam, a contractor for the railroad, organized an excursion for friends, family, and stockholders. Word about this event spread quickly and a group of 1,200 people, including former President Millard Fillmore, traveled by steamboat from Rock Island, IL to St. Paul, MN.  This grand excursion turned into an opportunity to show influential persons of the day the remarkable beauty, numerous resources, and the unlimited opportunities that the Mississippi River and the West could provide. This excursion brought millions of dollars of investment to the area and positioned the Upper Mississippi region as a dominant force in the development of the nation in the 19th century.  Once again, the Grand Excursion is an opportunity to highlight the recreational, commercial, and environmental opportunities the river provides, as well as celebrate the renaissance of the Upper Mississippi River region. Over 50 communities, 23 regional organizations, and 4 states are joining together to make this celebration a reality.  For the past 10-15 years, communities in Iowa, Wisconsin, and Minnesota have been working together to reclaim their relationship with the Mississippi River and reestablish vibrant riverfront communities. Planning for the celebration has been a catalyst for over $5 billion in capital improvements and environmental initiatives along the river.  In Iowa, communities such as the Quad Cities, Dubuque, and Clinton have all rallied together to make their riverfronts engines for economic development. The Quad Cities are the kickoff site for the Grand Flotilla takingplace in June of 2004. Dubuque is the home of the National Mississippi River Museum and Aquarium, as well as the home dock of the Audubon Ark. All of the participating Iowa cities have welcoming marinas, main streets, and fun events planned for the celebration. I am honored to be a partner with these dynamic communities.  Through the Grand Excursion 2004, hundreds of thousands of citizens will experience America's River, a matchless national treasure, through community festivities, educational events, enhanced recreation opportunities, and cultural programs. Those who are unable to participate first-hand in the celebrations will be able to experience the excitement through a first-class website and educational Exploration Trunks that will be provided with curriculum to classrooms around the country.  I hope that you will join me in supporting this resolution of America's celebration of the Upper Mississippi River: Grand Excursion 2004.                                 ______                                 SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 6--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT A     COMMEMORATIVE POSTAGE STAMP SHOULD BE ISSUED IN HONOR OF DANIEL    ``CHAPPIE'' JAMES, THE NATION'S FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN FOUR-STAR                                 GENERAL
