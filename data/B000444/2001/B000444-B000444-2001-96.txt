 President, there has been a request, with which I agree, that we recess for up to 3 minutes. We were to hear from the distinguished Prime Minister of Australia, one of ourstrongest allies, a man who himself is in deep sympathy and mourning for this Nation, in a joint meeting. He is in the Chamber.                          ____________________
