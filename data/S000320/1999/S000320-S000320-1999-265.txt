 President, I would like to bring to your attention the National Association of Letter Carriers Food Drive Day. On Saturday, May 8, letter carriers from around the country will collect nonperishable food items placed near their customers' mail boxes. The food will then be given to local food pantries for distribution to those in need. The National Association of Letter Carriers in Alabama collected more than 500,000 items last year alone, and I would like to encourage my colleagues to support the letter carriers' food drives in their States, districts, and hometowns in order to make this worthy event a success.                          ____________________
