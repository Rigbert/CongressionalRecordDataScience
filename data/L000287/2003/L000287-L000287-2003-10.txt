Reclaiming my time, Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia for those comments, and I will continue to yield to the majority for a response, but I noticed the gentleman mentioned several conference reports coming up next week and that the military construction and interior appropriation bills are the most likely. Would those be the business for next Friday; since the gentleman indicated that he does expect to be in on Friday, possibly late Friday night?
