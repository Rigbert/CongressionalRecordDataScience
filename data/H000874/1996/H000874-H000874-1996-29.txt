Leader, and I appreciate the statement that the leader just made, a bill, H.R. 3953, printed August 2, 1996, at 1:51 p.m. Is that the legislation that will be offered under the rule?  The reason I ask that, Mr. Leader, as you know, the rule provides that the leader, yourself, can offer any bill that you so choose.
