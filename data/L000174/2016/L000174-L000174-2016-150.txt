President, Senator McCain, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, believes that $602 billion is not enough for the Department of Defense. Rather than reject unnecessary spending for weapons and other programs the Pentagon says it does not want or need, the Senator from Arizona not only says we should fund them, he also proposes to spend another $18 billion on defense.  I will leave it to others to defend or contest the assumptions on which Senator McCain's amendment is based. But I do want to speak briefly in support of the second degree amendment offered by the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Reed of Rhode Island.  Because if there is one thing we have learned over and over, it is that protecting U.S. national security is not only about a strong military that can respond when all other options fail. It is also about homeland security, including border control and maintaining critical infrastructure. It is about law enforcement within the United States. It is about cyber security. It is about educating the next generation of Americans and creating jobs that lead to advancements in science and technology. And it is about strengthening the capabilities of foreign partners and acting as a leader in international diplomatic efforts to prevent and respond to threats to global security.  The fiscal year 2017 budget allocation for the Department of State and foreign operations is $591 million below fiscal year 2016. That, coupled with the fact that the President's budget underfunds programs for refugees and other victims of disasters by $1 billion, presents us with an untenable budgetary situation. The amendment offered by the Senator from Rhode Island would help to alleviate this shortfall.  While there are many foreign crises, Senator Reed's amendment focuses on one area where the situation is particularly dire. It authorizes $1.9 billion to support the Department of State and U.S. Agency for International Development to implement their portions of the Integrated Campaign Plan to Counter ISIL. The funds would also support embassy security, as well as additional assistance for Israel, and for Jordan and Lebanon which have been severely impacted by the influx of hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees.  This is directly related to U.S. security interests in the Middle East at a time when the stability of the entire region is under threat.  In a June 2 piece in Time Magazine, Retired GEN James Conway, former Commandant of the Marine Corps, and Retired ADM James M. Loy, former Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard, wrote that:       . . . the security challenges our nation faces today are      not the same as when we began our service during the Cold      War. . . . Twenty-first century problems require fine      scalpels, and the military is a broad sword. We can start by      better resourcing and strengthening our own institutions. The      State Department, the Peace Corps and USAID are the front      lines of keeping our country safe, but they are underfunded      and undermanned.  Mr. President, we should also remember that the Balanced Budget Act is based on parity. The spending caps we put in place have consequences for both the defense and nondefense sides of the ledger. Yet the Senator from Arizona's one dimensional approach ignores this bipartisan compromise. His amendment ignores the essential roles that development and diplomacy play in national security. It ignores the many domestic components to a strong defense, like a well-trained workforce and reliable infrastructure, like energy independence, like health systems that have the resources to protect the public from infectious diseases, contaminated drinking water, and unsafe food.  If you ask the American people whether these investments are as important as more fighter planes and warships, they would emphatically answer ``yes''. And that is why the very name of the Balanced Budget Act includes the word ``balanced''.  The amendment of the Senator from Rhode Island should be passed overwhelmingly.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the June 2 article I referred to by General Conway and Admiral Loy.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:   Former Military Leaders: 3 Lessons for Our Next Commander-in-Chief             (James Conway and James M. Loy, June 2, 2016)                   Military alone cannot keep us safe       As Hillary Clinton makes a national security speech      Thursday and with Trump's recent major foreign policy speech,      it's important to remember that the military alone cannot      keep us safe. As the former commandants of the Marine Corps      and the Coast Guard, we believe our next Commander-in-Chief      will also need the civilian tools in our arsenal to keep our      nation strong and secure.       For centuries, the blessing of two large oceans on our      flanks acted as geographical barriers. But in the modern era,      technology has made the world smaller and increasingly      interconnected. The recent attacks in Brussels, Paris and San      Bernardino, Calif., remind us that global threats do not      respect borders, and oceans are not enough to preserve our      peace and prosperity.       The security challenges our nation faces today are not the      same as when we began our service during the Cold War.      National security challenges have become more resistant to      bullets. Ebola, the Zika virus, the influx of undocumented      children from Latin states, and even the rise of ISIS cannot      be resolved only with the force of arms.       If there was one immutable lesson of the Sept. 11 attacks,      it is that instability in remote corners of the world can      pose a direct threat to our way of life. The rise of ISIS is      only a recent example that underscores that reality.       Military force will continue to be a necessary deterrent      for the exercise of American     power, but it cannot be the only option. To preserve our flag      and freedom, there are three areas where America must do      better.       1. We must strengthen not only our soldiers, sailors,      Marines, Coast Guard, and airmen but also our diplomats and      development experts who are critical to our national      security.       Fighting terrorism means more than bombing the Middle East      from the air. It means supporting weak or fragile states,      increasing foreign military training and assistance, and      devoting more resources to fight weapons proliferation. These      are battles best fought at the local level with knowledge of      cultures, economics and history.       2. We must help create economic opportunities around the      world--particularly those where there are security concerns.       Think of America's engagement with Germany, Japan and South      Korea in the postwar years. They are now our fourth, fifth,      and sixth largest trading partners, respectively. Helping      promote rule of law and economic development strengthens our      economy here at home.       3. We must strengthen the humanitarian values that      undergird American global leadership.       U.S. foreign assistance has helped cut extreme poverty in      half since 1990. It has increased life expectancy in the      developing world by 33%, afforded two billion people access      to clean water, and the number of children in primary school      has tripled over the last 25 years.       Pandemics and diseases like Ebola and the Zika virus are      more easily defeated in the countries where they originate      when those countries have strong health care systems, an      educated population and the economic means to combat the      virus. We can help build those institutions. To those      concerned about the cost of assistance to the developing      world, we would submit to you that economic development is      cheaper than sending in the military.       Twenty-first century problems require fine scalpels, and      the military is a broad sword. We can start by better      resourcing and strengthening our own institutions. The State      Department, the Peace Corps and USAID are the front lines of      keeping our country safe, but they are underfunded and      undermanned.       Facing the largest global displacement of people since      World War II, we have much more work to do. If we are not      helping to support and build up allies and friends, then we      are reducing our prospects for success and ceding immense      benefits for our own national security.       General James Mattis got it right when he said: ``If you      don't fund the State Department fully, then I need to buy      more ammunition.''       Keeping all the tools of American national security strong      will help save lives and promote global stability and      prosperity. Regardless of who is elected in November, a      candidate who understands these challenges, and acts      accordingly, will be in America's best interests.
