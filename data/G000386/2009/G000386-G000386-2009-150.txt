 President, I am here to discuss a very important matter that I had intended to bring up in the Judiciary Committee last week but the agenda did not allow it. It is about the oversight of the Department of Justice and the responses provided by Attorney General Holder to questions from the Judiciary Committee. Two weeks ago, Chairman Leahy--and I thank him for participating--and I sent a letter to the Attorney General asking him to stand by his statements made during his confirmation and answer a number of outstanding requests for information. That list includes questions submitted by members of the Judiciary Committee to an FBI oversight hearing over 1\1/2\ years ago. We all agreed no committee should have to wait that long to get answers to oversight questions.  Last Friday, the Judiciary Committee received answers from the Attorney General following his June 17,2009, testimony. I hoped he would uphold his commitment he made during his confirmation hearing to ``fully and in a timely fashion'' answer Judiciary Committee inquiries.
