President, in my ongoing effort to see a worldwide ban on the use of antipersonnel landmines, it is interesting to note that since starting this effort 25 countries have taken at least the initial step by halting all or most of their exports of antipersonnel mines. That was due in large part to the action we took here 2 years ago, by passing my amendment to stop U.S. exports of these weapons. Our action captured the attention of the world, and that is why it is important that we continue to show leadership to bring an end to the landmine scourge.  I remind my colleagues that today in over 60 countries there are 100 million antipersonnel landmines that wait silently to explode. These are 100 million not in warehouses but concealed in the ground. In many countries they are clearing the landmines an arm and a leg and a life at a time.  Today when wars end, soldiers leave and tanks and artillery and guns are withdrawn, in so many countries the killing continues, sometimes for months, sometimes long past when people can remember what caused the fighting in the first place. It continues because of the landmines left behind.  We are about to make a major decision in Bosnia. The distinguished Senator from Kansas and I spent most of an afternoon with the President of the United States, with the Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, our Ambassador to the United Nations, and General Shalikashvili discussing what alternatives are available to us.  It was a very good discussion, I think a very important discussion. I commend the President for having it. I could not help think throughout no matter who is in Bosnia, whether us, for whatever reason, our allies, whether now or when the fighting stops, they are going to find a very, very grim surprise; that is, hundreds of thousands, perhaps over a million landmines that are now in the former Yugoslavia, and they will keep on killing long after this dreadful fighting stops.                          ____________________
