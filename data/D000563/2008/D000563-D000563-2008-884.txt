President, let me thank my colleague from Texas for coming to the floor and offering an amendment. I don't know if I will be able to support it, but I do commend him because the amendment clearly relates to the bill, a very important bill, and it draws us into something perilously close to debate which hardly ever happens on the floor of the Senate. I hope the spirit in which he has offered this amendment will be respected on both sides of the aisle.  I know there are many pressing issues facing us in Congress and few opportunities to bring them up. But I hope this bill can pass this week, that we have an honest debate on the merits of the bill, and then bring it to passage. I support the bill. I thank Senator Pryor.  Senator Pryor of Arkansas has been a leader on this issue. He has done an extraordinarily good job making this a bipartisan bill. All of us read the stories last year about toy safety. Many parents came up to me in Illinois and said: What am I supposed to buy this year? Is everything dangerous? If it says ``made in China,'' am I supposed to stay away from it?  I didn't have a good answer. I couldn't recommend toys. That is not what I do for a living.  I have to tell you, a lot of the stories that were coming out in the newspapers were troubling, not just for parents but for grandparents such as me. Magnetic toys, I never had those when I was a kid. All we had were Lincoln Logs and Tinker Toys and all kinds of stuff like that--erector sets. But these were little objects that could stick together with magnets. Kids could build them into huge forms. My grandson loved them. He had boxes full of this stuff and he would make these huge things with his dad, and always wanted more.  Well, I bought it--something to bring around at Christmastime--and did not realize, until the newspaper stories came out, this toy was a danger. Because the reason it worked is, it had these tiny, little, rare earth magnets. It looked like a pill, a little black pill.
