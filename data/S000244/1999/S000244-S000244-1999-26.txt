Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2607) to promote the development of the commercial space transportation industry, to authorize appropriations for the Office of the Associate Administrator for Commercial Space Transportation, to authorize appropriations for the Office of Space Commercialization, and for other purposes, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                               H.R. 2607       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Commercial Space      Transportation Competitiveness Act of 1999''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       The Congress finds that--       (1) a robust United States space transportation industry is      vital to the Nation's economic well-being and national      security;       (2) a 5-year extension of the excess third party claims      payment provision of chapter 701 of title 49, United States      Code, (Commercial Space Launch Activities) is necessary at      this time to protect the private sector from uninsurable      levels of liability;       (3) enactment of this extension will have a beneficial      impact on the international competitiveness of the United      States space transportation industry;       (4) space transportation may eventually move into more      airplane-style operations;       (5) during the next 3 years the Federal Government and the      private sector should analyze and determine whether a more      appropriate and effective liability risk-sharing regime can      be achieved and, if so, develop and propose the new regime to      Congress at least 2 years prior to the expiration of the      extension contained in this Act;       (6) the areas of responsibility of the Office of the      Associate Administrator for Commercial Space Transportation      have significantly increased as a result of--       (A) the rapidly expanding commercial space transportation      industry and associated government licensing requirements;       (B) regulatory activity as a result of the emerging      commercial reusable launch vehicle industry; and       (C) the increased regulatory activity associated with      commercial operation of launch and reentry sites; and       (7) the Office of the Associate Administrator for      Commercial Space Transportation should engage in only those      promotional activities which directly support its regulatory      mission.
