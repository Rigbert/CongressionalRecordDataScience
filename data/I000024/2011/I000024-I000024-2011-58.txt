President, let me say, as far as the subject is concerned right now, I am very proud to have one of the first signatures on this effort. It is good for every reason the Senator from Texas mentioned. On top of that, we have allies we are dealing with. We have the employment situation. I know this is going to be successful. I appreciate all the effort that has gone forth.                       Honoring Our Armed Forces                  Specialist Christopher David Horton  Today, I wish to recognize and pay tribute to Army SPC Christopher David Horton from Owasso, OK. That is home of the Rams in case people did not know. Chris was born in Tulsa on October 1, 1984. He was deployed to Afghanistan with over 2,000 Oklahoma National Guard soldiers from the 45th Infantry Brigade Combat Team. There were actually 3,000 initially in this deployment. Some of them actually went to Kuwait at the last minute.  He was deployed to Afghanistan. This combat team, the 45th, has probably had more deployments than anyone else, although this was Chris's first deployment. His unit was attacked by enemy forces in Paktia Province on September 9, 2011. Chris and two of his fellow soldiers, SGT Bret Isenhower and PFC Tony Potter, died of injuries sustained from that firefight.  He would have turned 27 next week, on October 1. Chris attended the Missouri Military Academy in Mexico, MO, and graduated in 2003. He excelled both militarily and academically during his 6 years at Missouri Military Academy. He was the 2nd platoon leader his senior year, captain of the rifle team, on the honor roll, earning him the Academic Fourragere Award.  Chris lived a remarkable life, driven by service and excellence. He often spoke of his desire for America to excel. He was a business owner and a volunteer police officer. He was extremely patriotic and very passionate in his love for America and for its freedoms, knowing they have to be protected.  Chris was an accomplished recreational shooter and a professional sponsored shooter through the U.S. Shooting Academy of Owasso, OK. Some of his marksmen awards include the Gus Hadwiger Award of 2009. He received first place in novice pistol in the Oklahoma National Guard, first place in novice pistol in the Governor's Twenty Match. This guy was very good. He excelled and was among the very best. That was something he enjoyed.  But in addition to shooting--this is kind of interesting because things bond us together. I came so close to meeting him, but I never actually did. But one of the things we had in common is weare both avid fishermen. He loved fishing. That is one of the things he enjoyed very much. Every opportunity he had, he would fish both ocean and freshwater.  His younger brother Nick said:       He was the best big brother I could ever have asked for. He      taught me how to drive a car and how to fish.  That pretty much tells it all. Chris's mother Cherie Horton said:       My son's passion his whole life was to be a part of the      military.  He wanted to be part of the military.       He loved his country, and he really wanted to serve his      country. He was absolutely made to be a solder.  This is a mother speaking. Chris enlisted in the Oklahoma National Guard in 2008, was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 279th Infantry Regiment of the 45th Brigade of the Army National Guard.  He attended basic training at Fort Benning, GA, became a sniper-qualified infantryman, and to no one's surprise, graduated at the top of his class. Chris leaves behind his parents, Cherie and David Horton, his brother Nicholas, sister Tenley, and his wife Jane Horton. Chris met Jane while attending the Kings College in New York City. Jane said it was Chris's fiery passion and their mutual love for politics that brought them together.       He was the most honorable man I'd ever met in my life.      That's why I snagged him and we were engaged within 2 months.      We were married very fast.  She knew what she was out after. I know this is true because my staff and I got to know Chris through his wife Jane. She was an intern for me. She worked in my office, and we had these exchanges all the time. As could be expected, Jane took a personal interest in operations in Afghanistan. She worked with my legislative staff, responsible for military and veterans affairs.  During her time in Washington, she coordinated a campaign that resulted in over 20 care packages being sent to the Oklahoma National Guard Infantry Combat Brigade. I can tell everyone this, having been over there at a time when a lot of these care packages come in, we know, as we go across this country in helicopters, a lot of these packages, even though the people at home do not know it, are dropped to kids on the ground who love what we are doing there.  So I think Jane represents the best asset our military has at its disposal; that is, the military spouses. Her zeal and dedication are not uncommon attributes for military spouses who ``hold down the fort'' while their loved ones are deployed.  I had looked forward to meeting Chris during my upcoming trip to Afghanistan another week from now. I had a meeting during the break, the recess, in Collinsville, OK, and Jane was there. We talked about how we were going to meet up with Chris in my upcoming trip to Afghanistan. I had looked forward to meeting him during that trip.  While this personal conversation will not happen, I am committed to making Chris's desire that our Nation be led down the right path a reality. Chris lived a life of love for his family, friends, and country. He will be remembered for his commitment to and belief in the greatness of our Nation.  Here are some of the comments posted online in honor of his life. I think it is kind of neat to read a lot of these. They come from assorted different people. Some are members of the family, some are not. Here is one of them:       God's got a good warrior up there with him now.  Another one:       I want to thank the families of this wonderful young man      who was willing to give his life for our freedom. May no one      in America take this act lightly. Love and prayers to all of      the family and friends.  Here is another:       Christopher David Horton was the kind of young man who      would do anything for anybody.  Another one:       He is a hero--each and every servicemen/women are--they      protect our freedoms and without them we cannot. Thank you      Specialist Christopher Horton--may you rest in peace. Prayers      being said for your family.  But here is my favorite one. It is actually by his brother Nick. He said:       You will be missed more than anything brother, especially      on the range, you always gave me a run for my money. Till we      meet again in heaven!  That is kind of great. This tough fight took place and took the life of Chris. But make no mistake, Chris's sacrifice made a difference and will continue to make a difference not just in Afghanistan but here in the United States.  We are safe and our country is secure because of Chris and all the service men and women. We have to continue in our unwavering support for them. Although each servicemember we lose hurts, it is because of our connection to Jane that my staff and I are particularly affected by the loss of SPC Chris Horton.  I extend the deepest gratitude and condolences to Chris's family. I will say something I will be criticized for--I always am. I have always been a Jesus guy. I find out, of course, that so is Chris. So when something such as this happens, even though we did not personally meet, we are brothers. So, in a case such as this, we do not say: Goodbye, Chris. We say: We will see you later.  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The clerk will call the roll.  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.
