 This affects jobs in a couple States, and I wish to say that when we are having a program--as the stimulus bill did--to keep people from being laid off and to have people being hired, you would at least think we would not think about eliminating jobs in a couple States. I was a supporter of this program before any contracts were awarded. As I said, I will not support the program if it does not prove effective.  Given the propensity to spend the Government seems to be afflicted with, there is going to be a hunger for new sources of revenue which is going to be controversial. What should not be controversial is that we need to collect taxes currently owed in the most effective and most efficient way possible and particularly not ignore a policy of not going after money under $25,000. Since the private debt collection program will accomplish that, I urge support for this amendment when it comes up.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
