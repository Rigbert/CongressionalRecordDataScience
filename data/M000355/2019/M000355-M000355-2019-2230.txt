 We would only vote on plans that stood an actual chance of being signed by the President and, thus, obviously becoming law.  So I was glad to hear today the President's announcement that he and our Democratic colleagues have reached an agreement that will immediately reopen the government while providing the room to negotiate a funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security. Further, negotiations on DHS will be prioritized over the consideration of any other funding bill. With cooperation, we can pass legislation opening the government, and we can send the DHS appropriations bill to a conference today with the House.  I am glad the closed portions of the Federal Government will reopen and get back online. I am glad the dedicated men and women of the Coast Guard, law enforcement, the TSA, and all of the other Federal employees will not have to go longer without pay for their work and will receive their backpay. I know the pain this episode has caused for many Kentuckians and for people all over our country. They deserve this resolution.  In going forward, I hope our Democratic friends will stay true to the commitment they have stated constantly over the past weeks that once the government was reopened, they would be perfectly willing to negotiate in good faith on full-year government funding that would include a significant investment in urgently needed border security measures, including physical barriers.  After all, the only way Federal workers are going to have stability and certainty beyond the next 3 weeks and the only way our border is going to have real security is if the Democrats will stop playing partisan games and get serious about negotiating with the President on a long-term compromise.  The days ahead will tell us whether our Democratic colleagues are actually serious about securing our Nation--whether they actually mean what they say. The President has called on the Senate to act on these proposals, and now that there has been an agreement between the Democrats and the White House, we can make that happen.
