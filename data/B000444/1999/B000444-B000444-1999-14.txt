 President, today I am joined by Senator Roth, in introducing a bill that would designate the White Clay Creek and its tributaries in Delaware and Pennsylvania as a unit of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System.  It has been eight years since I introduced the bill authorizing the study of the White Clay Creek watershed, and thirty years since I began my efforts to protect this unique and valuable region from the over development and urban sprawl that are of increasing concern to all of us.  The White Clay Creek watershed is a truly remarkable environment, covering 107 square miles and draining over 69,000 acres in Delaware and Pennsylvania. Centrally located between the densely urbanized regions of New York and Washington, D.C., the White Clay Creek watershed is within a 2 hour drive of eight million people.  Its diversity of natural, historic, cultural and recreational resources, as detailed in the National Park Service's Resources and Issues Report in September of 1994, is extraordinary. The watershed is home to a wide variety of plant and animal life, archeological sites dating back to prehistoric times, a bi-state preserve and state park, and a source of drinking water for the region.  It became clear, early on, that these resources warranted the federal protection provided under the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. With the introduction of my legislation today, we are entering the last major phase of seeing that protection become a reality.  Before I begin to speak on the particulars of today's legislation and the study process that got us to this point, I think it is important to note that while there are over 150 National Wild and Scenic Rivers across this nation, the White Clay Creek brings with it two distinctions: Specifically, it will be the first and only Wild and Scenic River in Delaware; and, it is the first and only river to be studied for designation on a watershed basis.  The study of the White Clay Creek for possible inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System recently culminated with the release of a National Park Service study report in September of this year. The study process began in 1992, when Congress directed the National Park Service to convene a study task force consisting of state and local governments, community organizations, watershed residents and landowners within the White Clay Creek watershed.  As described in the study legislation, the duties of the task force were to evaluate the eligibility and suitability of the White Clay Creek and its tributaries, and to develop a management plan for the preservation and protection of the watershed. Fifteen local governments in Delaware and Pennsylvania participated in the study task force.  I stated during hearings on the study legislation, before the Senate Subcommittee on Forests and Public LandManagement in November of 1991, that there was tremendous support for the study and subsequent designation. However, I realized that with the diverse group of individuals, organizations and agencies making up the task force, the possibility for conflict in determining which segments should be designated and what protections afforded them, could be great.  What I could not have expected and what I am extremely pleased to report is that the support for protection of the White Clay Creek is so strong, that over 190 miles of the approximately 400 river miles studied in the watershed are being requested for designation today. Clearly, Delawareans and Pennsylvanians alike understand the value of preserving areas as unique as the White Clay Creek.  And, the legislation I am introducing will do just that. It directs the National Park Service to incorporate 190.9 miles of the White Clay Creek and its tributaries into its National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. Along with the designation, all 15 local governments within the watershed area have unanimously supported, through the passage of resolutions, the ideals and goals of the White Clay Creek Management Plan. The plan, developed by the White Clay Creek Task Force, will ensure long-term protection of the White Clay Creek watershed, emphasizing the importance of local governments working together, which is key in obtaining the federal designation I am seeking today.  Designation of the White Clay Creek and its tributaries will bring national attention to the unique cultural, natural and recreational values of the area. It will provide an added level of protection from over development, by requiring an in-depth review by the National Park Service of any proposed project requiring federal permits or federal funding in the affected area. And finally, it elevates the value of the watershed when applying for state, local and federal preservation grants.  Of the 69,000 acres in the watershed, 5,000 acres are public lands owned by state and local governments, the rest is privately owned and maintained. There are no federal lands within the watershed and no federal dollars will be used to purchase any land within its boundaries.  I believe the protection of the White Clay Creek watershed to be one of the most important environmental initiatives I have undertaken since taking office in 1973, and it is my hope that Congress will act quickly on this bill so it can be preserved not only for us, but also for all the generations to come.                                 ______                                       By
