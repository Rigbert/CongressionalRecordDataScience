Earlier on the amendment I called up regarding the $1.8 billion add-back, there were two amendments. I asked that they be considered en bloc. It was objected to by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Walsh) so they stayed separate, but we were allocated only 5 minutes.  Mr. Chairman, I would ask unanimous consent for those additional 5 minutes to hear from a few Members who were precluded from speaking.
