President, while this is my first opportunity to vote for a Supreme Court nominee named by a Democratic President, I don't view the confirmation of judges through a partisan lens. Instead of partisanship, I have developed several criteria for assessing Supreme Court nominations. I believe these criteria are straightforward, and they are easy to understand:  Does the nominee have extensive experience with the law and a judicial temperament?  Has the nominee demonstrated sharp legal intelligence and sound judgment?  Does the individual display a judicial philosophy that falls within the mainstream of American legal thought?  Is he or she able and willing to separate their personal beliefs from their constitutional obligations?  On each count, I rule in favor of Judge Sotomayor.  My colleagues and I have all been listening carefully to Judge Sotomayor's testimony, and we have reviewed her record. In that record, everything I have been able to ascertain indicates that Justice Sotomayor will look a lot like Judge Sotomayor--an exemplary arbiter of the law, firm but practical, tough but fair.  For these reasons, I will cast my vote to confirm her as the next Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.  I speak from, perhaps, a unique position among Senators. I may be the shortest serving Senator in the history on our Senate Judiciary Committee. At the beginning of the 111th Congress, Senator Reid asked me to serve on this extraordinarily important committee. Senator Reid told me it would be atemporary assignment, but I was still on the committee when Judge Sotomayor was nominated to the Supreme Court. I very much enjoyed my meeting with Judge Sotomayor, and I told her I wasn't sure how long I would be serving on the committee. I said I felt a little bit like a snowflake with the prospect of an Oregon rain coming in the afternoon. In fact, the rain came just a few days before the Judiciary Committee began the confirmation hearing for Judge Sotomayor. I did get a chance to talk with her and discuss, at some length, her views with respect to the key issues surrounding how a Senator evaluates a nominee to the Supreme Court.  On the basis of that discussion and a review of her record, while I wasn't able to cast a vote for her in committee, it is going to be, later this week, an honor for me to vote for her on the Senate floor.  When I met with Judge Sotomayor, we discussed a number of important issues--particularly matters relating to national security, the power of the Commander in Chief, and we also spent some time on a matter that I know the occupant of the chair is most interested in and that is end-of-life health care. What struck me the most about Judge Sotomayor was her openness, her intellectual curiosity, and her desire to make sure she had all the facts, all the information, all the views and background and the reading material that you have to have when you are going to make a call not on the basis of your predisposition but on the basis of the law and the law as it is applied to the facts.  In a number of areas we discussed with respect to end of life, Judge Sotomayor acknowledged that these were issues she hadn't personally considered. The occupant of the chair and I have talked at some length about the politicized case of the late Terri Schiavo. I objected on the floor of the Senate to the Senate considering that matter.  Of course, Judge Sotomayor could not go into how she would rule on end-of-life cases. But we talked at some length about those issues, and I am going to discuss them later in this statement tonight.  I wish to start my comments by saying I believe, with the young people at home in Oregon, this nomination by President Obama is regarded as an inspiration and a remarkable personal story. Oregonians have told me they look at her journey as the realization of the American dream. Oregonians have followed her testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee. They believe she is qualified for this job. They are very excited about the fact that this nomination makes history, and I commend the President for demonstrating with this nomination how it is possible to increase the diversity, talent, and experience on the Supreme Court with one very capable individual.  Chairman Leahy and others have done an excellent job of going through the judge's impressive background. I do want to spend some time talking about the issues that Judge Sotomayor and I discussed in my office most extensively--Presidential power and end of life.  Serving on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, I have followed the history with respect to a President's Commander in Chief authority. Disagreements about this authority and how it is applied are certainly nothing new. There have been vigorous debates about this issue since our country was founded. But over the past several years, there has been especially heated debate around these questions and, in particular, the issue of whether, during times of war, the President has the authority to ignore laws passed by the Congress. As a result, there have been several occasions, over the past few years, where the Supreme Court has had to rule on major national security issues and address this question directly.  Our Court has frequently been sharply divided on this issue. At the same time, it has consistently ruled that--in Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's words--``a state of war is not a blank check for the President.'' I believe this is a principle that has to be upheld.  When I raised these issues with Judge Sotomayor, I was impressed with her thoughtfulness, her knowledge, and the experience she discussed about dealing with these thorny issues. Her answers made me believe that, as a Supreme Court Justice, she would apply the Constitution in a way that struck a balance--a very careful balance--between protecting our collective security and protecting our individual liberty.  We have always had, in the national security area, something of a constitutional teeter-totter, where the Founding Fathers always sought to try to ensure that there was an appropriate balance between protecting our Nation and securing our individual liberties; and maintaining that balance is what the Founding Fathers saw as paramount.  While Judge Sotomayor certainly gave no inkling to me in our discussion about national security how she might rule in a particular case, I felt very strongly that she would be able to define the reach of the Commander in Chief's power so as to strike that appropriate balance between collective security and individual liberty.  I must say, I don't want judges who will defer to any one President. I want judges who are going to defer to the Constitution. I believe Judge Sotomayor will do that in her service on the U.S. Supreme Court.  As I mentioned, I discussed with the judge the matter of end-of-life health care. This is a very sensitive issue for millions of Americans. What was striking about this in our discussions, when she and I met, is she recognized it was a contentious area of the law--one that deals with the rights of individuals and family members; and she certainly indicated she was going to spend a lot of time trying to learn about the history of cases in this area and the Court's judgments on end-of-life care.  I have been very interested particularly in Justice Brandeis's dissent in the Olmstead case. This was a 1928 case. The Supreme Court later adopted Justice Brandeis's view in the Katz case which essentially made it clear there is a right to be left alone, a right to be respected in these very delicate questions.  What concerned me so much about the Terry Schiavo case--and again, Judge Sotomayor gave no inkling about how she would rule on an end-of-life case--I think she understood my concern, and would follow up on it, that we cannot have elected officials, and particularly the Senate, become something of a medical court of appeals where the Senate essentially appoints itself the arbiter of these very difficult tragedies.  Judge Sotomayor did not commit herself to any specific position on end-of-life issues or any of the other issues. And, in fact, the judge said that coming from New York where they have a very sophisticated set of laws and legal protections to empower the individual to make their own choices--not government--empower the individual to make these very difficult questions, the judge said because New York had those statutes empowering individuals that she would spend time looking at the laws and the decisions of the Supreme Court in this area, reflecting, again, her commitment to follow the facts, follow the law, and not bring any predisposition of one sort or another to a very difficult and contentious area of the law, one that is as sure as night follows the day is going to be before the Supreme Court again--the matter of end-of-life health care.  Let me also mention one of our colleagues talked about her respect for precedent. I asked her about a woman's right to choose. She said that is an area of the law that has been settled for decades.  On the second amendment, she indicated she would not try to eliminate the right to own guns for hunting or for personal protection, again, what amounts to a recognition of existing law.  On foreign law, she said she would not rely on international legal decisions to interpret the Constitution.  This is a nominee who is going to be very sensitive to following precedent, following the facts, and ensuring that those principles are what guide her service on the U.S. Supreme Court.  Before I close, I wish to submit a letter the Senate Judiciary Committee received in support of Judge Sotomayor from the Federal Bar Association. They passed a resolution in support of the judge's nomination. The Senate Judiciary Committee has also received statements of support from the Hispanic National Bar Association, from the past presidents of NHBA.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter and resolution and statement of support.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                     June 1, 2009.     Re Nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the United States          Supreme Court.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Washington          DC.

Respectfully,                                     Katherine Gonzalez-Valentiin,     President.                                  ____   Resolution of the Board of Directors on President Barack Obama's  Nominee for the Current Judicial Vacancy in the United States Supreme                                  Court       Whereas on May 26, 2009, President Barack Obama nominated      Judge Sonia Sotomayor to fill the vacancy left by Justice      David H. Souter in the United States Supreme Court;       Whereas Judge Sotomayor has received widespread support,      and in view of this Chapter, is an exceptionally qualified      federal jurist with a stellar record of professional      achievement;       Whereas the Board of Directors of this Chapter is convinced      that the nominee will administer justice fairly and      impartially, and will faithfully and impartially discharge      and perform all the duties incumbent upon her under the      Constitution and laws of the United States; and further, will      support and defend the Constitution of the United States      against all enemies, foreign and domestic, and will bear true      allegiance to our Constitution and laws;       Whereas this Board of Directors is fully satisfied that      Judge Sotomayor possesses the necessary professional skills,      temperament, and other qualifications that are required to      perform this important judicial role with distinction;       Now, therefore, the Board of Directors of the Federal Bar      Association, Hon. Raymond L. Acosta Puerto Rico Chapter,      hereby unanimously resolves:       1.

To exhort the United States Senate and Its Committee on      the Judiciary to expeditiously consider and favorably act on      Judge Sonia Sotomayor's nomination, so that the United States      Supreme Court may have a full complement of Justices by the      time the Supreme Court reconvenes on October 5, 2009.       In San Juan, Puerto Rico, this 29th day of May, 2009.                            Hispanic National Bar Association,                                                     July 8, 2009.      HNBA Announces Endorsement of the Honorable Sonia Sotomayor       Washington, DC.--The Hispanic National Bar Association      (HNBA) announced today that it has formally endorsed The      Honorable Sonia M. Sotomayor to serve as Associate Justice of      the Supreme Court of the United States. The HNBA's Special      Committee on the U.S. Supreme Court has concluded its most      recent review of Judge Sotomayor's qualifications and overall      record, and found her to be `extraordinarily well-qualified'      to serve on the Nation's highest court. According to Ramona      E. Romero, HNBA National President, ``the HNBA unanimously      endorsed Judge Sotomayor after reviewing her judicial record,      professional competence, intellect, character, reputation for      integrity, temperament, commitment to equal justice and      record of service to the American public and the Hispanic      community.'' Carlos Ortiz, who co-chairs the HNBA's Supreme      Court Committee, added that ``based on our review, we are      certain that she is extraordinary well-equipped to serve on      our country's high court. We believe that she embodies all      the qualities required for service as a Justice, and are      confident that, when confirmed, she will render fair and      impartial justice for all Americans. We recommend her without      any reservation.''       This is the HNBA's fourth review of Judge Sotomayor's      record. The HNBA conducted due diligence before including      Judge Sotomayor on a short list of potential Hispanic      American nominees for the U.S. Supreme Court released in      2005. Her credentials were also reviewed by the HNBA prior to      her elevation to the Second Circuit in 1998, and when she was      nominated for the U.S. District Court. ``In each instance, we      have been impressed by her intellect, her commitment to the      rule of law and equal justice, her experience, and her      respect for all who interact with the legal system,'' said      Ms. Romero. Since the nomination of Judge Sotomayor to the      U.S. Supreme Court in late May, the HNBA has met with members      of the Senate Judiciary Committee and their staff to advocate      for a fair and expeditious confirmation hearing. The HNBA      looks forward to the opportunity to reiterate its strong      support for Judge Sotomayor during the confirmation process.       The HNBA Supreme Court Committee is co-chaired by Robert      Raben, founder and President of The Raben Group. Its members      are Michael A. Olivas, Houston, TX; HNBA Law Professor Sect      Chair Emeritus, 1987-2009; Gilbert F. Casellas, Round Rock,      TX; HNBA Past President, 1984-1985; Mark S. Gallegos, Miami,      FL; HNBA Past President, 1988-1989; Dolores S. Atencio,      Denver, CO; HNBA Past President, 1991-1992; Mary T.      Hernandez, San Jose, CA; HNBA Past President, 1994-1995;      Gregory A. Vega, San Diego, CA; HNBA Past President, 1997-     1998; Lillian R. Apodaca, Albuquerque, NM; HNBA Past      President, 1998-1999.       The Hispanic National Bar Association (HNBA) is an      incorporated, not-for-profit, national membership Association      that represents the interests of the more than 100,000      attorneys, judges, law professors, legal assistants, and law      students of Hispanic descent in the United States, its      territories and Puerto Rico. For more information about the      HNBA, please visit www.hnba.com.                                  ____                       HNBA Presidents' Statement       We the undersigned past presidents of the Hispanic National      Bar Association wholeheartedly support the nomination of      Judge Sonia Sotomayor to serve as an Associate Justice on the      United States Supreme Court. Judge Sotomayor has exceptional      academic and professional credentials. She is a summa cum      laude graduate of Princeton University and graduated from      Yale Law School, where she served as an editor of the Yale      Law Journal. Before her appointment to the federal bench,      Judge Sotomayor was a prosecutor for five years in the      Manhattan District Attorney's Office and then a commercial      litigator in a private law firm. Judge Sotomayor has been a      federal judge for 17 years, serving with distinction on both      the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York      and the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.       We have all long been troubled by the fact that no person      of Hispanic heritage has ever served on our nation's highest      court. During our terms as HNBA President, each and every one      of us engaged in bipartisan efforts to diversify the federal      bench and to build a pipeline of qualified Latino lawyers,      jurists and legal scholars who would be prepared to serve on      the U.S. Supreme Court with distinction. We have always been      convinced that greater diversity on the Supreme Court would      broaden and strengthen the perspective of its jurisprudence      and enhance the administration of justice for all Americans.      Words cannot adequately express the delight in our hearts      that our time has finally arrived. We urge the U.S. Senate to      confirm an exceptional jurist with extraordinary federal      judicial and legal experience, Judge Sonia Sotomayor.         Mario G. Obledo, John R.
