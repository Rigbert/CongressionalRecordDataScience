President, today I wish to honor the contributions of Mena Boulanger to the Chicagoland area. Next week, Mena is retiring after 30 years of work to raise public awareness of the Forest Preserve District of Cook County and its conservation efforts throughout its 76,000 acres.  In the fall of 1973, the Boulanger family--Mena and David and children Sarah and John--made their way from Seattle, WA, to Cook County, IL. The family began spending almost every weekend exploring the various Forest Preserve District sites in the Western suburbs of Chicago. Leaving behind the landscape of their native Pacific Northwest, the family's appreciation of the Midwest flora and fauna came slowly, and so did a commitment to the prairie around Chicago--lands now part of Chicago Wilderness.  In 1979, Mena began as the first, full-time Director of Development for the Lincoln Park Zoological Society. Forthe following 11 years, Mena dramatically increased fundraising efforts, allowing the Lincoln Park Zoo to expand at an unprecedented rate.  Mena transitioned to Chicago's Zoological Society, working with the Brookfield Zoo in 1991, where she assumed the role as Vice President for Development. It was during this time, that Mena achieved one of her most significant long-term accomplishments. Mena helped secure additional bonding authority for the Forest Preserve District so that it could address its capital maintenance needs, as well as the needs of the Brookfield Zoo and Chicago Botanic Gardens. The Forest Preserve District's holdings--and those of the Brookfield Zoo and Chicago Botanic Garden--have significantly improved through the use of these bond funds.  In 2003, she became the Vice President of Government Affairs and Strategic Initiatives, directing the Zoo's local, State, and Federal government communications and solicitation programs. Mena worked closely with Zoo staff to help the Forest Preserve District better serve Cook County residents through special outreach programs, including tours for senior groups, family pass programs at area libraries, and information on Brookfield Zoo job fairs and lecture series.  One of Mena's signature achievements was raising funds for the Hamill Family Play Zoo, an award-winning play area for children age 8 and under that has served as a model for many zoos across the country.  A few years ago, Mena was diagnosed with breast cancer. In the midst of a personal health crisis and in addition to pursuing traditional therapies, Mena thought about all of the women in her life--daughter, granddaughters, friends, colleagues--and enrolled in an NIH-funded study at Loyola University in Chicago, examining the effects of meditation on immune cells in breast cancer patients. That is what makes Mena special. She is always optimistic, always strong, and always looking to help others. I am happy to say that Mena's cancer is in remission. She is a survivor. She is also an inspiration.  To say that Mena is ``retiring'' somehow doesn't seem quite right. It would be more accurate to say that she is redirecting her energies. I have no doubt that Mena will remain involved in her community and committed to the many causes in which she believes so deeply. I know she is excited to spend more time with her family, especially her four grandchildren. Mena will enjoy having more free time to spend hiking, picnicking and exploring the lands of the Forest Preserve District she treasures so dearly. And if you know Mena, you also know that she enjoys a good, spirited political debate. I can only imagine how retirement will foster that passion.  It is with a sense of gratitude that I wish Mena Boulanger well as she prepares to retire from the Chicago Zoological Society and moves on to the next chapter in her life. Mena has created a lasting impact on the lives of thousands through her work and volunteerism in the Chicagoland region. Anyone that has visited either the Lincoln Park Zoo or Brookfield Zoo since 1980 has benefited from Mena's efforts and generosity.  I wish Mena Boulanger the best in her retirement and thank her for caring for the Midwest flora and fauna she embraced some 35 years ago.                          ____________________
