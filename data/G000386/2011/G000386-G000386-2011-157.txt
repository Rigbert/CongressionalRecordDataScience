 President, I, Senator Grassley, intend to object to the consideration of S. 520, S. 530, S. 871, and S. 1057. These bills would eliminate or modify current incentives for the production and use of domestic, renewable biofuels. I object to their consideration because they would lead to greater dependence on foreign oil, increased prices at the gas pump forconsumers, increased greenhouse gas emissions, and the loss of U.S. jobs. They also represent poor tax policy.                          ____________________
