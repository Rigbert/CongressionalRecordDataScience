We have moved very quickly on it. I hope we do not run into the situation that happened last year. We spent a lot of time on the juvenile justice bill, and then it languished and languished after coming out of committee. It sat so long that by the time we got to it, the time of the session ran out. In fact, the end of the Congress ran out.  Here we are not right at the end of a Congress, but we are facing a school year, and we should begin.  I promised the distinguished senior Senator from New Hampshire that I would wrap up. I believe I have wrapped up.
