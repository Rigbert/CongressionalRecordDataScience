Speaker, I rise today to recognize University of Oregon (UO) Professor David Frank. In his 32 year career at the UO, Professor Frank has taught, mentored, and inspired generations of students. He has shaped the study of speech and debate as the dean of the Robert D. Clark Honors Program at the UO and as the longtime director of the UO Forensics Program. For his exemplary work and for his leadership, the UO college debate tournament has been renamed the David Frank Tournament of Scholars.   Professor Frank is renowned for his wit, rhetorical flair, and passion for the principles of debate. He is the recipient of five teaching awards, including three university wide recognitions and a career achievement award in forensics. He has overseen the UO Forensics Program since 1981, which won three national championships and international recognition, with a team competing in the semifinal round at the 2006 World Universities Championship in Dublin, Ireland.   As a University of Oregon graduate, it is my pleasure to highlight the outstanding accomplishments of Professor Frank. I am also proud to note that Oregon forensics dates to the founding of the university in 1876. One of the very first intercollegiate debates in America occurred in 1891 between Oregon and Willamette University. The style of debate now known as policy cross-examination was developed at the University of Oregon in the 1930s.   The UO hosts the first David Frank Tournament of Scholars later this month, an honor Professor Frank so richly merits.                          ____________________
