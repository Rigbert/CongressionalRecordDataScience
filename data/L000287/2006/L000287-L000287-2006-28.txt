Mr. Speaker, the Voting Rights Act was good for America in 1965 and it is good and necessary in 2006. We must strengthen our resolve and complete the job that we began almost a year ago in a bipartisan way and pass the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act tomorrow without amendment.  The struggle for voting rights was not so long ago. It was not 75 or 100 years ago. It was 41 years ago that this Voting Rights Act was passed. This is not ancient history. Yet so many Members of the House are too young to remember our very dark history of segregation and voting discrimination.  The history of the right to vote in America is a history of conflict, of violence, of struggle for the right to vote. Many people died trying to gain that right. I was beaten and jailed because I stood up for it. The experience of minorities today tell us that the struggle is not over, and that the special provisions of the Voting Rights Act are still necessary.  We do not want to go back to our dark past, and we must not go back. Forty-one years ago it was almost impossible for people of color to register to vote in many parts of the American South, in Georgia, in Alabama, and in Mississippi. Forty-one years ago, the State of Mississippi had a black voting-age population of more than 450,000, and only about 16,000 blacks were registered to vote.  Just 41 years ago, people of color had to pay a poll tax, pass a so-called literacy test in some States in the South. There were black men and women who were professors in colleges and universities, black lawyers and black doctors who were told they could not read or write well enough to register to vote.  They were asked to interpret certain sections of the Constitution in southern States. Some were asked to count the number of bubbles in a bar of soap, others were asked to count the number of jelly beans in a jar.  People stood in unmovable lines for the opportunity to register to vote. In some States voters could register only on 1 or 2 days a month; but those lines never moved, and those would-be voters were never registered. People were beaten, arrested, jailed, people even shot and killed for attempting to register to vote. It was a matter of life and death.  On March 7, 1965, about 600 of us black men and women and a few young children attempted to peacefully march from Selma, Alabama, to Montgomery to the State capitol to dramatize to the Nation and to the world that people of color wanted to register to vote. The world watched as we were met with nightsticks, bullwhips, we were trampled by horses, and tear-gassed.  Eight days after what became known as Bloody Sunday, President Johnson came to this podium and spoke to a joint session of Congress and began by saying, ``I speak tonight for the dignity of man and for the destiny of democracy.'' And during that speech, President Johnson condemned the violence in Selma and called on the Congress to enact a Voting Rights Act. He closed his speech by quoting the rights of the civil rights movement saying, ``And we shall overcome.''  I was sitting next to Martin Luther King, Jr., in the home of a local family in Selma, Alabama, as we listened to Lyndon Johnson say, ``And we shall overcome.'' Tears came down his face. And we all cried. Dr. King said, ``John, the Voting Rights Act will be passed, and we will make it from Selma to Montgomery.''  Congress did pass the Voting Rights Act. On August 6, 1965 it was signed into law.  There was an elderly black man who lived in Selma, Alabama, who after Johnson had signed the Voting Rights Act became registered to vote for the first time. He was 91 years old. He said, ``I am registered now. I can die and go home to my Lord.''  Today, people no longer meet attack dogs and bullwhips and fire hoses as they demonstrate or attempt to register to vote. Today, the tools of discrimination are not poll takes and literacy tests. But make no mistake, discrimination still exists. Look at Florida in 2000. Look at Ohio.  The tools of discrimination are much more difficult, but just as dangerous. Today, the discrimination comes in the form of redistricting and annexation plans, at-large elections, polling place changes.  In my own State of Georgia, the legislation went back to a period in our dark history by passing a voter ID law that would make it more difficult for the elderly, the poor and minorities to vote. Both a State and a Federal court jurist have called the law unconstitutional and stopped it from taking effect.  We can do better. We must do better, and pass the Voting Rights Act without amendment tomorrow.                          ____________________
