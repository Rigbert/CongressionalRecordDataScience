 2239) for Mr. Bingaman. (Purpose: To limit access by minors to cigarettes through prohibiting  the sale of tobacco products in vending machines and the distribution  of free samples of tobacco products in Federal buildings and property                          accessible by minors)       At the appropriate place in the bill add the following new      section:       Sec.   . (a) This section may be cited as the ``Prohibition      of Cigarette Sales to Minors in Federal Buildings and Lands      Act''.       (b) The Congress finds that--       (1) cigarette smoking and the use of smokeless tobacco      products continue to represent major health hazards to the      Nation, causing more than 420,000 deaths each year;       (2) cigarette smoking continues to be the single most      preventable cause of death and disability in the United      States;       (3) tobacco products contain hazardous additives, gases,      and other chemical constituents dangerous to health;       (4) the use of tobacco products costs the United States      more than $50,000,000,000 in direct health care costs, with      more than $21,000,000,000 of these costs being paid by      government funds;       (5) tobacco products contain nicotine, a poisonous,      addictive drug;       (6) all States prohibit the sale of tobacco products to      minors, but enforcement has been ineffective or nonexistent      and tobacco products remain one of the least regulated      consumer products in the United States;       (7) over the past decade, little or no progress has been      made in reducing tobacco use among teenagers and recently,      teenage smoking rates appear to be rising;       (8) more than two-thirds of smokers smoke their first      cigarette before the age of 14, and 90 percent of adult      smokers did so by age 18;       (9) 516,000,000 packs of cigarettes are consumed by minors      annually, at least half of which are illegally sold to      minors;       (10) reliable studies indicate that tobacco use is a      gateway to illicit drug use; and       (11) the Federal Government has a major policy setting role      in ensuring that the use of tobacco products among minors is      discouraged to the maximum extent possible.       (c) As used in this section--       (1) the term ``Federal agency'' means--       (A) an Executive agency as defined in section 105 of title      5, United States Code; and       (B) each entity specified in subparagraphs (B) through (H)      of section 5721(1) of title 5, United States Code;       (2) the term ``Federal building'' means--       (A) any building or other structure owned in whole or in      part by the United States or any Federal agency, including      any such structure occupied by a Federal agency under a lease      agreement; and       (B) includes the real property on which such building is      located;       (3) the term ``minor'' means an individual under the age of      18 years; and       (4) the term ``tobacco product'' means cigarettes, cigars,      little cigars, pipe tobacco, smokeless tobacco, snuff, and      chewing tobacco.       (d)(1) No later than 45 days after the date of the      enactment of this Act, the Administrator of General Services      and the head of each Federal agency shall promulgate      regulations that prohibit--       (A) the sale of tobacco products in vending machines      located in or around any Federal building under the      jurisdiction of the Administrator or such agency head; and       (B) the distribution of free samples of tobacco products in      or around any Federal building under the jurisdiction of the      Administrator or such agency head.       (2) The Administrator of General Services or the head of an      agency, as appropriate, may designate areas not subject to      the provisions of paragraph (1), if such area also prohibits      the presence of minors.       (3) The provisions of this subsection shall be carried      out--       (A) by the Administrator of General Services for any      Federal building which is maintained, leased, or has title of      ownership vested in the General Services Administration; or       (B) by the head of a Federal agency for any Federal      building which is maintained, leased, or has title of      ownership vested in such agency.       (e) No later than 90 days after the date of enactment of      this Act, the Administrator of General Services and each head      of an agency shall prepare and submit, to the appropriate      committees of Congress, a report that shall contain--       (1) verification that the Administrator or such head of an      agency is in compliance with this section; and       (2) a detailed list of the location of all tobacco product      vending machines located in Federal buildings under the      administration of the Administrator or such head of an      agency.       (f)(1) No later than 45 days after the date of the      enactment of this Act, the Senate Committee on Rules and      Administration and the House of Representatives Committee on      House Administration, after consultation with the Architect      of the Capitol, shall promulgate regulations under the Senate      and House of Representatives rulemaking authority that      prohibit the sale of tobacco products in vending machines in      the Capitol Buildings.       (2) Such committees may designate areas where such      prohibition shall not apply, if such area also prohibits the      presence of minors.       (3) For the purpose of this section the term ``Capitol      Buildings'' shall have the same meaning as such term is      defined under section 16(a)(1) of the Act entitled ``An Act      to define the area of the United States Capitol Grounds, to      regulate the use thereof, and for other purposes'', approved      July 31, 1946 (40 U.S.C. 193m(1)).       (g) Nothing in this section shall be construed as      restricting the authority of the Administrator of General      Services or the head of an agency to limit tobacco product      use in or around any Federal building, except as provided      under subsection (d)(1).
