Madam Speaker, I rise today to call attention to the true story of Adam Pietras, a Boy Scout from my home town of Hamilton, N.J. in the Fourth Congressional District.  Adam's remarkable courage--without any concern for his own personal safety--and his immediate and decisive response action literally helped save the life of his sister.  This Saturday, March 16, 2019, Adam will be honored at a Court of Honor by his fellow scouts of Boy Scout Troop 87, members from the Veterans of Foreign War who host Troop 87, friends, and family. We will be proud and humble to present him with a U.S. flag, flown over the U.S. Capitol in his honor.  Madam Speaker, Adam was only 10, when he acted without regard to his own safety as he fought off a loose Bullmastiff dog that was charging to attack his younger sister, Rachel, then age 7, in the family's backyard in 2015. Though Adam sustained severe injuries from the powerful dog, his actions enabled his sister to escape and his brother, Tyler, to run for help. Truly, Adam and Tyler's teamwork to protect their little sister prevented what could have been a tragedy. Adam was rushed to Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital--Hamilton. He lost a lot of blood and needed 200 stitches and months to recover.  Adam's exceptional actions went largely unreported in the news and were not well known outside his immediate family and community. That changed when he was a guest of the Sunshine Foundation Mercer County Chapter's 2018 Operation Dreamlift that takes children to Disney World. Trentonian reporter L.A. Parker happened to be on that flight, met Adam and heard Adam's story. In a column detailing the dog attack and Adam's actions, L.A. Parker--my fellow Trenton State College alumnus, quoted Adam as saying ``Yes, I was afraid really afraid. But I had to save my sister.''  Adam is a student at Reynolds Middle School in Hamilton, N.J. I've had the pleasure to meet Adam's father, Peter Pietras, who with his wife, Lisa Pitoniak-Pietras, and family and friends, are immensely proud of Adam. Adam, whose outstanding love for his sister shows he puts other people first, has a bright future.  Adam was honored by Hamilton Mayor Kelly Yaede with a proclamation as an example of a model citizen, and by the Boy Scouts of America with its highest national award for lifesaving and meritorious action, the Honor Medal With Crossed Palms. Given only for outstanding and unusual acts that demonstrate unusual heroism, skill, or bravery and reflect Scouting ideals, the medal is only presented to Scouts who have ``demonstrated unusual heroism and extraordinary skill or resourcefulness in saving or attempting to save life at extreme risk to self.'' That sounds like Adam to me.  Today it is my honor to make Adam's heroism and extraordinary act a permanent part of the Congressional Record.  In an age of fictional movie action heroes and comic book superheroes, this Saturday a real-life action hero will be the star. If Adam were in the military our nation would be looking to bestow one of its highest medals for his valor. Well done, Adam, well done.                          ____________________
