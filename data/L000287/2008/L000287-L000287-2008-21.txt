Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 6893, the Fostering Connections to Success Act and Increasing Adoptions Act.  I applaud the Gentleman from Washington (Mr. McDermott) and the Gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Weller) for working with our Senate colleagues in crafting this legislation. I am proud to serve on the Ways and Means Income Security and Family Support Subcommittee under their leadership.  Today, more than half a million children are living in foster care. H.R. 6893 addresses many of the key problems that plague the foster care system. This bill includes much needed educational stability requirements and new oversight for children's health care. H.R. 6893 also includes key adoption incentives that help create permanent, safe, loving families for all children. Of particular importance to my constituents in Georgia are the improvements to kinship guardian care and to services for youth aging out of foster care included in this bill.  I am proud to be a cosponsor of this important legislation; it is an important step in the right direction. We must pass H.R. 6893 in both the House and Senate before the end of this Congress. Then we must collaborate on more comprehensive improvements to the child welfare system in the 111th Congress.  Madam Speaker, in my home state, there are thousands of young people in foster care. Young people in foster care have not chosen this life. For a variety of reasons beyond their control, foster care children are uprooted from all that they know and rely on us for help. We must answer their call. As Members of Congress, citizens, and as parents, we must open our hearts and offer our hands and resources to serve these young people.  I ask my colleagues to join me in doing so by supporting H.R. 6893. We would do no less for our own children.
