  I would like to enter a letter into the Record from a physician, an obstetrician, a surgeon, who served as chief of the Abortion Surveillance Branch at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, where he did some preliminary work in evaluating third-trimester abortions, and finds this issue to be largely a smokescreen for those opposed to abortion. He points out the rarity of these abortions. He points out that in a study in Atlanta, the rate of third-trimester abortions was 4 per 100,000 abortions. I think this letter provides some accurate and vital testimony.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                         University of California,                                                San Francisco,                              San Francisco, CA, October 11, 1995.     Re H.R. 1833/S. 939.     Ross Rubin, J.D.,     Legislative Council, American Medical Association, Chicago,          IL.       Dear Mr. Rubin: As a member of the AMA and a long-time      provider of abortions, I write to express my concern about      the reported intention of the AMA to endorse a ban of certain      abortion techniques. As background, I have conducted research      on the safety of abortion for two decades. Some of that      research has appeared in JAMA. I am Board certified in both      obstetrics and gynecology (for which I am an Examiner) and in      preventive medicine. In the 1980's, I served as Chief of the      Abortion Surveillance Branch at the Centers for Disease      Control in Atlanta, where I was the principal federal agent      responsible for determining the safety of abortion in the      U.S. I have served as a consultant to the Planned Parenthood      Federation of America and the American College of      Obstetricians and Gynecologists concerning abortion issues. I      currently chair the Steering Committee for the World Health      Organization Task Force on Post-Ovulatory Fertility Control,      which studies abortion internationally. I have testified      before Congressional subcommittees several times concerning      abortion issues.       First, the term being used by abortion opponents, ``partial      birth abortion,'' is not a medical term. It is not found in      any medical dictionary or gynecology text. It was coined to      inflame, rather than to illuminate. It lacks a definition.       As I understand the term, opponents of abortion are using      this phrase to describe one variant of the dilation and      evacuation procedure (D&E), which is the dominant method of      second-trimester abortion in the U.S. If one does not use      D&E, the alternative methods of abortion after 12 weeks'      gestation are ``total birth abortion:'' labor induction,      which is more costly and painful, or hysterotomy, which is      still most costly, painful, and hazardous. Given the enviable      record of safety of all D&E methods, as documented by the      Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Lawson et al.      Abortion mortality, United States, 1972 through 1987. Am J      Obstet Gynecol 1994;171:1365-1372), there is no public health      justification for any regulation or intervention in a      physician's decision-making with the patient.       Second, the issue of alleged ``third-trimester abortion''      is largely a smoke screen of those opposed to abortion.      Abortions after 24 weeks are exceedingly rare in the U.S.      Indeed, my colleagues and I at the Centers for Disease      Control investigated two years' worth of reports of such      abortions in Georgia. Nearly all were coding errors      concerning gestational age or fetal death in utero. We found      two uterine evacuations for anencephaly, and one case with      inadequate documentation. The rate of third-trimester      abortion was 4 per 100,000 abortions. (Spitz et al. Third-     trimester induced abortion in Georgia, 1979 and 1980. Am J      Public Health 1983;73:594-595)       According to Congress Daily, the legislative council felt      that some unspecified D&E variation is not a recognized      medical procedure. If so, this may reflect only the      composition and medical background of the legislative      council. Several variations of the D&E technique have been      widely used in the U.S. over the past twenty years (Grimes et      al. Midtrimester abortion by dilation and evacuation: a safe      and practical alternative. N Engl J. Med 1977;296:1141-1145)      and are well known to gynecologists and others who provide      abortions.       In summary, abortions after 24 week's gestation are      exceedingly uncommon and are done for compelling fetal or      maternal indications only. Variations of D&E are by far the      most common means of abortion in the U.S. after 12 weeks'      gestation. Outpatient D&E dramatically reduces medical costs      and pa- tient suffering, while having morbidity and mortality      comparable to labor induction. From a public health      perspective, any intrusion of Congress into this medical      issue is both unwarranted and unjustified. I hope that the      AMA will strongly oppose any such regulation of the practice      of medicine by anti-abortion activists.       If I can be of help to the legislative council by providing      references or by meeting with your group in Chicago, I would      be glad to do so. Thanks very much for your consideration.           Sincerely yours,                                            David A. Grimes, M.D.,                                         Professor and Vice Chair.
