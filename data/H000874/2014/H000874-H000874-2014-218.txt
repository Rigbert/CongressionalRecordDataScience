 Certainly we are not proponents of ``my way or the highway,'' and I am glad, I do believe, that hopefully the majority leader is not either.  Briefly, on the SKILLS Act, we have legislation, of course, on our side of the aisle, a number of pieces of legislation which deal with training, job skills, and we are certainly prepared to work on those. Unfortunately, as the gentleman knows, that bill passed out in a partisan way. There were two Democrats who voted for it. But I am certainly willing to work with the gentleman, and I think our side of the aisle is willing to work with the gentleman to invest and to give flexibility so that we can recognize, obviously, that what may be needed in my district or the gentleman from Virginia's district is different from a district in Washington State or California or Texas or Florida or Maine. So I want to assure the gentleman that we are prepared to work on that.  Next, can I ask you when those principles that you talked about might be expected, because I think that would be a very positive step forward. But, in my view, if we wait long, comprehensive immigration reform will not get accomplished, as I believe it should be, in the next few months.  I yield to the gentleman.
