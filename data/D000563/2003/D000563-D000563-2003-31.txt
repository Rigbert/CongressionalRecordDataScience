President.  I join my friend and colleague from Nevada, Senator Reid, in saying to Senator Frist, thank you for your leadership. We disagree on issues from time to time, but we agree on some, too. You have been an exceptionally good leader on the Republican side. I have said this to you privately, and I want to make it a matter of public record: I think you have been eminently fair to the minority in this Senate. And that is, I am sure, not an easy task. There are certainly forces at work in your party, as there are in our party, calling for a different outcome.  But I applaud you for your fairness in allowing the minority on this side of the aisle an opportunity to debate, offer amendments, to express our points of view, and bring an issue to a vote. I do not think a member of any legislature--national or State--could ask for anything more. I think you have worked long and hard to make that a hallmark of your leadership.  As a member of the minority, let me say to the Republican leader, thank you for your service to this institution. You have been a great asset to our Nation and to this body.                          ____________________
