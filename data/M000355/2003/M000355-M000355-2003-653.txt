 President, if there is no further business to come before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate stand in adjournment under the previous order.  There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:27 p.m., adjourned until Tuesday, July 15, 2003, at 9:30 a.m.                          ____________________
