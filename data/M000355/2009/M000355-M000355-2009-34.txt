 We have been out here for 2 weeks on the amendment process. We have had 21 votes, many of them have been side-by-sides, in order to cover the majority against the potential downside of voting to cut Medicare and voting to raise taxes.  But there is no serious effort to engage in any kind of genuine amendment process, such as the Senator from Arizona and I have been involved in here for quite a while. Then the bill, which we are actually only allowed to have about two votes a day on, is not the real bill. The real bill--we know the core of it, but there are a lot of things around the edges being slipped in and slipped out, and they want to jam the public before Christmas, as the Senator from Arizona indicated.  How arrogant is that? They think: We know better than you, we know better than the Republicans, and we know better than the public. Why don't all of you--the Republicans and the public--sit down and shut up and leave it to us and we will take care of it before Christmas.
