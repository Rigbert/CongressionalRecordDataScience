 President, I recently heard from an 81-year-old Iowan who is battling cancer. She told me that one test cost more than $12,700. That is almost an entire year's income for that lady. On top of that, her medication is more than $4,700 a month. She is on Humana and Medicare, but that is not enough for her to still afford her medical bills.  Too many Americans share this Iowan's story. That is why we must pass the Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Act, to finally help Americans afford the critical medications they need.  The bill I just named is a bipartisan bill sponsored by this Senator and Democratic Senator Wyden. It got voted out of committee 19 to 9 back in July.  We have the good fortune that the House of Representatives understands that the pricing of prescription drugs is a major problem. They passed a bill last week. I applaud them for taking up this issue. It so happens that the bill they passed probably can't get anywhere near 60 votes in the U.S. Senate, so I hope we will have an opportunity to sit down with Speaker Pelosi and other House Members to see what we can work out to do something about the high cost of prescription drugs for the citizens of this country. Every Member of this body hears from their constituents that they don't like the fantastic increase in prices of drugs that occurs on a regular basis.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
