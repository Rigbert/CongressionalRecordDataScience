Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding and also want to add my voice to those who are complimenting Mr. McLemore on his dedication to public service and his retirement as clerk of the Defense Subcommittee.  I would tell my colleagues that, despite the strong leadership and very best efforts of Chairman Rogers and Ranking Member Lowey, I am abjectly disappointed that we again find ourselves in the position of considering another continuing resolution. Continuing resolutions are no way to run a nation. We cannot expect good government if we are incapable of providing appropriations in a timely and predictable manner.  As importantly, I am greatly concerned about providing another authority for conducting military operations in the Middle East.  In letters to Congress, the President has cited the powers granted to him in Article II of the United States Constitution as the legal basis for some of the actions already taken. In recent briefings and public statements, the administration also indicates that the authorized use of military force resolutions passed in 2001 and 2002 remain the legal foundation for current operations. However, these authorities were approved by the Congress in a different time and for different conflicts and with a very different membership.  The time has come to rationalize the authorities with the needs of the current conflict and for the current legislative body to weigh in on this matter of war and peace rather than to rely on authorities intended for Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden.  I appreciate the President's honesty in pointing out that the efforts to combat ISIL will extend into the next administration. So why, after 3 years of civil war in Syria, are we including this authority in a continuing resolution that will be in effect for less than 3 months, providing a fleeting authority for what we all anticipate will be a protracted effort? Further, this approach fails to take into consideration the long-term financial costs of conducting this mission, which has been estimated to cost up to $500 million a year.  I also believe that there is an inherent flaw in this strategy, training andequipping nonstate actors as the main effort in combating a threat to the region and our national security.                              {time}  1445  The United States invested lives and innumerable injuries, as well as a great deal of national treasure, to train and equip the Iraqi Army, only to see the result of that professional force collapse in the midst of serious conflict. Why then do we expect the next force we train to behave differently? We must also ask ourselves if we can truly vet these rebel groups beyond their known affiliations and ensure that we are not arming the next extremist threat to the region.  I would note that, recently, some of our allies and partners in the region have made commitments of equipment, training areas, and financial resources. I believe far more will ultimately be required of them, including leadership and troops of their own, to truly degrade and defeat ISIL.  The task of fighting ISIL is complicated. I am gravely concerned with the complexities we face while ensuring the safety of our forces. It is for these reasons that I am opposed to the amendment that will be offered by Chairman McKeon.
