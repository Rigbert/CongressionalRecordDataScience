President, I, first, thank my colleague from the State of Indiana. This is a great day. We have this great alliance of two adjoining States--Illinois and Indiana--for the good of people all across the United States. I thank the Senator for his very kind words.  Before I address the merits of the bill, the substance, there are two modifications which have been proposed. I would like to offer one from Senator Dorgan, and I ask the Senator from Indiana if he would do the same for Senator Gramm of Texas, who has offered a modification.                   Modification to Amendment No. 2821  Mr. President, I send this modification to the desk of the amendment which has been offered. I ask unanimous consent it be reported.
