 This is not 1 year off or 2 years off. The NID has budget execution authority, not just putting the budget together for presentation and recommendation to the President; he executes the budget as the year goes by. He has strong authority to reprogram funds with congressional approval and notification, I hasten to say, and to transfer funds.  He has extensive authority to transfer personnel. He has the right under our bill to appoint the heads of these agencies with concurrence from the Secretary of Defense. That is a major change from current law.  If the Senator from Ohio is saying, as he is, that the NID should have direct line authority over the day-to-day operations of these combat support agencies, I disagree with the Senator from Ohio. I believe it does not make sense and, in fact, the NID could not handle running these agencies day to day. As Senator Levin indicated earlier, you would have to create an enormous supervisory staff within the office of the NID if you were going to transfer that authority from the Secretary of Defense. Clearly, the NID has the authority to direct the collection and analysis of information by the heads of these agencies, but I do not think he should be running them day to day.  Mr. DeWINE. If I could follow that up with a question, since the Senator raised it--and I think I know her answer, but I want to make sure I do understand her answer--talking about moving people around, according to the newspapers--this is what is published in the newspapers--there is a problem with a backlog apparently in listening to tapes of intercepts, at least that is what has been in the newspaper. Would the NID have the authority to move linguists from one agency to another to correct that problem? For example, if they had to, they could move them from the DIA to the CIA?
