President, today, I am introducing groundbreaking legislation to make a difference in the way in which dying patients and their families can access hospice care. Ninety percent of Americans do not realize that there is a hospice benefit provided under the Medicare program. Over time, the length of stay in a hospice is decreasing so that patients do not get the full benefit of services that could make them more comfortable at a crucial time in their lives.  The issues related to how we die are too important to permit the Medicare Hospice benefit to remain fixed in time. Now is the time to begin to test new ways to design the benefit so that the benefit can remain truly patient-centered at one of the most crucial times in patients' and their families' lives.  Just as we push our health care system for medical breakthroughs that will allow more of us to live healthier and longer, we need to drive our health care system to create accessible, positive care for those facing the end of life.  My legislation, the Hospice Improvement Act of 2000, would require the Secretary to establish a demonstration program to increase access and use of hospice care for patients at the end-of-life, and to increase the knowledge of hospice among the medical, mental health and patient communities. My legislation stresses the following:  Supportive and Comfort Care: To assist families and patients in getting the benefit of hospice care, the Demonstration program will allow for a new supportive and comfort care benefit. This benefit, elected at the option of the patient, will not require the terminally ill to elect hospice care instead of other medical treatment, but will permit a patient to have supportive and comfort care in place while the patient still seeks ``curative treatment.'' This will permit patients and families to learn about hospice without forcing them to make a choice between hospice and other care. Case management would be provided through a hospice provider reimbursed on a fee-for-service basis.  Severity Index Instead of a Six-Month Prognosis: To determine whether or not a patient is eligible for the supportive and comfort care option, a severity index will be used instead of the current hospice requirement of a 6 month prognosis. This will permit patients to have access to support services, as needed, instead of relying on an often inaccurate time-related prognosis.  Increase Rural Hospice Access: Permit nurse practitioners and physician assistants to admit patients to hospice if this is within their authority under state practice law. In communities without a qualified social worker, other professionals with skills, knowledge and ability may provide medical social services such as counseling on the effects of illness on the family.  Respite Care: Nursing facilities used for respite care would not be required to have skilled nurses on the premises 24 hours a day (because hospice will be caring for the patient) or respite could be provided in the patient's home.  Payment Issues: Permit reimbursement for consultations, preadmission informational visits, even if the patient does not elect hospice/supportive care and provide minimum payment for Medicare hospice services provided under the demonstration program based on the provision of services for a period of 14 days, regardless of length of stay.  In addition, the demonstration project could address other payment issues such as offsetting changes in services and oversight and the increased cost of providing services in rural areas and creating a per diem rate of payment for respite care that reflects the range of care needs.  In addition to the Demonstration program, the Secretary would be required to establish an education grant program for the purpose of providing information about the Medicare hospice benefit, and the benefits available under the demonstration program. Education grants could be used to provide individual or group education to patients and their families and to the medical and mental health community, and to test messages to improve publicknowledge about the Medicare hospice benefit.  Let me conclude by saying that in the time left for this Congress, we have a unique opportunity to truly begin to improve care for the dying. There are fewer who are more vulnerable than someone who is dying and having to cope with the physical breakdown of their body and the emotional turmoil that imminent death brings to a family. This legislation provides us an opportunity to begin to remove the barriers to care for those who facing death.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3026       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Hospice Improvement Program      Act of 2000''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Each year more than \1/3\ of the people who die suffer      from a chronic illness.       (2) Approximately \1/3\ of Americans are unsure about whom      to contact to get the best care during life's last stages.       (3) Americans want a team of professionals to care for the      patient at the end of life.       (4) Americans want emotional and spiritual support for the      patient and family.       (5) Ninety percent of Americans do not realize that hospice      care is a benefit provided under the medicare program under      title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et      seq.).       (6) Health Care Financing Administration data show that      beneficiaries were enrolled in hospice for an average of less      than 7 weeks in 1998, far less than the full 6-month benefit      under the medicare program.       (7) According to the most recent data available, although      the average hospice enrollment is longer, half of the      enrollees live only 30 days after admission and almost 20      percent die within 1 week of enrollment.       (8) Use of hospice among medicare beneficiaries has been      decreasing, from a high of 59 days in 1995 to less than 48      days in 1998.     SEC. 3.
