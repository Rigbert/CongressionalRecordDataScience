President, I commend the Senator from Missouri for the amendment she has offered. As does the Senator from Missouri, I come from a State that has some very cold winters and a lot of snow. I know how important this issue is.  Any of us who live, basically, in the frost belt know how an unusually severe winter, sometimes even an enormously severe winter, can push somebody over the brink into bankruptcy.  I think the distinguished Senator from Missouri--I assume we will vote on her amendment tomorrow--has raised an extremely good point. I hope all Senators, whether they come from the northern-tier States or from more temperate States, will look at her amendment and support it. I applaud her for proposing it.  I yield the floor.
