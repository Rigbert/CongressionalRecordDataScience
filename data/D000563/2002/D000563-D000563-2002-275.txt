At this time, parents sending their children to school are less concerned about the sources of the money going into the schools. They want to make certain that the children coming out of the school are well educated.  Here we have a President who really did some historic things. He made an announcement that there was going to be a Federal commitment to education. His political party had said in years gone by they wanted to eliminate the Federal commitment to education. He said: I am going to take a different course. We are going to make a Federal commitment to schools and education and funding. We applauded him, and the Senator from Massachusetts did. We voted with him and gave him a bipartisan, strong vote. We said we will stand with you because every level of government should make a commitment to this most basic issue in America: educating our children.  And now comes the first budget. The promise of the Federal commitment to education is disappearing before our eyes. So for the parents in Illinois, and in Massachusetts, and in Wisconsin, who are concerned about the quality of schools, they have to feel they have been misled by a President who said he wanted to make this commitment but then presents a budget that does not.  We have to make the difference here in Congress. We have to put in the resources, and I think this Democratic Senate has to lead the way.  I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his leadership.
