Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I rise in opposition to the amendment and claim the time in opposition.  Mr. Chairman, this can be called the two-or-more-kicks-at-the-cat amendment, because what the gentleman is proposing is that when the Federal court refuses to certify a class, then it goes back to State court and the State court looks at it again and may certify a class. While most States have got class action rules similar to rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, they are not always uniformly applied, and that is why there is all this forum shopping that is going around that has caused this bill to come before the House of Representatives today.                              {time}  1615  So I think that we really should not allow two kicks at the cat. They can have their day in court. If the Federal court determines that the Federal rules do not allow for the certification of a class, then we should not go back to square one and have the plaintiffs' lawyers shop around to a friendly State judge that may very well certify that the class that is not allowed in the Federal rules ends up getting certified and the trial ends up proceeding.  So I think that everybody should have one day in court, not more than one day in court. For that reason, I would urge that the amendment be rejected.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
