 We have a lot of people in this country who stand up and say: Get the government out of health care. Well, I think some of my Republican friends have kind of echoed that message. I do think that the Senator from Illinois is right. We may bring forth an amendment to allow our Republican friends to say: Let's abolish the Veterans' Administration. Because, as you know, that is a government-run program which most veterans in my State and I think around the country are very proud of. They think it is a good program. From what the statistics tell us, it is a very cost-effective way to provide quality health care to all of our veterans. Maybe we should bring forward an amendment to those who say get the government out of health care. If you want to abolish the Veterans' Administration, go for it. And what about TRICARE. Maybe you want to abolish TRICARE. Go for it. Maybe you want to abolish SCHIP which is providing high quality health insurance for millions of kids. Maybe we might work together and bring forth an amendment.  Let our Republican friends who say get the government out of health care, let them abolish the Veterans' Administration, Medicare, SCHIP, Medicaid, let them do that. We will see how many votes they might get.
