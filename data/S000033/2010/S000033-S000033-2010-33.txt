 President, I would like a minute and a half, and I will yield to Senator Whitehouse the remaining 30 seconds.  The reality today is that millions of senior citizens and disabled vets are hurting. They are spending a whole lot of money on prescription drugs, a whole lot of money on health care. Yet for the last 2 years they have not gotten any COLA because, in my view, of a poor methodology in terms of how we determine COLAs for senior citizens.  What this amendment does is provide a one-time $250 check to senior citizens and disabled vets. That is what it does. This amendment is supported by AARP, the largest senior group in America; the American Legion; Veterans of Foreign Wars; the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, and virtually every senior group and every veterans organization.  People are wondering how it could be that we could provide $1 million in tax breaks to the richest people in this country but we cannot come up with $250 for struggling seniors and disabled vets.  I hope my colleagues will support this important piece of legislation.  I yield to my colleague from Rhode Island.
