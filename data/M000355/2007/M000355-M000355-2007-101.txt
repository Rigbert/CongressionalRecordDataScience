 REID. I yield to my colleague.  Mr. McCONNELL. The fundamental problem, I would say to my friend, the majority leader, is: What incentive do Members on my side of the aisle who object to the process have to grant consent to set aside an amendment? What incentive do they have?  I would expect, just guessing, the senior Senator from New Hampshire may not be very enthusiastic about the underlying bill. By setting up a process like the majority leader has set up, in which a number of Members on my side believe the process is unfair, what is their incentive to give consent for themajority leader to set aside an amendment and then allow an amendment of his choosing to be dealt with?
