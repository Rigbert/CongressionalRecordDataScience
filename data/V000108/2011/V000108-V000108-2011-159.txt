Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I congratulate Temple Beth-El in Munster, Indiana, as its congregation joins together in celebration of its 100th Anniversary. To celebrate this Centennial, members will hold a celebratory reception at Temple Beth-El on October 29, 2011.  Truly, Temple Beth-El has had a long and dynamic history in the Calumet Region's Jewish Community. When it was first established in 1911, Temple Beth-El served as a modest Reform Congregation, holding its services in a rented building in Hammond, Indiana. In fact, for a short time after World War One, Temple Beth-El briefly came to share its rental property with fellow Temple, Knesseth Israel. However, in 1925, the Temple was finally able to purchase its own location, the W. B. Conkey Mansion in Hammond, Indiana, where they remained until 1955. The congregation later moved to 6947 Hohmann Avenue, also located in Hammond, where it remained for 41 years. Due to the changing needs of its congregation, the Temple eventually sold its Hammond property to move to Munster, Indiana on August 15, 1999. Conducting a ``Torah Walk,'' they marched their Torahs from their old property in Hammond to their new building at 10001 Columbia Avenue, in Munster, where they are soon to celebrate their rich, hundred-year history. Currently, the members of Temple Beth-El can be proud of a Reform congregation of over 200 households, an ample facility featuring a sanctuary, classrooms, a kitchen, and library, as well as an admirable dedication to community service programs, in which members passionately serve those in need throughout the community. Additionally, Temple Beth-El recently helped to sponsor the inspirational exhibit, ``A Fine Romance: Jewish Songwriters, American Songs, 1910-1965,'' which was on display at the Munster Center for Visual and Performing Arts until October 20, 2011, and will be visiting 55 sites throughout the United States in 2011 and 2012.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring and congratulating Temple Beth-El of Munster, Indiana, on its 100th Anniversary. Through the years, the members of Temple Beth-El have dedicated themselves to preserving the traditions and spiritual beliefs of Reform Judaism. For their dedicated service, and for touching the lives of countless individuals, they are worthy of our highest praise.                          ____________________
