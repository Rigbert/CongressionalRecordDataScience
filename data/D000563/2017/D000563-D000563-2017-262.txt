. 1628, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record. The motion is supported by Senator Duckworth.  The process Republicans have undertaken to repeal our healthcare law has been secretive, wrong, and undemocratic.  At first, it was 13 chosen apostles--all men--meeting in secret to craft their repeal measure.  At this moment, I don't know who is hiding in the shadows writing their repeal measure.  But what I do know is that there have been no hearings, no opportunity for public input, and no opportunity for myself and Senator Duckworth--as representatives of Illinois--to offer input.  If myself and Senator Duckworth have been locked out of the process from the beginning, why then should our constituents have to pay the price for this partisan Republican effort?  So our motion is simple. It says that this Republican repeal bill cannot unfairly impose hardships on our Illinois constituents. It cannot increase costs on my constituents, cut services or benefits or eligibility for my constituents, eliminate essential health benefits for my constituents, or impose lifetime limits or discriminate against my constituents with preexisting conditions.  If Senator Cruz who has been allowed to have input on this repeal bill--wants to rip away health insurance ``root and branch''from his constituents, that is fine.  But this motion protects my constituents in Illinois.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                   Motion to Commit With Instructions       Mr. Durbin moves to commit the bill H.R. 1628 to the      Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pension with      instructions to report the same back to the Senate in 3 days,      not counting any day on which the Senate is not in session,      with changes that--       (1) are within the jurisdiction of such Committee;       (2) prohibit increases in health insurance premiums or out-     of-pocket health care costs for residents of Illinois;       (3) prohibit reductions in eligibility or services, or any      increases in cost-sharing (including premiums and co-     payments) related to the eligibility of residents of Illinois      to participate in the Medicaid program;       (4) prohibit health insurance issuers from imposing annual      or lifetime limits on residents of Illinois;       (5) prohibit health insurance issuers from charging      residents of Illinois who have pre-existing conditions more      than the amount charged to healthy residents; or       (6) prohibit health insurance issuers from stopping      coverage of any essential health     benefits provided under section 1302 of the Patient      Protection and Affordable Care Act (42 U.S.C. 18022).
