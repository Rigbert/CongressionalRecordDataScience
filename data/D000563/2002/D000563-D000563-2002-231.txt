Athens, who is survived by his wife, Irene, and their three children. Mr. Athens had a lifetime of outstanding achievement and service to God, this great nation, his home state of Illinois, and his fellow countrymen.  A native of Chicago, Mr. Athens attended Northwestern University and then served in the United States Army during the Second World War. Outside of his military service, Mr. Athens strove constantly to be engaged in philanthropic activity. Whether it was the Greek Orthodox Church, the United Hellenic American Congress, UHAC, or the National Steel Distributors, Mr. Athens used his time and magnetic personality to build and support these organizations.  As a member of the Board of Directors and finance chairman of UHAC since 1975, Mr. Athens' dynamism helped the group to stay true to the ideals and traditions of Hellenism, while reaching sound levels of financial stability. He also served as the National Treasurer of the Association of Steel Distributors, receiving its Steel Man of the year Award in 1969. In addition, Mr. Athens has served as the National Chairman of the Lake Forest College Parent's Fund and is an Honorary Trustee of Deree-Pierce College.  Mr. Athens had a deep-seated passion for his Church. He was a founding member of the Archbishop Iakovos Leadership 100 Fund, an endowment fund for the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese in America and was instrumental in building its initial member base. He was also a founder of Saints Peter and Paul Greek Orthodox Church in Glenview, Illinois, and served on the parish council for many years. Mr. Athens has been the recipient of numerous awards, demonstrative of his passion for service to his Church and community. Among the many have been The Ellis Island Medal of Honor Award in 1999 and the Knighthood of Mikros Stravroforos of the Knights of the Orthodox Crossbearers of the All-Holy Sepulchre recognition from the Patriarchate of Jerusalem in 1982. He has also received the Medal of St. Andrews in 1980 and the Medal of St. Paul in 1979 from the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese and the office of ``Archon Deputatos'' from the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople in 1977.  Mr. Athens, along with his brother Andrew, co-founded Metron Steel Corporation, one of the largest independent steel service centers, in 1950. He served as the Executive Vice President until he retired in 1985.  The Greek-American community and the people of Illinois have lost someone who spent his life making a contribution to the values and organizations he loved. And many of us have lost a friend.                          ____________________
