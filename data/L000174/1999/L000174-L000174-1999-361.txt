The Senator from Massachusetts, of course, is one of those who was on the floor day after day, hour after hour, helping us craft this bill and getting it through. A former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, he has been a leader on juvenile justice issues for the better part of four decades. We greatly appreciate all that he contributes each day and all that he contributed again this year to the Senate juvenile justice bill that we were able to pass with such a strong bipartisan majority.  The Senator from Massachusetts, from his experience--longer experience than I have had in this body--is aware that when we have had these major pieces of criminal justice or juvenile justice legislation or any major justice legislation, we have gone to conference and we have worked out the differences. He also knows, as I do, if we refuse to do that, it, in effect, kills legislation--legislation that passed here in a bipartisan fashion. I share the concerns that the Senator from Massachusetts has.
