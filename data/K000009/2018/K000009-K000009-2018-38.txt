The only people who haven't been brought to justice are the scoundrels on Wall Street who created the mess.  I hope our colleagues will join me in opposing this bill. And let me thank Chairmen Frelinghuysen, Graves, and Calvert, as well as Ranking Members Lowey, McCollum, and Quigley for their efforts on this bill. I know how hard it is to bring an appropriations bill to the floor, and I am sorry I cannot support this one.
