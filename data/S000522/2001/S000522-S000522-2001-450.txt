Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to more than 70,000 Americans--and their family members--who are currently affected by spina bifida, a debilitating disease caused when a baby's spine fails to close properly during pregnancy. Additionally, Mr. Speaker, I rise to highlight the good works of the Spina Bifida Association of America, an organization that has helped people with spina bifida and their families for nearly 30 years.  Mr. Speaker, as most Members know, spina bifida, is the most frequently occurring permanently disabling birth defect afflicting 1 out of every 1,000 babies born in this country each year. There are three different forms of spina bifida with the most severe being Myelomeningocele spina bifida, which causes nerve damage and severe disabilities. This severe form of spina bifida is diagnosed in 96 percent of children born with this disease. Between 70 to 90 percent of the children born with spina bifida are at risk of mental retardation when fluid collects around the brain.  With proper medical care, people who suffer from spina bifida can lead full and productive lives. But they must learn how to move around using braces, crutches or wheelchairs, how to learn and how to function independently. They must also be careful to avoid a host of secondary health problems ranging from depression and learning disabilities to skin problems and latex allergies.  Because spina bifida can be detected before birth by using prenatal tests, more than 50 percent of babies diagnosed with spina bifida are aborted--their lives cruelly snuffed out because of their anomalies. Tragically, expectant parents are wrongly pressured to abort their child if spina bifida is detected during pregnancy. It is imperative to get the word out and let expectant parents know that spina bifida is not a death sentence. Those parents who have rejected such pressure have had their lives enriched through the love they share with their child.  The Spina Bifida Association of America works tirelessly to help families meet the challenges and enjoy the rewards of raising their child. As part of its service through 60 chapters in more than 100 communities across the country, the SBAA puts expecting parents in touch with families who have a child with spina bifida. These families answer questions and concerns and help guide expecting parents so that they make life-affirming, family enriching decisions. The SBAA then works to provide lifelong support and assistance for affected children and their families.  Today, about 90 percent of all babies diagnosed with this disease live into adulthood, about 80 percent have normal IQs and about 75 percent participate in sports and other recreational activities. We also know that spina bifida may be preventable if women consume folic acid supplements during their childbearing years and early stages of pregnancy. The daily amount of folic acid needed is typically found in most multivitamins.  It is heartening to see such promising statistics for people with spina bifida. The spina bifida community and our nation owe a tremendous debt to the SBAA for its work over the past three decades. Much more work still needs to be done, and I am confident this fine organization will lead the effort for decades to come.                          ____________________
