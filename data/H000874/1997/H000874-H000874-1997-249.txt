Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. Kildee], who does such an excellent job and I thank the subcommittee chair for his leadership as well.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 1385. This bill is a good step in coordinating our Federal, State, and local employment and training programs. It provides incentive grants to States that demonstrate continuing progress in coordination and integration of these programs. This bipartisan bill builds an integrated work force development system. However, I do not think the bill goes far enough, and I would presume that some of its enthusiastic supporters perhaps feel the same. It does not go far enough in my opinion in terms of requiring the Federal Government to coordinate other service programs with these employment and training programs.  Mr. Chairman, I rise because I have introduced a bill, and I want to talk to the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Goodling], the gentleman from California [Mr. McKeon], the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. Kildee], and others, the gentleman from Missouri [Mr. Clay], about it, called the Family Services Improvement Act, H.R. 1480. It takes this bill I think a necessary step further to encourage agencywide coordination at the Federal level.  I would like to voice my strong support for the full service centers that this bill seeks to implement.
