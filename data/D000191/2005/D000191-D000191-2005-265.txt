Speaker, I read from a story today in The Washington Post, page A8, ``Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican, South Carolina, who has spent weeks attempting to recruit Democratic support for a plan to restructure Social Security, said yesterday that Republicans `made a strategic mistake' by initially focusing on a proposal to create individual investment accounts,'' and, as he says, ``We've now got this huge fight over a sideshow. It's always been a sideshow, but we sold it as the main event.''  What he is talking about is that, as the President himself has admitted, the privatization of Social Security is and has nothing to do with fixing potential future financing problems in Social Security. It is a battle, in fact, if it was won under the President's terms, that would divert income from Social Security and, in fact, accelerate its financial problems from 40 years in the future to a mere 10 or 20 years in the future.  Senator Graham, Republican from South Carolina, has come to the conclusion that, as many of us have been saying on this side of the aisle, we should fix Social Security first, then engage in a debate over how best to encourage or assist Americans in having more private resources through IRAs, 401(k)s or other sorts of devices for their retirement.  The basic vision of the founders of Social Security still holds: President Roosevelt said that he wanted to have a program that was not a dole; that had its own source of funding that would be guaranteed, and it would beearned. Earned. And that is what Social Security is, an earned guaranteed benefit that not only covers people in retirement as long as they might live, unlike many other plans and programs out there, like the privatized accounts, but it also provides for survivor benefits in case of untimely death to a spouse and/or surviving children. It also provides for a disability benefit.  The proponents of privatization, in addition to not fixing potential financing problems for Social Security, have not dealt with the issues of survivor benefits or disability benefits. They cannot. There is no way to do it under privatized accounts.  You opt into a private, so-called opt, because people would be coerced into these because otherwise they would see dramatically reduced benefits and they would try to bet money to win back under this plan, but they would, say, at age 18, you opt in and you do really well for 6 years. You are working as hard as you can. You put away the maximum amount per year. Then you become totally disabled at age 24, and you have $12,000, if you did really, really, really well in your investments in your privatized account. There it is, $12,000, you are totally disabled, have a good life.  That is not going to work. So they have not dealt with that issue. They say, oh, those people would still get their regular benefits. Well, if they are still going to get their regular benefits, but you are diverting all this money from the program, then the problems of Social Security become yet worse again.  So Senator Graham has finally hit on something, and hopefully other Republicans will come to the same realization. We have not just been saying, no, we do not want to improve the lot of people in their retirement years; and, no, we do not want to help facilitate people to save more toward their retirement. Because FDR envisioned the one guaranteed leg, the earned benefit of Social Security in addition to private pensions in a different savings. Private pensions are going away, so we need to help people save more, invest more and have more to supplement a guaranteed earned benefit of Social Security that is secure.  That is what this debate has been about. Finally, there is some realization on that side of the aisle that private accounts, in addition to taking the future financing of Social Security and putting it more in jeopardy, are a sideshow, as Senator Graham, Republican from South Carolina, has said, to the real issue of, are we going to take steps to guarantee that Social Security will be there not only for this generation and the near generation of retirees, as the President would do, but for all future generations.  We can do that easily. There are a number of ways to get there, one which I have proposed in past Congresses is to lift the cap on earnings. We say, look, if someone earns $25 million a year, they should pay the same percent of their income into Social Security as someone who earns $40,000 a year. If a person earns $40,000 a year, who works for wages and salary, pays 6.2 percent into Social Security; the person who earns $25,000 a year pays about a thousandth of one percent of their income into Social Security; they finish paying social security taxes on the second or third day of the year at that wage rate. That is not fair. It is not right. If they paid on all of their earnings, and their employer, some big multinational corporation paid on all their earnings, Social Security would be secure forever. In fact, we could lower the tax rate on everybody who earns less than $94,000 a year.                          ____________________[Pages H1206-H1207]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                            SOCIAL SECURITY
