Mr. Speaker, I too want to thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Gilman) for his work on this important legislation and all of these human rights initiatives. He has been steadfast and I for one--and I know I speak for many--appreciate it deeply. I thank my friend for his kind words, and also thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos), the principal cosponsor of this legislation, along with 30 other bipartisan Members who have cosponsored H.R. 4309.  Mr. Speaker, this is a bipartisan bill. This legislation provides $31 million over 2 years to help heal and to mitigate at least some of the agony and some of the suffering that is truly unfathomable, for those who have endured grotesque torture around the world.  We have heard testimony time and time again that torture persists in many, many despotic countries. We have also heard from those who have suffered and their advocates on what steps the United States and other free countries ought to take to try to lessen some of that suffering.  Those who suffer cruelty at the hands of these governments usually bear the scars, physically, emotionally, and psychologically, for the rest of their lives. For most, if not all, the ordeal of torture does not end when they are released from a gulag, a laogai or a prison camp.  These victims, Mr. Speaker--and there are millions of them around the world and an estimated 400,000 survivors of torture living in the United States--need our help. To date, we have done far too little to assist these walking wounded.  The Torture Victims Relief Act contains a number of important provisions designed to assist torture victims. First, Mr. Speaker, it authorizes grants for rehabilitation services for victims of torture and related purposes in both domestic and foreign treatment centers.  Specifically, the bill authorizes $12.5 million, $5 million in fiscal year 1999, and $7.5 million in fiscal year 2000, from the Department of Health and Human Services for contributions to centers of treatment for victims of torture in the United States. There are currently 15 of those centers.  I want especially to thank the gentleman from Virginia (Chairman Bliley) for working with us on this, because that money comes from a different spigot, not a foreign aid spigot, and he came forward and was very helpful. Also, I thank Senator Rod Grams on the Senate side for helping us get that money from that particular source.  The legislation also authorizes an additional $5 million in 1999, $7.5 million in fiscal year 2000 for international torture victim centers. There are currently about 175 of those centers around the world.  All of these centers, Mr. Speaker, both domestic and international, are seriously underfunded. As a matter of fact, the Denmark-based International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims, the IRCT, estimates the worldwide need for assisting victims of torture to be about $28 million and only a small portion of that has been met.  H.R. 4309 also authorizes a voluntary contribution from the United States to the U.N. Voluntary Fund to the Victims of Torture in the amount of $3 million in 1999 and another $3 million in 2000. I am proud to say that our bipartisan efforts have already had an effect, because we have been pushing this bill for a number of years now. In 1995, the U.S. contribution was $1.5 million, when we originally introduced this bill in the 104th Congress. The administration had proposed to cut the fiscal year 1996 contribution by two-thirds to $500,000. Eventually, in response to the bipartisan support for this initiative,they put it up to $1.5 million. Now we will increase that to $3 million each fiscal year.  Mr. Speaker, the bill also provides specialized training for foreign service officers in the identification of evidence of torture, techniques for interviewing torture victims, and related subjects.                              {time}  1600  Finally, the bill contains an expression of the Sense of Congress that the United States shall use its voice and its vote in the United Nations to support the investigation and elimination of practices prohibited by the Convention Against Torture.  Mr. Speaker, I truly believe that whatever one's religion is--and I am a Christian, I am a Catholic, and others' sentiments come out of their deeply-held faiths--but one of the scriptures that motivates me is Matthew's gospel, the 25th chapter, when our Lord said, whatsoever you do to the least of my brethren, you do likewise to me. Whether it be the unborn or a persecuted believer, Baha'i, a Jewish person, whatever, at any given time he or she can be the least of our brethren. We need to stand up for those people.  In keeping with that scripture, I really believe, Mr. Speaker, that this legislation helps those people after they have been abused to get through that crisis and come to healing and to reconciliation with the trouble and ordeal they have experienced.  Mr. Speaker, I want to make one final point. Grover Joseph Rees, the chief counsel and staff director of the Subcommittee on International Operations and of Human Rights, is the reason this legislation is on the floor, and I do want to thank him for his steadfast work on it. He used to be the general counsel at INS. He knows the inside of that building, and that is why we hired him on the committee, but, more importantly, he knows what is going on around the world and has been absolutely invaluable in these kinds of issues, whether it be religious freedom or in the case of this assistance to the torture victims. So I want to thank Joseph for his excellent work on this legislation.
