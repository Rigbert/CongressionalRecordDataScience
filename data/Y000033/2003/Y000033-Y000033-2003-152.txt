Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the Emergency Directed Rail Service Act. We have now reached a point almost exactly one year after Amtrak's last shutdown threat. Only an emergency ``loan'' under the otherwise crippled Railroad Rehabilitation Finance (RRIF) program and an emergency appropriation prevented Amtrak from shutting down, stranding thousands of commuters on and off the Northeast Corridor, and ending freight service on the Corridor. (The ``loan''--supposedly for 90 days--has not been repaid to this day.)  Based on last year's threat, I introduced an earlier version of this bill, to provide a ``safety net'' of emergency directed service powers under the auspices of the Surface Transportation Board if Amtrak did shut down. Such a threat is still present. Amtrak has pending funding requests far in excess of the President's budget request and has made no significant structural or financial changes in the last year. Thus the nation's commuter railroads and freight service on the Northeast Corridor are still hostages to a new shutdown threat.  This legislation is intended to prepare the nation for the possibility that Amtrak will either repeat its prior threat, or that Amtrak's precarious financial situation will cause an involuntary cessation of service. This bill is part of my effort to make sure the country is as prepared as possible should any such shutdown occur.  I am particularly concerned about the effect on freight movements in the Northeast and on commuter operations around the country and consequently on our national economy. An Amtrak shutdown could adversely affect the economy in the Northeast United States, because considerable freight would not be able to get to its destination--especially plants where the Northeast Corridor is the only rail access. Moreover, commuters in the Northeast and around the country may not be able to get to work, either because the commuter authority operates on Amtrak infrastructure or because the commuter authority uses Amtrak employees to operate or maintain its trains.  Last year, before introducing the predecessor of this bill, I wrote to Linda Morgan, the then Chairman of the Surface Transportation Board, and asked whether the Board had the power to direct freight and commuter service that would be adversely affected by an Amtrak shutdown. Ms. Morgan responded that the STB was unclear whether it would have the power to direct freight and commuter service in the event of an Amtrak shutdown and that its emergency powers have ``never been tested before in this context . . . and . . . could be challenged in court.''  This country needs someone to have the power to address the fallout on freight railroads and commuters if Amtrak shuts down. The legislation I introduce today does just that. It makes it clear that the STB has the authority it needs to act in the event Amtrak ceases service.  In particular, the bill would give the STB the authority to order the continued maintenance, signaling, and dispatching of the Northeast Corridor. It would give the STB the authority to use federal funds to compensate the entity that conducts these services and to indemnify it with respect to any increased liability exposure. It would also authorize the STB to direct service and to provide interim financial assistance to commuter operations around the country affected by an Amtrak shutdown.  Further, current law requires that to the extent possible the Amtrak employees who already perform the work should do the work required by the directed service. The bill I introduce today would not change that requirement.  The nation may have narrowly avoided a rail transportation crisis last year, but there is no guarantee that we will not see a recurrence. Given the precarious financial situation of Amtrak, it would be irresponsible not to put a ``safety net'' of appropriate emergency powers in place. If Amtrak manages to recover, this legislation will prove to be very inexpensive insurance under which no claim had to be made. But if Amtrak shuts down, having this insurance in place will prove to be the wisest of investments.                          ____________________
