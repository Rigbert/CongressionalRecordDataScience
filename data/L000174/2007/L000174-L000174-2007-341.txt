President, today I am pleased to join Senator Kennedy, the distinguished Chairman of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor Pensions, in introducing the Health Information Privacy and Security Act of 2007, HIPSA. This comprehensive health privacy bill will ensure the right to privacy with respectto health information for millions of Americans.  In America today, if you have a health record, you have a health privacy problem. The explosion of electronic health records, digital databases and the Internet is fueling a growing supply and demand for Americans' health information. The ability to easily access this information electronically, often by the click of a mouse, or a few key strokes on a computer, can be very useful in providing more cost-effective health care. But, the use of advancing technologies to access and share health information can also lead to a loss of personal privacy.  In the Information Age, the traditional right and expectation of confidentiality between patient and doctor is at great risk. Without adequate safeguards to protect health privacy, many Americans will simply not seek the medical treatment that they need, nor agree to participate in health research, because they fear that their sensitive health information will be disclosed without then consent or knowledge. And those who do seek medical treatment must assume the risk of the unauthorized disclosure of their health information due to a data security breach or other privacy violation. The loss of health privacy is a growing threat to our national health care system that the Congress must address.  Senator Kennedy and I both firmly believe that a fear of a loss of privacy cannot be allowed to deter Americans from seeking medical treatment. We are introducing this legislation today to close the privacy gap with respect to Americans' electronic health information.  A guiding principle in drafting our health privacy bill has been that the American people will only support efforts to move toward health information technology if they are assured that their sensitive health information will be protected from unauthorized disclosure and from the growing dangers of identity crimes posed by data security breaches. The bill that we are introducing today takes several important steps to honor this principle and to protect the health privacy of all Americans.  First, our bill guarantees the right of every American to privacy and security with respect to the use and disclosure of their health information. Under this legislation, every individual has the right to inspect and copy his or her own health records and to receive notice of the privacy rights and practices of data brokers and others who store this information in electronic databases. Our bill also ensures the security of electronic health information by requiring that data brokers establish safeguards to secure health information from data security breaches and other unauthorized disclosures.  Second, our bill places meaningful restrictions on the disclosure of sensitive health information. The bill expressly prohibits the disclosure or use of health information without a patient's authorization and requires that any health information intended to be used for medical research first be stripped of personally identifying information to protect an individual's privacy. There are exceptions to these restrictions for law enforcement, public safety and national security purposes.  Our bill also requires that patients be notified of a data security breach involving their health information within 15 days of discovery of the breach. The bill provides for important exceptions to this notice requirement for law enforcement and national security reasons.  Thirdly, our bill addresses the growing fear of many Americans that they will not be able to obtain important health information about a parent or child in situations involving a medical emergency, because of confusion about the requirements of current health privacy laws. The New York Times recently reported that many health care providers are overzealously applying health privacy laws, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, HIPAA, thwarting the legitimate efforts of family members, caretakers and even law enforcement to obtain critical health information about patients in their care. Our bill expressly allows health care providers to disclose health information to law enforcement for legitimate purposes and to a patient's next of kin, provided that the patient has been notified of their right to object to such disclosure. The bill also establishes a national office of health information privacy within the Department of Health and Human Services to aid American consumers in learning about their health privacy rights.  Lastly, our bill contains meaningful civil and criminal enforcement provisions to discourage and punish the wrongful disclosure of Americans' sensitive health information. The bill makes it a Federal crime to knowingly and intentionally disclose or use sensitive health information without an individual's consent. Violators of this provision are subject to a criminal penalty of up to $500,000 and up to 10 years in prison, if the violation is committed with the intent to sell or use sensitive health information for economic gain. In addition, the bill authorizes the Attorney General to file a civil action in Federal district court to obtain civil penalties from entities that fail to adequately safeguard electronic health records, or to provide consumers with information about their health privacy rights.  Senator Kennedy and I have worked on this legislation for more than a decade and we both understand the need to carefully balance the right to health privacy with the legitimate needs of health care providers, medical researchers and public health and law enforcement officials. Our bill strikes the right balance between protecting privacy and ensuring public safety.  We have also conferred extensively with the many stakeholders in the health care community in crafting this legislation and our bill is supported by a wide range of public policy, consumer and health care organizations from across the political spectrum.  Senator Kennedy and I believe that the right to health privacy is of vital interest to all Americans. For this reason, and on behalf of the millions of Americans who are currently at risk of either foregoing medical treatment or losing their right to health privacy, I urge all Senators to join us in supporting this important privacy legislation.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a copy of the July 3, 2007, the New York Times article entitled ``Keeping Patients' Details Private, Even From Kin,'' be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1814       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

(B) Rule of construction.--Subparagraph (A) shall not be      construed to preclude the provision of health care to an      individual who has not given appropriate authorization prior      to receipt of such care if--       (i) the health care provider involved determines that such      care is essential; and       (ii) the individual can reasonably be expected to sign an      authorization for such care when appropriate.       (b) Requirements for Individual Informed Consent.--To      satisfy the requirements of this subsection, an authorization      from an individual to disclose the individual's protected      health information shall--       (1) identify, by general job description or other      functional description and by geographic location, those      persons that are authorized to disclose the information,      including entities employed by, or operating within, a person      authorized to disclose the information;       (2) describe the nature of the information to be disclosed;       (3) identify, by general job description or other      functional description and by geographic location, those      persons to which the information will be disclosed, including      entities employed by, or operating within, a person to which      information is authorized to be disclosed;       (4) describe the purpose of the disclosures;       (5) permit the executing individual to indicate that a      particular person or class of persons (a group of persons      with similar roles or functions) listed on the authorization      is not authorized to receive protected health information      concerning the individual, except as provided for in      subsection (c)(3);       (6) provide the means by which an individual may indicate      that some of the individual's protected health information      should be segregated and to what persons or classes of      persons such segregated information may be disclosed;       (7) be subject to revocation by the individual and indicate      that the authorization is valid until revocation by the      individual or until an event or date specified;       (8)(A) be--       (i) in writing, dated, and signed by the individual; or       (ii) in electronic form, dated and authenticated by the      individual using an authentication method approved by the      Secretary; and       (B) not have been revoked under subparagraph (A);       (9) describe the procedure by which an individual can amend      an authorization previously obtained by a person;       (10) include a concise description of any systems or      services used for access, maintenance, retention,      modification, recording, storage, destruction, or other use      of protected health information by the authorized person,      including--       (A) a description of any linkages made with other systems,      databases, networks, or services external to the authorized      person; and       (B) how the linkages made with other systems, databases,      networks, or services external to the authorized person meet      the privacy and security standards of the authorized person;       (11) describe the extent to which the authorized person      will share information with sub-contracted persons, and the      geographic location of sub-contracted persons, including      those operating or located overseas, except that the      authorized person shall obtain the informed consent of the      individual involved prior to outsourcing such individual's      protected health information to a sub-contracted person      operating or located overseas; and       (12) describe the nature and probability of harm to the      individual resulting from authorization for use or      disclosure, consistent with the principle of informed      consent.       (c) Limitation on Authorizations.--       (1) In general.--Subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), a      person described in section 102(a)(1) that seeks an      authorization under this title may not condition the delivery      of treatment or payment for services on the receipt of such      an authorization.       (2) Right to require self-payment.--If an individual has      refused to provide an authorization for disclosure of      administrative billing information to a person and such      authorization is necessary for a health care provider to      receive payment for services delivered, the health care      provider may require the individual to pay from their own      funds for the services.       (3) Right of health care provider to require authorization      for treatment purposes.--If a health care provider that is      seeking an authorization for disclosure of an individual's      protected health information believes that the disclosure of      such information is necessary so as not to endanger the      health or treatment of the individual, and if the withholding      of services will not endanger the life of the individual, the      health care provider may condition the provision of services      upon the individual's execution of an authorization to      disclose personal health information to the minimum extent      necessary.       (4) Authorizations for payment under certain      circumstances.--If an individual is in a physical or mental      condition such that the individual is not capable of      authorizing     the disclosure of protected health information and no other      arrangements have been made to pay for the health care      services being rendered to the patient, such information may      be disclosed to a governmental authority to the extent      necessary to determine the individual's eligibility for, and      to obtain, payment under a governmental program for health      care services provided to the patient. The information may      also be disclosed to another provider of health care or      health care service plan as necessary to assist the other      provider or health care service plan in obtaining payment for      health care services rendered by that provider of health care      or health care service plan to the patient.       (d) Model Authorizations.--The Secretary, in consultation      with the Director of the Office of Health Information      Privacy, after notice and opportunity for public comment,      shall develop and disseminate model written authorizations of      the type described in this section and model statements of      the limitations on authorizations. Any authorization obtained      on a model authorization form under section 202 developed by      the Secretary pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be      deemed to satisfy the requirements of this section.       (e) Segregation of Files.--A person described in section      102(a)(1) shall comply with the request of an individual who      is the subject of protected health information--       (1) to hide, mask, or mark separate any type or amount of      protected health information held by the person; and       (2) to limit the use or disclosure of the segregated health      information within the person to those specifically      designated by the subject of the protected health      information.       (f) Revocation of Authorization.--       (1) In general.--An individual may, electronically or in      writing, revoke or amend an authorization under this section      at any time, unless the disclosure that is the subject of the      authorization is required to effectuate payment for health      care that has been provided to the individual and for which      the individual has declined or refused to pay from the      individual's own funds.       (2) Health plans.--With respect to a health plan, the      authorization of an individual is deemed to be revoked at the      time of the cancellation or non-renewal of enrollment in the      health plan, except as may be necessary to complete plan      administration and payment requirements related to the      individual's period of enrollment.       (3) Actions.--An individual may not maintain an action      against a person for disclosure of personally identifiable      health information--       (A) if the disclosure was made based on a good faith      reliance on the individual's authorization under this section      at the time such disclosure was made;       (B) in a case in which the authorization is revoked, if the      disclosing person had no actual or constructive notice of the      revocation; or       (C) if the disclosure was for the purpose of protecting      another individual from imminent physical harm, and is      authorized under section 204.       (g) Record of Individual's Authorizations and      Revocations.--Each person accessing, maintaining, retaining,      modifying, recording, storing, destroying, or otherwise using      personally identifiable or protected health information shall      maintain a record for a period of 7 years of each      authorization by an individual and any revocation thereof,      and such record shall become part of the individual's health      record set.       (h) Rule of Construction.--Authorizations for the      disclosure of protected health information for treatment or      payment shall not authorize the disclosure of such      information where the intent is to sell, market, transfer, or      use the protected health information for a commercial      advantage other than for the revenues directly derived from      the provision of health care to that individual. With respect      to such a disclosure for a use other than for treatment or      payment, a separate authorization that satisfies the      requirements of section 203 is required.     SEC. 203. AUTHORIZATIONS FOR DISCLOSURE OF PROTECTED HEALTH                    INFORMATION OTHER THAN FOR TREATMENT OR                    PAYMENT.       (a) In General.--To satisfy the requirement under section      201(b)(1), a health care provider, health plan, health      oversight agency, public health authority, employer, health      researcher, law enforcement official, health or life insurer,      school or university, or other person described under section      102(a)(1) that seeks to disclose protected health information      for a purpose other than treatment or payment shall obtain an      authorization that satisfies the requirements of subsections      (b), (e), (f), and (g) of section 202. Such an authorization      under this section shall be separate from an authorization      provided under section 202.       (b) Limitation on Authorizations.--       (1) In general.--A person subject to section 202 may not      condition the delivery of treatment, or payment for services,      on the receipt of an authorization described in this section.       (2) Requirement for separate authorization.--A person      subject to section 202 may not disclose protected health      information to any employees or agents who are responsible      for making employment, work assignment, or other personnel      decisions with respect to the subject of the information      without a separate authorization permitting such a      disclosure.       (c) Model Authorizations.--The Secretary, in consultation      with the Director of the Office of Health Information      Privacy, after notice and opportunity for public comment,      shall develop and disseminate model written authorizations of      the type described in subsection (a). Any authorization      obtained on a model authorization form under this section      shall be deemed to meet the authorization requirements of      this section.       (d) Requirement to Release Protected Health Information to      Coroners and Medical Examiners.--       (1) In general.--When a coroner or medical examiner or      their duly appointed deputies seek protected health      information for the purpose of inquiry into and determination      of, the cause, manner, and circumstances of an individual's      death, the health care provider, health plan, health      oversight agency, public health authority, employer, health      researcher, law enforcement officer, health or life insurer,      school or university, or other person involved shall provide      that individual's protected health information to the coroner      or medical examiner or to the duly appointed deputies without      undue delay.       (2) Production of additional information.--If a coroner or      medical examiner or their duly appointed deputies receives      health information from a person referred to in paragraph      (1), such health information shall remain as protected health      information unless the health information is attached to or      otherwise made a part of a coroner's or medical examiner's      official report, in which case it shall no longer be      protected.       (3) Exemption.--Health information attached to or otherwise      made a part of a coroner's or medical examiner's official      report shall be exempt from the provisions of this Act except      as provided for in this subsection.       (4) Reimbursement.--A person referred to paragraph (1) may      request reimbursement from a coroner or medical examiner for      the reasonable costs associated with inspection or copying of      protected health information maintained, retained, or stored      by such person.       (e) Revocation or Amendment of Authorization.--An      individual may, in writing, revoke or amend an authorization      under this section at any time.       (f) Actions.--An individual may not maintain an action      against a person described in section 102(a)(1) for the      disclosure of protected health information--       (1) if the disclosure was made based on a good faith      reliance on the individual's authorization under this section      at the time disclosure was made;       (2) in a case in which the authorization is revoked, if the      disclosing person had no actual or constructive notice of the      revocation; or       (3) if the disclosure was for the purpose of protecting      another individual from imminent physical harm, and is      authorized under section 204.       (g) Record of Authorizations and Revocations.--Each person      accessing, maintaining, retaining, modifying, recording,      storing, destroying, or otherwise using personally      identifiable or protected health information for purposes      other than treatment or payment shall maintain a record for a      period of 7 years of each authorization by an individual and      any revocation thereof, and such record shall become part of      the individual's health record set.     SEC. 204. NOTIFICATION IN THE CASE OF BREACH.       (a) In General.--A person described in section 102(a)(1)      that accesses, maintains, retains, modifies, records, stores,      destroys, or otherwise uses or discloses protected health      information shall, following the discovery of a security      breach of such information, notify each individual whose      protected health information has been, or is reasonably      believed to have been, accessed, or acquired during such      breach.       (b) Obligation of Owner or Licensee.--       (1) Notice to owner or licensee.--Any person engaged in      interstate commerce, that uses, accesses, transmits, stores,      disposes of, or collects protected health information that      the person does not own or license shall notify the owner or      licensee of the information following the discovery of a      security breach involving such information.       (2) Notice by owner, licensee, or other designated third      party.--Nothing in this subtitle shall be construed to      prevent or abrogate an agreement between a person required to      give notice under this section and a designated third party,      including an owner or licensee of the protected health      information subject to the security breach, to provide the      notifications required under subsection (a).       (3) Person relieved from giving notice.--A person obligated      to give notice under subsection (a) shall be relieved of such      obligation if an owner or licensee of the protected health      information subject to the security breach, or other      designated third party, provides such notification.       (c) Timeliness of Notification.--       (1) In general.--All notifications required under this      section shall be made within 15 business days, or earlier if      the Secretary determines appropriate, following the discovery      by the person of a security breach.       (2) Burden of proof.--The person required to provide      notification under this section shall have the burden of      demonstrating that all notifications were made as required      under this subtitle, including evidence demonstrating the      necessity of any delay.

(2) Extended delay of notification.--If the notification      required under subsection (a) is delayed pursuant to      paragraph (1), a person shall give notice not later than 30      days after such law enforcement delay was invoked unless a      Federal law enforcement agency provides written notification      that further delay is necessary.       (3) Law enforcement immunity.--No cause of action shall      arise in any court against any Federal law enforcement agency      for acts relating to the delay of notification for law      enforcement purposes under this subtitle.

(a) General Rule.--In the event of a threat of imminent      physical or mental harm to the subject of protected health      information, any person may, in order to allay or remedy such      threat, disclose protected health information about such      subject to a health care provider, health care facility, law      enforcement authority, or emergency medical personnel, to the      minimum extent necessary and only if determined appropriate      by a health care provider.       (b) Harm to Others.--Any person may disclose protected      health information about the subject of the information      where--       (1) such subject has made an identifiable threat of serious      injury or death with respect to an identifiable individual or      group of individuals;       (2) the subject has the ability to carry out such threat;      and       (3) the release of such information is necessary to prevent      or significantly reduce the possibility of such threat being      carried out.     SEC. 212. PUBLIC HEALTH.       (a) In General.--A health care provider, health plan,      public health authority, employer, health or life insurer,      law enforcement official, school or university, or other      person described in section 102(a)(1) may disclose protected      health information to a public health authority or other      entity authorized by public health law, when receipt of such      information by the authority or other entity--       (1) relates directly to a specified public health purpose;       (2) is reasonably likely to achieve such purpose; and       (3) is intended for a purpose that cannot be achieved      through the receipt or use of de-identified health      information.       (b) Public Health Protection Defined.--For purposes of      subsection (a), the term ``public health protection'' means a      population-based activity or individual effort, authorized by      law, the purpose of which is the prevention of injury,      disease, or premature mortality, or the promotion of health,      in a community, including--       (1) assessing the health needs and status of the community      through public health surveillance and epidemiological      research;       (2) implementing public health policy;       (3) responding to public health needs and emergencies; and       (4) any other activities or efforts authorized by law.       (c) Limitations.--The purpose of the disclosure described      in subsection (a) should be of sufficient importance to      warrant the potential effect on, or risk to, the privacy of      individuals that the additional exposure of protected health      information might bring. Any infringement on the right to      privacy under this section should use the least intrusive      means that are tailored to minimize intrusion on the right to      privacy.     SEC. 213. PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY AGENCIES.

(b) Use and Maintenance of Protected Health Information.--A      health oversight agency that receives protected health      information under this section--       (1) shall secure protected health information in all work      papers and all documents summarizing the health oversight      activity through technological, administrative, and physical      safeguards including cryptographic-key based encryption;       (2) shall maintain in its records only such information      about an individual as is relevant and necessary to      accomplish the purpose for which the protected health      information was obtained;       (3) using appropriate encryption measures. shall maintain      such information securely and limit access to such      information to those persons with a legitimate need for      access to carry out the purpose for which the records were      obtained; and       (4) shall remove or destroy the information that allows      subjects of protected health information to be identified at      the earliest time at which removal or destruction can be      accomplished, consistent with the purpose of the health      oversight activity.       (c) Use of Protected Health Information in Judicial      Proceedings.--       (1) In general.--The disclosure and use of protected health      information in any judicial, administrative, court, or other      public proceeding or investigation relating to a health      oversight activity shall be undertaken in such a manner as to      preserve the confidentiality and privacy of individuals who      are the subject of the information, unless disclosure is      required by the nature of the proceedings.       (2) Limiting disclosure.--Whenever disclosure of the      identity of the subject of protected health information is      required by the nature of the proceedings, or it is      impracticable to redact the identity of such individual, the      agency shall request that the presiding judicial or      administrative officer enter an order limiting the disclosure      of the identity of the subject to the extent possible,      including the redacting of the protected health information      from publicly disclosed or filed pleadings or records.       (d) Authorization by a Supervisor.--For purposes of this      section, the individual with authority to authorize the      oversight function involved shall provide to the disclosing      person described in subsection (a) a statement that the      protected health information is being sought for a legally      authorized oversight function.       (e) Use in Action Against Individuals.--Protected health      information about an individual that is disclosed under this      section may not be used in, or disclosed to any person for      use in, an administrative, civil, or criminal action or      investigation directed against the individual, unless the      action or investigation arises out of and is directly related      to--       (1) the receipt of health care or payment for health care;       (2) a fraudulent claim related to health; or       (3) oversight of a public health authority or a health      researcher.

(2) Notice not required.--An order for the disclosure of      protected health information about an individual may be      issued without prior notice to the individual if the court      finds that notice would be impractical because--       (A) the name and address of the individual are unknown; or       (B) notice would risk destruction or unavailability of the      evidence, intelligence, counter-intelligence, or other      national security information.       (e) Conditions.--Upon the granting of an order for      disclosure of protected health information under this      section, the court shall impose appropriate safeguards to      ensure the confidentiality of such information and to protect      against unauthorized or improper use or disclosure.

Another nurse      threatened Mr. Nussbaum with arrest for scanning his      relative's medical chart to prove to her that she was about      to administer a dangerous second round of sedatives.       The nurses who threatened him with eviction and arrest both      made the same claim, Mr. Nussbaum said: that access to his      father-in-law and his medical information were prohibited      under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability      Act, or Hipaa, as the federal law is known.       Mr. Nussbaum, a health care and Hipaa consultant, knew      better and stood his ground. Nothing in the law prevented his      involvement. But the confrontation drove home the way Hipaa      is misunderstood by medical professionals, as well as the      frustration--and even peril--that comes in its wake.       Government studies released in the last few months show the      frustration is widespread, an unintended consequence of the      1996 law.       Hipaa was designed to allow Americans to take their health      insurance coverage with them when they changed jobs, with      provisions to keep medical information confidential. But new      studies have found that some health care providers apply      Hipaa regulations overzealously, leaving family members,      caretakers, public health and law enforcement authorities      stymied in their efforts to get information.       Experts say many providers do not understand the law, have      not trained their staff members to apply it judiciously, or      are fearful of the threat of fines and jail terms--although      no penalty has been levied in four years.       Some reports blame the language of the law itself, which      says health care providers may share information with others      unless the patient objects, but does not require them to do      so. Thus, disclosures are voluntary and health care providers      are left with broad discretion.       The unnecessary secrecy is a ``significant problem,'' said      Mark Rothstein, chairman of a privacy subcommittee that      advises the Department of Health and Human Services, which      administers Hipaa. ``It's drummed into them that there are      rules they have to follow without any perspective,'' he said      about health care providers. ``So, surprise, surprise, they      approach it in a defensive, somewhat arbitrary and      unreasonable way.''       Susan McAndrew, deputy director of health information      privacy at the Department of Health and Human Services, said      that problems were less frequent than they once had been but      that health care providers continued to hide behind the law.      ``Either innocently or purposefully, entities often use this      as an excuse,'' she said. ``They say `Hipaa made me do it'      when, in fact, they chose for other reasons not to make      the permitted disclosures.''       Mr. Rothstein, one of Hipaa's harshest critics, has led      years of hearings across the country. Transcripts of those      hearings, and accounts from hospital administrators, patient      advocates, lawyers, family members, and law enforcement      officials offer an anthology of Hipaa misinterpretations,      some alarming, some annoying:       Birthday parties in nursing homes in New York and Arizona      have been canceled for fear that revealing a resident's date      of birth could be a violation.       Patients were assigned code names in doctor's waiting      rooms--say, ``Zebra'' for a child in Newton, Mass., or      ``Elvis'' for an adult in Kansas City, Mo.--so they could be      summoned without identification.       Nurses in an emergency room at St. Elizabeth Health Center      in Youngstown, Ohio, refused to telephone parents of ailing      students themselves, insisting a friend do it, for fear of      passing out confidential information, the hospital's patient      advocate said.       State health departments throughout the country have been      slowed in their efforts to create immunization registries for      children, according to Dr. James J. Gibson, the director of      disease control in South Carolina, because information from      doctors no longer flows freely.       Teaching staff to protect records is easier than teaching      them to share them, said Robert N. Swidler, general counsel      for Northeast Health, a nonprofit network in Troy, N.Y., that      includes several hospitals.       ``Over time, the staff has become a little more flexible      and humane,'' Mr. Swidler said. ``But nurses aren't lawyers.      This is a hyper-technical law and it tells them they may      disclose but doesn't say they have to.''       Many experts, including critics like Mr. Rothstein and      proponents like Ms. McAndrew, distinguish different      categories of secrecy.       There are ``good faith nondisclosures,'' as when a floor      nurse takes a phone call from someone claiming to be a family      member but cannot verify that person's identity. Then there      are ``bad faith nondisclosures,'' like using Hipaa as an      excuse for not taking the time to gather records that public      health officials need to help child abuse investigators      trying to build a case.       Most common are seat-of-the-pants decisions made by      employees who feel safer saying ``no'' than ``yes'' in the      face of ambiguity.       That seemed to be what happened to his own mother, Mr.      Rothstein said, when she called her doctor's office to      discuss a problem. She was told by the receptionist that the      doctor was not available, Mr. Rothstein said, and then      inquired if the doctor was with a patient or out of the      office. ``I can't tell you because of Hipaa,'' came the      reply. In fact the doctor was home sick, which would have      been helpful information in deciding whether to wait for a      call back or head for the emergency room.       The law, medical professionals and privacy experts said,      has had the positive effect of making confidentiality a      priority as the nation moves toward fully computerized,      cradle-to-grave medical records.       But safeguarding electronic privacy required a tangle of      regulations issued in 2003, followed last year by 101 pages      of ``administrative simplification.''       Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, a      sponsor of the original insurance portability law, was      dismayed by the ``bizarre hodgepodge'' of regulations layered      onto it, several staff members said, and by the department's      failure to provide ``adequate guidance on what is and is not      barred by the law.'' To that end, Mr. Kennedy, along with      Senator Patrick M. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, plans to      introduce legislation creating an office within the      Department of Health and Human Services dedicated to      interpreting and enforcing medical privacy.       ``In this electronic era it is essential to safeguard the      privacy of medical records while insuring our privacy laws do      not stifle the flow of information fundamental to effective      health care,'' Mr. Kennedy said.       This spring, the department revised its Web site,      www.hhs.gov/ocr/hipaa, in the interest of clarity. But Hipaa      continues to baffle even the experts.       Ms. McAndrew explained some of the do's and don'ts of      sharing information in a telephone interview:       Medical professionals can talk freely to family and      friends, unless the patient objects. No signed authorization      is necessary and the person receiving the information need      not have the legal standing of, say, a health care proxy or      power of attorney. As for public health authorities or those      investigating crimes like child abuse, Hipaa defers to state      laws, which often, though not always, require such      disclosure. Medical workers may not reveal confidential      information about a patient or case to reporters, but they      can discuss general health issues.       Ms. McAndrew said there was no way to know how often      information was withheld. Of the 27,778 privacy complaints      filed since 2003, the only cases investigated, she said, were      complaints filed by patients who were denied access to their      own information, the one unambiguous violation of the law.       Complaints not investigated include the plights of adult      children looking after their parents from afar. Experts say      family members frequently hear, ``I can't tell you that      because of Hipaa,'' when they call to check on the patient's      condition.       That is what happened to Nancy Banks, who drove from      Bartlesville, Okla., to her mother's bedside at Town and      Country Hospital in Tampa, Fla., last week because Ms. Banks      could not find out what she needed to know over the      telephone.       Her 82-year-old mother had had a stroke. When Ms. Banks      called her room she heard her mother ``screaming and yelling      and crying,'' but conversation was impossible. So Ms. Banks      tried the nursing station.       Whoever answered the phone was not helpful, so Ms. Banks      hit the road. Twenty-two hours later, she arrived at the      hospital.       But more of the same awaited her. She said her mother's      nurse told her that ``because of the Hipaa laws I can get in      trouble if I tell you anything.''       In the morning, she could speak to the doctor, she was      told.       The next day, Ms. Banks was finally informed that her      mother had had heart failure and that her kidneys were      shutting down.       ``I understand privacy laws, but this has gone too far,''      Ms. Banks said. ``I'm her daughter. This isn't right.''       A hospital spokeswoman, Elena Mesa, was asked if nurses      were following Hipaa protocol when they denied adult children      information about their parents.       She could not answer the question, Ms. Mesa said, because      Hipaa prevented her from such discussions with the press.
