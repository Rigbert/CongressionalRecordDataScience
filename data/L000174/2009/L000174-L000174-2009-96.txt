Throughout my chairmanship I made sure to treat President Bush's judicial nominees better than the Republicans had treated President Clinton's. During the 17 months I chaired the Judiciary Committee during President Bush's first term, we confirmed 100 of his judicial nominees. At the end of his Presidency, although Republicans had chaired the Judiciary Committee for more than half his tenure, more of his judicial nominees were confirmed when I was the chairman than in the more than 4 years when Republicans were in charge.  In spite of President Obama's efforts, however, Senate Republicans beganthis year threatening to filibuster every judicial nominee of the new President. They have followed through by dragging out, delaying, obstructing and stalling the process. The result is that 10 months into President's Obama's first term, the Senate has confirmed only three of his nominations for circuit and district courts while judicial vacancies skyrocket around the country. The delays in considering judicial nominations pose a serious problem in light of the alarming spike in judicial vacancies on our Federal courts.  There are now 96 vacancies on Federal circuit and district courts and another 24 future vacancies already announced. These vacancies are at near record levels. Justice should not be delayed or denied to any American because of overburdened courts. We can do better. The American people deserve better.  Professor Tobias' observations about the Second Circuit hold true throughout the country and with respect to this President's efforts to work cooperatively with respect to judicial nominations. President Obama made his first judicial nomination, that of Judge David Hamilton to the Seventh Circuit, in March, but it has been stalled on the Executive calendar since early June, despite the support of the senior Republican in the Senate, Senator Lugar. The nomination of Judge Andre Davis to the Fourth Circuit was reported by the committee on June 4 by a vote of 16 to 3, but has yet to be considered by the Senate. The nomination of Judge Beverly Baldwin Martin to the Eleventh Circuit has the support of both of Georgia's Senators, both Republicans, and was reported unanimously from the committee by voice vote on September 10 but has yet to be considered or scheduled for consideration by the Senate. The nomination of Joseph Greenaway to the Third Circuit has the support of both Pennsylvania Senators, and was reported unanimously from the committee by voice vote on October 1, but has yet to be considered or scheduled for consideration by the Senate. All of these nominees are well-respected judges. All will be confirmed, I believe, if only Republicans would consent to their consideration by the Senate. Instead, the President's good efforts are being snubbed and these nominees stalled for no good purpose.  President Obama has been criticized by some for being too solicitous of Senate Republicans. As Wade Henderson, the executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, said to The Washington Post recently: ``I commend the President's effort to change the tone in Washington. I recognize that he is extending an olive branch to Republicans on the Judiciary Committee and in the Senate overall. But so far, his efforts at reconciliation have been met with partisan hostility.'' As usual, Wade has it right. The efforts the President has made have not been reciprocated.  The Senate can and must do a better job of restoring our tradition of regularly considering qualified, noncontroversial nominees to fill vacancies on the Federal bench without needless and harmful delays. This is a tradition followed with Republican Presidents and Democratic Presidents. We should not have to overcome filibusters and spend months seeking time agreements to consider consensus nominees.  In addition, four nominations to be Assistant Attorneys General at the Department of Justice remain on the Executive calendar, three of them for many months. Republican Senators have also prevented us from moving to consider the nomination of respected Federal Judge William Sessions of Vermont to be Chairman of the United States Sentencing Commission for over 5 months, even though he was twice confirmed as a member of that Commission. The majority leader has been forced to file a cloture motion in order to end the obstruction of that nomination.  Four out of a total of 11 divisions at the Department of Justice remain without Senate-confirmed Presidential nominees because of Republican holds and delays--the Office of Legal Counsel, the Tax Division, the Office of Legal Policy, and the Environment and Natural Resources Division. Earlier this month, with the hard work of Senator Cardin, we were finally able to move forward to confirm Tom Perez to head the Civil Rights Division at the Justice Department. His nomination was stalled for 4 months, despite the fact that he was approved 17 to 2 by the Judiciary Committee. At the last minute, Senate Republicans abandoned an ill-fated effort to filibuster the nomination and asked that the cloture vote be vitiated. He was finally confirmed with more than 70 votes in the Senate.  During the 17 months I chaired the Judiciary Committee during President Bush's first term, we confirmed 100 of his judicial nominees and 185 of his executive nominees referred to the Judiciary Committee. And yet 10 months into President's Obama's first term, we have confirmed only 2 of his nominations for circuit and district courts and 40 of the executive nominees that have come through our committee.  I hope that, instead of withholding consents and filibustering President Obama's nominees, the other side of the aisle will join us in treating them fairly. We should not have to fight for months to schedule consideration of the President's judicial nominations and nomination for critical posts in the executive branch.  I look forward to congratulating Mr. Lange and his family on his confirmation today. I commend Senator Johnson for his steadfastness in making sure his State is well served.                               Exhibit 1  Commentary: Second Circuit Appeals Court Openings Need To Be Filled                            (By Carl Tobias)       The country's attention was recently focused on the Senate      confirmation vote for U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals      Judge Sonia Sotomayor, President Barack Obama's initial      Supreme Court nominee and judicial appointment. This emphasis      was proper because the tribunal is the highest court in the      nation and decides appeals involving fundamental      constitutional rights.       Nonetheless, the same day that Justice Sotomayor received      appointment, Second Circuit Judge Robert Sack assumed senior      status, a type of semi-retirement, thereby joining his      colleague, Guido Calabresi, who had previously taken senior      status. Moreover, on Oct. 10, Judge Barrington Parker also      assumed senior status. These developments mean that the      Second Circuit will have vacancies in four of its thirteen      authorized judgeships.       Operating without nearly 25 percent of the tribunal's      judicial complement will frustrate expeditious, inexpensive      and equitable disposition of appeals. Thus, President Obama      should promptly nominate, and the Senate must swiftly      confirm, outstanding judges to all four openings.       The numerous vacancies can erode the delivery of justice by      the Second Circuit, which is the court of last resort for all      but one percent of appeals taken from Connecticut, New York      and Vermont. The tribunal resolves more critical business      disputes than any of the 12 regional circuits and decides      very controversial issues relating to questions, such as free      speech, property rights and terrorism.       Among the appellate courts, the Second Circuit needs more      time to conclude appeals than all except one, which is a      useful yardstick of appellate justice. The August loss of two      active judges and the October loss of a third will exacerbate      the circumstances, especially by additionally slowing the      resolution of cases that are essential to the country's      economy.       There are several reasons why the tribunal lacks almost one      quarter of its members. Judge Chester Straub took senior      status in July 2008, and President George W. Bush nominated      Southern District of New York Judge Loretta Preska on Sept. 9      after minimally consulting New York's Democratic Senators      Charles Schumer and Hillary Clinton. September was too late      in a presidential election year for an appointment, and the      110th Senate adjourned without affording the nominee a      hearing.       Moreover, President Obama has nominated no one for the      Calabresi or Sack opening, although both jurists announced      that they intended to take senior status last March. In      fairness, Judge Calabresi did not actually assume senior      status until late July, while Judge Sack only took senior      status and Justice Sotomayor was confirmed in August.       President Obama has implemented several measures that      should foster prompt appointments. First, he practiced      bipartisanship to halt the detrimental cycle of accusations,      countercharges and non-stop paybacks. Moreover, the White      House has promoted consultation by seeking advice on      designees from Democratic and GOP Senate members, especially      home state senators, before official nominations. Obama has      also submitted consensus nominees, who have even temperaments      and are very smart, ethical, diligent and independent. The      Executive has worked closely with Senator Patrick Leahy (D-     Vt.), the Judiciary Committee chair, who schedules hearings      and votes, and Senator Harry Reid (D-Nev.), the Majority      Leader, who arranges floor debates and votes, and     their GOP counterparts to facilitate confirmations.       Emblematic is the President's nomination of U.S. District      Judge Gerard Lynch, who served with distinction on the U.S.      District Court for the Southern District of New York since      2000. New York Democratic Senators Schumer and Kirsten      Gillibrand expeditiously suggested the superb trial judge to      Obama, who nominated Lynch on April 2. By mid-May, the panel      conducted Lynch's confirmation hearing, and on June 11, the      committee approved Lynch. In mid-September, the Senate      confirmed Lynch on a 94-3 vote.       Senator Schumer's Sept. 9 announcement that he had      recommended District Judge Denny Chin to the White House and      the jurist's Oct. 6 nomination are precisely the correct      approaches. The New York and Connecticut senators must      continue suggesting excellent candidates for the three Second      Circuit openings which remain. Obama must swiftly consider      their proposals and nominate outstanding prospects. The      Judiciary Committee should promptly afford hearings and      votes, while the Majority Leader ought to expeditiously      schedule floor debates and votes.       Judge Sotomayor's Supreme Court elevation, the assumption      of senior status by Judges Calabresi, Parker and Sack and      Judge Lynch's recent Senate confirmation mean there are four      openings in the Second Circuit's thirteen judgeships.      President Obama should cooperate with the Senate to quickly      fill the vacancies with superior judges, so that the tribunal      can deliver appellate justice.
