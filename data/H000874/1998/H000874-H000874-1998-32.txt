Speaker, unfortunately, during the course of the consideration of the energy and water bill, I was not able to be on the floor because I was doing other business on another committee. Therefore, I did not get an opportunity to rise to pay tribute to my colleague and one of the closest friends I have, not just in this institution but in my life, and that is Vic Fazio our colleague.  He is about to, I think, have a colloquy about the schedule, acting in his leadership capacity. Very frankly, Mr. Speaker, Vic Fazio has been a leader of this House since I arrived here in 1981. He is an extraordinarily capable Member. He is a Member whose integrity and intellect will match anybody, notonly in this institution but in our country. He has chosen to leave this body and this body will be a lesser place for that decision.  I wanted to take, Mr. Speaker, this short, brief minute to stand and say to him, thank you. During the 5\1/2\ years that I served as chairman of the caucus, Vic was my vice chair, and I was proud to have him serving with me. During his time as chairman of the DCCC, I was one of his strongest supporters.  During the decade that he headed the Subcommittee on Legislative of the Committee on Appropriations and served this institution and its Members and the citizens of this Nation so well in ensuring the effective operation of the people's House, I was proud to be his strong supporter.  During the last four years he has chaired the Democratic caucus. One of the hallmarks of his leadership was a partisan commitment to the issues and principles for which our party stands. But I know that my colleagues on the majority side also found in Vic Fazio a gentleman who was interested in the interests of America and was willing and able and desirous of working with the other side in a collegial way to effect progress in this House on behalf of this country and its citizens.  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to rise to say to one of the closest friends I have that we are going to miss you. I am going to miss you. This institution is going to miss you.  The good news for all of us is that Vic Fazio will be around. He hopefully will stay in Washington. I know he will go back to his beloved California frequently, but hopefully he and his beloved wife, Judy, an extraordinary individual in her own right, will be here, and we will see him frequently and have the opportunity to benefit from his advice and counsel and his leadership.  Vic, you have been one of the extraordinary Members of this House. The House is a better place for your service, and our country is better for your service.                          ____________________
