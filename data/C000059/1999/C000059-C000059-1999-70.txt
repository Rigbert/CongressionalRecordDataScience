Speaker, the Endangered Species Act of 1973 was well-intentioned legislation. But the Fish and Wildlife Service, especially in California, is working outside of the ESA and undermining its original intent.  Today, I am dropping the third in a series of single-issue bills to make common sense corrections to the ESA. My bill would prohibit the use of any information obtained by trespassing on privately owned property without the consent of the owner. This bill would restrict Fish and Wildlife from using any information that was illegally obtained to declare habitat or otherwise administer the Endangered Species Act.  It is common sense that trespassing is illegal. We all know that. Yet I continue to hear, over and over, that Fish and Wildlife is using information that was questionably obtained to administer the ESA. Mr. Speaker, the Fish and Wildlife Service is not above the law. While Fish and Wildlife employees may or may not be the ones doing the actual trespassing, they have continually shown a disregard for how information was obtained, thereby encouraging trespassing.  In May, the Resources Committee held a hearing with community officials and landowners to outline the problems they are having with Fish and Wildlife's implementation of the ESA. Every member of Congress needs to sit up and take notice and talk to their local officials. This is not just a problem in California, but in places as far east as North Carolina and as far north as Washington.  I'm frustrated, Mr. Speaker. So frustrated that I will introduce one ESA reform bill every week until the field hearing on July 9. This is a call to common sense.                          ____________________
