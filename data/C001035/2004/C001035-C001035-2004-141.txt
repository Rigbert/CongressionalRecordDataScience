President, I echo the words of my colleague from Connecticut. Senator Mikulski has been so helpful throughout this debate and in the development of this bill. In fact, when the Governmental Affairs Committee was first assigned the responsibility for evaluating the 9/11 Commission recommendations and producing this bill, it was the Senator from Maryland who was the first to call me and to offer to help, to share her knowledge from her years on the Intelligence Committee and on the Appropriations Committee. I really appreciated that gesture.  Since that time, she also participated in one of the Governmental Affairs Committee hearings that we held. Her State lost so many citizens on that awful day, and she has been relentless in her determination to make sure their memory is never forgotten. I very much appreciate all of her contributions.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
