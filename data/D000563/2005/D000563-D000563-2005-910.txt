We have talked about the gun manufacturer who did not do a background check on his employees and the employees stole guns without serial numbers on them--the guns went onto the street and were used to kill innocent people--that that gun manufacturer would escape liability under this bill that is before us. I would like to ask the Senator from Rhode Island about the example where someone who is a gun dealer, knows that under the law you cannot sell guns to felons, people convicted of a felony, sees someone who comes in with another person, we call them straw purchasers, someone else who is going to buy the guns, a girlfriend, some other person. We had a case I believe the Senator referred to, a 10-year-old boy in Philadelphia on his way to school gets right to the gates to go into the schoolyard, a gang member comes up and shoots him in the face. He survived, was conscious for a few hours and then lapsed into a coma and died. It turns out that the gun was traced to a store where it was sold to one of these straw purchasers--the other purchaser, the real purchaser who wasn't eligible to buy it, standing next to them. So it was pretty clear what was going on. The store clerk charges extra because there is a straw purchaser involved, acknowledging they know that this gun is being bought by one person to be given to another.  So what the Senator from Rhode Island is telling us is that this bill says the family of that 10-year-old boy shot in the face, who died by that gun, cannot even go to court to hold responsible the gun dealer who knowingly sold this gun to a straw purchaser to avoid the law.  Is that my understanding of this as it is written?
