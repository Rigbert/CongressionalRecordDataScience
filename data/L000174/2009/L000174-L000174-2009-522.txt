None of us would hesitate for a moment to provide funds to help someone in our family who might be in this condition. I see the Senator from Mississippi on the floor. His amendment prohibits funds to the U.N. Population Fund for that.  The bill provides funds to reestablish maternal health care in areas where medical facilities and services have been destroyed or limited by natural disasters, armed conflict or other factors, such as in Pakistan after the earthquake that destroyed whole villages. Why would we not want to support maternal health care? Any one of us, be it our sisters and daughters, our wives, we would want them to access to these medical services. Or in Congo, where armed conflict has destroyed what limited health services existed and where thousands of women and girls have been raped, some barely old enough to walk. This bill provides funds for programs to help them. The amendment of the Senator from Mississippi would prohibit funding for the U.N. Population Fund for that.  Funds are provided to promote access to clean water, sanitation, food and health care for poor women and girls. His amendment would prohibit that. I have traveled to different parts of the world. I have seen the differences in the lives of women and young girls that are made with these programs. The Senator prohibits that.  The U.S. Agency for International Development has these types of programs in 53 countries, but the U.N. Population Fund works in about 150 countries. If you live in the Republic of the Congo or the Central African Republic, two of the poorest countries in Africa, and you are a 16-year-old girl with obstetric fistula, you are out of luck because USAID does not have programs there. That is why we fund the U.N. program. If you have a 7-year-old daughter who has been raped there, we don't have a program to help her. But we give funds to the U.N. to help her. The amendment of the Senator from Mississippi would stop that.  If you live in Niger or Mauritania, where genital mutilation is common, or in Sri Lanka where child marriage is common, we don't have funds there, but we give funds to the U.N. to help.  The Senator's amendment creates a problem where there is none. It denies funding to address the basic needs of poor women and girls who are subjected to practices that would be crimes in this country.  Our law already prohibits funds for abortion of any kind, whether coercive or voluntary. We already prohibit funds for involuntary sterilization. We prohibit funds for the U.N. Population Fund's program in China. We have already done all these things. But we do provide funds to help girls who are being forced into marriages at the age of 9. We do support care for women who suffer from these debilitating conditions. We do have funds for maternal care, clean water, and voluntary family planning. But if the amendment of the junior Senator from Mississippi is agreed to, we would prohibit those funds in many parts of the world.  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.                               Exhibit 1                [From the New York Times, Feb. 24, 2009]                 After a Devastating Birth Injury, Hope                           (By Denise Grady)       Dodoma, Tanzania.--Lying side by side on a narrow bed,      talking and giggling and poking each other with skinny      elbows, they looked like any pair of teenage girls trading      jokes and secrets.       But the bed was in a crowded hospital ward, and between the      moments of laughter, Sarah Jonas, 18, and Mwanaidi Swalehe,      17, had an inescapable air of sadness. Pregnant at 16, both      had given birth in 2007 after labor that lasted for days.      Their babies had died, and the prolonged labor had inflicted      a dreadful injury on the mothers: an internal wound called a      fistula, which left them incontinent and soaked in urine.       Last month at the regional hospital in Dodoma, they awaited      expert surgeons who     would try to repair the damage. For each, two previous,      painful operations by other doctors had failed.       ``It will be great if the doctors succeed,'' Ms. Jonas said      softly in Swahili, through an interpreter.       Along with about 20 other girls and women ranging in age      from teens to 50s, Ms. Jonas and Ms. Swalehe had taken long      bus rides from their villages to this hot, dusty city for      operations paid for by a charitable group, Amref, the African      Medical and Research Foundation.       The foundation had brought in two surgeons who would      operate and teach doctors and nurses from different parts of      Tanzania how to repair fistulas and care for patients      afterward.       ``This is a vulnerable population,'' said one of the      experts, Dr. Gileard Masenga, from the Kilimanjaro Christian      Medical Center in Moshi, Tanzania. ``These women are      suffering.''       The mission--to do 20 operations in four days--illustrates      the challenges of providing medical care in one of the      world's poorest countries, with a shortage of doctors and      nurses, sweltering heat, limited equipment, unreliable      electricity, a scant blood supply and two patients at a time      in one operating room--patients with an array of injuries,      from easily fixable to dauntingly complex.       The women filled most of Ward 2, a long, one-story building      with a cement floor and two rows of closely spaced beds      against opposite walls. All had suffered from obstructed      labor, meaning that their babies were too big or in the wrong      position to pass through the birth canal. If prolonged,      obstructed labor often kills the baby, which may then soften      enough to fit through the pelvis, so that the mother delivers      a corpse.       Obstructed labor can kill the mother, too, or crush her      bladder, uterus and vagina between her pelvic bones and the      baby's skull. The injured tissue dies, leaving a fistula: a      hole that lets urine stream out constantly through the      vagina. In some cases, the rectum is damaged and stool leaks      out. Some women also have nerve damage in the legs.       One of the most striking things about the women in Ward 2      was how small they were. Many stood barely five feet tall,      with slight frames and narrow hips, which may have      contributed to their problems. Girls not fully grown, or      women stunted by malnutrition, often have small pelvises that      make them prone to obstructed labor.       The women wore kangas, bolts of cloth wrapped into skirts,      in bright prints that stood out against the ward's drab,      chipping paint. Under the skirts, some had kangas bunched      between their legs to absorb urine.       Not even a curtain separated the beds. An occasional hot      breeze blew in through the screened windows. Flies buzzed,      and a cat with one kitten loitered in the doorway. Outside,      kangas that had been washed by patients or their families      were draped over bushes and clotheslines and patches of      grass, drying in the sun.       Speaking to doctors and nurses in a classroom at the      hospital, Dr. Jeffrey P. Wilkinson, an expert on fistula      repair from Duke University, noted that women with fistulas      frequently became outcasts because of the odor. Since July,      Dr. Wilkinson has been working at the Kilimanjaro Christian      Medical Center, which is collaborating with Duke on a women's      health project.       ``I've met countless fistula patients who have been thrown      off the bus,'' he said. ``Or their family tells them to      leave, or builds a separate hut.''       For the women in Ward 2, the visiting doctors held out the      best hope of regaining a normal life.       Fistulas are a scourge of the poor, affecting two million      women and girls, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia--those      who cannot get a Caesarean section or other medical help in      time. Long neglected, fistulas have gained increasing      attention in recent years, and nonprofit groups, hospitals      and governments have created programs, like the one in      Dodoma, to provide the surgery.       Cure rates of 90 percent or more are widely cited, but, Dr.      Wilkinson said, ``That's not a realistic number.''       It may be true that the holes are closed in 90 percent of      patients, but even so, women with extensive damage and      scarring do not always regain the nerve and muscle control      needed to stay dry, Dr. Wilkinson said.       Ideally, fistulas should be prevented, but prevention--     which requires education, more hospitals, doctors and      midwives, and better transportation--lags far behind      treatment. Worldwide, there are still 100,000 new cases a      year, and most experts think it will take decades to      eliminate fistulas in Africa, even though they were wiped out      in developed countries a century ago. Their continuing      presence is a sign that medical care for pregnant women is      desperately inadequate.       ``Fistula is the thing to follow,'' Dr. Wilkinson said.      ``If you find patients with fistula, you'll also find that      mothers and babies are dying right and left.''       The day before her surgery, Ms. Jonas sat on her bed,      anxiously eyeing the other women as they were wheeled back      from the operating room. Some vomited from the anesthesia,      and she found it a distressing sight.       Ms. Jonas said that when she was 16, she became intimate      with a 19-year-old boyfriend, without realizing that sex      could make her pregnant. It quickly did. Her labor went on      for three days. By the time a Caesarean was performed, it was      too late. Her son survived for only an hour, and she      developed a fistula, as well as nerve damage in one leg that      left her with an awkward gait.       Her boyfriend denied paternity and married someone else,      and some friends abandoned her because she was wet and      smelled. She was living in a rural village in a two-room mud      hut with her parents, two sisters and a brother. She had one      year of education and could not read or write, but said that      she hoped to go to school again someday.       The operating room in Dodoma had just enough room for two      operating tables, separated by a green cloth screen. Two at a      time, the patients, wearing bedsheets they had draped as      gracefully as their kangas, walked in. Some were so short      that they needed a set of portable steps to climb up onto the      table.       The women had an anesthetic injected into their spines to      numb them below the waist, and then their legs were lifted      into stirrups. Awake, they lay in silence while the doctors      worked, Dr. Masenga at one table and Dr. Wilkinson at the      other, each surrounded by other doctors who had come to      learn.       An air-conditioner put out more noise than air. Flies      circled, sometimes lighting on the patients. A mouse scurried      alongside the wall. There were none of the beeping monitors      that dominate operating rooms in the United States.      Periodically, a nurse would take a blood pressure reading.       Midway through the first operation the power failed, and      the lights went out. Dr. Wilkinson put on a battery-powered      headlamp and kept working, but Dr. Masenga had to depend on      daylight. Their scrubs and gowns grew dark with sweat.       Most fistula surgery is performed through the vagina, and      can take anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours. It      involves more than simply sewing a hole shut: delicate      dissection is needed to loosen nearby tissue so that there      will not be too much tension on the stitches, and sometimes      flaps of tissue must be cut and sculpted to patch or replace      a missing or damaged area. It can take several weeks to tell      how well the operation worked.       At the end of the week in Dodoma, the surgeons said that of      the 20 operations, some were straightforward and easy, and a      few seemed likely to fail. Three patients needed such      complicated repairs that they were referred to the      Kilimanjaro medical center.       At first, it seemed as if Ms. Jonas's operation had worked,      while Ms. Swalehe's outlook was uncertain. Shortly after      their surgeries, the two young women were violently ill. Ms.      Swalehe wept from pain when the surgeons came in to check on      her. But both women were smiling the next day, hoping for the      best. (Ultimately, Ms. Jonas's surgery failed, and Ms.      Swalehe's succeeded.)       One day after the last operation, the fistula surgeons      moved on, already thinking about the countless new cases that      awaited them.
