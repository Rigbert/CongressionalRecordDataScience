President, we spent a lot of months of very, very hard work to craft this farm bill. Today, we are completing the final legislative step in the farm bill process. I am glad that Secretary Glickman has said that he will recommend that the bill be signed.  The Secretary is one of the most knowledgeable Secretaries of Agriculture with which I have ever worked. He has been a Member of the Congress. He has worked on many farm bills. He knows, as I do, that nobody ever gets everything they want in a farm bill. You have to bring in a number of competing interests and ultimately make a judgment of whether the bill should be signed or not. I believe it should be signed. I concur with his judgment.  I am also pleased that the President said he would sign the farm bill. In my discussions with the White House and with the Secretary, I have told them this is a good bipartisan bill that proves we can work together.  We were in a situation, Mr. President, where we were not going to be able to pass a Democratic or a Republican farm bill. However, if we worked as we have in the past in a bipartisan fashion, we could pass a very good farm bill.  There are many who had a hand in this legislation. First and foremost of those is the chairman of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee, the senior Senator from Indiana, Senator Lugar.  Had it not been for his energy, foresight and perseverance, we would not be on the floor today with a completed conference report. The Agriculture Committee is made up of members with very diverse and, I might say, occasionally conflicting interests. For those who know the Agriculture Committee as Senator Lugar and I do, that is probably considered an understatement. The Senate has some committees that divide along ideological lines and one can almost predict how a vote might go.  That is not the case in the Senate Agriculture Committee. Conservatives join with liberals on various issues; conservatives break with conservatives; liberals break with liberals; moderates oftentimes have a balance of power; regions have interests that conflict with other regions. This is not a case of ideological balances. This is a case of trying to balance the different needs of different parts of our great and wonderful Nation.  Throughout the year, Chairman Lugar worked closely with members to craft a bill that provides us with the basic road map for agriculture policy. I appreciate both his leadership and his friendship. The bill recognizes that farm policy has changed. It cannot be just about the production side of agriculture. It is about the consumption side of agriculture, too.  The bill provides important protection to consumers in key environmental conservation issues. The focus is on providing incentives to get farmers to voluntarily do the right thing for the environment, their communities, and their neighbors.  It is a major step away from the old focus of mandatory, detailed regulations. The conservation provisions break with the past. They will provide cash payments to farmers for improvements that make sense for their farms. The bill will help farmers do those things that farmers know should be done. The bill contains the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, EQUIP, to assist farmers in solving critical water quality problems, for those farmers who want to protect lakes, rivers, and the ground water important to both them and their neighbors. This means that farmers will get funds to protect the groundwater that their neighbor's children drink.  There is $300 million in new spending to restore the Florida Everglades which is one of America's national treasures.  All of us should agree, whether we are from Florida or not, that we need to restore the Florida Everglades to its full glory.  There is a $35 million initiative to buy easements sold by willing sellers, on farmland threatened by development. This voluntary program, called Farms for the Future in Vermont, allows farm families to save their farmland for their children.  The bill contains a conservation farm option that will encourage farmers to use good conservation methods. I am pleased that, despite efforts to phase out the Conservation Reserve Program, we were able to save it. It is the Nation's largest, and most successful, private land conservation program.  I also want to mention dairy. Let me speak not as the ranking member of the committee, but as a Vermonter.  I know the farmers in Vermont. They work very, very hard. They rise early every morning and work late into the night just to get their milk into the market. I have sat in the kitchens of farm houses throughout Vermont and talked with the farmers, the women and men, and their sons and daughters, who run these dairy farms. I have gotten up with them at 4 o'clock in the morning and gone into the barns and helped them do their chores and milking. One farmer said I probably made a better Senator than I did a hired hand.  I was helping Bob Howrigan bring a couple different herds in different fields. As I helped him bring one of the herds across to the milking shed, I said, ``Bob, I got that herd in for you, and I probably only lost a couple cows on the way over.''  He said, ``Pat, I appreciate it. If I keep you around a few weeks I can get out of farming altogether.''  That is the kind of humor that goes on. These are people who work harder than anybody else I know. These are small family farms. They dot the New England countryside. They are a beautiful part of our heritage. But they exist only if they work hard and efficiently.  So I am pleased this bill includes an issue very important to my region, the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact. Farmers in my State are not looking for handouts.  All they want is a farm bill that gives them a fair price for an honest day's work. They will work harder than anybody else, but they ought to be recompensed for that work. I am tired of the person in the middle getting all the profits and the typical Vermont farmer going almost 15 years without any kind of a price increase.  This compact is the last best hope of preserving Vermont's heritage. Dairy farmers work harder than anyone I know. Cows have to be milked 7 days a week. It does not make a difference whether it is 25 degrees below zero, as it is often in Vermont, or 5 o'clock in the morning. It makes no difference. The cows have to be milked.  I commend Chairman Lugar for his help on the dairy compact. I commend the other members of the Vermont delegation. Interestingly enough, we are a State where one-third of our delegation is independent, one-third is Republican, and the remaining third is me. We came together, all three of us, to work for this. Chairman Lugar talked to farmers in Vermont. He knew how important it was. After years of debate in Congress, we finally have a farm bill that gives them the dairy compact.  I want to remind everyone that while retail prices for dairy products have increased 30 percent, farm prices have actually decreased 5 percent. I want to also point out that although the price of a half gallon of milk has gone from $1.19 to $1.59 over the past 15 years, the farmer's share has remained at just 59 cents.  The dairy compact establishes a system which gives the States and local farmers control over their lives.  It will ensure that New England consumers can find milk in their supermarkets at fair prices.  It will also provide family farmers throughout the region with a decent living, so that they will be able to pass on their farms to their children and their children's children.  Instead of a national standard imposed by the Federal Government, the dairy compact allows local citizens, farmers and officials to make local decisions on milk. That is good for dairy farmers, good for Vermont and good for America.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a resolution in support of the compact from the New England Governors, letters in support of the compact from various groups in Vermont, the vote totals in each of the State legislatures be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                            New England Governors'                                             Conference, Inc.,                                    Boston, MA, February 13, 1995.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: I understand the Northeast Interstate      Dairy Compact awaits action by the full Senate. On behalf of      the New England Governors' Conference, Inc., I write to ask      your help in moving the Compact bill forward as quickly as      possible.       The attached Resolution of the New England Governors'      Conference, Inc. was adopted unanimously at our recent      meeting in Washington, D.C.       The Dairy Compact has been enacted into law by the six New      England states. We hope you will support this unique      experiment in cooperative federalism. The Compact is a bi-     partisan, state-sponsored, regional response to the chronic      problem of low dairy farm prices. If successfully      implemented, the Compact will stabilize our region's dairy      industry and reinvigorate this crucial segment of our rural      economy, without cost to the federal government or adverse      impact on the national industry.       Thank you for your consideration of this matter.           Very truly yours,                                                William A. Gildea,                                               Executive Director.                Resolution 127--Northeast Dairy Compact       A Resolution of the New England Governors' Conference, Inc.      in support of congressional enactment of the Northeast Dairy      Compact.       Whereas, the six New England states have enacted the      Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact to address the alarming      loss of dairy farms in the region; and       Whereas, the Compact is a unique partnership of the      region's governments and the dairy industry supported by a      broad and active coalition of organizations and people      committed to maintaining the vitality of the region's diary      industry, including consumers, processors, bankers, equipment      dealers.     veterinarians, the tourist and travel industry,      environmentalists, land conservationists and recreational      users of open land; and       Whereas, the Compact would not harm but instead complement      the existing federal structure for milk pricing, nor      adversely affect the competitive position of any dairy      farmer, processor or other market participant in the nation's      air industry; and       Whereas, the limited and relatively isolated market      position of the New England dairy industry makes it an      appropriate locality in which to assess the effectiveness of      regional regulation of milk pricing, and       Whereas, the Constitution of the United States expressly      authorizes states to enter into interstate compacts with the      approval of Congress and government at all levels      increasingly recognizes the need to promote cooperative,      federalist solutions to local and regional problems; and       Whereas, the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact has been      submitted to Congress for approval as required by the      Constitution; Now therefore be it Resolved, That the New      England Governors' Conference, Inc. requests that Congress      approve the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact; and be it      further Resolved, That, a copy of this resolution be sent to      the leadership of the Senate and the House of      Representatives, the Chairs of the appropriate legislative      committees, and the Secretary of the United States Department      of Agriculture.       Adoption certified by the New England Governors'      Conference, Inc. on January 31, 1995.                                              Stephen Merrill,                                        Governor of New Hampshire,     Chairman.                                                                    ____                                           Vermont Public Interest                                               Research Group,                                   Montpelier, VT, March 29, 1995.     Re Support for the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,      87 State Street,     Montpelier, VT.       Dear Senator Leahy: Thank you for your efforts last year to      move the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact through the      Senate. VPIRG appreciates that those efforts fell prey to      gridlock in Congress. Notwithstanding, we strongly support      the Compact--we see it as a means to sustain family farms and      agriculture in Vermont. We were thus heartened to see your      co-sponsorship of Senate Joint Resolution 28 on March 2nd,      and ask you to help accelerate its movement through Congress.       We know that passage will not be easy. But the time is      right for a strong push. We need your help more than ever.      The mood of Congress is to return power to the states and, in      the case of the Compact, allow states greater power to manage      their own affairs collectively. Please take advantage of this      opportunity to promote passage of the Compact at the earliest      time possible.       Time is of the essence--Vermont dairy farmers are in      trouble. We read that the Vermont Department of Agriculture      reported a loss of 50 more dairy farms in January and      February alone, bring the total to below 2,000 farms. If      anything, the rate of loss seems to be increasing, and this      is of great concern to our club members.       In addition to their direct input into the economy. Vermont      dairy farms add to the aesthetic quality of the state. And      financially stable farms are better able to deal with      agricultural run-off problems and important regulations to      deal with non-point pollution. Family-owned dairy farms are      also a significant part of Vermont's heritage and it is      important that they continue to operate here.       Again, thank you for your efforts in supporting the      Compact. We are behind you 100%!           Sincerely,                                                Katherine M. Vose,     Executive Director.                                                                    ____                                             Vermont Federation of                                      Sportsmen's Clubs, Inc.,                                                   April 13, 1995.     Senator Patrick Leahy,     87 State Street,     Montpelier, VT.       Dear Senator Leahy: Thank you for your efforts last year to      move the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact through the      Congress. We appreciate that those efforts fell prey to      gridlock. Notwithstanding, the Vermont Federation of      Sportsmen Clubs, Inc. continues to strongly support the      Compact--we see it as a reintroduction of Senator Joint      Resolution 28 on March 2nd, and ask you to help accelerate      its movement through Congress.       We know that passage will not be easy. But the time is      right for a strong push. The mood of Congress is to return      power to the states and, in the case of the Compact, allow      states greater power to manage their own affairs      collectively. Please take advantage of this opportunity to      promote passage of the Compact at the earliest time possible.       Time is of essence for an even more critical reason--     Vermont dairy farmers are in trouble. We read that the      Vermont Department of Agriculture reported a loss of 50 more      dairy farms in January and February alone, bring the total to      below 2000 farms.

Vermont      dairy farms add to the aesthetic quality of the state.      Tourism and recreational opportunities are enhanced by the      open space provided by farms, Family owned dairy farms are a      significant part of Vermont's heritage and it is important      that they continue to operate here.       Again, thank you for your efforts in supporting the      Compact. We are behind you 100%!           Yours in Sportsmanship,                                                   Ralph Buchanan,     Secretary, VFSC.                                                                    ____                                         Bourdeau Bros., Inc.,                                                    Champlain, NY.     Re Support for the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact.     Senator Patrick Leahy,     87 State Street,     Montpelier, VT.       Dear Senator Leahy: Thank you for your efforts last year to      move the Northeast Interstate Dairy Company through the      Senate. We appreciate that those efforts fell prey to      gridlock in Congress. Notwithstanding, Bourdeau Brothers,      Inc. continues to strongly support the Compact--we see it as      a means to sustain family farms and agriculture in Vermont      and the Northeast. A substantial part of our feed and      fertilizer business is with Vermont farmers and they need      help! We were thus heartened to see the reintroduction of      Senate Joint Resolution 28 on March 2nd, and ask you to help      accelerate its movement through Congress.       We know that passage will not be easy. But the time is      right for a strong push.

Please take advantage of this opportunity to      promote passage of the Compact at the earliest time possible.       The Compact is a unique piece of legislation and is clearly      a regional solution to a regional problem. In the long-run,      it benefits both consumers and producers. It complements the      existing federal program, and even has a provision to      discourage overproduction. It's a work of art.       Again, thank you for your efforts in supporting the      Compact. We are behind you 100%!           Sincerely,                                                 Germain Bourdeau,     President.                                                                    ____                                               Vermont Housing and                                       Conservation Coalition,                                   Montpelier, VT, April 13, 1995.     Senator Patrick Leahy,     87 State Street,     Montpelier, VT.       Dear Pat: I am writing on behalf of the Vermont Housing and      Conservation Coalition to support passage of the Northeast      Interstate Dairy Compact legislation. The Coalition is a      group of land conservation and affordable housing      organizations, including the Vermont Land Trust, that have      been instrumental in the creation of the Vermont Housing &      Conservation Trust Fund and in the implementation of its      program. In less than eight years, that program has      permanently protected more than 125 operating farms in      Vermont through the acquisition of conservation easements,      and the momentum is growing. Over a third of the transactions      have involved the transfer of the farm from one generation of      owners to the next, which is a key element in maintaining the      long-term viability of the agricultural industry in this      state.       But that is not the only key element, as you well know.      What is also critically important, especially with dairy      farming continuing to be the largest sector of Vermont      agriculture, is that farmers receive a fair price for their      product. If milk prices continue at their present      disastrously low levels, Vermont may see a drastic shrinkage      in its number of family farms. Even if much of that land is      absorbed into other stronger farm operations, Vermont will      have lost some of the fabric which makes this state so      special.       Congress has been moving in the direction of returning more      control to the States. It is therefore highly significant      that the six New England States have all adopted the      legislation endorsing the compact. The only barrier to      returning some sense of fairness and control over milk prices      is Congress' authorization.       I understand that the Joint Resolution has been      reintroduced in the House and Senate. I hope you will do all      you can to push for its passage by Congress at the earliest      possible time. Time is short. An officer at the Farm Credit      Association, who works with many farmers and is a strong      advocate of Vermont's program to purchase development rights      on farmland, recently told me that Vermont may lose as many      as 800 farms in the next five years. He felt that the next      12-18 months will be the most difficult. We cannot afford to      wait for the Compact legislation.       Thank you for your support. With best wishes.           Sincerely,                                                    Darby Bradley,     Co-Chair.                                                                    ____                                Vermont Ski Areas Association,                                   Montpelier, VT, April 11, 1995.     Re Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact.     Senator Patrick Leahy,     87 State Street,     Montpelier, VT.       Dear Senator Leahy: As you well know, tourism and      agriculture in Vermont are mutually dependent industries.      More and more,     these two industries depend on the health and prosperity of      each other. For as long as I can remember, the Vermont ski      industry has taken a keen interest in the health and      stability of Vermont's dairy farms. We not only share a      working landscape, but we also share common markets as well      as common values.       On behalf of Vermont ski areas, I want to thank you for      your continued support of the Northeast Interstate Dairy      Compact. Solving our financial problems within the dairy      industry will challenge us for a generation to come, but      there is little question that an essential first step is the      passage of legislation creating the Northeast Interstate      Dairy Compact.       I urge you to give this matter special attention in a very      busy legislative session. We in Vermont's ski industry know,      perhaps better than ever, what hard economic times can mean      and want to lend our voice of support to the enactment of      this legislation at the earliest possible date.           Sincerely,                                              Joseph A. Parkinson,     Executive Director.                                                                    ____                                               Vermont Current Use                                                Tax Coalition,                                   Montpelier, VT, March 30, 1995.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     87 State Street,     Montpelier, VT.       Dear Senator Leahy: We appreciate your efforts of last year      to try to obtain passage of the Northeast Interstate Dairy      Compact legislation. Congress did not see fit to act on the      legislation. We still believe this legislation deserves your      strong support and so urge you to help accelerate Senate      Joint Resolution 28 through Congress.       It is clear that passage will not be easy against western      and mid-western determination to hold onto control of milk      pricing structures over the entire country. But, we believe      that if agriculture is to be sustainable over the foreseeable      future in New England, we must be able to set prices for our      products based on production costs in New England, not in the      corn belt, or on vast federal range lands of the west. The      dairy industry should lead the way; the other agricultural      sectors will follow.       It appears that now is not only an opportune time to press      this legislation because of the general mood on federal      deregulation and greater empowerment of the states to manage      their own affairs, but also because Vermont agriculture, and      dairy farms in particular, are undergoing increasingly      difficult financial times. Vermont lost 50 more dairy farms      in the first two months of this year. Where is it going to      end?       The Compact was adopted with near-unanimous support by the      six New England state legislatures. The Current Use Tax      Coalition supported the process then, and we continue to      believe that if agriculture is to remain an active part of      our lives in Vermont this key piece of legislation must be      passed.       Thank you for your efforts on behalf of Vermont      agriculture.           Sincerely,                                               David A. McDonough,     Chair, Current Use Tax Coalition.                                                                    ____                                      National Bank of Middlebury,                                    Middlebury, VT, April 3, 1995.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,      U.S. Senator, State Street,     Montpelier, VT.       Dear Senator Leahy: Thank you for your efforts last year to      move the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact through the      legislature. National Bank of Middlebury continues to      strongly support the Compact, and we are pleased to see the      re-introduction of Senate Joint Resolution #28 on March 2, We      know that passage will not be easy. However, the Compact has      received near unanimous support from the six New England      state legislatures. There is a clear regional mandate to      solve this problem.       Time is of the essence because Vermont dairy farmers are in      trouble. The Vermont Department of Agriculture reported a      loss of 50 more dairy farms in January and February alone      bringing the total farms in Vermont to below 2,000 in number.      We will see one of our customers added to the list of      casualties in June. The ``loss-of-farms'' rate is alarming      for the industry, but also for the state economy. It is      unclear how much farming contributes to the tourism economy      and the postal nature of Vermont. Our instincts tell us it is      immeasureable. So, we urge you to promote passage of the      Compact at the earliest time possible. Thank you for your      efforts in supporting the Compact.           Sincerely,                                                G.
