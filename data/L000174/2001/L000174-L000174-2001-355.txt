I see my good friend from Utah is here, as well as the Senators from Montana and Virginia.  Mr. President, it took the Senate the entire month of June to pass S. Res. 120, a very simple resolution in which we organized our committees. As one Senator, I am sorry we lost the month of June to the process of reorganizing the Senate, but I am proud of the very quick start of the Judiciary Committee on holding hearings and reporting nominees.  I sent out official notice of the committee's first hearing on judicial nominations within 10 minutes after the majority leader announced an agreement had been reached on reorganization.
