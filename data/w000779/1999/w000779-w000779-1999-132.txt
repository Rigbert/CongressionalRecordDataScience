 I think the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island, particularly with Families USA, is on to something that really constitutes a revolution in consumer protection. What we have seen on one issue after another--just a few minutes ago the distinguished Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, and Senator Dodd of Connecticut, and I were able to get an agreement on the Y2K issue with respect to trying to hold down frivolous lawsuits surrounding Y2K. What the Senator from Rhode Island and Families USA have been able to do is essentially say in the health care system: We are going to do everything we possibly can to limit frivolous lawsuits; we are going to help people when they need it most, when the problem first develops.  I want to assure the Senator from Rhode Island and the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts that I am anxious to work with them on this proposal, because I think this is one of the areas where the parties ought to be able to come together. It may sound quaint, but the ombudsman notion is simply good government. It is preventive kind of medicine.  I thank the Senator for the chance to work with him on it. I will not ask him to yield further. But I am very hopeful that in the days ahead both political parties can see the merit in this idea and have it included.
