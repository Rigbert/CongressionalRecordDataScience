 President, today is a very special day for millions of women around the world. Today is a day that celebrates the promise of a better future. Today is a day that offers the hope that injustices inflicted on too many women in too many societies will disappear from the earth forever. Today, March 8, 2000, is International Women's Day  I rise today to recognize this day's importance to the women of today and to the generations of women to come. I rise to cry shame for our failures in fulfilling this day's promise. And, I rise to direct our attention to three criticalissues: the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, CEDAW, international family planning, and the international trafficking of women and girls. These are issues in which the United States, and especially this body, are honor-bound to spare no effort in leading the international community to improve the status of women around the world.  In 1948, the United Nations dramatically focused world attention on the international human rights agenda when it adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This historic event aimed at increasing public awareness of the need to better the human condition in many places throughout the globe. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights represented a milestone in human history. Regrettably, it glossed over the needs of over half the world's population--women.  Women's rights remained unrecognized as a legitimate concern until the Convention to Eliminate all Forms of Discrimination Against Women, CEDAW, was drafted to redress this oversight. CEDAW organized all existing international standards regarding discrimination on the basis of gender, and established rights for women in areas not previously subject to international standards. The United States actively participated in drafting of the Convention; President Carter signed it on July 17, 1980.  Then the U.S. did nothing. For fourteen years, the United States scrutinized CEDAW with an intense scrutiny normally reserved for judging the merits of a technically demanding international agreement, not a document seeking to establish the fundamental human rights of over half the world's population. CEDAW was not sent to the Senate until September, 1994.  In 1994, the Foreign Relations Committee recommended by bipartisan vote that CEDAW be approved with qualifications, but acted too late in the session for the Convention to be considered by the full Senate.  Now, almost six years later, the Convention continues to languish in the Senate, locked up in the Committee on Foreign Relations. A bi-partisan group of women Senators, among whom I am proud to be counted, has sponsored Senate Resolution 237 which expresses the sense of the Senate that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee should hold hearings on CEDAW and that the full Senate should act on CEDAW by March 8, 2000.  Today is March 8, 2000. The date has come, and will go, and this body has yet to take substantive action on CEDAW, even though this Convention contains no provisions in conflict with American law.  The Convention has been ratified by 161 countries. Of the world's democracies, only the United States has yet to ratify this fundamental document. Indeed, even countries we regularly censure for human rights abuses--China, the People's Republic of Laos, Iraq--have either signed or agreed in principle. In our failure to ratify CEDAW, we now keep company with a select few--Iran, North Korea, Sudan and Afghanistan among them. Remember, as the old saying goes, we are judged by the company we keep. Is this how we want to be known when it comes to defending the human rights of those unable to defend themselves?  In failing to sign on to this Convention, we risk losing our moral right to lead on human rights. By ratifying CEDAW, we will demonstrate our commitment to promoting equality and to protecting women's rights throughout the world. By ratifying CEDAW, we will send a strong message to the international community that the U.S. understands the challenges faced by discrimination against women, and we will not abide by it. By ratifying CEDAW, we reestablish our credentials as a leader on human rights and women's rights.  Today, as we commemorate International Women's Day, I call on my colleagues in the Senate to move forward and ratify CEDAW.  The second issue I would like to touch on today is one which has seen much congressional attention in recent years: U.S. support for international family planning and reproductive health.  The world now has more than 6 billion people. The United Nations estimates this figure could be 12 billion by the year 2050. Almost all of this growth will occur in the places least able to bear up under the pressures of massive population increases. The brunt will be in developing countries lacking the resources needed to provide basic health or education services. If women are to be able to better their own lives and the lives of their families, they must have access to the educational and medical resources needed to control their reproductive destinies and their health.  International family planning programs reduce poverty, improve health and raise living standards around the world; they enhance the ability of couples and individuals to determine the number and spacing of their children.  Under the leadership of both Democratic and Republican Presidents, and under Congresses controlled by Democrats and Republicans alike, the United States has established a long and distinguished record of world leadership on international family planning and reproductive health issues.  Unfortunately, in recent years these programs have come under increasing partisan attack, despite the fact that no U.S. international family planning funds are spent on international abortion.  The Fiscal Year 2000 omnibus appropriations bill contained ``Mexico City'' restrictions that prohibit U.S. grants to private foreign non-governmental organizations that perform abortions or lobby to change abortion laws in foreign countries. House leaders insisted on these provisions in exchange for acceptance of arrear payments to the United Nations.  I was disappointed that the bill included this language. I voted in favor of the legislation because I thought it critical that we pay our back dues to the United Nations, and because it contained a provision granting Presidential authority--which President Clinton later exercised--to waive the restrictions through the end of Fiscal Year 2000. I am pleased the President took this action and that he announced that he would oppose any attempt to renew the ``Mexico City'' restrictions when they expire on September 30, 2000.  International family planning programs have experienced significant cuts in funding in recent years. President Clinton's foreign aid budget for Fiscal Year 2001 calls for $542 million for international family planning programs, restoring funding to Fiscal Year 1995 levels.  Today, as we mark International Women's Day, I urge my colleagues to recommit themselves to U.S. leadership in international family planning and support the President's request.  Lastly, I would like to focus attention on a vicious, and growing problem for women the world over--forced or coerced trafficking of girls and women for the purpose of sexual exploitation.  This is a rapidly growing, highly lucrative international business. The United Nations estimates that every year millions of women fall victims to this international trafficking in human life. Criminal organizations make an estimated $7 billion a year on the trafficking and prostitution of approximately 4 million women and girls. They do some by preying on the fears and economic insecurity created by the grinding poverty, rising unemployment and disintegrating social networks common to many poorer societies, today.  The traffickers target women from Eastern Europe and East Asia, women who agree to work as waitresses, models or dancers in the industrialized world to escape the grip of poverty in their native lands. But, once they arrive, their passports are seized, they are beaten, held captive and forced into prostitution. Traffickers and pimps hold these women in bondage, forcing them to work uncompensated as repayment for exaggerated room, board, and travel expenses.  These victims have little or no legal protection; they travel on falsified documents or enter by means of inappropriate visas provided by traffickers. When and if discovered by the police, these women are usually treated as illegal aliens and deported. Even worse, laws against traffickers who engage in forced prostitution, rape, kidnaping, and assault and battery are rarely enforced. The women will not testify against traffickers out of fear of retribution, the threat of deportation, and humiliation for their actions.  We, as a nation, cannot sit idly and allow this vicious exploitation of women to continue unchecked. We must effectively enforce current laws and implement new laws to protect victims and prosecute traffickers. I am proud to be a co-sponsor of Senator Wellstone's International Trafficking of Women and Children Victim Protection of 1999 which provides more information on trafficking and toughens law dealing with the illegal trade of women.  I urge all of my colleagues to support this vital piece of legislation.  The issues I have laid before you today are not just women's issues, they are humanity's issues. As First Lady Hillary Clinton has said, `Women's rights are human rights and human rights are women's rights.' They merit attention throughout the year, not just on one day.  We must debate and ratify the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. We must rededicate ourselves and our resources to international family planning programs. And we must enact tough anti-trafficking legislation.                          ____________________
