Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment. It is an amendment like the four other amendments. It is an interesting proposition that we have before us. We are talking about campaign finance reform.  The gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Wamp) said that he went and asked his people about whether or not they thought that everybody ought to be covered by the same rules. The gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Wamp) said yes, all of them agreed that everybody ought to be covered by the same rules and they ought to know who advertises and tells them things so they can figure out for themselves what people are saying.  I suppose there are some on the other side of the aisle who will go home and say yes, I am for campaign finance reform, but I voted to exempt everybody from its coverage. That would be an interesting campaign finance reform. We have it on the books; but by the way, it does not cover anybody. Everybody is exempt.  Now, this amendment exempts workers and families and farmers and individuals. I am trying to figure out who, therefore, would be included if we adopted this amendment, seeing as how most of us sort of consider ourselves individuals?  So this is an extraordinarily interesting amendment, but it is also an extraordinarily bad amendment; and I do not believe any Member who is at all serious about trying to have some meaningful campaign finance reform could in good conscience, with any intellectual honesty, and with all due respect to the gentleman from Texas whom I have a great relationship with and greatly respect, possibly vote for his amendment. Therefore, I enthusiastically urge Members to vote against it.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore (Mr. Thornberry). All time for debate on this amendment has expired.  The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Combest).  The question was taken; and the Chairman pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it.                             Recorded Vote
