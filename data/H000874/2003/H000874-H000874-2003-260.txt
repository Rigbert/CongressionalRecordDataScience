 Now, Mr. Leader, one of the things I was very concerned about in hearing the schedule, it has now been just short of 7 days that we passed the child tax credit legislation that many of us have expressed real concern about. We went to conference that same day, as the gentleman knows.  Can the gentleman tell me whether or not the conference is meeting? Can the gentleman tell me whether we expect to consider a conference report so that prior to July the 6.5 million families and the 12 million children that were left out when it came out of conference might be helped? Can the gentleman tell me whether or not there is either the conference proceeding or whether or not there is any expectation that we will take a conference report up on the floor next week prior to going home for the July 4th break? I yield to the gentleman.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding; and as the gentleman knows, we are very excited about extending the $1,000 per child tax credit beyond 2005, to extend it to 2010. Rather than leaving out refundable tax credits, those that are getting refundable tax credits will continue to get them. They just will not get the full $1,000 unless we are able to pass this bill.                              {time}  1730  And we are also very excited about the fact that the House put many tax provisions tax relief for our military and military families. And we are very excited about the fact that we gave some tax relief to those families that lost their loved ones in the shuttle accident. So we are very interested in getting this bill done as quickly as possible.  I am sure the gentleman knows that the other body just went to conference yesterday and, therefore, we are discussing how we can do this conference and, hopefully, do it before the Fourth of July district work period. However, the other body also is very much engaged in the debate over their Medicare bill, which ties up their finance committee and ties up those Members that would be serving on the conference committee. So we are trying to work that out, and we hope that we can call a conference and come to some sort of agreement on this bill and have it out before the Fourth of July.
