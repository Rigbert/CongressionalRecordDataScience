President, I rise today to recognize the achievement of La Salle Academy of Providence, RI whose football team became State Champions for the year 2000.  In 1871, the de La Salle Christian Brothers came to Rhode Island to teach at the ``Brothers'' school. In 1876, that school became an academy and was named La Salle, after the Christian Brothers founder, Saint John Baptiste de La Salle. Since its opening 125 years ago, La Salle has offered its students a rigorous, value-based education. The Brothers' approach to comprehensive student development has been evident not only in their academic excellence, but in the successes of their clubs and athletic teams as well.  The athletic department at La Salle has a strong commitment to instilling leadership, sportsmanship, and a healthy approach to athletic competition. Since its founding in 1908, the La Salle football program has been one of the most successful in the state. Legendary Coach Jack Cronin guided the Rams to 274 wins during his 44 years tenure from 1928 to 1972. In the 1940's and 1950's, La Salle played before some of the largest crowds ever to see a game in Rhode Island, including 25,000 in 1945, 40,000 in 1947, and 10,000 in 1955. In the 1970's and 1980's, the La Salle football team won ten Division A titles.  La Salle also participates in the oldest sports rivalry in the state. For seventy-one years, La Salle and East Providence High School have met traditionally on Thanksgiving Day. Up until this past year, the series had been tied, but with La Salle's victory they now proudly lead that series 35-34, with two ties.  Through the leadership of Tim Coen, first year Coach of the La Salle Rams, and Team Captains Toyin Barnisile, Joe Ben, Howie Brown, David Regus, and Jon-Erik Schneiderhan, La Salle can boast its first Super Bowl Division Championship. After winning only four of nine league games in the previous year, the Rams completed the regular season with an impressive 9-0 record, including a win over Thanksgiving rival and two-time defending state champions East Providence.  The last time La Salle played in a championship game was nearly a decade ago in 1992, when they lost to Portsmouth High School. The year 2000 finally brought a re-match as this year's Super Bowl game pitted the Portsmouth Patriots against the La Salle Rams. The Rams were victorious in a very close game, thanks to the exceptional effort put forth by the La Salle team supported by their fellow students and alumni.  As a proud graduate and former member of the La Salle Academy football team, I know the skills, training, and strength of character that are necessary to achieve what this program has achieved. I would ask that my colleagues join me in applauding La Salle Academy for its remarkable accomplishments this year and throughout its long tradition of excellence.                          ____________________
