Speaker, it is with great pleasure and admiration that I stand before you today to recognize Father J. Patrick Gaza, Pastor of Saints Monica and Luke and Saint Mark Catholic Churches in Gary, as he celebrates his retirement after 44 years of selfless service to the Catholic Church and the countless individuals he has ministered to throughout his life. Father Pat will be honored at a retirement reception on Sunday, July 21, 2013, at Avalon Manor in Merrillville, Indiana.   Father Gaza dedicated his life to becoming a priest from the time of his studies at Saints Peter and Paul School in Merrillville. Since then, he has not faltered in his commitment to God and to serving the people of his community, especially those most in need. He completed his higher education at Our Lady of the Lake Seminary in Wawasee, Indiana, Saint Meinrad College in Saint Meinrad, Indiana, and Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome. In 1968, Father Gaza was ordained a Catholic priest at Saint Peter's Basilica in Vatican City. Through his experiences as an instructor of religion at Bishop Noll Institute in Hammond, as well as his supervision of theological field education at the North American College in Rome, Father Gaza has contributed tremendously to the religious schooling of youth. These stand as just a few teaching experiences among his extensive contributions to the younger generation.   In 1992, Father Patrick Gaza became Pastor of Saints Monica and Luke Catholic Church. With his devoted guidance, the church has thrived in the community and has expanded its community outreach efforts. In 2007, Father Pat was also assigned Pastor of Saint Mark Catholic Church in Gary. Throughout the years, Father Gaza has served in various organizations throughout Northwest Indiana and Gary, including the LaPorte County FEMA Food Program, the Gary Ten Point Coalition, the Gary Urban Enterprise Association, the Gary branch of the NAACP, Rebuilding Together, and the Catholic Youth Organization. Father Gaza's involvement with these organizations evidences his absolute commitment to minister and tirelessly work and advocate on behalf of ``the least amongst us.'' Those who are without, those who suffer physically or are challenged physiologically, and those who need spiritual guidance have always found compassion, warmth, and a generosity of spirit in Father Pat. Father J. Patrick Gaza is a gifted, Godly, and good man. For his constant and passionate devotion to his God, his church and his flock, Father is worthy of our profound respect and gratitude.   Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring Father Patrick Gaza for his lifetime of leadership and selfless service to others. Saints Monica and Luke and Saint Mark Catholic Churches, the community of Gary, and all of Northwest Indiana have certainly been blessed by the good work of Father Gaza.                          ____________________
