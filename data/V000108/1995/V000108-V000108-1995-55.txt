Speaker, if NAFTA is such a great deal why are we bailing out Mexico?  We need answers and open debate on this and many other questions concerning the Mexican bailout.  It is just flat out wrong for at least 20 billion taxpayer dollars to be put at risk without congressional debate and action. Our willingness to duck--or even talk about--this tough political issue is an object failure of the Congress to meet its constitutional responsibilities.  Congress--not the President--controls the power of the purse and Congress needs to vigorously protect the taxpayers' money. That's why the Banking Committee should favorably and fully act on the resolution of inquiry so we can get some real answers.  Mr. Speaker, we're in the dark and the American people want answers. It's time for Congress to shine a bright light on the Mexican bailout.                          ____________________
