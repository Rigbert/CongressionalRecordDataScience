 President, briefly, I ask unanimous consent the package I just referred to in my remarks be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:    Senator McConnell's 6 Technical Changes Proposed--Agreement in                                Principal       1. Transfer of Excess Campaign Funds--Shays-Meehan      inadvertently eliminated unlimited transfers of excess      campaign funds to party committees.       Solution: Include ``without limitation'' for transfers of      excess funds so transfer will not be a ``personal use'' of      campaign funds.       2. Not Impact 2002 Run-Offs--Effective date is before run-     off elections are held.       Solution: Allow parties to operate under the current system      for any 2002 run-off elections.       3. Defined Soliciation--Federal candidates and      officeholders are heavily restricted in fundraising for state      candidates and party committees. For example, federal      candidates and officeholders could be banned from attending      fundraising events for state candidates.       Solution: Clearly define what we can and cannot do.       4. Time Limit for Special Judicial Review Procedures--     Plaintiffs around the country should not be forced to sue      only in D.C. District Court forever, with no circuit court      review (only option is discretionary appeal to the Supreme      Court--practically foreclosing appellate review).       Solution: Provide a time limit for exclusive jurisdiction      in D.C. District Court and lack of circuit court review.       5. Authorize Member Challenges--Shays-Meehan specifically      authorizes member intervention in a suit but does not      specifically authorize a member to challenge the new law.       Solution: Specifically authorize member challenges--parity      for challenging and intervening.       6. State Party Building Funds--State parties will have to      use hard dollars to pay for their buildings.       Solution: Clarify that state party building funds are      governed exclusively by state law.    Senator McConnell's 7 Technical Changes Proposed--Not Agreed to       1. Outside groups/State Party Parity       Shays-Meehan Empowers Outside Groups and Weakens State      Parties       Federal candidates and officeholders can raise soft money      for outside groups: unlimited for 501(c)s whose primary      purpose is not grassroots voter activities (could be used for      issue ads and voter activities) and $20,000 per individual      for any entity specifically for grassroots voter activities.      (Not in McCain-Feingold.)       But state party grassroots voter activities are restricted:      no party transfers, no joint fundraising, federal candidates      and officeholders can only raise hard money and state parties      can't use broadcast media for those activities. (Not in      McCain-Feingold.)       Solution: Return to McCain-Feingold language and raise soft      money limit to state parties from $10,000 to $20,000 to      achieve parity with fundraising for outside groups.       2. Coordination Prosecution--If a candidate raises money      for or meets with an outside group and that group engages in      voter registration or simply discusses legislation in the      candidate's state, the candidate may be civilly or even      criminally prosecuted.       Solution: Require a more precise coordination standard.       3. Index Contribution Limit To State Party. The limit is      increased but not indexed.       Solution: Index the hard dollar limit--critical to compete      with outside groups.       4. Permit Party Coordinated And Independent Expenditures.      Shays-Meehan treats all party committees (from national to      local parties) as a single committee. Prohibits all      committees from doing both coordinated expenditures and      independent expenditures after nomination by party (contrary      to S. Ct. ruling in Colorado I).       Solution: Do not treat all party committees as a single      committee and do not prohibit them from doing both      independent and coordinated party expenditures.       5. Do Not ``Federalize'' State Candidates--State candidates      may not mention federal candidates in an advertisement unless      they use hard dollars; state candidates doing GOTV activities      together must use hard dollars, and federal candidates and      officeholders are subject to the hard dollar limits and      restrictions in fundraising for state candidates.       Solution: Do not ``federalize'' state candidates.       6. Index PAC limit--The limit is not increased or indexed.       Solution: Index, but do not increase, hard dollar      contribution limits to and from PACs.       7. National Party Building Fund--Will be eliminated on 11/     06.       Solution: Allow parties to spend, not raise, building funds      until funds are depleted.  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent an analysis of changes proposed by Senator McConnell be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Analysis of Changes Proposed by Senator McConnell to Pending Campaign                        Finance Reform Legislation       Twelve specific changes to the McCain-Feingold/Shays-Meehan      bill have been proposed to Senator McCain. Incorporation of      any of these changes in the bill itself would kill the bill      by sending it to conference or back to the House.       Many of these changes are unacceptable substantive      revisions of the bill. Some of these changes would upset      bipartisan compromises made during floor consideration in the      Senate or decisions made on the House floor. Still others      would undermine central components of the reform effort,      particularly the soft money ban.       Some of the suggested changes are technical corrections      that are not necessary, but that could be addressed in a      separate technical corrections bill as long as it does not      interfere with the prompt enactment of the pending campaign      finance reform legislation.       Each of the amendments is discussed below. The headings for      the amendments are taken from the proposal given to Senator      McCain.       1. State Party/Outside Group Parity--This is a proposed      substantive change to the pending CFR legislation. It would      eliminate the changes made in the House that clarified      Senator Levin's amendment in order to prevent the amendment      from becoming a major loophole in the soft money ban.       Under the Levin amendment, state and local parties could      use up to $10,000 per year of a contribution from a      corporation, union, or individual, for generic get out the      vote activities (GOTV); GOTV for state and local candidates;      and voter registration within 120 days of an election      involving a federal candidate, so long as these activities do      not refer to a clearly identified candidate for federal      office. As passed by the Senate, the Levin amendment could      have been interpreted to allow federal officeholders to raise      these soft money funds, and to allow state parties to use      these soft money funds to finance broadcast ads.       Senator Levin was very clear on the Senate floor, however,      that he did not intend this soft money to be raised by      federal candidates or officeholders, and the House bill      clarifies this. Senator Levin also intended that the money be      used for grassroots activities, and the House bill clarifies      this as well. On the Senate floor, Senator Levin explained      that his amendment:       ``These are dollars not raised through any effort on the      part of Federal officeholders, Federal candidates, or      national parties. These are non-Federal dollars allowed by      state law.       Senator Levin further said:       ``[This provision] will allow the use of some non-Federal      dollars by state parties for voter registration and get out      the vote, where the contributions are allowed by state law,      where there is no reference to federal candidates, where      limited to $10,000 of the contribution which is allowed by      state law, and where the allocation between federal and non-     Federal dollars is set by the federal election commission.''       The proposed revision would eliminate these clarifying      provisions.       The House bill also added restrictions on joint fund-     raising to prevent solicitations of large sums from a single      donor, and restrictions on transfers of monies for Levin      activities to state and local party committees to help      prevent the federal soft money system from being shifted to      the state level. The proposed revision would eliminate these      protections.       The proposed revision would also double the amount of soft      money that state parties can use from contributions provided      by corporations, unions, or individuals for the authorized      GOTV and voter registration activities. This would increase      the $10,000 per year limit contained in both the House and      Senate-passed bills to $20,000 per year. The $10,000 limit is      the same as the limit that applies to hard money donations by      individuals to state parties under the bill. Thus, under the      bill, an individual donor can already give a total of $20,000      per year to a state party that can be used for voter      activities, the same amount that federal candidates can      solicit for outside groups for use on these activities.       2. Contribution Limit to State Parties--The proposal      suggests indexing the amount that individuals can contribute      to state parties. The decision not to index this amount was      part of difficult bipartisan negotiations during Senate      consideration of the bill that led to a package of increases      in contribution     limits approved by the Senate. The only change in this      provision made by the House was to increase the aggregate      limits.       3. Hard Dollar Candidate Support by Parties--This is a      proposed substantive change to the pending CFR legislation.      The proposal would allow parties to make both independent and      coordinated expenditures in individual races.       The requirement that the parties choose between these      expenditures was contained in both the Senate and House-     passed bills and is not inconsistent with the Colorado I      decision. For purposes of this provision only, national and      state party committees are treated as a single entity.      Otherwise, the provision would not be effective because, for      example, a national party could choose to make coordinated      expenditures, and then transfer additional funds to a local      party to use for independent expenditures.       Parties should not be able to claim that they are      independent of one of their candidates if, during the general      election period, they are making coordinated expenditures      with that same candidate under section 441a(d) of the FECA.      Permitting both coordinated and independent expenditures by a      party makes meaningless the coordinated spending limits      recently upheld by the Supreme Court in Colorado II.      Furthermore, since the bill provides that the choice between      making independent or coordinated expenditures is made by the      party only after a candidate is nominated, the national party      will be able to control the decision of which kind of      spending to undertake. In addition, contrary to the claim      made in the proposal, there is no general restriction on      transferring hard money between national and state parties.       4. Excess Campaign Funds--This is a proposed technical      clarification. The proposal seeks to add the words ``without      limitation'' to the portion of the personal use provision of      the bill that deals with transfers of excess campaign funds      by candidates to political parties.       There was no intention to change longstanding federal      election law that permits candidates to transfer excess      campaign funds without limitation to their parties. This can      be clarified in a colloquy or in a technical corrections bill      if there is one.       5. PAC Contribution Limit--This is a proposed substantive      change. The proposal would index the limits on how much can      be contributed to and from PACs.       Increasing or indexing PAC contribution limits was      considered and rejected in bipartisan negotiations on      contribution limits during Senate consideration of the bill.      The decision represents a position that the role of PACs in      financing elections should not be increased. The Senate      agreement was not changed in the House.       6. 2002 Run-off Elections Unfairly Impacted--This is a      proposed substantive change to the pending CFR legislation.      The proposed revision suggests changing the effective date      with respect to runoff elections. This would allow soft money      to be raised after November 5, 2002.       In deciding to delay the effective date of the bill so that      it would not apply to the 2002 elections, a very clear      decision was made that no soft money should be raised after      election day. With respect to other provisions of the bill,      such as the spending of excess soft money and electioneering      communications, the suggestion that the bill not apply to      runoff elections related to the 2002 elections can be dealt      with in a floor colloquy or in a technical corrections bill      if there is one.       7. Building Fund--The proposal has two parts. One is a      substantive change, the other is not. The substantive change      would allow the national parties to spend their excess soft      money on buildings without any time limitation. The non-     substantive portion of the proposal would make clear that      state party building funds are governed solely by state law.       A provision allowing the national parties to spend their      excess soft money on buildings was included in the House bill      that went to the floor. It was vigorously attacked by the      Republican leadership in the House, which claimed that it was      a special advantage for the DNC. The provision was stripped      from the bill by an amendment on the House floor that was      overwhelmingly supported by Republicans. The Senate bill      contained no special exemptions for national party buildings.       There is nothing in the House-passed bill that regulates      state party building funds. This concern can be addressed in      a floor colloquy, or a separate technical corrections bill if      there is one.       8. Ensure Unintended Litigation Does Not Result--This is a      substantive proposal that has two parts. The first part      suggests defining ``solicitation.'' Separately, the proposal      would eliminate the increase in the statute of limitations      from three to five years that was added to the bill by the      Thompson-Lieberman amendment.       Like many other terms in the bill, ``solicitation'' will be      subject to definition by the FEC in regulations. A statutory      definition could also be included in a separate technical      corrections bill if there is one and if agreement on the      definition of the term can be reached.       The increase in the statute of limitations from three to      five years resulted from Senators Thompson and Lieberman's      concern that wrongdoing in the 1996 election was not being      effectively pursued by the Justice Department. A five year      statute of limitations is common in the federal criminal law.      Both the House and Senate bills lengthened the statute of      limitations and did not contain a definition of solicitation.      No question about either of these issues was raised during      floor consideration in either body.       9. Coordination--This is a substantive proposal. The      proposal claims to offer ``modest changes'', but in fact      would make significant changes to coordination language that      was passed by the Senate, and included in the House bill.       Contrary to the proposal's claim, the bill does not provide      a new definition of ``coordination.'' The bill repeals      recently adopted FEC regulations on coordination and directs      the FEC to issue new regulations. It requires the FEC to      address certain topics in the rulemaking, but does not      dictate what the FEC should decide. The bill also specifies      that ``agreement'' or ``formal collaboration'' are not      required for coordination to exist.       This direction is given because the current regulations      allow blatant coordination to occur between candidates and      outside groups in issue ads and other campaign-related      activities simply by never entering into an ``agreement'' or      ``formal collaboration.''       Contrary to the suggestion in the proposal, nothing in the      bill even remotely suggests that a candidate's raising money      for a group would alone trigger a finding that the group's      spending on voter registration activity is coordinated with      the candidate.       10. Effect on State Candidates--The proposal suggests a      non-substantive, but unnecessary change. The proposal seeks      to clarify that state candidates may ``align themselves''      with federal candidates in their solicitations and campaign      activities, including advertisements.       The bill already permits state candidates to publicize      endorsements from federal candidates or align themselves with      a federal candidate's views. However, the bill prohibits      state candidates from spending soft money to promote or      attack federal candidates through general public political      advertising.       11. Time Limit For Expedited Judicial Review--The proposal      seeks to limit the expedited judicial review provision of the      bill to suits brought shortly after enactment.       The expedited review provisions in the Senate and House-     passed bills were not limited in this way. The expedited      review provisions assure that decisions that could affect      ongoing campaigns will be made promptly. These provisions      will be useful even years after enactment.       By requiring all suits challenging the constitutionality of      the bill to be brought in the District of Columbia, the bill      avoids the conflicts between the circuit courts that have      created uncertainty in current law. The provision also      requires these cases to be heard by three-judge panels. Given      the importance of the election law to campaigns, there is no      reason to force suits to be brought within a specific time      period after enactment in order to qualify for expedited      treatment. The Supreme Court can summarily affirm the lower      court's decision if it chooses, so this provision need not be      a burden on the Court's docket.       If agreement can be reached on revised judicial review      procedures, it can be included in a technical corrections      bill if there is one.       12. Court Challenges--The proposal would give Members of      Congress a statutory right to challenge the campaign finance      reform law directly.       The existing intervention provisions of the bill give      Members of Congress on both sides of the issue the ability to      participate equally in litigation concerning the      constitutionality of the Act. Members of Congress may already      have standing to challenge the Act in court, and Congress      cannot grant constitutional standing where it does not      already exist. Issues relating to standing by members could      be addressed in a separate technical corrections bill if      there is one, as long as members on both sides of the issue      are treated similarly.                          ____________________
