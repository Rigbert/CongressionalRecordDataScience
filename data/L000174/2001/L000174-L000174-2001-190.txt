I am hoping they are going to be cleared by the end of the day, I tell the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia.  Again, as he knows, he having let us use his office as temporary quarters for hearings, we have been operating under some difficulty. A lot of our paperwork is in the Judiciary Committee rooms in Dirksen or in my office in the Russell Building. Normally, I could answer his question immediately.  I asked this morning that we make sure they are cleared. I know they want to get them in West Virginia. I know they have been approved by the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia and by his colleague. I am hoping that we can have them cleared quickly.  Incidentally, nominations were reported last Thursday after most of the Capitol closed down. We were still able to get a quorum because of the Members who stayed in town so we could report them, even though we had recommendations from the other side to get out of here. I appreciate those Senators who stayed so we could get that quorum and get them out.  Again, I appreciate the Senator from West Virginia in allowing us the use of his office. We had a number of judicial nominations that came up. Virtually all Republican Senators took the time to come to introduce their judicial nominees. I appreciate that, too.
