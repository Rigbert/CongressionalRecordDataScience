Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, again I want to thank the gentleman from California [Mr. Miller] and all those who have worked very hard on this legislation. It is not everything I wanted. As I stressed before, we will be back. MacArthur said that, and he came back, and I will come back with a bigger and better army, and we will achieve those goals.  I think it is important to understand one thing. There is little in this bill for this chairman. Most of this is, very frankly, in areas that passed the House, and as the gentlewoman from San Francisco said, this is a strong train with the Presidio, but most all of this legislation already passed the House.  It is the unworkable situation that occurs in the other body, where the holds can be put on and on and on, that really, I think, hurts the process. Somewhere and somehow we have to expedite that process so when the House speaks, at least there should be a time limit to return the bill to the floor. It is unfair to tie everything, very frankly, to one horse. It is not the correct way to legislate. We have donethat. Hopefully the Senate will see the wisdom of adopting it, and we will go on next year and hope to do bigger and greater things.
