Speaker, reclaiming my time, I will take a back seat to no one. You, Mr. Leader, the gentleman from California (Mr. Hunter), or anybody else in this House on support of the troops, support of our efforts, and support of this country, period. But we do see things differently, Mr. Leader.  I think I have a reputation in this body of being able to work in a bipartisan fashion with the speaker, with the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ney) with whom I worked as ranking member on the Committee on House Administration, with the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Blunt), and with others.                              {time}  1530  And, yes, Mr. Leader, with you on some very issues of great importance to this institution. And I continue to be in that posture, but, yes, we do see it differently. The leader got, at 10 p.m. last night, the opportunity to review this in a meaningful way  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield?
