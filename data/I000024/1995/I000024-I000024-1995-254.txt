It was not my intention to use so much of the Senator's time.  I can only say, I am going to catch a plane. I am going back to Oklahoma where real people are, where the people spoke loudly and clearly in the November 8 election when they said: We want to downsize the scope of Government; we do not want to have Government involved in our lives to the degree that Government now is involved.  You and I probably will disagree philosophically with the role of Government. But the bottom line is, and I say it one last time, we have demonstrated we cannot do it, that either we cannot or will not do it.  I have not given up. I would like to serve notice to everyone in this Chamber, I believe we will get that one additional vote because the people are now identifying what is going on in this country and they are going to be heard.  I have the utmost respect for the Senator from West Virginia, but I suggest if you take a trip back to West Virginia, you will hear the same thing there.  Thank you.
