 President, while I have the floor, I want to turn quickly to a different topic, and that is on the issue of education and class size.  I know my colleagues have watched me come to the floor and talk numerous times about how important it is that we reduce class sizes in the grades of 1 through 3. I have talked about the research in this country which has shown that reducing class size makes a difference for our students.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a report from Tennessee that has just come out. It is called the Star Report.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                      [From the Project STAR News]            Benefits of Small Classes Pay Off at Graduation   project star finds small classes in K-3 linked to greater student   achievement, better grades, lower dropout rates, and higher college                               aspirations       Washington, D.C.--A ground-breaking Tennessee-based class      size study has found that public school students placed in      small classes in grades K-3 continue to outperform students      in larger classes right through high school graduation.       Researchers for Project STAR (Student/Teacher Achievement      Ratio)--whose earlier findings helped form the basis for      class size reduction in some 20 states--today reported that      students placed in small class sizes in grades K-3 have      better high school graduation rates, higher grade point      averages, and are more inclined to pursue higher education.       ``This research adds to the evidence we have compiled over      the past 14 years,'' said Dr. Helen Pate-Bain, who convinced      the Tennessee state legislature to provide funding for the      initial STAR research. ``The project's findings indicate that      students placed in small classes in grades K-3 continue to      benefit from that experience in grades 4-12.''       The original STAR research tracked the progress of an      average of 6,500 students each year in 79 schools between      1985 and 1989 (and 11,600 students overall). It found that      children who attended small classes (13-17 pupils per      teacher) in kindergarten through grade 3 outperformed      students in larger classes (22-25 pupils) in both reading and      math on the Stanford Achievement Test for elementary      students. The second phase of the STAR research found that      even after returning to larger classes in grade 4, STAR's      small class students continued to outperform their peers who      had been in larger class sizes.       At a news conference held today at the National Press Club,      STAR researchers released a new wave of findings:       Students in small classes are more likely to pursue      college: STAR students who attended small classes--and black      students in that group in particular--were more likely to      take the ACT or SAT college entrance exams, according to      Princeton University economist Dr. Alan B. Krueger, who      researched test data linked to the Project STAR database.      ``Attendance in small classes appears to have cut the black-     white gap in the probability of taking college-entrance exam      by more than half,'' Krueger said.       Small classes lead to higher graduation rates: Preliminary      data from participating STAR school districts in Tennessee      show that students in small classes were more likely to      graduate on schedule; they were less likely to drop out of      high school; and they were more likely to graduate in the top      25% of their classes, according to Dr. Jayne Boyd-Zaharias, a      STAR researcher since 1986. In addition. Boyd-Zaharias found      that small class students graduated with higher grade point      averages (GPAs) than regular class size students.       Students in small classes achieve at higher levels: Three      other reearchers--Dr. Jeremy D. Finn, professor of education      at SUNY Buffalo, Susan B. Gerber of SUNY Buffalo, and Charles      M. Achilles, Ed.D., of Eastern Michigan University, together      with Boyd-Zaharias--released new findings showing that STAR      students who attended small classes in grades K-3 were      between 6 and 13 months ahead of their regular-class peers in      math, reading, and science in each of grades 4, 6, and 8.      ``Our analyses show that at least three years in a small      class are necessary in order for the benefits to be sustained      through later grades,'' wrote the researchers. ``Further, the      benefits of having been in a small class in the primary years      generally increase from grade to grade.''       Class size is different from pupil/teacher ratio: Achilles,      one of the original STAR researchers, explained the      difference between class size (the number of students      assigned to a teacher) and pupil/teacher ratio (the total      number of students divided by the total number of educators      in a school). Many ``class size'' studies, he noted, have      relied on pupil/teacher ratios to make their case. The STAR      research is able to track students based on specific class      size. Achilles noted that some 20 states--including Michigan,      California, Nevada, Florida, Texas, Utah, Illinois, Indiana,      New York, Oklahoma, Iowa, Minnesota, Massachusetts, South      Carolina, and Wisconsin--have initiated or considered STAR-     like class size reduction efforts.       Teachers who taught small classes in Project STAR support      the program strongly.       ``All educators instinctively know that the smaller the      class size, the more individual attention a teacher can      provide a student,'' said Sandy Heinrich, a teacher at      Granbery Elementary School in Davidson County, Tenn., who      taught first grade in the STAR program in 1986. ``The more      individual attention per student, the more learning and      personal growth each student can enjoy. I was     fortunate enough to witness this notion first-hand.''       The STAR research is the only large-scale, long-term class      size research of its kind. Dr. Frederick Mosteller, a      professor of mathematical statistics at Harvard University,      said this about STAR in 1995: ``Because a controlled      education experiment (as distinct from a sample survey) of      this quality, magnitude, and duration is a rarity, it is      important that both educators and policymakers have access to      its statistical information and understand its      implications.''       In fact, the STAR research provided support for federal      legislation that proposes to reduce class sizes by hiring      100,000 new teachers in grades K-3 nationwide.       Last fall, Congress appropriated $1.2 billion in the FY      1999 federal budget as a ``down-payment'' on that      legislation, enough to hire approximately 30,000 teachers for      one year. Future funding will require congressional      authorization and additional annual appropriations. Pate-Bain      was scheduled to share the new STAR findings with a number of      education policy experts and Members of Congress later in the      day.
