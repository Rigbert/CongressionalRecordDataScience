 President, the Senator from West Virginia has very well described what his amendment does, and that description in itself gives the reasons why we should be against it.  No. 1, it would deny the death tax relief this bill provides with a credit up to $4 million to help the estates from paying the estate tax.  This will also be a massive tax increase compared to the bill before us because it eliminates all relief in marginal rates except for the 10-percent rate. And also it would eliminate the entire estate tax amendments we have.  Also, I believe this amendment is not germane, and I raise the point of germaneness on a reconciliation measure because it does not comply with section 305(b)(2) of the Budget Act.
