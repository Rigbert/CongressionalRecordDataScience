 This is an important Convention and I assure you that from my point of view this new Convention on the Worst Forms of Child Labor should be a high priority. I am aware that this Convention pertains to abolishing child slavery, child prostitution and other hazardous work endangering a child's well-being. Therefore, I will work with the Chairman of the Committee to try to bring this treaty before the Committee as soon as practical after it is submitted by the President.                          ____________________
