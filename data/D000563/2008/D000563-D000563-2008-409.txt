On the vote tomorrow, we need one more Republican Senator to join in this effort. We hope Senator McCain will be back. I don't know Senator McCain's position on this issue. I hope he is for Medicare. I hope he is against this physician Medicare cut. It is time for Senator McCain to make his position clear and return to the Senate for this critically important vote, this historic vote. We want to make sure tomorrow that Medicare's future is bright. We have confidence that the doctors will be reimbursed and that seniors across America can receive their Medicare services without fear of having them cut off. We need John McCain on the Senate floor tomorrow. We need to make sure we have enough Republican votes tomorrow to make this bipartisan measure the same success in the Senate as it was in the House.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
