 Speaker, for the benefit of my colleagues I would like to have printed in the Record this statement by a high school student from Vermont, who was speaking at my recent town meeting on issues facing young people.       Ms. Hayes. Writer Justice Conrad said the artist appeals to      that part of our being which is not dependent on wisdom, to      that in us which is a gift and not an acquisition and,      therefore, more permanently enduring. He speaks to our      capacity to delight, for delight and wonder, to the sense of      mystery surrounding our lives, to our sense of pity, beauty      and pain.       The arts cross geographical, ethnic and socioeconomic      barriers to enter into the lives of both children and adults.      The arts are the heritage we leave to our children and a      vital arts environment helps the economic development of this      country. You may not know it, but attendance there shows that      throughout the United States more people attend art      galleries, museums, ballet, theater, opera and symphony      concerts in a year than go to all the major professional      sports combined. That's good box office, it's good business      and it's good for the country.       In particular, I know how important funding is to the arts      and the joy and happiness that exposure to arts brings to our      residents. For the past six years I have performed in a      traveling youth circus that has brought the thrill and antics      of the big top to communities throughout New England. Our      performances cross all age barriers. The child, the teenager      and adults alike all share in the excitement of seeing live      performances. If funding disappears, how will we provide that      experience of such entertainment to the thousands of      Vermonters who cannot travel to the big top in New York?       I've heard people suggest that the Government has no role      in supporting the arts and humanities yet in Europe,      governments recognize that arts are part of the economy and      add essential vitality to modern life. Most European      countries support their museums, orchestras, dancers, poets      and visual artists to a far greater degree than the U.S.      Government has ever done. With the creation of the National      Endowment for the Arts in the 1960s, we took a step forward      in providing a rich cultural advantage to all citizens. Now      in the 1990s we are faced with the attacks by foes who are      picking insignificant battles and efforts to undermine the      support of the arts.       With cuts up to 40 percent survival is paramount. The focus      on funding public arts programs will be on the projects of      very wide public appeal and accessibility. Gone will be the      funding for public programs of great scholarly significance      but smaller audience draw. The proposals to shrink government      by severely reducing or eliminating funds for the National      Endowment for the Arts is also a move of far-reaching effects      on the strength of all art programs.       There are creative ways to fund the arts. In my research      I've discovered many new and innovative ways already      successful on the state level. In particular, I believe we      need to take a look at endowment funds, income tax check-offs      and lotteries. Together with local initiatives, we can      guarantee support for the arts. Just look at what some state      initiatives are, license plate programs, corporate filing      fees, special tax districts, local option taxes earmarked for      the arts and bond issues.       Endowment funds offer long-term investment opportunities      for the arts by using interest only to fund current affairs.      Should we offer our wealthy citizens a tax haven through      contributions to the arts endowment, we will build up a      significant amount to fund the arts well into the next      century. Just like the presidential campaign check-     offs, let's allow our citizenry to express their support for      the arts through a voluntary contribution of their tax refund      to such a worthwhile cause.       I propose to further these ideas through a regional      petition drive urging Congress to support funding for the      National Endowment for the Arts.       I believe I recognize the problems that are going on within      the United States, but I also believe that the arts provide a      fundamental part of life. You can't really experience life      without experiencing the arts because they really show the      true human emotion and no human can live without emotion. I      believe we can fund it through a number of the things that I      listed which were the endowment funds and such, and I believe      that if we really try, we can find funding for it if we      realize that it is such an important part of our life.       At Burr & Burton we've been provided a lot of educational      things that have helped us out. We've had some dancers that      have come, some drummers. We've also had plays that have been      put on here in the Smith Center for us and I believe that      it's been an important part of our school life. It helps us      to just know that there's more out there than what we see      every day.       I believe that art is subjective and if the person that      didn't like it should also recognize that now he knows what      he doesn't like and he knows that--what true art is now. He      knows what he likes to look for and he also knows what he      will never see again, so it is also enriching his life.       I believe that everyone should have the right to go see it      if they want to. If they're not funded, then they may not be      wide for public appeal and you may not even if you wanted to      have the chance to go see it. You have the choice not to go      see it and that's your choice, but by federal funding, it      allows the people who may not be able to go see it. Like some      people can't get up to New York to see the plays and      everything and this brings it home to Vermont so everyone is      allowed the equal opportunity to see these things.                               ____________________
