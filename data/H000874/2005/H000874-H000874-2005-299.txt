Speaker, reclaiming my time. I thank the leader for that observation and information.  I would urge the leader, as we bring additional bills to the floor, that we give the opportunity to have these bills fully considered by the floor. We want to move them. We want to move them quickly.  The overwhelming majority of us on both sides of the aisle have voted for all of the bills that you just referenced on the theory, as you said, that we need to move ahead on the Pell Grants and TANF and on the dollars themselves, on liability issues.  But the failure to give full consideration to them, assuming full consideration does not mean days and weeks delay but a full day of consideration of these pieces of legislation, we believe is appropriate, particularly if we deal with another very large money bill.  We hope it goes through committee, and we hope it comes to the floor with an opportunity for Members to make suggestions in forms of amendment, either cutting or adding or shifting, as the case may be, those resources. Because we think that is, you know, the theory of the process is, our collective judgments are better than our individual judgments. And that is what democracy is.                              {time}  1730  Mr. DeLAY. The gentleman is absolutely right, and I hope Members will pay attention to this unusual process that we are using. The gentleman is right. To what extent we can, we ought to use regular order, but these are unusual times. And there are things that need to be done immediately. And I do not think the people that have been devastated by this disaster want us to wait a week to vet things and that kind of stuff, particularly if you were one of those students that was trying to get into another university and could not transfer your Pell grant to that other university. I think they are appreciating that we are trying to move as quickly as possible so they can do that. That is just one example of many examples.  The point is that we are trying to do this in a bipartisan way. If there are ranking members that are not being consulted, then I want to hear about it. Members should understand that we are trying to get it out to the Members and we are more than willing to hear anything from anybody, so they should be working through their ranking member and on our side of the aisle, their full committee chairman. But there are some things that we need to get to the floor as quickly as possible.  At any rate, it is taking several days to get these bills done so Members havean opportunity to participate and have their input. We are going regular order on most of the bills, but there are some that need attention immediately; and that is why we moved quickly in consultation and cooperation with the other side of the aisle. And we thought these were all bills that had everybody's consent because we even checked with the Senate, we checked with the administration, and we thought these bills could move quickly. Unfortunately, the Senate sees it differently.
