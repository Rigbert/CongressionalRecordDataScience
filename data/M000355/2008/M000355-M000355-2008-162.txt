 President, I notice my good friend from Nevada did not mention T. Boone Pickens' views on whether speculation is a part of the problem. Republicans are perfectly happy to have a speculation component of the overall issue. But if we are in the business of quoting T. Boone Pickens, I had a chance to meet with him for an hour on Monday. He told me, without equivocation, he did not think speculation had anything to do with this particular runup. I do not know whether it does. I think most of my Members are in favor of transparency. We want to put more cops on the beat to make sure the markets are working properly. But if we are quoting Pickens, I am sure I will be safe in saying Pickens would not be voting for this bill that the majority leader thinks is the way we ought to go.  Right now in Lexington, KY, and Las Vegas, NV, and every other city and town across the country, Americans are hurting from high gas prices. Right now, there is a man watching his hard-earned paycheck go into his gas tank instead of his daughter's college fund. That man doesn't care about cloture motions or second-degree amendments; he wants Congress to do something. He wants us to act.  We have all heard the frustrations from constituents literally for months.
