 There's one agency of the Federal Government that has never been audited--and is unauditable. It happens to be the Department of Defense.  Last year, Representative Garrett and I snuck up on them with a little amendment in the appropriations bill to require an audit of the Pentagon. It's not too much to ask when they spend $600 billion a year, none of which they can meaningfully account for according to the GAO. They can't reconcile their books. It was stripped out in the conference committee. Senator Ayotte from New Hampshire got one in the authorization bill. It was stripped out in the conference committee.  Now this time they're acting proactively. They're prohibiting us from bringing an amendment to the floor of the House that would require--and we're letting up on them a little bit--that 3 years from now the Department of Defense--that's $1.8 trillion from now--should have to pass an audit. And they're saying no, no, no, no. They can't be required to do an audit until they spend $3.6 trillion in the year 2017.  This is an abuse of the American taxpayer and an abuse of our servicemen and -women. The waste that goes on at the Pentagon has to stop. We need a meaningful audit.
