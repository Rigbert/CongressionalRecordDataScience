L. 107-204, of which I was the primary author along with my good friend from Utah, Senator Hatch. Title IX was derivedfrom S. 2717, the ``White-Collar Crime Penalty Enhancement Act of 2002,'' which I introduced with Senator Hatch on July 10, 2002. That same day, Senator Hatch and I offered the text of S. 2717 as a floor amendment to the Public Company Accounting Reform and Investment Protection Act of 2002, S. 2673. Our amendment was unanimously adopted by the Senate on July 10, 2002, by a 96-0 vote. S. 2673 was overwhelmingly approved, as amended with the inclusion of S. 2717, on July 15, 2002, by a vote of 97-0. S. 2673 then went to a House-Senate conference. The Biden-Hatch amendment was retained in the final conference report as Title IX, and in substantially identical form to that in S. 2673. The conference report, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, H.R. 3763, was passed by the Senate on July 25, 2002, by a 99-0 vote. The President signed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act into law on July 30, 2002.  As I mentioned, Title IX of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, entitled the ``White-Collar Crime Penalty Enhancement Act of 2002,'' closely mirrors the original S. 2717. In order to provide guidance in the legal interpretation of these provisions, I have compiled the following analysis and discussion, which are intended to augment, and not supplant, the legislative history and explanatory statements that accompanied passage of H.R. 3763. This legislative history is intended also to supplement my remarks at the time of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act's final passage. See S7426-S7425 (July 26, 2002). I ask unanimous consent that this section-by-section analysis be included in the Congressional Record as part of the official legislative history of these provisions.  The content of Title IX was developed partly in response to a series of white-collar crime hearings I held in my capacity as Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs. Through those hearings, the subcommittee heard from a wide range of witnesses with expertise in both corporate law and white-collar crime--including current and former high-ranking officials from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the United States Departments of Justice and Treasury, and the Federal Reserve; business and law professors; corporate practitioners; as well as victims of corporate fraud.  The first hearing, held on June 19, 2002, focused on the disparity in sentences between white-collar offenses, including pension fraud, and federal ``street crimes'' like car theft. Specifically, the hearing explored four broad areas: it focused on the human consequences of white-collar crimes; defined and quantified the problem, including an evaluation of the use of the criminal sanction against white-collar criminals and the severity of penalties typically imposed; explored the reasons that might explain the lighter sentences that white-collar offenders often receive; and discussed recent amendments to the federal sentencing guidelines that purport to address the historic, disparate treatment of economic crimes. The first-panel witnesses included Charles Prestwood, a retiree who lost his retirement savings in the bankruptcy of the Enron Corporation; Janice Farmer, a retiree who similarly lost her retirement savings in the Enron bankruptcy; and Howard Deputy, a former employee of the Metachem Company in Delaware who was at risk of losing a portion of his pension in Metachem's bankruptcy. The second-panel witnesses included James B. Comey, United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York; Glen B. Gainer, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the National White Collar Crime Center and West Virginia State Auditor; Bradley Skolnik, Chief of the Enforcement Section of the North American Securities Administrators Association and Securities Commissioner for the State of Indiana; Frank O. Bowman, Associate Law Professor at the University of Indiana School of Law; and Paul Rosenzweig, Senior Legal Research Fellow at the Heritage Foundation.  The second hearing, held on July 10, 2002, also addressed the adequacy of criminal penalties for white-collar crimes and evaluated the use of the criminal sanction to deter wrongdoing and encourage corporate responsibility. We were particularly interested in learning whether the current federal criminal law, as opposed to civil enforcement mechanisms, was sufficient to address the range of corporate scandals that were then unfolding. Specifically, the hearing addressed the issue through the lense of the recent accounting scandals--exploring the pattern of corporate irresponsibility and the cultural and economic conditions that made the scandals possible; the impact of the scandals on investor confidence and economic health; and the need for investor protection and anti-fraud legislation which includes stiffened criminal penalties. The first-panel witnesses included Michael Chertoff, Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division at the United States Department of Justice; and William W. Mercer, United States Attorney for the District of Montana and head of the United States Attorneys' White-Collar Crime Working Group. The second-panel witnesses included John C. Coffee, Jr., Adolf A. Berle Professor of Law at Columbia University School of Law; Thomas Donaldson, Mark O. Winkelman Professor at the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania; Charles M. Elson, Edgar S. Woolard, Jr. Chair at the Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware; George Terwilliger, former Deputy Attorney General at the United States Department of Justice; and Tom Devine, Legal Director at the Government Accountability Project.  The third hearing, held on July 24, 2002, continued the discussion initiated in the earlier hearings and featured three former, high-ranking officials in the Executive Branch who commented on a host of suggested reforms--including S. 2717 which, by that time, had been amended to the Senate precursor to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (the Public Company Accounting Reform and Investment Protection Act of 2002, S. 2673). The witnesses included G. William Miller, former Secretary of the Treasury under President Carter and former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board; Roderick Hills, former Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission under President Ford; and James Doty, former General Counsel to the Securities and Exchange Commission and head of the corporate and securities practice at Baker Botts LLP.  On a final note, the legislation was introduced and subsequently enacted against the backdrop of the Sentencing Commission's ongoing efforts in the area of economic crime. We are aware of the ``Economic Crime Package,'' which was approved by the Commission in April 2001 and went into effect in November 2001. These amendments to the federal sentencing guidelines consolidated the guidelines for theft, property destruction, and fraud offenses; revised the definition of ``loss,'' which largely informs the range of sentencing available for an offense; increased penalties for offenses involving moderate and high-dollar losses and reduced penalties on some lower-level offenses; and revised the loss table for tax offenses to provide for higher penalty levels for offenses involving moderate and high tax losses. Title IX was developed and enacted with full awareness of these new amendments to the guidelines.  I ask unanimous consent that the section-by-section analysis be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:Section-By-Section Analysis and Discussion of the ``White-Collar Crime        Penalty Enhancements Act of 2002'' (Title IX of H.R. 3763)     Section 901. Short Title       This section designates this title of the Act as the      ``White-Collar Crime Penalty Enhancement Act of 2002.''     Section 902. Attempts and Conspiracies To Commit Criminal          Fraud Offenses       This section adds a new provision to the United States Code      (18 U.S.C. Sec. 1349), which indicates that any person who      attempts or conspires to commit a fraud offense under Chapter      63 of Title 18 (in other words, 18 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1341-     1348) shall face the same penalties as those provided for in      the predicate, or underlying, offense that was the object of      the attempt or the conspiracy. (While 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2      currently provides for the same penalties for aiding and      abetting offenses as the predicate crimes, prosecution under      that section requires the government to prove some      affirmative act by the defendant. In contrast, prosecution      under Section 902 requires no affirmative act, but only an      agreement to commit a future crime, as is the case with 18      U.S.C. Sec. 371.)       During hearings by the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and      Drugs on the ``penalty gap'' between white-collar offenses      and     other federal crimes, we observed that defendants charged      with conspiracy pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Sec. 371 were afforded      a potential windfall in terms of their sentence, vis-a-vis      their co-defendants who were convicted of the actual      offenses. That windfall resulted because the charge of      conspiracy under Section 371 only subjects a convicted      individual to a maximum imprisonment term of 5 years. In      contrast, certain fraud offenses in Chapter 63 carry maximum      penalties of up to 30 years imprisonment, e.g., 18 U.S.C.      Sec. 1344 (imposing up to 30 years imprisonment for bank      fraud). In the case of a particularly egregious bank fraud      case, then, one co-defendant could receive a 30-year sentence      while an equally culpable co-conspirator would receive only a      5-year sentence.       Congress responded by creating a new Section 1349 for      defendants who attempt or conspire to commit a financial      fraud under Chapter 63 of Title 18. The Justice Department      may now elect to charge a fraud conspirator under this new      section, rather than pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Sec. 371, thereby      preserving the same maximum penalties. In enacting this new      section, we harmonize the penalties for financial fraud      conspiracy with those of narcotics offenses. See 21 U.S.C.      Sec. 846 (``[a]ny person who attempts or conspires to commit      any [narcotics] offense defined in this subchapter shall be      subject to the same penalties as those prescribed for the      offense, the commission of which was the object of the      attempt or conspiracy.'')     Section 903. Criminal Penalties for Mail and Wire Fraud       This section increases the potential maximum term of      imprisonment available upon conviction for mail fraud (18      U.S.C. Sec. 1341) or wire fraud (18 U.S.C. Sec. 1343) from 5      years to 20 years. Fraud affecting financial institutions in      both Sections 1341 and 1343 of Title 18 is unaffected by this      section, so the potential maximum term of imprisonment for      this offense remains 30 years.       By raising the criminal penalties for Sections 1341 and      1343, we intended to harmonize the penalties for mail and      wire fraud with the penalties for other serious financial      crimes. See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1348 (25-year maximum      penalty for securities fraud); 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1956(a)(3)(A)      (20-year maximum penalty for money laundering); 18 U.S.C.      1962 (20-year maximum penalty for racketeering). In addition,      we intended to ensure that the penalty structure for these      offenses was sufficiently stiff to provide a real deterrent      effect. As support for that aim, the Subcommittee on Crime      and Drugs heard testimony from several witnesses who insisted      that (1) these federal penalties should be toughened; and (2)      in order to deter misconduct, offenders should be subject to      some amount of actual incarceration.       For example, the Honorable James B. Comey, Jr., the United      States Attorney for the Southern District of New York,      observed that ``[w]hite collar criminals have broken serious      laws, done grave harm to real people . . . [and] should be      subject to the same serious treatment that we accord all      serious crimes: substantial periods of incarceration. While      we have made significant progress on some issues in recent      years, especially in improving the applicable sentencing      guidelines, we believe that current federal penalties for      white collar offenses should be toughened.'' Testimony of      Comey before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and      Drugs, June 19, 2002, p. 2. He continued: ``[E]nforcement can      be undermined when criminals perceive the risk of      incarceration as minimal and view fines and probation merely      as a cost of doing their criminal business. We believe that      if it is unmistakable that the automatic consequence for one      who commits a significant white collar offense is prison,      then many will be deterred. . . . [White collar criminals]      commit their crimes not in a fit of passion, but with      cold, careful calculation. Accordingly, they are the most      rational offenders and are more likely than most to weigh      the risks of possible courses of action against the      anticipated rewards of criminal behavior.'' Testimony of      Comey before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime      and Drugs, June 19, 2002, p. 4.       The Honorable Michael Chertoff, Assistant Attorney General      for the Criminal Division at the United States Department of      Justice, echoed this sentiment: ``We believe that strong      enforcement and tough penalties are especially important in      the context of white collar crimes, because business      criminals act with calculation rather than in a fit of anger      or compulsion. Because white collar criminals act more      rationally than most other criminals, they can more easily be      deterred. In our experience, one thing is crystal clear:      businessmen and women want to avoid jail at any cost. If      their calculus includes a reasonable likelihood that they      will be caught, and if caught, a reasonable likelihood that      they will go to jail rather than get probation, home      detention, or some other alternative to incarceration,' they      will be much less willing to roll the dice and commit a      fraud.'' Testimony of Chertoff before the Senate Judiciary      Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs, July 10, 2002, p. 3; see      also Testimony of G. William Miller, former Secretary of the      Treasury and former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board,      before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs,      July 24, 2002, p. 3-4 (``[T]he greed that drives the recent      rash of alleged corporate wrongdoing is fostered by the      criminal's belief that the rewards are great and the      possibility of more than nominal punishment is low. For the      corporate wrongdoer the deterrent is only likely to be      effective if there is a high likelihood of detection and a      high probability of serious punishment. The most powerful      deterrent is the threat of jail time. The prospect of      substantial monetary penalties also can affect behavior.'');      Testimony of Bradley Skolnik, Securities Commissioner of the      State of Indiana and Chairman of the Enforcement Division of      the North American Securities Administrators Association,      before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs,      June 19, 2002, p. 2, 3 (``Investor education is an effective      crime prevention tool but the strongest deterrent to crime, I      believe is criminal prosecution and prison time. . . . [F]rom      my perspective as a state securities regulator, white-collar      criminals who commit securities fraud deserve prison time      just like thieves, muggers and murderers. . . . Someone      steals your car, they go to prison; some con artist steals      the money your parents needed for retirement, they get fined.      That's just not right.'') ``Jail time performs two      functions,'' Chertoff explained. ``It holds white collar      criminals accountable for their past misdeeds, and it      prevents future misbehavior by those executives who might toy      with the idea of beating the system.'' Testimony of Chertoff      before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs,      July 10, 2002, p. 5.     Section 904. Criminal Penalties for Violations of the          Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974       This section increases the maximum criminal penalties for a      willful violation of the reporting and disclosure provisions      of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), Title      I, subtitle B, part 1, or any regulation or order issued      thereunder. Section 904 increases the maximum fine for an      individual defendant convicted under 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1131 from      $5,000 to $100,000, and the maximum term of imprisonment from      1 year to 10 years. The increased maximum term of      imprisonment converts the offense from a misdemeanor to a      felony. In addition, this section increases the maximum fine      for a convicted organizational defendant from $100,000 to      $500,000.       ERISA imposes on pension managers a number of reporting and      disclosure requirements regarding the administration of their      pension plans. Among other things, ERISA requires the      administrator of a pension plan to notify the United States      Department of Labor and the plan's participants and      beneficiaries of any material modifications in the terms of      the pension plan. It also creates a fiduciary relationship      between the pension managers and the pension plan      beneficiaries. Criminal penalties apply for violations of      Part 1 of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1131, which is designed,      among other things, to do the following: (1) require the      disclosure of significant information about employee benefit      plans and all transactions engaged in by those who control      the plans; (2) provide specific data to plan participants and      beneficiaries about the rights and benefits to which they are      entitled and the circumstances that may result in a loss of      those rights and benefits; and (3) set forth the      responsibilities and proscriptions applicable to persons      occupying a fiduciary relationship to employee benefit plans.      29 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1021-1031.       Hearings by the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs      included a discussion of the penalty scheme under ERISA.      Section 1131 of ERISA only made it a criminal misdemeanor      ``willfully'' to violate Part 1 of ERISA, 29 U.S.C.      Sec. 1131, even though the potential harm flowing from an      ERISA violation could be enormous. A criminal violation of      Part 1 of ERISA could occur, for example, where a      corporation's pension administrator learns of information      relating to the company's financial health which, if not      disclosed, could result in a loss of the employees' rights      and benefits under the corporation's pension. (A recent study      by the Congressional Research Service of the Enron      Corporation collapse concluded that one criminal provision      which might be implicated is Section 1131 of ERISA. See CRS      Report for Congress, ``Possible Criminal Provisions Which May      Be Implicated in the Events Surrounding the Collapse of the      Enron Corporation,'' RS21177 (March 25, 2002)). In enacting      Section 904, Congress concluded that the disproportionately      low ERISA penalty constituted one of the ``penalty gaps''      between white-collar offenses and other federal crimes. For      example, a defendant convicted of interstate auto theft is      subject to up to 10 years in prison, regardless of the value      of the stolen automobile. 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2312. In contrast, a      defendant who violates ERISA--but no other federal fraud      statute--was only subject to a maximum penalty of 1 year in      prison, regardless of the value of the loss to an employee's      pension.       While a defendant who violates the criminal provisions of      ERISA may also violate another federal felony statute with      higher penalties, that will not always be the case.      Accordingly, the intention of this provision is to provide      federal prosecutors with an appropriate felony charge to      combat willful criminal conduct which devastates      employees' pension holdings. The United States Sentencing      Commission recognized that there are instances when an      ERISA criminal violation occurs in the absence of any      other federal criminal offense. The United States      Sentencing Guideline provision for the ERISA criminal      violation is USSG Sec. 2E5.3, entitled ``False Statements      and Concealment of Facts in Relation to Documents Required      by the Employee Retirement Income Security     Act.'' The background notes to Sec. 2E5.3 provide that      ``this section covers the falsification of documents or      records relating to a benefit plan covered by ERISA.'' The      background note to Sec. 2E5.3 recognizes that while ERISA      violations ``sometimes occur in connection'' with other      federal offenses, they do not always thus occur. The base      offense level under Sec. 2E5.3 for a ``stand-alone'' ERISA      violation, absent any other violation, is only 6.       If the ERISA criminal offense is accompanied by another      criminal violation, however, the guidelines direct the      application of USSG Sec. 2B1.1, which addresses fraud, theft      and other white-collar offenses (which has a base offense      level of 6, but may increase to a level of 32 depending on      the monetary value of the loss). Thus, under prior law, if a      defendant violated both ERISA and the mail fraud statute,      Sec. 2B1.1 would apply--not Sec. 2E5.3--and the defendant's      sentence would be calculated with the loss calculations of      the guidelines, and apply the higher felony maximum penalties      of the mail fraud statute.       In contrast, if the defendant were only convicted of an      ERISA criminal violation, the sentencing court would be      limited by the statutory cap in 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1131 and the      base offense level cap of Sec. 2E5.3. Accordingly, given the      relative potential for devastating economic loss to      pensioners who are victims of an ERISA criminal violation, it      is entirely appropriate for Congress to close the ``penalty      gap'' between ERISA and other federal statutes used to combat      securities fraud. Pursuant to Section 905 of the Sarbanes-     Oxley Act, Congress expects the Sentencing Commission to      examine Sec. 2E5.3 of the Sentencing Guidelines and make any      appropriate modifications given the enactment of Section 904.     Section 905. Amendment to Sentencing Guidelines Relating to          Certain White-Collar Offenses  This section directs the United States Sentencing Commission, within 180 days of enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to review and, as appropriate, to amend the applicable sentencing guidelines and related policy statements. Section 905(b) directs the Commission, among other things, to ensure that the guidelines and policy statements reflect the seriousness of the offenses and the statutory increases in penalties set forth in the Act, the growing incidence of such fraud offenses, and the need to modify the guidelines and policy statements to deter, prevent, and punish such offenses.       In passing the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the criminal and      sentencing provisions in particular, Congress was aware of      ongoing efforts by the Sentencing Commission to consolidate      certain economic crimes, as achieved through the ``Economic      Crime Package,'' and to study the effects of that      consolidation. Recognizing, however, that the length of an      offender's sentence is determined both by the operation of      the sentencing guidelines and by the strength of the      underlying statute, cf. Testimony of Paul Rosenzweig, Senior      Legal Research Fellow at the Heritage Foundation, before the      Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs, June 19,      2002, p.6 (noting that disparities in penalties are      principally the product of actions of Congress, i.e., the      criminal statutes passed by Congress), we amended the federal      criminal code to increase penalties significantly for certain      offenses (as discussed above). Our expectation is that,      similarly, the federal sentencing guidelines will be reviewed      and, where appropriate, modified accordingly.       Although the Commission has recently considered the      severity of sentences for these economic crimes, we believe      that further study is warranted--as did several of the      witnesses who testified before the Subcommittee on Crime and      Drugs. This is particularly so, given the new and increased      penalties for white-collar offenses established by Title IX.      For instance, the Honorable Glen B. Gainer, III, State      Auditor of the State of West Virginia and Chairman of the      National White Collar Crime Center, a non-profit organization      that provides support services to state and local law      enforcement agencies and other organizations involved in the      prevention, investigation and prosecution of economic crimes,      noted: ``In terms of sentence length, research conducted in      the early 90's clearly demonstrates the disparity between      [white-collar and so-called `street' crime offenders. Those      incarcerated for losses in excess of $100,000 or more as a      result of the savings and loan scandals received an average      of 36.4 months in prison. During the same time period, those      nonviolent federal offenders who committed burglary got 55.6      months, car theft received 38 months, and first-time drug      dealing averaged 65 months. While some of this disparity may      have been corrected by revisions to the federal sentencing      policy for economic crimes, disparate sentencing can still be      seen between `white-collar' cases involving substantial      monetary loss, and other crimes with similar financial      impact.'' Testimony of Gainer before the Senate Judiciary      Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs, June 19, 2002, p. 4.       Another witness, also using data that preceded adoption of      the ``Economic Crime Package,'' cited statistics that      similarly demonstrated a disparity in sentencing between      traditional white-collar and other crimes: ``[D]efendants      convicted of larceny, embezzlement, fraud, and counterfeiting      who were sentenced to federal prison received average (mean)      sentences of 15.6 months, 9.9 months, 18 months, and 17      months respectively. By contrast, robbery defendants received      110.6 months, drug defendants 75.3 months, and firearms      offenders 64.1 months. Even the average immigration sentence      was 27.8 months, ten months longer than the average fraud      penalty. Moreover, federal economic crime defendants receive      sentences of probation at dramatically higher rates than      virtually any other class of defendant. More than one-half of      all larceny defendants and one-third of all fraud defendants      receive probation.'' Testimony of Frank O. Bowman, Associate      Law Professor at the University of Indiana School of Law,      before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs,      June 19, 2002, p. 2. Similarly, Rosenzweig observed: ``An      overwhelming percentage of those who were sentenced for      traditional crimes received sentences requiring terms of      imprisonment. For example, 94.2 percent of those convicted      of drug trafficking were sentenced to prison. 97 percent      of those convicted for robbery were imprisoned, as were 93      percent of those convicted of arson, and 97.4 percent of      those convicted of murder. By contrast only 53.5 percent      of those convicted of fraud and 48.1 percent of those      convicted of embezzlement were sentenced to prison.''      Testimony of Rosenzweig before the Senate Judiciary      Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs, June 19, 2002, p. 4.       While there was not a consensus regarding the reasons for,      or desirability of, such a penalty disparity between      similarly egregious infractions, many of the witnesses      suggested that its existence worked to undermine the      integrity of the criminal justice system. For example,      Chairman Gainer concluded: ``The conclusion we can safely      draw from this body of information is that white-collar      criminals, particularly those involved in large, complex      frauds that impact hundreds, if not thousands of victims, do      not receive punishment that is proportionate to the harm that      they cause.'' Testimony of Gainer before the Senate Judiciary      Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs, June 19, 2002, p. 5.       Finally, in its efforts to comply with the terms of this      title, we hope that the Sentencing Commission will take the      opportunity to review and advise Congress on a disturbing      development cited by the two witnesses from the Justice      Department, Assistant Attorney General Chertoff and United      States Attorney Comey--namely, an over-willingness in some      jurisdictions to depart downward from the mandated sentencing      guideline range for certain white-collar offenses. Justifying      the need to increase penalties for certain white collar      offenses, Chertoff explained: ``Not only are the maximum      statutory penalties for fraud and other white collar-type      offenses substantially less than those for violent offenders      or drug cases, but it appears that judges in some      jurisdictions are overly willing to depart downward from the      mandated federal sentencing guideline range to sentence such      offenders to minimal (if any) jail time, home detention, or      even probation.'' Testimony of Chertoff before the Senate      Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs, July 10, 2002, p.      5.       Comey's comments mirrored this concern: ``[I]n some      districts, non-substantial assistance downward departures are      anything but infrequent (9,286 non-substantial assistance      downward departures were made in 2000). . . . While available      analyses do not detail the bases of these departures in white      collar cases, a number of district judges appear to believe      that white collar defendants should not be incarcerated in      order to facilitate payment of restitution and fines. Of      course, this is at odds with the view that incarceration can      deter such crime in the first instance. . . . [F]or a variety      of reasons, federal judges are hesitant to incarcerate white      collar defendants. If past is prologue, even though the      economic crime amendments of 2001 increased penalties for      these crimes, departures will be used to undercut the      purposes of the new provisions.'' Testimony of Comey before      the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs, June      19, 2002, p. 17.       By citing this and other testimony, we underscore Congress'      belief that a ``penalty gap'' has existed between white-     collar offenses and other offenses. Congress in particular is      concerned about base offense levels which may be too low. The      increased sentences, while meant to punish the most egregious      offenders more severely, are also intended to raise sentences      at the lower end of the sentencing guidelines. While Congress      acknowledges that the Sentencing Commission's recent      amendments are a step in the right direction, the Commission      is again directed to consider closely the testimony adduced      at the hearings by the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and      Drugs respecting the ongoing ``penalty gap'' between white-     collar and other offenses. To the extent that the ``penalty      gap'' existed, in part, by virtue of higher sentences for      narcotics offenses, for example, Congress responded by      increasing sentences for certain white-collar offenses.      Accordingly, we ask the Commission to consider the issues      raised herein; determine if adjustments are warranted in      light of the enhanced penalty provisions contained in this      title; and make recommendations accordingly.     Section 906. Corporate Responsibility for Financial Reports       Summary. This section adds a new provision to the United      States Code (18 U.S.C.     Sec. 1350), which requires the chief executive officer and      chief financial officer (or their equivalent) of an issuer,      foreign or domestic, to certify the accuracy of periodic      financial statements filed by the issuer with the Securities      and Exchange Commission under 15 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 78m(a) or      78o(d). (An ``issuer'' is defined, under Section 2(a)(7) of      the Act, to mean an entity whose securities are registered      under Section 12 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934      or that is required to file reports under Section 15(d) of      that Act.) The chief executive and financial officers must      certify that the periodic financial statement complies with      certain specified requirements of the Securities and Exchange      Act and that it ``fairly presents, in all material respects,      the financial condition and results of operations of the      issuer.'' Pursuant to Section 1350(c)(1), anyone who makes      such a certification ``knowing'' that the report accompanying      the certifying statement does not meet the statutory      requirements would, upon conviction, face up to $1 million in      fines, up to 10 years in prison, or both. Pursuant to Section      1350(c)(2), anyone who ``willfully'' certifies compliance      ``knowing'' that the periodic report accompanying the      statement does not comport with the requirements of 18 U.S.C.      Sec. 1350 would face up to $5 million in fines, up to 20      years in prison, or both.       Financial Reports. The backdrop to Section 906 is the long-     standing requirement under Section 13(a) and Section 15(d) of      the Securities and Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 78m(a)      or 78o(d)) that publicly-traded companies file reports with      the SEC regarding the financial well-being of the      corporation. See 15 U.S.C. Sec. 78m(a) (``Every issuer of a      security . . . shall file with the Commission . . . such      information and documents . . . as the Commission shall      require to keep reasonably current the information and      documents required to be included in or filed with an      application or registration statement [and] such annual      reports . . . as the Commission may prescribe.'') Pursuant to      this provision, the SEC requires publicly-traded companies to      file numerous reports (e.g., Forms 10-K, 20-F, 40-F, 10-Q, 8-     K, 6-K), all intended to provide both the Commission and the      investing public with information regarding the financial      condition of the corporation. Willful failure to file these      periodic reports, or the making of materially      false statements therein, constitutes a felony. See 15      U.S.C. Sec. 78ff (``Any person who willfully violates any      provision of this chapter . . . or any person who      willfully and knowingly makes . . . [any] false or      misleading [statement] with respect to any material fact,      shall upon conviction be fined not more than $1,000,000,      or imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both[.]'') (We      note that, in contrast to the ``willful'' standard we      apply in Section 906, courts have ascribed a different      meaning to ``willful'' violations of the 1934 Act, e.g.,      United States v. Dixon, 536 F.2d 1388 (2d Cir. 1976)      (determining that an act is done ``willfully'' if it is      done intentionally and deliberately and not the result of      innocent mistake, negligence or inadvertence; a specific      intent to disregard or disobey is not required). As      explained more fully below, Congress uses ``willful'' in      Section 906 to create a specific intent crime, not the      general intent crime which courts have sometimes used in      interpreting the penalty provisions of the 1934 Act.)      While defendants have been prosecuted under 15 U.S.C.      Sec. Sec. 78m and 78ff for filing false financial reports      with the SEC, see, e.g., United States v. Colasurdo, 453      F.2d 585 (2d Cir. 1971), cert. denied. 406 U.S. 917      (1972), the law has never required a company's top      corporate official to certify to the accuracy of the      company's financial reports. Section 906 closes this      loophole by imposing this responsibility upon the CEO and      CFO (or their equivalents) of all publicly-traded      corporations. Significantly, it does not mandate any      additional reporting requirements, but only applies to      those companies who are independently required, by      Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities and Exchange      Act of 1934, to certify the accuracy of those reports. As      noted above, the law has always required that those      reports be materially accurate.       Executive Certification. The notion of requiring an      organization's primary or senior executive to certify a      statement submitted to the government, on threat of possible      criminal liability, is hardly novel. For example, Section      911(a)(1) of the National Defense Authorization Act for      Fiscal Year 1986 requires a senior executive of a defense      contractor to certify, to the best of his or her ``knowledge      and belief,'' that all costs included in a proposal for      settlement of indirect costs are allowable under the cost      principles of the Federal Acquisition Regulation and its      supplements. 10 U.S.C. Sec. 2324(h); 48 C.F.R. Sec. 52.242-4.      Like Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the regulation      implementing the certification requirement contained in      Section 911(a)(1) mandates that the certificate be executed      by a company's senior executives, who face potential criminal      liability if the representations contained in the      certification are shown to be inaccurate. See 10 U.S.C.      Sec. 2324(i).       Such a certification of accuracy is especially important in      the securities context, since the robustness of financial      markets and the success of national securities regulation are      based on the full disclosure of a company's financial state.      During the summer of 2002, as daily reports of alleged CEO      criminal wrongdoing filled the news, congressional testimony      from finance experts touted the critical need to impose      responsibility upon top corporate officials in ensuring      accuracy in financial reports. For example, Federal Reserve      Chairman Alan Greenspan testified before the Senate Committee      on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs on July 16, 2002, the      day after the Senate passed S. 2673. Much of his testimony      focused on (1) the need for top corporate officials to report      accurately the financial health of their companies; and (2)      the need for criminal penalties for those who knowingly fail      to do so. Chairman Greenspan said the following: ``A CEO must      . . . bear the responsibility to accurately report the      resulting condition of the corporation to shareholders and      potential investors. Unless such responsibilities are      enforced with very stiff penalties for noncompliance, as many      now recommend, our accounting systems and other elements of      corporate governance will function in a less than optimum      manner. . . . Already existing statutes, of course, prohibit      corporate fraud and misrepresentation. But even a small      increase in the likelihood of large, possibly criminal      penalties for egregious behavior of CEOs can have profoundly      important effects on all aspects of corporate governance      because the fulcrum of governance is the chief executive      officer . . . . And I don't wish to make a generalized      statement, but I suspect that if the CEO issue [i.e.,      accurate reporting of the financial health of a company] were      fully and completely resolved--which it never will be,      because we're dealing with human beings--I think all the rest      of the problems will just disappear . . . . [I]f you do not      get the CEO changing in the way that particular position      functions, a goodly part of the work of the Senate is not      going to be very effective . . . . [W]hat you can do is to      try to create an environment and a legal structure which very      significantly penalizes malfeasance.''       Likewise, several witnesses before the Judiciary      Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs echoed the testimony of      Chairman Greenspan, suggesting that the best way to protect      investors from fraud is to require corporate executives at      publicly-traded companies to disclose detailed information      about their companies' financial health. For example,      Professor Thomas Donaldson, Mark O. Winkelman Professor at      the Wharton School of Business at the University of      Pennsylvania, commented: ``The importance of accurate      information in fueling efficient economic activity is well      substantiated. Rational choice demands accurate information.      When companies fail to provide investors with accurate      information, investors make worse decisions and markets, in      turn, become less efficient.'' Testimony of Donaldson before      the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs, July      10, 2002, p. 4. Relatedly, he noted: ``Crony capitalism and      the lack of transparency were rightly implicated in the Asian      melt down of 1997-1998. Without transparency and reliable      numbers about the economic health of Asian companies,      investors were stymied from responding rationally to the      crisis. They were unable to dump their investments in poorer      companies and hold their investments in better companies      because they simply couldn't trust the numbers. In the      ensuing crisis, they dumped everything with pernicious      consequences. Today, we appear to be experiencing a      transparency discount in the American equity markets.      Investors pay less because they believe that they know      less.'' See id. at 2; see also Testimony of Devine before the      Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs, July 10,      2002, p. 2 (``Two long-accepted truths are that secrecy is      the breeding ground for corruption, and sunlight is the      best disinfectant.'')       Thus, Section 906 simply seeks to facilitate full      disclosure and ensure the accuracy of financial reports by      requiring corporate executives' personal stamp of approval.      As Secretary Miller stated plainly but poignantly, ``[i]f the      CEO is required to certify the reports he will be hard      pressed later to say he thought the CFO had everything in      apple pie shape. So the certificate becomes the hook that      establishes accountability.'' Testimony of Miller before the      Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs, July 24,      2002, p. 5.       State of Mind Requirement for Criminal Liability. Section      906 provides for a two-tiered penalty scheme for corporate      officials who certify financial statements which they know to      be false. It should be kept in mind that both penalties only      apply to corporate executives who certify statements      ``knowing that the periodic report accompanying the statement      does not comport with all the requirements set forth in this      section.''       While it is common for drafters of legislation to use the      mens rea terms ``knowing'' and ``willful'' interchangeably,      there are some criminal statutes which distinguish between      them. See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. Sec. 35 (knowingly conveying false      information triggers civil liability, while willfully      conveying false information is a felony). When these two mens      rea requirements are used in setting forth graduated      penalties for the same predicate conduct, courts construe      ``knowing'' to embody a general intent standard and      ``willful'' to embody a specific intent standard. As such,      knowing conduct is distinct from, and less intentional than,      willful conduct. See Bryan v. United States, 524 U.S. 184,      193 (1998) (noting that ``more is required'' for a finding of      ``willful'' misconduct; ``[t]he jury must find that the      defendant acted with an evil-meaning mind, that is to say,      that he acted with knowledge that his conduct was      unlawful'').       ``Knowing.'' Section 906 establishes 18 U.S.C.      Sec. 1350(c)(1), making it a 10-year felony     for a corporate official to certify financial statements      ``knowing'' that they contain false or misleading      information. As explained above, ``knowing'' as used here is      meant to embody a general intent standard. It refers to      knowledge of the facts constituting the offense, as      distinguished from knowledge of the law. See Bryan, 524 U.S.      at 192 (quoting Justice Jackson). In other words, to certify      financial statements ``knowing'' them to be false simply      means to certify the financial statements intentionally,      voluntarily and with an awareness of their duplicity, rather      than by mistake or accident. Knowledge of the law is not      required, nor is a willful and intentional desire to evade      the law's requirements. Stated differently, Section      1350(c)(1) imposes criminal liability for corporate officials      who certify a financial statement ``knowing'' that it fails      to ``fairly present, in all material respect, the financial      condition and the operations of the issuer.'' It is not      required that the corporate official intended to violate the      statute (or even knew of the statute's certification      requirements). Rather, the government must only prove that      the corporate officer knew that the financial statements were      materially misleading or inaccurate.       That is not to say, however, that certifying executives can      evade liability by avoiding acquiring knowledge. We agree      with the sentiments of Secretary Miller, who noted that      ``[t]he certifying officer should be judged upon whether he      has been diligent, exercised due care, established procedures      for verification, made adequate investigations, and provided      appropriate supervision.'' Testimony of Miller before the      Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs, July 24,      2002, p. 5. It is our intent that courts impose a duty on      these individuals to be reasonably informed of the material      facts necessary to prepare financial information for      submission to the SEC and for dissemination to the public.      This position is consistent with well-established law that      conscious avoidance, or a deliberate attempt to avoid      knowledge of the crime, will not be a defense to the criminal      penalties contained in a statute. See, e.g., United States v.      de Francisco-Lopez, 939 F.2d 1405, 1409 (10th Cir. 1991)      (```[T]he act of avoidance of knowledge of particular facts      may itself circumstantially show that the avoidance was      motivated by sufficient guilty knowledge to satisfy the . . .      `knowing' element of the crime.'''); United States v. Hanlon,      548 F.2d 1096, 1101 (2d Cir. 1977) (``It is settled law that      a finding of guilty knowledge may not be avoided by a showing      that the defendant closed his eyes to what was going on about      him; `see no evil' is not a maxim in which the criminal      defendant should take any comfort.''); United States v.      Jewel, 532 F.2d 697 (9th Cir.) (en banc) (``To act      `knowingly,' therefore, is not necessarily to act only with      positive knowledge, but also to act with an awareness of the      high probability of the existence of the fact in      question.''), cert. denied, 426 U.S. 951 (1976); see also      Leary v. United States, 395 U.S. 6, 46 n. 93 (1969).       On the other hand, the standard articulated here is not      tantamount to negligence or recklessness. We simply note the      well-established proposition that conscious avoidance of      certain facts should not provide immunity from prosecution;      in contrast, if lower-level corporate officials conspire to      hide the true financial health of the company from the CEO      for whatever reasons, the CEO will not be held liable if he      or she did not know these facts. We expect that this would be      a rare event, however, given the requirement that a CEO be      aware of the contents of their company's financial reports      filed with the SEC. See, e.g., Howard v. Everix Systems,      Inc., 228 F.3d 1057, 1062 (9th Cir. 2000) (``Key corporate      officials should not be allowed to make important false      financial statements knowingly or recklessly, yet still      shield themselves from liability in the preparation of those      statements. Otherwise, the securities laws would be      significantly weakened, because corporate officers could stay      out of loop such that . . . only the SEC could bring suit      against them in an individual capacity for their      misrepresentations.'') Nor does Congress intend Section 906      to be a so-called ``public welfare law'' which would create      strict liability. See, e.g., United States v. Dee, 912 F.2d      741 (4th Cir. 1990) (holding that one who possesses hazardous      wastes will be presumed to be aware of federal regulations      governing such wastes, notwithstanding law's inclusion of a      knowledge mens rea requirement).       ``Willful.'' Section 906 also creates a new 20-year felony      provision, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1350(c)(2), which applies to      corporate officials who ``willfully'' certify financial      statements which they know to be false. ``Willfully'' here is      meant to denote a specific intent standard. When used in the      criminal context, a ``willful'' act is generally one      undertaken with a bad purpose, or with knowledge that the      prohibited conduct is unlawful. See Bryan, 524 U.S. at      191-92. Under Section 906, certifying financial statements      which the CEO knows are false is not enough to be      ``willful.'' Rather, the act also must be done with an      evil intent to evade the law. That evil intent is an      intent to disobey or disregard the law, rather than an      intent to do wrong in some more general sense. A corporate      executive who certifies financial statements which he      knows to be false is not guilty under this section unless,      in addition to knowing what he was doing, he voluntarily      and intentionally engaged in conduct that he knew was      prohibited. See Ratzlaf v. United States, 510 U.S. 135,      142 (1994) (describing a `` `willful' actor as one who      violates `a known legal duty' ''); Cheek v. United States,      498 U.S. 192, 201 (1991) (establishing that ``the standard      for the statutory willfulness requirement is the      `voluntary, intentional violation of a known legal duty'      '').       Section 1350(c)(2)'s construction is consistent with prior      judicial interpretations of the word ``willful.'' As the      Supreme Court has observed, ``the word `willfully' is      sometimes said to be `a word of many meanings' whose      construction is often dependent on the context in which it      appears.'' Bryan, 524 U.S. at 191. ``Willfully'' may mean      either a requirement of general intent or specific intent.      Recognizing that ignorance of the law typically is no defense      to a criminal charge, Congress here intended to require a      more particularized showing of knowledge in order to access      the tougher criminal penalties under Sec. 1350(c)(2)--i.e.,      knowledge of the specific law or rule that a defendant's      conduct is alleged to violate. In passing this section,      Congress relied on the Court's determination in cases like      Ratzlaf, 510 U.S. 135, and Cheek, 498 U.S. 192.       In these cases, the Court interpreted the term      ``willfully'' in two different statutes, one dealing with      structuring transactions and the other dealing with tax      evasion, as requiring a finding of specific intent. Ratzlaf,      510 U.S. at 141; Cheek, 498 U.S. at 200. Part of the Court's      reasoning was that the complex nature of these laws justified      an inference that Congress intended ``willfully'' to be a      specific intent requirement so that those who were ignorant      of the law, but exercised reasonable care, would not be      subjected to the same punishment as bad actors with an evil      intent. Ratzlaf, 510 U.S. at 144-46; Cheek, 498 U.S. at 200,      205. Stated differently, Congress made violations of these      statutes ``specific intent crime[s] because, without      knowledge of the . . . requirement, a would-be violator      cannot be expected to recognize the illegality of his      otherwise innocent act.'' United States v. Eisenstein, 731      F.2d 1540, 1543 (11th Cir. 1984). Like the anti-structuring      and tax evasion provisions at issue in Ratzlaf and Cheek,      securities laws are complex, which is why Section 906      incorporates different penalties for ``knowing'' violations      committed with general intent and ``willful'' violations      characterized by a specific intent to violate the law. In      effect, for the heightened penalties triggered by ``willful''      violations, Section 906 carves out a limited and rebuttable      exception to the traditional rule that ``ignorance of the law      is no excuse.'' See Bryan, 524 U.S. at 196.       Finally, for purposes of clarity, we should mention that we      are aware that the term ``willfully'' is invoked and      interpreted differently in the context of civil      administrative disciplinary proceedings instituted by the SEC      under federal securities laws. For example, under Sections      15(b)(4) and 15(b)(6) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,      the SEC may discipline a registered broker-dealer in      securities or anyone associated or participating with the      broker-dealer if it finds in such proceedings that the      respondent has ``willfully'' violated or ``willfully'' aided      and abetted the violation by any person of any provision of      certain securities laws or rules. While, as we have noted,      the meaning of ``willfully'' depends on statutory context, in      the SEC administrative disciplinary context, it has been held      to mean ``no more than the person charged with the duty knows      what he is doing.'' Hughes v. Securities and Exchange      Commission, 174 F.2d 969, 977 (D.C. Cir. 1949); see also      Seaman v. Securities and Exchange Commission, 603 F.2d 1126,      1135 (5th Cir. 1979), aff'd on other grounds, 450 U.S. 91      (1981); Arthur Lipper Corp. v. Securities and Exchange      Commission, 547 F.2d 171, 180 (2d Cir. 1976), cert. denied,      430 U.S. 1009; Stead v. Securities and Exchange Commission,      444 F.2d 713, 714-15 (10th Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 404 U.S.      1059. See also the discussion of willfulness in Wonsover v.      Securities and Exchange Commission, 205 F.3d 408, 413 (D.C.      Cir. 2000). The court reiterated its ``traditional      formulation of willfulness'' for purposes of Section 15(b) of      the Exchange Act. Citing its prior holding in Gerhard & Otis,      Inc. v. Securities and Exchange Commission, 348 F.2d 798      (D.C. Cir. 1965), the Court noted that ``willfully'' in that      provision ``means intentionally committing the act which      constitutes the violation,'' not that ``the actor [must] also      be aware that he is violating [the law].'' Tager v.      Securities and Exchange Commission, 344 F.2d 5, 8 (2d Cir.      1965); Edward J. Mawood & Co. v. Securities and Exchange      Commission, 591 F.2d 588, 595-96 (10th Cir. 1979) (same).      Needless to say, for purposes of Section 906, we do not adopt      the ``general intent'' interpretation of ``willful.''       Expert Advice. Some defendants charged in white-collar      cases have attempted to avert criminal liability by claiming      reliance on expert advice. See, e.g., Ratzlaf, 510 U.S. at      142 n.10 (`` `[S]pecific intent to commit the crimes' . . .      might be negated by, e.g., proof that defendant relied in      good faith on advice of counsel.''); Eisenstein, 731 F.2d at      1543-44 (same). To the extent that it exists, the so-called      ``reliance on expert'' defense is held to apply only when the      defendant can demonstrate that he fully disclosed all      relevant facts to his accountant or attorney and that he      relied in good faith on the expert's advice. See United      States v. Johnson, 730 F.2d 683, 686 (11th Cir.), cert.      denied, 469 U.S. 867 (1984); United States v. McLennan, 563      F.2d 943, 946 (9th Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 435 U.S. 969      (1978) (noting that ``[a]dvice of counsel is no defense      unless the defendant gave his attorney all of the facts, and      unless counsel specifically advised the course of conduct      taken by the defendant''). It is not Congress' intent to     disrupt this line of authority. We presume that, where it is      a reliance on expert advice that is truly at issue, see      Johnson, 730 F.2d at 686-87 (discounting defendants' defense      where reliance on expert advice was irrelevant to the real      claims at issue), the same standard articulated in the above-     cited and other authority would apply to the criminal      provisions contained in this title.       Finally, the duty imposed by the Section 906 certification      requirement is not intended to end once a financial statement      and accompanying certification are submitted. Upon      discovery that a statement contains an error, immediate      correction and disclosure of the correction should be      required.       Interplay With Section 302 of S. 2673: Scope of      Certification Requirement. At the time I offered the Biden-     Hatch Amendment to S. 2673, that bill already had a provision      (now codified at Section 302), which is similar to Section      906, with three significant exceptions. First, the provision      does not apply to the chairperson of a company's board of      directors (my original legislation and subsequent amendment      to S. 2673 applied the certification requirement to chief      executive officers, chief financial officers, and board      chairpersons). Second, it contains no criminal enforcement      provisions. Third, the scope of corporate filing activity      subject to the requirements of Section 302 is far narrower,      as I explain below.       Section 302 provides that the SEC must require, for each      company filing periodic reports under Section 13(a) or 15(d)      of the Exchange Act, that the principal executive officer and      the principal financial officer, or persons performing      equivalent functions, make certain certifications in each      annual or quarterly report filed with or submitted to the      SEC. Section 302, by its terms, only applies to annual and      quarterly reports and, accordingly, its scope is so cabined.      Section 906, on the other hand and quite intentionally,      includes no such limitation of its scope. It is intended to      apply to any financial statement filed by a publicly-traded      company, upon which the investing public will rely to gauge      the financial health of the company. So, Section 906 applies      to annual and quarterly reports (e.g., Forms 10-K, 20-F, 40-     F, 10-Q) but, unlike Section 302 certifications, is also      intended to apply to so-called ``current'' reports like Forms      8-K and 6-K (foreign issuer submissions), as well as      submissions of Form 11-K by employee benefit plans. The above      list is merely illustrative, not exhaustive, and Congress      intends the SEC to issue guidance on any additional reports      which are subject to Section 906.       We are aware of the SEC's historic position that the term      ``periodic reports'' describes Forms 10-Q, 10-K, 10-QSB, 10-     KSB, 40-F and 20-F, which are required to be filed at      specified intervals in time, and not Forms 8-K and 6-K, which      are only required to be filed upon the occurrence of      specified events. We in no way intend to import the more      expansive scope of Section 906 into broader securities      regulation; the wider view of ``periodic report'' is for      purposes of implementing this specific certification      requirement only.       Note that Section 906 does not require certification that      the financial statements are in accordance with generally      accepted accounting principles (GAAP). That omission is      intentional in that the certification is designed to ensure      an overall accuracy and completeness that is broader than      financial reporting requirements under generally accepted      accounting principles. In so doing, for purposes of this      section, Congress effectively establishes possible liability      where statements may be GAAP-compliant but materially      misleading. See States v. Simon, 425 F.2d 796, 808 (2d Cir.      1969) (finding that accountants can be criminally liable for      preparing financial statements that are GAAP-compliant but      materially misleading).       Certification Form. We do not intend to prescribe the      precise form or format of certification (e.g., whether the      certification should appear on the signature page or among      the exhibits or appendices to the report) or method of      submission to the appropriate regulators. On these questions,      Congress properly defers to the expert judgment of      experienced officials at the SEC, who we trust will fully      consider the liability implications of these administrative      options. What is important is that the ultimate form reflect      the substantive requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act--     including a recognition that, as the text of the statute and      the foregoing explanation should make clear, certification      under Section 302 applies to a subset of the certifications      required by Section 906. Nevertheless, I have encouraged the      SEC and the Justice Department to develop a single form which      could be used for certifications under both Sections 302 and      906. Section 906 certification establishes a ``floor'' of      minimum certification requirements, while Section 302 cites      some additional factors. Accordingly, any company properly      certifying under Section 302 will also satisfy the      requirements of Section 906. Thus, it may be possible for the      SEC to develop a unitary certification for the sake of      administrative ease. However, for companies that need only      certify under Section 906, a separate certification      satisfying the somewhat lesser requirements of Section 906      may be appropriate.       Penalties for Failure to File Section 906 Certification.      Some observers have asked whether failure to file a      certification pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1350(a)--as opposed      to certifying a false financial report as accurate in      violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1350(c)--triggers criminal      liability. It does. Pursuant to Section 3(b) of the Sarbanes-     Oxley Act, ``a violation by any person of this Act . . .      shall be treated for all purposes in the same manner as a      violation of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 . . . and      any such person shall be subject to the same penalties, and      to the same extent, as for a violation of that Act or such      rules and regulations.'' As noted above, the criminal      provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C.      Sec. 78ff) include a 10-year felony for ``willful''      violations. Accordingly, willful failure to file a      certification pursuant to Section 1350(a) of Title 18      triggers the criminal provisions of 15 U.S.C. Sec. 78ff. (As      noted above, courts have interpreted ``willful'' violations      of the 1934 Act to require only general intent to commit the      crime.) Significantly, the U.S. Department of Justice concurs      with this analysis. See Letter from Assistant Attorney      General Daniel J. Bryant to the Honorable Joseph R. Biden,      Jr., December 26, 2002 (``[A]s you have suggested, the      Department may utilize Section 78ff's criminal penalties to      prosecute executives who violate the Sarbanes-Oxley Act by      willfully failing to file Section 906's required      certification.''). Of course, in addition to this penalty      scheme, failure to file the required Section 1350(a)      certification may also result in an economic penalty, since      Wall Street analysts and investors would surely take note of      the failure and punish offending companies by shifting their      investment dollars to compliant companies. This potential      economic penalty should in no way mitigate application of the      criminal penalty.                          ____________________
