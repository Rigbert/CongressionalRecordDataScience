 President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota and all of our Democratic colleagues who have spoken. When the Senator from Minnesota was speaking, I couldn't help but think of someone he remembers well. During the whole debate of No Child Left Behind, Senator Paul Wellstone, who was on the floor during that debate saying: We are giving a promise I don't believe we are going to keep. Everyone assured him: No, no, we will put this accountability in place. We will fund this.  The Senator from Minnesota speaks from his heart, as I know Senator Wellstone would have admired him for, in reminding all of us what is happening to our children and to our schools because we haven't kept the promise all of us said we would keep when the debate took place several years ago.  How much time remains on both sides?
