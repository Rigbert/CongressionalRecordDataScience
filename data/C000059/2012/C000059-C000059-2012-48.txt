Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to the community of Corona, California, are exceptional. Corona has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Dean Seif, a board member of the Greater Corona Valley Chamber of Commerce, is one of these individuals. On January 21, 2012, Dean will receive a prestigious honor when the Greater Corona Valley Chamber of Commerce gives him the Chairman's Award at the organization's annual awards and installation gala at the Eagle Glen Golf Club.  Dean was voted onto the Board to serve in 2011 and as a new board member took on the responsibility of chairing the weekly networking group, ``Chamber Networking Solutions.'' Taking his board responsibility seriously, Dean attended a special Southern California Training for Chamber Volunteers, bringing his wife, Shannon, who also is a member of the Chamber. They enthusiastically participated, taking notes and bringing back to the Board a full report which engaged and motivated other board members to consider future training. This past September a similar training session was held and Dean and ten other board members attended this time, bringing value back to the Chamber and its members.  Annually, the Chamber travels to Sacramento for Legislative Days and the Chamber excels in bringing a contingent of volunteers to the trip each year. In 2011, both Shannon and Dean were part of the 18-person group from the Greater Corona Valley Chamber.  Dean's passion and leadership is contagious and when it comes to commitment, Dean matches his words with his actions. He was the top ticket seller for the Super Bowl Ticket drawing contest. Dean has attended countless meetings for creating and revising the 2012 budget. This next year, Dean will serve as an officer, becoming the Treasurer and overseeing the Finance Committee. Additionally, Dean will move to the chair position for the Ambassador's committee and is planning on having the Chamber host the Ambassador Rally in 2012.  In light of all Dean has done for the community of Corona, the Greater Corona Valley Chamber of Commerce has given Dean their Chairman's Award. Dean's tireless passion for community service has contributed immensely to the betterment of the community of Corona, California. He has been the heart and soul of many community organizations and events and I am proud to call him a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for his service and salute him as he receives this prestigious award.                          ____________________
