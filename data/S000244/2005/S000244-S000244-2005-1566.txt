Speaker, today I am introducing a bill to complete the codification of title 46, United States Code, ``Shipping'', as positive law. This bill is an updated version of H.R. 4319 which was introduced in the 108th Congress.  This bill has been prepared by the Office of the Law Revision Counsel of the House of Representatives in accordance with 2 U.S.C. 285b(1). That Office received comments on the predecessor bill and made appropriate changes which are reflected in this bill.  Questions about this bill should be addressed to Richard B. Simpson, Senior Counsel, Office of the Law Revision Counsel, U.S. House of Representatives, H2-304 Ford House Office Building, Washington, D.C. 20515. The telephone number is 202-226-9059.
