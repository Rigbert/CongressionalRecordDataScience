Chairman, I rise in support of the Hostettler amendment, which I believe deals with the issue of compliance with the torture amendment in a humane manner that will safeguard the safety of the American people.  Let me say why this is necessary. Under current law, as interpreted by the courts, a criminal who has committed a crime or conspired to commit a crime in another country, or someone who is on a terrorist watch list can come to the United States. When they get here, they claim asylum. It takes a while to adjudicate asylum applications.  They also can say if he is immediately deported, then he would be tortured if he went back home. So the way it stands now under the current law, that person would be out in society free to commit crimes, free to commit terrorist acts until the time comes for the asylum hearing. And then if the person were found not to be eligible for asylum, they still could not be deported if they thought that they would be tortured when they come back home.  So if we cannot send them home under the torture convention, and that is the case in many Middle Eastern countries, and we cannot detain them, then they are out on the street posing a danger to society.  What the Hostettler amendment does in this circumstance is say that they can be detained. And there are procedural safeguards in the Hostettler amendment that set up standards for detention and require a review every 6 months. If my colleagues vote against this amendment, they are going to have these people out on the street.  They should not be out on the street. They should be detained or deported. If we cannot deport them, then let us give the Department of Homeland Security the authority to detain them. Pass the amendment.
