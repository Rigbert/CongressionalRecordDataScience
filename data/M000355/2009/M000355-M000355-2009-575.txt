 President, I rise today to honor the Bourbon Heights Nursing Home, which was recently recognized as the best nursing home in the State in 2008 by the Kentucky Association of Health Care Facilities, KAHCF.  Recently, the Bourbon County Citizen in Paris, KY, published a story about the Bourbon Heights Nursing Home receiving this top honor.  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the work of the dedicated staff and volunteers at Bourbon Heights, whose continued commitment to the community and to those they care for is extraordinary. I further ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:              [From Bourbon County Citizen, Dec. 19, 2008]                  Bourbon Heights Receives State Award                            (By Paul Gibson)       The Bourbon Heights Nursing Home was the recipient of the      coveted award recognizing them as the best nursing home in      the state by the Kentucky Association of Health Care      Facilities (KAHCF). There are 247 nursing homes in the      association and each one is awarded the large trophy that      signifies the top honor.       ``There is an extensive application procedure,'' said      Glenda McKenzie, Activities Director. ``And judges come at      least twice during the year to personally see the facility.''       ``The judges' visit is very thorough,'' said Angie      Forsythe, Administrator at Bourbon Heights. ``They interview      each department head and observe the services we provide      residents.''       According to Forsythe, the judges also interview staff      members, residents, and volunteers to gain better      understanding of how the facility operates.       ``The judges really wanted to know what makes us unique,''      Forsythe said.       The judges discovered, McKenzie said, ``that we are a very      diverse facility offering a wide range of services to our      residents.''       Currently, Bourbon Heights provides independent living in      apartments, personal care, nursing care, day care and out      patient rehabilitation.       ``I think the judges were impressed with the way we take      pride in the care we provide our residents,'' Forsythe said.      ``We are like a family here and the staff provides a loving      care for each resident.''       She added that Bourbon Heights has very little turnover in      staff and that many staff     members have 20 or more years of service. ``It is like a      family here, the staff cares for the residents and      relationships are developed that are important to the      residents.''       One of the most unique attributes of Bourbon Heights is the      support from the community and the volunteers who are in the      floors every day providing support and help to the regular      staff.       ``As I travel around the state attending meetings,''      McKenzie said. ``Other Activity Directors are amazed at the      level of community support that we have at Bourbon Heights.''       The giant trophy in the lobby is awarded for one year and      will be passed on next year to a new recipient. A trophy cup      will remain at Bourbon Heights as a reminder of this year's      honor of being named the best nursing home in the state.       Bourbon Heights was chartered in 1965 when it opened as a      senior care center. It is a non-profit organization. The land      is owned by the county and the buildings and improvements are      part of the Bourbon Heights Corporation and under the      direction of the board of directors that oversee the non-     profit organization.                          ____________________
