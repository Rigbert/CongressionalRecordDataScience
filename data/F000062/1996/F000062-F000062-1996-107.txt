 President, Congressman Sonny Bono introduced identical legislation last Thursday and the Native American and Insular Affairs Subcommittee of the House Resources Committee has scheduled hearings this afternoon on this legislation. I look forward to working with the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs to implement this agreement in law and the Appropriations Committee to provide funds as outlined in the settlement agreement.  I hope my colleagues will join me today in enacting this legislation.                               exhibit 1 Submittal to the Board of Supervisors, County of Riverside, State of                                California     From: Supervisor Wilson.     Subject: Support of Legislation for Settlement With Torres-         Martinez Indian Tribe.       Recommended Motion: That the Board take a position in      support of the attached draft legislation, proposed by      Congressman Sonny Bono and providing for settlement with the      Torres-Martinez Indian Tribe by providing compensation for      acquisition of lands in the Coachella Valley; further, direct      the county Executive Office to immediately forward copies of      the Board Minute Order to members of California's      Congressional delegation.       Justification: The accidental creation of the Salton Sea in      1905-1907 resulted in approximately 12,000 acres of Torres-     Martinez Indian Tribal lands in the southeastern Coachella      Valley being either underwater or unusable. There has been      litigation since 1982 by the Federal Government on behalf of      the Tribe against Coachella Valley Water District and      Imperial Irrigation District, and the Tribe itself filed      litigation in 1991. In addition to the issue of compensation      to the Tribe, the completion of Highway 86 is also at risk,      as the alignment and construction of the highway is      contingent on right-of-way on existing Tribal lands.       The attached draft legislation has been developed in      consultation with all parties, and I am advised that all are      in agreement with its provisions. It provides the Tribe with      funds to acquire 12,000 acres, either in entirety in the      ``primary'' acquisition area (Avenue 56, also known as      Airport Blvd., south to the Riverside/Imperial County line)      which is adjacent to existing Tribal lands, or up to 640      acres (out of the total 12,000) in the ``secondary''      acquisition area (the remainder of the Coachella Valley,      generally from Desert Hot Springs southeast to Avenue 56).       Finally, the legislation authorizes the Tribe to establish      a single gaming site, and provides land use jurisdiction      within the secondary acquisition area with the ability to      protest acquisition/conversion of land to Tribal status      within 60 days of being notified of the Tribe's intent.       County Counsel worked directly with Congressman Bono's      staff in development of the draft legislation, and I urge the      Board's support of this proposed settlement.     Roy Wilson.                                                                    ____                              Bayh, Connaughton & Malone, P.G.                                    Washington, DC, June 14, 1996.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     Senate Hart Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: I would like to transmit      correspondence from Coachella Valley Water District, the      Imperial Irrigation District and the Torres-Martinez Desert      Cahuilla Indians regarding the Torres-Martinez settlement      legislation (H.R. 3640).       For the past four years, on behalf of the water districts      and in full cooperation with the Tribe, I have assisted in      facilitating this settlement through the Departments of the      Interior and Justice. The legislation introduced by Rep. Bono      in the House accurately and completely implements the      settlement agreement. Thus, all parties support enactment of      this legislation and ask that you sponsor the companion bill      on the Senate side.       We appreciate your consideration of our request and are      grateful for all of the help we have received from Mia Ellis,      Susy Elfving and your other staff members over the past      several years. We are close to the finish line and we ask      that you and Senator Boxer help us on the Senate side in      enacting this legislation that is so critical to both the      Tribe and the water users in the Imperial and Coachella      Valleys of California.       Thank you.           Sincerely,     Joseph Findaro.                                                                    ____                              Coachella Valley Water District,                                     Coachella, CA, June 14, 1996.

Dianne Feinstein,     Senate Hart Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: The text of the Torres-Martinez      settlement legislation (introduced by Rep. Bono in the House      as H.R. 3640) accurately and completely implements the      settlement agreement. We therefore support enactment of this      legislation and request that you sponsor this legislation in      the Senate.           Sincerely,                                             Richard L.

Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     Senate, Hart Senate Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: Soon President Clinton is expected      to approve a settlement of claims by the Torrez-Martinez      Desert Cahuilla Indian Tribe regarding the Salton Sea. The      Imperial Irrigation District and our district will be signing      this agreement along with the Tribe and the Federal      government.       This settlement resolve long-standing disputes concerning      land and water use in our region of California. At the local      level, there is widespread support finally settling the      dispute and for swift enactment of legislation to implement      this settlement. We, therefore,     urge you to sponsor this legislation for introduction in the      Senate concurrently with House introduction.       The Cahuilla Indian Tribe will receive $14 million,      approximately $4 million from the two water districts and $10      million from the federal government. The districts will      receive permanent flowage easements, the Tribe will be able      to purchase new lands, and local water rights will be      protected.       We appreciate the attention your staff has given this      matter over the last several years and look forward to      working with you to obtain implementing legislation.           Sincerely,                                                  Gerald F. Pisha,     Mayor.                          ____________________
