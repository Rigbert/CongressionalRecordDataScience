President, I know we are all going to greatly miss our friend Senator Bumpers. He is certainly one of the finest orators this body has enjoyed since Daniel Webster. But I want to take a moment to personally thank Senator Bumpers.  Senator Bumpers and I came to the Senate as part of the class of 1974. So I had very mixed feelings last year when I heard that my good friend would be leaving this Chamber. He and I have shared many battles over the twenty-four years that we have spent in these halls and on this floor. And, as my good friend pointed out just a few days ago, I am not even half as entertaining as him, so his shoes will be hard to fill.  However, as Senator Bumpers has often remarked, he has probably fought more losing battles in this Chamber than any other Member. He is leaving those battles for the rest of us to fight. He has laid down a marker for where our country must go in the next century. His challenge to us who remain in this Chamber is to frame laws that show respect to our country's founders and to our country's future.  He has fought tirelessly to defend our Bill of Rights and only yesterday warned this Chamber against of the temptation of amending what he has often called ``our sacred document.'' Senator Bumpers has shown great courage over the years in his steadfast protection of our Constitution.  As he has pointed out many times, he has taken a lot of political heat for voting against popular issues like school prayer, flag burning and the balanced budget amendment. But even though he has voted against all of these things and voted for our Constitution, he is walking out of this Chamber by his own choice. His courage should guide us all in our choices between Popular issues of the day and protecting our Constitution.  His legacy will also be marked by an intense desire to pass on to his grandchildren and to all of our grandchildren a world where you can still find places of solitude and beauty, streams where you can still catch trout and salmon and forests where you can still find trees older than your grandparents.  That is why it is only fitting that in the last few days of this Congress we are able to honor Senator Bumpers by dedicating wilderness areas within the Ozark and Ouachita National Forests to his long, and often lonely, fight to protect our nation's most precious natural resources.  His marker also represents a world where children are free from disease and free from debt. Dale and his wife Betty have not only made a professional commitment to protecting the health of our children, but they have made this a personal commitment.  Even if Dale was still a Main Street merchant or a jackleg merchant, as he described himself, Betty would still be dragging him into these fights to protect our children's health. Although I know that she has never had to pull very hard, because his commitment comes from the heart.  Many of us will remember the Senator Bumpers not only for a keeper of our national treasures, but also as a chaser of boondoggles. Whether it be reining in government subsidies for mining companies or chemical companies, he is never one to pull punches or mince words.  In fact, one of the only reasons I can come up with for Congress still not passing mining reform is that we all so love to see Dale take over the aisles of this Chamber and entertain us with his now re-known ``Bumperisms.'' Who else would think to compare the attraction between our mining companies and government subsidies to a ``duck on a June bug.''  Of course, Dale certainly would not be one to limit his battles to planet Earth. He has also taken on the black holes we've tried build in outer space. I will not be surprised at all if we start receiving Bumper-Grams from Arkansas each week telling us how many millions we have spent in the last seven days on the International Space Station. Although this fight is not over, Senator Bumpers can leave here knowing he helped stop the ill-conceived ``Star Wars'' to make our heavens a battlefield.  Although we will certainly miss Senator Bumpers for all his one-liners, impassioned speeches, and frank critiques, we will also miss his wonderful wife, Betty. As we leave here this week, I will look fondly on Senator Bumpers future--spending his days with Betty, his three children, Brent, Bill, and Brooke and their five grandchildren.  Finally, Mr. President, let me help send our dear friend by quoting from another highly-esteemed Arkansan, Johnny Cash, ``ask that engineer if he will blow his whistle please, `Cause I smell frost on cotton leaves. . . . And I smell that Southern breeze. Hey, Porter! Hey, Porter! Please get my bags for me, I need nobody to tell me now that we're in Tennessee. . . . Hey Porter! Hey Porter! Please open up my door. When they stop this train I'm gonna get off first `Cause I can't wait no more. Tell that engineer I say, ``Thanks a lot. I didn't mind the fare. I'm gonna set my feet on Southern soil. . . . And breathe that Southern air.''  We all hope that Southern air treats you and Betty well.                          ____________________
