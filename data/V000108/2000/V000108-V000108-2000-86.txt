Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. I do think this debate is what is best about the House of Representatives. I think everyone who has spoken today is agreed on fundamental policy, and that is Kyoto has not been ratified, it is not the law of the land and it should not, therefore, be implemented.  We have had a continuing debate as far as the language that has been included in a number of bills, and I am very pleased that the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Knollenberg) and the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Olver) have worked out a compromise.  In the limited time I have, I simply want to put this debate into perspective. Kyoto did not come from the vacuum of space; it did not come from Bill Clinton's mind. The fact is, it is a point on a continuum that began under the George Bush administration pursuant to a treaty President Bush signed on May 9, 1992, that was ratified by the United States Senate on October 7 of 1992, and the instrument of ratification was signed on October 13. That is where Kyoto came from.  It is not implemented, but there are discussions, there are considerations taking place.  My concern about the language that has been included in a number of bills is that we would be placing qualitative and quantitative restrictions on thought, on judgment, on opinion, and on the preexchange of information which, in the end, is to all of our benefit to make sure that that is not impeded.  Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Olver) for offering his amendment. I want to thank the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Knollenberg) for continuing to have an open mind on this issue. Hopefully, all of us will be able to reach an appropriate compromise that allows authorized, legal programs to deal with environmental problems we face today to continue unimpeded while we continue to negotiate enhancement of the Kyoto protocol.  Mr. Chairman, I support the Olver amendment.
