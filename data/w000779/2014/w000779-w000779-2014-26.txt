I want to express my full support for the administrative guidance issued by the IRS in Rev. Proc. 2014-35. I would also point out to the Senator that the bill requires under its ``Statutory Construction'' provision of section 2(c), that any ambiguities in new Code section 139E shall be resolved by the IRS in favor of Indian Tribal governments and deference shall be given to Indian Tribal governments for programs administered and authorized by the Tribe to benefit the general welfare of the Tribal community.
