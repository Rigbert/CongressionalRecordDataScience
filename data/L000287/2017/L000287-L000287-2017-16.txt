Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record a letterfrom many of our colleagues supporting the U.S. Institute of Peace.                                Congress of the United States,                                   Washington, DC, March 27, 2017.     Hon. Hal Rogers,     Chair, Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations and Related          Programs, House Committee on Appropriations, Washington,          DC.     Hon. Nita Lowey,     Ranking Member, Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations,          and Related Programs, House Committee on Appropriations,          Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Rogers and Ranking Member Lowey: We write in      strong support of the valuable contribution made by United      States Institute of Peace (USIP) to our country's strategic      interests abroad and encourage you to support $37,884,000 to      USIP for fiscal year 2018. This is the same level requested      by USIP in FY 2017.       Founded by Congress in 1984, USIP applies cost-effective,      practical solutions in conflict zones around the world with      the mission of preventing, mitigating and resolving violent      conflict. USIP's work is grounded in its commitment to      education and training while honing best practices in      challenging environments.       For example, in Iraq USIP has brokered peace agreements in      Tikrit and Kirkuk among tribal leaders in areas liberated      from ISIS. After ISIS' 2014 massacre of as many as 1,700 Shia      military personnel at former Camp Speicher near the city of      Tikrit, USIP and its grassroots Iraqi partners facilitated      dialogues among local tribal and religious leaders resulting      in an inter-tribal agreement that formed the critical basis      for the return by mid-2016 of more than 360,000 displaced      residents.       At a time when current estimates place the cost of violent      conflict globally at more than $13 trillion, USIP serves as      an important element of the national security toolbox. The      U.S. government must have a full range of options for      preventing and resolving violent international conflicts. It      is critically important that Congress continue to support      USIP and its proven, successful record of reducing conflict      while advancing U.S. interests.       We believe you share our understanding that USIP's work      helps reduce the impact of violent conflict in places where      American security interest are top priorities. As always, we      appreciate your previous support for USIP, and we look      forward to working with you during the FY 2018 appropriations      process.           Sincerely,         John Lewis, Joseph Crowley, Eliot L. Engel, G.K.            Butterfield, Alcee L. Hastings, Lucille Roybal-Allard,            Joe Courtney, Janice D.
