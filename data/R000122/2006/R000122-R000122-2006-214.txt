President, this amendment would raise the allocation for LIHEAP to the statutorily authorized $5.1 billion. It recognizes the fact that energy prices have been going up and that we are likely not to see a mild winter again next year; that we can expect right now to need more resources. Just a few weeks ago, we were on the floor of the Senate trying to raise the emergency funding for LIHEAP because of the intersection of cold temperatures and the increased cost of fuel. If we do pass this amendment, it will increase the allocation of resources not just to the cold States but to the warm States. This will provide significant resources for those States such as Alabama, Louisiana, and Nevada that need the assistance in the summertime for air-conditioning.  I urge my colleagues to pass my amendment. We know it is going to be a problem next year. The funds in the President's budget are insufficient. We have to stand up and make sure we take care of the vulnerable people.
