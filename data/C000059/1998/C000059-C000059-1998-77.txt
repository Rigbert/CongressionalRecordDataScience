Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to John Orellana, an individual from my hometown of Corona, California who contributed generously of his time and talents to help others and to make his community a better place in which to live and work. In doing so, he made the ultimate sacrifice and died in January in the line of duty.  Mr. Orellana was not born an American citizen--he immigrated from El Salvador to the United States when he was 17 years old. He was proud of his adopted country, served honorably in the U.S. Marine Corps, and worked hard to provide for his family. Mr. Orellana was a 22-year veteran of the Immigration and Naturalization Service and worked as a special agent in the anti-smuggling unit. He was killed in a car crash as he responded to a call for help from a U.S. Border Patrol agent. Mr. Orellana was a husband, a father, and a great American who went out everyday to make a difference. And he did, some days in small ways, some days in big ways, and on January 29, 1998, it cost him his life. Mr. Orellana deserves our deepest respect and gratitude.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and our colleagues join me in remembering John Orellana. Our prayers and most heartfelt sympathy are extended to his family and loved ones. To Mr. Orellana's wife Aura, and his children Nami, David, and Pilar--we honor your husband and father and wish him God's peace.                          ____________________
