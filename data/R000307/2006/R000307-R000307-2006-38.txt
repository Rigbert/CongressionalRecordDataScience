President, let me say to my friend from West Virginia, however, if I might, and my friend from Illinois, I don't speak for the Vice President. I ask the Senator to address that question to the Vice President. It is the information in the cable which is classified, not the format. I think the distinguished vice chairman is talking about the format in another report as opposed to the report that Senator Reid quoted from, and it is that information--the cable which is classified, again, by the intelligence community.
