President, first let me acknowledge my colleague from the State of Louisiana. No person has worked harder than Senator Mary Landrieu for a State devastated by Hurricane Katrina and the city of New Orleans, which is still in recovery. My colleague, Senator Obama, visited there 2 weeks ago and came back and told me personally of traveling for long periods of time within the city of New Orleans and seeing very few homes that have not been devastated by Hurricane Katrina and were still barely inhabitable, some virtually uninhabitable. It is hard to imagine in the United States of America, almost a year after the devastation of Hurricane Katrina, that great city is still reeling from all the damage done.  I know Senator Landrieu feels as strongly as anyone--maybe morestrongly because of her personal experience--that the State of Louisiana needs a helping hand. I want to do my best to try to be on her side as she continues this battle. I thank her for her leadership on this issue.  (
