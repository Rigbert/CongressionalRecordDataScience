He has been one of the primary Members of this institution that has helped to outsource our jobs all over the world, China, India, Mexico; so I am sorry he has left the floor.  But I guess I could say, here we go again, another episode in the outsourcing of American jobs. And this one is especially outrageous, because it involves our U.S. taxpayer dollars.  The Richmond Times Dispatch in Virginia reported yesterday that the big bank, J.P. Morgan Chase and Company, which administers the Bush administration food stamp program for Virginia and 37 other States, has been exporting administrative jobs since 2001. Why would the Bush administration select a big bank anyway to administer the U.S. food stamp program, rather than use not-for-profit institutions like credit unions and other financial intermediaries located across this country?  Today now, the Associated Press reports that food stamp beneficiaries in 43 States already get help with problems such as replacing lost cards by calling toll-free numbers, and these toll-free numbers connect them to companies that have contracts with State governments, and those companies have outsourced the calls to foreign countries.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture says it would consider permitting a State government to hire private contractors to sign up people for food stamps, even though the Federal law says U.S. Government workers should handle the job.  Madam Speaker, this policy by our U.S. Department of Agriculture is not only inappropriate; it is outrageous, particularly when you look at growing food stamp rolls because of unemployment in this country and this administration not extending unemployment benefits to people.  It is also outrageous because of the growing ranks of the unemployed, 9 million unemployed workers in this country. Just in Ohio, 347,000 people without work, and many more having quit looking, so they are not even counted anymore. Why not put unemployed Americans at work at these call centers inside our country, instead of shipping out these service calls, outsourcing the work to other countries like India?  Something is haywire when we allow multinational corporations to take our U.S. taxpayer dollars and give them in the form of government contracts to companies that then outsource the work to foreign workers and foreign countries. It is absolutely indefensible, when so many of our taxpayers cannot find jobs.  It is ironic. American workers who lose their jobs to unfair trade practices might have to talk to somebody overseas in order to get their food stamps.  Think about this one: when we asked the Under Secretary, Mr. Bost, yesterday before our committee whether he would consider working with the Department of Labor to go into these pockets of unemployed people in our country and let them do the call center jobs, he never attempted it, and it did not really seem to appeal to him.  This issue came up during our agriculture meeting yesterday, and as the ranking member I asked USDA officials, since they were not willing to hire Americans, would they be willing to support a ban on outsourcing these U.S. jobs to call centers, primarily in India. The USDA, that we pay for, we pay for their salaries, U.S. taxpayers, we pay the salary of the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture, of the gentleman who was testifying before us, they said, no, they would not ban sending the work overseas.  Now, the Republican practice of outsourcing American jobs cannot end one moment too soon.  Madam Speaker, the two articles I wish to place in the Record that document what I am saying is an article in the Associated Press by Ira Dreyfuss, and the headline reads: ``Private Contractors May Handle Food Stamps,'' and also an article that was in the Richmond Times-Dispatch. The headline reads: ``Food Stamp Calls Routed to India. A Firm That Runs Part of the Virginia Program Outsourced Call Center to India.''  Madam Speaker, it would be nice to have some attention in one of the largest programs that this government funds, over $50 billion a year in various food programs, about two-thirds of that in the food stamp program, and try to help some of our own people earn some money in this country so they would not have to be on food stamps and they could have good jobs right here in the good old USA.                [From the Times-Dispatch, Mar. 23, 2004]                    Food-Stamp Calls Routed to India   firm that runs part of the Virginia program outsourced call center                           (By Tyler Whitley)       When food-stamp recipients in Virginia have a question      about the program, they get answers from someone in India.       J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., a giant bank-holding company that      administers a key part of the program for the social-services      departments in Virginia and 37 other states, has outsourced      its call center to the Asian nation.       Maurice Jones, commissioner of the Virginia Department of      Social Services, estimates that six or seven jobs could be      created in Virginia to handle the 10,000 calls a month that      are now made to India by Virginia's 195,000 food-stamp      recipients.       He said the Warner administration inherited the outsourcing      from the Gilmore administration, which signed a contract with      another banking giant, Citicorp, in February 2001.       Louis Rossiter, secretary of health and human resources      under then-Gov. Jim Gilmore, said the jobs were not being      sent abroad when the contract was signed.       Rossiter said Citicorp had a near monopoly on the business      at the time the contract was signed.       The decision to send the jobs abroad was not the state's      but the contractor's, Citicorp. It subsequently sold the      food-stamp electronic-transfer program to J.P. Morgan, Jones      said.       Jones said the calls have been going overseas since October      2001. A disgruntled local official complained about the      situation recently to The Times-Dispatch.       When the state's five-year contract expires in 2006, Jones      said yesterday, he hopes the 38 states can put pressure on      the bank to return the call centers to the United States--     perferably to Virginia.       Outsourcing, largely ignored until recently, has become a      major political target in the 2004 presidential campaign.      Although it is not a new phenomenon, Democrats are blaming      the shipment of jobs to lower-wage countries abroad for the      slow pace of job creation during the economic recovery.       Trevelocity, which provides airfares and travel service      over the Internet, recently announced it is closing a call      center with about 250 jobs in Diskenson County in Southwest      Virginia later this year and sending most of the business to      India. It estimated it could save $10 million from the move.       Richmond-based Circuit City Stores Inc. also has begun      outsourcing jobs to India. Its customer-service toll-free      line now goes to India.       According to the American Legislative Issue Campaign      Exchange, a Wisconsin-based organization, 22 states are      considering legislation to prevent job loss because of      outsourcing by requiring state and local government contracts      to purchase only American goods and services.       The U.S. Senate has voted to do the same on federal      contracts. ``I'm a firm believer that you ought to take care      of your own people first,'' said Del. Clarence E. ``Bud''      Phillips, a Democrat who represents Dickenson County.       Phillips said he will introduce legislation next year to      bar the state from entering into contracts that ship jobs      abroad.       If the jobs are returned to the United States, bank      officers have told him that Virginia will have to pay a      higher fee for the services, Jones said.       Jones said he recognizes the irony that someone in Virginia      might be receiving food stamps because he lost a job through      outsourcing. ``In an ideal world, I wish we could have a call      center in Virginia staffed by present or former food-stamp      clients,'' he said.       Food-stamp coupons are not longer given out. The federal      government now issues electronic benefit-transfer (EBT)      cards, which operate much like debit cards.       A food-stamp recipient gets a card from the state      Department of Social Services with a limit on how much the      person can draw. J.P. Morgan handles the monetary transfers      for a fee paid by the state.       J.P. Morgan has call centers in Bangalore and Pune, India,      and a center for automated calls in Delaware, Jones said. He      said only about 10,000 of the 400,000 monthly calls made by      Virginians go to India, where people handle the inquiries.      The rest go to the automated call center.       Repeated calls for comment to J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. in      New York City were not returned.                                  ____                      [From the Associated Press]               Private Contractors May Handle Food Stamps                           (By Ira Dreyfuss)       Washington.--The Agriculture Department says it would      consider letting a state hire private contractors to sign up      people for food stamps, even though federal law says      government workers should handle the job.       Eric Bost, undersecretary for food nutrition and consumers,      raised the prospect Wednesday after the issue came up at a      hearing before the House appropriations subcommittee on      agriculture.       If a state has a better way to provide services and save      money, ``it would be foolhardy on our part not to at least      consider it,'' Bost told reporters. Florida Gov. Jeb Bush has      directed his state Department of Children and Families to see      if nongovernment workers could handle applications for food      stamps, as well as Medicaid and other Welfare benefits.       While the governors's proposal envisions a U.S. contractor      with American employees handling Florida's food stamp      signups, some states already have contracted to have overseas      operators handled complaint and service calls regarding their      food stamp programs.       Because the Florida project would be lilmited--a test to      see if the concept would work--Bost said he could waive the      requirement that food stamp signups be handled by government      workers. But allowing all states to do so would require a      change in law, he said.       Food stamp beneficiaries in 43 states already get help with      problems such as replacing lost cards by calling toll-free      numbers of companies that are contracted by states to operate      help lines. Some of these contracts ``outsource'' calls      overseas, but it is unclear how many.       Outsourcing of jobs has become a political issue after      President Bush's chief economic adviser said it benefits the      economy, a position that was challenged by leaders in both      parties this election year.       Rep. Marcy Kaptur of Ohio, the senior Democrat on the House      subcommittee, said at the hearing that the Agriculture      Department should be prohibiting all outsourcing of food      stamp calls.       Rep. Allen Boyd, D-Fla., another member of the      subcommittee, said he doesn't ``understand how you would      determine food stamp eligibility without a face-to-face      interview.''       Easy, responded Bost. ``We have got such sophistication in      this country that potentially I can get a loan for a couple      of hundred thousand dollars and never see anybody face to      face,'' Bost said.                          ____________________
