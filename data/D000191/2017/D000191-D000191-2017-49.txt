Speaker, I include in the Record the following letter:         The United States Conference of Mayors, National            Association of Counties, National League of Cities, and            National Association of Regional Councils,                                                   March 28, 2017.     Hon. Greg Walden,     Chairman, Energy and Commerce Committee,     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.     Hon. Frank J, Pallone, Jr.,     Ranking Member, Energy and Commerce Committee, House of          Representatives, Washington, DC.     Hon. Bill Shuster,     Chairman, Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, House          of Representatives, Washington, DC.     Hon. Peter DeFazio,     Ranking Member, Transportation and Infrastructure Committee,          House of Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Walden, Ranking Member Pallone, Chairman      Shuster and Ranking Member DeFazio: On behalf of the nation's      mayors, cities, counties and regions, we strongly encourage      you to reauthorize and improve the U.S. Environmental      Protection Agency (EPA) Brownfields program, which is key for      both economic development and job creation In local      communities across the county.       Since its creation, the EPA Brownfields program has      provided crucial assistance to local governments for      reclaiming hazardous, polluted and underutilized properties.      To date, there have been over 26,000 brownfields assessments      and 1,200 brownfields cleanups nationally, which has led to      over 123,000 jobs. Each of the $22 billion federal dollars      that has been invested since the program was established in      2002 has leveraged approximately $16 in other investments,      close to $400 billion in total.       While many communities have benefited from brownfields      redevelopment efforts under this program, the U.S. Government      Accountability Office estimates there are between 400,000 and      600,000 remaining brownfields sites throughout the United      States. To build upon these past successes and assist in the      cleanup, reuse and redevelopment of remaining sites, some key      Improvements to the program are needed.               Increase or maintain authorization amounts       While we understand the fiscal challenges and constraints      faced by the U.S. Congress, we strongly encourage you to      authorize and fully fund the Brownfields program to at least      previously authorized levels. The Brownfields program has a      proven track record of leveraging additional investments,      creating new jobs, and redeveloping new properties, while      creating additional tax revenues.       At current appropriation levels, EPA has had to turn away      many highly qualified applicants due to a lack of funding.      EPA estimates that for the past 5 years, over 1,700 requests      for viable projects were not awarded money because of limited      funding. EPA estimates that if they were able to provide      funding to those turned away applicants, an additional 50,000      jobs would have been created along with $12 billion of      leveraged funding.       Additionally, President Trump has made reinvesting in      America and putting people back to work as key priorities for      his administration. In order to make this happen and to do so      quickly, Congress should utilize existing programs, and we      believe that the Brownfields program would be a strong      candidate for any type of reinvestment initiative. That is      why we urge Congress to increase or at least maintain the      current authorization levels for EPA's brownfields program.  increase overall grant funding to allow communities to cleanup more                             difficult sites       Although many brownfield sites have been redeveloped, what      remains are brownfield sites that are more difficult to      redevelop due to their level of contamination or marketplace      conditions. Communities would like the EPA program to be      expanded to address the clean up challenges at these more      complex sites.       We suggest the following:       Increase Cleanup Grant Amounts--Congress should recognize      the complexity of the cleanup process for larger or more      complicated sites by increasing the funding limit for cleanup      of a single site to $1 million. Under special circumstances,      EPA could waive the limit, up to $2 million per site.       Establish Multi-Purpose Brownfields Grants--Congress should      allow local governments to have the option to apply for      multi-purpose grants that can be used for the full range of      brownfields-funded activities (assessment, cleanup, reuse      planning, etc.) on a community-wide basis. Applicants should      be required to demonstrate a plan and the capacity for using      this multi-purpose funding within a set timeline in order to      qualify for such funding.       Allow Funding for Reasonable Administrative Costs for Local      Brownfields Programs--Congress should allow brownfields grant      recipients to use a small portion (10 percent) of their grant      to cover reasonable administrative costs such as rent,      utilities and other costs necessary to carry out a      brownfields project.  brownflelds liability concerns are a disincentive for local governments       Local governments face enormous challenges in brownfields      redevelopment. One of the most significant challenges is the      potential liability for local governments, which creates a      disincentive to acquire contaminated property. We encourage      Congress to revise the Comprehensive Environmental Response,      Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERLA) to encourage      and protect local communities who choose to take ownership of      blighted properties for the purpose of brownfields      redevelopment where the local government had no role in      creating the contamination. These changes should include:       Clarify Eligibility of Publicly-Owned Sites Acquired Before      2002--Congress should allow local governments to be eligible      for grant funding for properties that were acquired prior to      the January 11, 2002 enactment of the Brownfields      Revitalization Act--when there was no required standard for      ``all appropriate inquiries''--provided that the applicant      did not cause or contribute to the contamination and      performed ``appropriate care.'' For these sites, applicants      would not have to demonstrate that they performed all      appropriate inquiry.       Remove Barriers to Local and State Governments in      Addressing Mothballed Sites--Congress should exempt local and      state governments from CERCLA liability if the government      unit (a) owns a brownfields property as defined by section      101(39); (b) did not cause or contribute to contamination on      the property; and (c) exercises due care with regard to any      known contamination at the site. We suggest language to amend      section 101(20)(D) that clarifies that properties acquired      through eminent domain qualify for the CERCLA exemption for      local governments involved in ``Involuntary Acquisitions.''      Alternatively, we would suggest language that establishes a      simplified and clear exemption from CERCLA liability for      local governments that acquire brownfields sites.       Eliminate Eligibility Barriers for Petroleum Brownfields      Sites--Grantees that seek to use assessment, cleanup or      multi-purpose grants on sites with petroleum contamination      should not be required to make the difficult demonstrations      that the site is ``low risk'' and that there is ``no viable      responsible party'' connected with the site. We recommend      replacing the ``No Viable Responsible Party'' language in      section 101(39)(D) with a prohibition on using funds to pay      for cleanup costs at a brownfields site for which the      recipient of the grant is potentially liable under the      petroleum statutes. This would parallel the language for non-     petroleum brownfields sites.
