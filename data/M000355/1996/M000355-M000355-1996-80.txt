 President, the Senator from Missouri is on the floor to claim his 5 minutes prior to the vote on the Hatfield-Dorgan amendment.  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that, at 5:55, the Senate proceed to back-to-back rollcall votes, first a 15-minute rollcall vote on the Hatfield-Dorgan amendment, and that the second amendment be a 10-minute rollcall vote on the Domenici amendment.
