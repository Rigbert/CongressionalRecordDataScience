President, today I wish to recognize the 30th anniversary of the U.S. Coast Guard Pay and Personnel Center in Topeka, KS. The Coast Guard's Pay and Personnel Center was first established in 1979 in the greater Washington, DC, area. In 1982 the center permanently moved to the Frank Carlson Federal Building in Topeka. My staff and I have the honor of working with this dedicated team of leaders on a regular basis.  The Pay and Personnel Center offers a specific and imperative service to more than 100,000 men and women of the U.S. Coast Guard. Spanning from human resources, to processing, disbursement, and other services, the Pay and Personnel Center has continued to operate without much attention or fanfare but with the goal of providing the compensation and services necessary to keep our Coast Guardians focused, secure, and dedicated.  Today, I offer congratulations and accolades to the Pay and Personnel Center on 30 years of hard work and superior service to our men and women in the U.S. Coast Guard. The center is a shining example of the Coast Guard motto, Semper Paratus, Always Ready.                          ____________________
