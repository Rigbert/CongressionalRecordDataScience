Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I think this is a very worthy undertaking. As the gentleman points out, we have hollowed out so much of American manufacturing capability, but we have for years touted the fact that our leadership in aviation and aerospace, that this would be one of the areas where we would continue to dominate the world. To have the prospect of agencies of the Federal Government using taxpayer resources to outsource to foreign vendors in this very critical sector, a sector which in the case of at least one major manufacturer is beleaguered by unfair foreign competition, in fact, something we heard repeated on a trip of the Subcommittee on Aviation for the engine manufacturers and others, where subsidies and development grants that never have to be paid back and all sorts of things are made available to them that are not made available to American manufacturers. I think the audit at this time is extraordinarily worthy. I really thank him for bringing this issue before the Congress.
