Speaker, the gentleman who preceded me in the well said it very well. He said he talked about American people getting change back, and that, in fact, is what the Republican tax bill would provide for the vast majority of Americans. He then went on to say:  Hello? Should not the wealthy people get back more? They pay more.  But guess what? They have already gotten their tax cuts.  A study that was just published yesterday and is coming to the attention of the Congress and the American people shows that because of the tax cuts back in the 1970s and the 1980s the wealthiest 1 percent of the American people have already realized an average tax cut of $40,000 a year from their 1977 tax rate, $40,000 a year. That is more than two-thirds of the American people earn for an entire year let alone pay in taxes, and he is saying: Of course those people should get more tax relief.  Why should they get more tax relief? Their average tax bill is already greatly reduced from the tax bill that was assessed against those same incomes in this country 20 years ago.  But in order to provide that tax relief, guess what? Programs that most American families value whether it is the Veterans Administration which we are debating today on the floor of the House, today and again tomorrow, which, yes, they have made it whole in terms of last year's budget, but guess what? There is not enough money there to cover the aging World War II vets and the care they need and my generation, the Vietnam vets. There is not enough money in that budget. But that money will not be appropriated.  They are actually cutting housing. Is America well housed? Does the average young family who wants to have an opportunity to get into what is record-priced housing in the western United States, in my district and elsewhere? Are they getting a little bit of help from the government that they could use to get into that first house? Are other families over housed or well housed in the middle third or so of the incomes in this country? Those programs are being cut.  Medicare is being cut. The home health program is a disgrace; the cuts that were put into place 2 years ago, which I voted against, but a majority here and, sadly, a large number of Democrats voted for and the President signed is still going to be dramatically underfunded, and home health care benefits will not be extended to millions of seniors who need them in order to give a tax cut to the wealthiest 1 percent of the American people who have already gotten a very generous tax cut over the last 20 years.  Mr. Speaker, the result of all this is that we are seeing an unprecedented concentration of wealth in that 1 percent. More than 40 percent of the wealth in this country, levels not seen since the great depression are owned by 1 percent of the people, and the response of the gentleman from Georgia is: Hello? They should get their taxes cut more so they can accumulate an even bigger portion of the pie while middle-income families have both parents working and still cannot afford to send their kids to college without the kid incurring a huge mountain of debt, while seniors are not able to pay for their prescription drugs and cannot get the home health care they need, while our veterans go unserved. All those things will be reduced so that those people, hello, that top 1 percent who are suffering horribly, and, you know, they are paying only 20 percent less taxes than they paid 20 years ago in this country who are accumulating unprecedented amounts of wealth so they can see yet another tax cut.  This is change, chump change for average American workers. For the vast majority of people in this country the Republican tax bill delivers, as the gentleman said, change, chump change, 116 bucks a year for two-thirds of the American workers on average, many of them getting nothing, but $116 on average per year for people earning less than $34,000 a year. But yet, if you earn over $350,000 a year, you will get a $31,800 tax cut, more than most of those other families earn altogether.  Do those people, are they suffering? Are they struggling to make ends meet on $350,000 a year? Do they really need that tax cut? Do we have to reduce those programs in order to deliver that tax cut? Do we need such an unfair tax cut? If you want to have a tax cut thatis fair, let us reduce the burden of the FICA tax, the Social Security tax. You could do that. You could actually do that and still safeguard Social Security. That would provide tax relief to 96 percent of wage-earning Americans in a bill I have proposed.  But guess what? It does not help out those people in the top 1 percent, those earning over $350,000 a year who are paying almost 80 percent of the level of taxes that they paid 20 years ago. They need more tax relief. That is the bottom line in the Republican bill. It is delivering to the people who fund their campaigns, it is delivering to the people who run the corporations that fund their campaigns, and it is delivering, as the gentleman said, chump change to average Americans.  Mr. Speaker, we need to reject the Republican tax bill, I am certain the President will veto it, and let us get back to reality here in Washington, get back to our work, fund the veterans programs, fund the housing programs, set up fair priorities and give tax relief to average families who could use a tax break because they are not even keeping up with inflation.                          ____________________
