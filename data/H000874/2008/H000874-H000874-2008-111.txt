 I agree with the Speaker that it is our intention to move the Defense bill. We think that is critically important to do. We think it's critically important to move the other bills as well.  I was having a discussion with the chairman of the Appropriations Committee during the last vote. I asked him about his discussions with Mr. Lewis to try to facilitate the consideration of appropriation bills. My belief is that they hadn't made as much progress as he had hoped to make, but with relation to the other bills, I will just reiterate what I have said, that I continue to talk to Mr. Obey about my hope that we can find a way to move appropriation bills to the floor if that is possible. But we have not gotten any scheduled at this point. We do intend to move certainly the Defense bill. The Speaker was accurate on that.
