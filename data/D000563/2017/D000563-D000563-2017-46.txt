I have now been instructed that the personnel at the Senate cannot read this page the way it is currently written. Could I have this entered in the Record just as written with the handwritten notations on the side? Could I enter it as a graphic or artwork or something like that?  I ask the Presiding Officer, does that mean if the amendment has this page in it, that the amendment cannot be filed?
