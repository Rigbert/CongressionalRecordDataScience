President, today I commemorate the life of Robert F. Ellsworth--a dear friend and mentor to myself, loving husband to his wife Eleanor, and leader to many. In his service throughout his life as a lawyer, officer, Congressman, Presidential aide, and Ambassador, Bob met challenges as opportunities and transformed ideas into reality. His memorial service was held at St. Francis Episcopal Church in Potomac on Saturday, June 11. Along with my own statement, I ask that the following statements from that day be printed in the Record.                   Statement From Senator Pat Roberts       It is both an honor and a privilege to offer just a few      brief thoughts as we friends celebrate the unique and special      life of our friend Bob Ellsworth.       Many people would define happiness in many different ways.      However, a good definition of happiness would be Eleanor in      that she brought so much happiness into Bob's life and, for      that matter, to everyone privileged to meet and know her.      Eleanor, our prayers and thoughts are with you. I really      don't think anyone can capture or fully describe Bob      Ellsworth, but here is my take:       First, he was a friend of the Roberts family dating back to      my Dad and such a loyal friend. Second, throughout his      wonderful and most notable career, Bob was just plain nice; a      true gentleman. The late congressman Bill Emerson of      Missouri, who worked as a staffer for Congressman Bob      Ellsworth, said he was the best and most unique boss he ever      had. Bill often said, ``Bob Ellsworth would come around and      ask us if we were happy with our jobs. I first thought I was      going to be fired but soon realized he really cared about his      staff and wanted them to feel useful and if they thought they      were making a difference.'' As a Senator, I try to follow his      example with my staff today. But, seriously, who does that      today?       Third, he was not only my friend but mentor as well. He      made wonderful things happen for me and gave me so many      opportunities: serving on the German-American International      Exchange just as the wall came down and putting up with a      freshman Senator and later on the Commission on America's      National Interests with the Who's Who of America's foreign      and national security policy makers. This time, with Bob's      help, I think I actually made a difference. And, he was a      mentor and advisor to so many and like so many of his stature      and knowledge, he seldom offered advice and counsel without      first being asked. Bob Dole and I asked a lot and I know Bob      regrets deeply he cannot be in attendance.       I affectionately called Bob Ellsworth the Phantom with the      light bulbs. He would always call, drop in suddenly, like the      Phantom and then give me a rapid fire summary of what others      of like mind were thinking and what he thought. During his      dissertation and wonderful visit, light bulbs would go off in      my head always with the thought, ``Why didn't I think of      that?''       I really think Bob Ellsworth was a genius who somehow let      you believe you really came up with his latest insight. Being      an over the top Kansas State University enthusiast, genius      may be the proper description but we mere Kansas State      graduates simply said he was ``pretty damn smart.''       I will miss my friend and mentor as will so many. We shall      not see the likes of Bob Ellsworth again. I thank the Dear      Lord for allowing me to know, learn from and truly enjoy Bob      Ellsworth during this space and time.                                  ____          Statement From Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger       As we grow older, life becomes more and more lonely as the      pillars on which we counted disappear one by one. Bob was one      of those patriots who sustained our country and gave meaning      to our personal life. Over the decades of our acquaintance,      he always stood for principles I respect and was committed to      concepts of service that have made our country great.       He will be missed but long remembered.                                  ____       Statement From Former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld       Bob Ellsworth led a life dedicated to service. From his      time as a Naval officer in World War II and in the Korean      War, to his service in the Congress and as U.S. ambassador to      NATO, to his tour in the Pentagon as an Assistant Secretary      and later Deputy Secretary, Bob did not drift from his love      of country and sense of duty. Never one to give in to      pessimism or mistrust, he radiated warmth and solid, common      sense. Our paths first crossed in the early 1960s, a time      when warmth and common sense were not always in ample supply.      We came to know each other in the U.S. Congress, when      differences over civil rights, riots over political      assassinations, and rancor over the Vietnam War peaked across      the country. His was always a steadying hand. A serious      legislator, he believed that his job in representing his      constituents consisted of the often unglamorous work of      working on legislation in committee rooms and at late nights      behind his office desk. Bob wasn't a man short on courage. He      helped a small group of upstart Republicans turn out the      incumbent House leadership in 1964 and elect Gerald Ford as      Minority Leader.       It's been said by Soviet dissident Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn      that ``hastiness and superficiality'' are distinguishing      features of the 20th century, and that nowhere are they on      more display than in the press and in politics. But Bob      Ellsworth was the antidote to hastiness and superficiality.      What he lacked in flash, he made up in substance. As the      senior official in charge of Defense Department intelligence      operations, Bob manned     the ramparts against white-hot Congressional committee      investigations that often seemed to be excoriating the      intelligence community rather than helping to fix it. He      responded to partisanship with collegiality and to bluster      with thought. Joyce and I regret that we cannot be with Bob's      family and his many friends to mourn, to remember, and to      most of all, to celebrate a life lived to its fullest. Our      thoughts and prayers are with Eleanor, Ann and William. May      God bless Bob Ellsworth, his loving family, and the country      he served so ably.                                  ____          Statement by Former Senators Bob and Elizabeth Dole       Dear Friends of Bob Ellsworth,       Longstanding commitments in Kansas prevent us from being      physically present as you celebrate Bob Ellsworth's life and      legacy. But we are very much with you in spirit and in our      prayers. We share not only the grief felt by Bob's family and      friends--but also their gratitude for all he accomplished in      84 remarkable years. Along the way Bob earned many titles of      distinction. Yet no resume, however impressive, can do      justice to the character of this man. Exactly fifty years      have passed since the two Bobs--Ellsworth and Dole--first      arrived in Washington. We came from opposite ends of Kansas,      and not just geographically. But from the start we were      kindred spirits. Bob loved his country second only to his      family. He made politics a noble calling. His example of      personal civility and respect for his colleagues has much to      teach today's public servants as they strive to be patriots      ahead of partisans. Nor will either of us ever forget the day      in December, 1975, when Bob served as best man at our      wedding. The title might well have been coined for him, and      not in a ceremonial capacity alone. For the odds were great      that, whatever setting Bob graced by his presence, he was the      best man there.       It is customary to address public officials, and      particularly members of Congress, as ``Honorable.'' No man we      know did more to deserve that label than Bob Ellsworth. Much      as we will miss him, we will be forever thankful that our      lives were so entwined with, and enriched by, the life we      celebrate today.                                  ____          Statement From the Center for the National Interest       The Center for the National Interest and The National      Interest lost a leader and a dear friend with the death of      Bob Ellsworth on Monday, May 9.       Center Honorary Chairman and former Secretary of State      Henry Kissinger, a close colleague for many years, described      Ellsworth as ``a great public servant and a valued friend.''      Bob was a key member of the Center's board from its inception      and had been Vice Chairman since 2008. He was also President      of The National Interest, Inc. and a long-time member of the      magazine Advisory Council.       Bob was among the small group who advised Richard Nixon on      the creation of the Center in the early 1990s. Nixon relied      heavily on Bob's advice over the years, both in and out of      government--he knew, as he put it, that Bob was one of the      rare individuals in Washington who would tell him what he      needed to hear, not what he wanted to hear.       As a true gentleman, Bob Ellsworth always delivered his      candid views with grace and tact, to Nixon and to others.      Though very independent-minded--demonstrated in his      opposition to the wars in Vietnam and Iraq, and his      endorsement of Barack Obama after a lifelong career as a      leading Republican--Bob's personal charm and openness ensured      that he was widely respected and admired, even by those with      different perspectives. Bob was rare for one of his stature      and accomplishment in being able to take bold positions on      important issues while always remaining civil and ensuring      that differences were substantive rather than personal.       During his long and varied career, Bob was a soldier, a      politician, a diplomat, an official, a scholar, and, most      recently, an investor. This included service in World War II      and the Korean War, in the United States Congress, as      Ambassador to NATO and later Assistant Secretary and Deputy      Secretary of Defense. In addition to his leadership at our      Center and its magazine, Bob served for many years as      Chairman of the Council of the International Institute for      Strategic Studies (London). He was also a member of the      Council on Foreign Relations, the Atlantic Council, the      American Council on Germany, and many other internationally      focused organizations.       Bob was also a great patriot. He worked and fought      throughout his life to advance American leadership, American      security, and American principles. He believed strongly in      America's exceptionalism--but was convinced that our country      should also be exceptional in its tolerance and humility in      dealing with others. Bob was also a profoundly religious man,      married to an Episcopal priest. Yet as in the case of his      patriotism, his piety was personal rather than public.       Robert Ellsworth was a genuine role model--a man of      uncommon strength, determination, wisdom, and warmth whom all      should emulate. He will be greatly missed. We offer our      deepest condolences to his wife, Rev. Eleanor Ellsworth, and      his family.                          ____________________
