She is currently a Federal magistrate judge in that district, previously serving as that district's U.S. Attorney, as an Assistant U.S. Attorney, and a civil litigator. Judge Fleissig earned the highest possible rating--unanimously well qualified--from the ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary. She has the support of both of her home state Senators, Republican Senator Kit Bond and Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill.  Judge Lucy Koh is nominated to fill a vacancy on the Northern District of California determined by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts to be a judicial emergency. Judge Koh's nomination was reported favorably by the Judiciary Committee by voice vote with no dissent on March 4, more than three months ago. If confirmed, she will be the first Korean American woman in the Nation to serve as a Federal judge. In addition, she would become the first Asian American to serve on the district court bench in the 150-year history of the Northern District of California. Currently a judge on the Santa Clara County Superior Court, Judge Koh previously practiced law at two Northern California firms and worked as a Federal prosecutor in Los Angeles. She also served in the U.S. Department of Justice and she worked for one year as a fellow on the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee. Judge Koh has the strong support of both her home state Senators, Senator Feinstein and Senator Boxer.  Judge Jane E. Magnus-Stinson has been nominated to the Southern District of Indiana. If confirmed, Judge Magnus-Stinson will be the third female district court judge in Indiana history. The Judiciary Committee favorable reported her nomination, by unanimous consent, on March 11, nearly three months ago. Judge Magnus-Stinson is currently a Federal magistrate judge on the court to which she is now nominated. She has 15 years of judicial experience, including 12 years as a judge in the major felony division of the Marion Superior Court in Indianapolis. The American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously rated Judge Magnus-Stinson well qualified to serve on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana. Judge Magnus-Stinson has the support of both home state Senators, Republican Senator Lugar and Democratic Senator Bayh.  I congratulate the three nominees who will finally be considered and confirmed today.                               Exhibit 1                                                      U.S. Senate,                                   Committee on the Judiciary,                                     Washington, DC, June 2, 2010.     Hon. Harry Reid,     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senate Leaders: I was very disappointed that in his      statement last Thursday evening about the lack of progress on      filling judicial vacancies Senator McConnell left the      impression that the halting pace of Senate consideration of      President's Obama's judicial nominations is merely a      ``sequencing'' of judicial nominations that ``is acceptable      to both sides.'' I do not think that is an accurate      description of what has led to only 12 Federal circuit and      district court nominees being considered all last year and      only 13 so far this year.       As you know, I have spoken to these matters a number of      times over the last several months and have since last      December been urging the Republican leadership to agree to      consider and approve the noncontroversial nominees and enter      into time agreements to debate those they believe require      Senate discussion, but to end the obstruction and unnecessary      delays.       As the Senate recessed for Memorial Day, there remained a      backlog of 26 judicial nominees awaiting final Senate action.      Nineteen of the 26 were reported by the Judiciary Committee      without a single negative vote from any Republican or any      Democratic Senator on the Committee. In my view the cause of      that backlog is Republican refusal to agree to consider these      nominations in a timely fashion. In addition, six of the      seven Republicans on the Committee voted in favor of Judge      Wynn to the Fourth Circuit, and nearly half the Republicans      on the Committee supported Jane Stranch's nomination to the      Fourth Circuit. I have been supporting Senator Alexander's      efforts to get Senate consideration of the Stranch nomination      for months.       The same is true of the two North Carolina nominees to the      Fourth Circuit supported by Senators Hagan and Burr. It is      Republican refusal to enter into time agreements on these      nominations that has preventing their consideration and      confirmation by the Senate. In all, 26 judicial nominations      are currently being stalled from consideration and      confirmation of which only three have been scheduled for      consideration next week.       Senate Republicans have only allowed the Senate to consider      25 Federal circuit and district court nominations during the      entire Obama presidency. The dozen considered in 2009 was the      lowest confirmation total in more than 50 years. The stalling      and obstruction is unprecedented.       The Senate is well behind the pace I set for President      Bush's judicial nominees in the second half of 2001 and      through 2002. By this date in President Bush's presidency,      the Senate had confirmed 57 of his judicial nominees. Despite      the fact that President Obama began sending us judicial      nominations two months earlier than President Bush had, the      Senate has only confirmed 25 of his Federal circuit and      district court nominees to date. The comparison is 25 to 57--     and this is while Federal judicial vacancies around the      country remain over 100 with 40 of those vacancies      categorized as ``judicial emergency vacancies'' by the      Administrative Office of the United States Courts.       During the 17 months that I chaired the Judiciary Committee      during President Bush's first two years in office, the Senate      confirmed 100 of his judicial nominees. Rather than continue      that kind of cooperation, Senate Republicans have chosen to      delay consideration of virtually every judicial nominee of      President Obama's. Judge David Hamilton was unsuccessfully      filibustered. The Majority Leader was forced to file cloture      to get votes on the nominations of Judge Barbara Keenan and      Judge Denny Chin. Both were then confirmed unanimously by the      Senate. These are a few of the more than 20 nominations on      which the Majority Leader has had to file cloture in order to      secure a vote.       Before the Memorial Day recess in 2002, there were only six      judicial nominations reported by the Senate Judiciary      Committee left awaiting final consideration by the Senate and      they had all been reported within the last week before the      recess began. They were each confirmed promptly in the June      2002 work period. This year, by contrast, Senate Republicans      have stalled nominations reported as long ago as last      November and only one of the 26 was reported close to this      recess. More than two dozen judicial nominees have been      languishing without final Senate action because of Republican      obstruction. This is not how the Senate should act, nor how      the Senate has conducted its business in the past. This is      new and it is wrong.       The judicial nominations on the Senate Executive Calendar      number 26. They were each considered and favorably reported      by the Senate Judiciary Committee after a hearing. They are      each still awaiting final Senate action because the      Republican leadership has refused for some time to agree to      their consideration. As I have consistently urged since last      December, the Senate should vote on all of them without      further obstruction or delay.       The way to do that is for the Republican leadership to work      with the Majority Leader and agree to time agreements on      those on which debate is requested. If there are judicial      nominations that Republicans truly wish to filibuster--after      arguing during the Bush administration that such action would      be unconstitutional and wrong--then they should so indicate      and the Majority Leader can proceed to that matter and seek      cloture to end the filibuster.       I again urge the Republican leadership, as I have      consistently since last December, to work with the Majority      Leader to take up and confirm the judicial nominees that are      not controversial and can be confirmed without further delay      by voice vote or a roll call and to enter into time      agreements on the others so that the Majority Leader can      schedule their consideration by the Senate.           Sincerely,                                                    Patrick Leahy,                                                         Chairman.
