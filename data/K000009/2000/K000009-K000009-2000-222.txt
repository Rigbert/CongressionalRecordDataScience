Chairman, the amendment I am proposing is very straightforward. Essentially what it does is it allows the Secretary of Energy at this time of very high gas prices to take a portion of our Strategic Petroleum Reserve, draw it down, and use the proceeds to purchase ethanol and biodiesel, adding those to the reserves that we have across this country. There is no budget impact to this proposal.  Essentially what we are doing here is recognizing that rising gas prices, in fact, harm and create havoc within our economy. This is a great economic vulnerability and a great military vulnerability.  We also recognize that we want to encourage domestic production of all fuels to the best extent possible. My colleagues should know that 92 percent of the fuels, the crude in the Petroleum Reserve, in the SPRO, has been imported. So it is not domestic. In fact, what fueled America this past year, over two-thirds of it is all imported. This is not a position that we should permit for our great country.  This amendment promotes alternative fuels focused on biofuels, specifically ethanol and biodiesel. It is a very reasonable proposal. Even after being implemented, this would represent less than 2 percent of all fuel that is in the reserve.  In addition, it is very competitive in the sense that, if one looks at the prices of ethanol now at about a dollar a gallon, when one purchases the amount we are talking about here, 300 million gallons, and biodiesel at $1.50, we are at the point now where it makes sense to do this.  In addition, let me say, if one looks at the SPRO today, there are about 750 million barrels in it or allowed to be in it. But only 575 million are actually in it, which means we have a shortfall of 175 million barrels. So there is room in terms of the authority that exists within the law.  So I would just ask for favorable consideration of this. In particular, at a time when prices in rural America are so very low, let us use the cellulose, let us use the power of the fields and force of our country and help put us on a course of renewables and not such dependence on imported fuel inside this great economy. I ask for favorable consideration of the membership of what I believe is a very worthy amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.                             Point Of Order
