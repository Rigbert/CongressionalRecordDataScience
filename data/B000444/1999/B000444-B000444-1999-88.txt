 President, reserving the right to object--and I obviously do not want to object to my own amendment--we do have a time problem. I would be delighted to do that if the Senator would allow the remainder of the time on this amendment to be used on the Resolution of Ratification, so we do not use up--I have a number of Senators who wish to speak. That means I will only have 20 minutes left to debate this entire issue. I will be delighted to have it accepted. I probably have about an hour or 20 minutes or 30 minutes or 40 minutes left on the amendment; is that correct?  Parliamentary inquiry: How much time is left on the amendment?
