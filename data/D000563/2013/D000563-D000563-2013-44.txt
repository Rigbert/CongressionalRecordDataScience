President, first let me commend my colleague from Minnesota and tell him that I proudly cosponsor his legislation. I have had visits throughout my State with community colleges and have watched this work, where they literally bring employers and future employees together at a community college--an affordable community college--they get the very best training, really focused on the job opening, and when it is finished, they go right to work and they make a good salary.  I tell you, I think this is the future. This is an excellent idea. I was happy to support it. I have shamelessly stolen it and said it was my idea in a few places, but I will confess to the Senator on the floor----
