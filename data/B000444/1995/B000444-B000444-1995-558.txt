 President, we have reached an important point in dealing with the budget deficit. The Senator from New Mexico has proposed a deficit reduction budget that is real. The Senator from Nebraska and the Senator from the State of North Dakota and Senator Bradley and I, although they are different plans, have introduced proposals that are real, genuine reductions in working on a balanced budget and moving to a balanced budget within 7 years.  But there is a big difference here. I believe the one we are about to vote on is simply not fair. We can get there from here fairly. There is a fundamental difference in the approach taken by Senator Bradley and myself and the Senator from North Dakota, and others, and the Republican proposal, and that is, we put a lot less burden on the elderly, a lot less burden, or no burden, on college loans, a lot less burden on middle-class folks. We increase the burden on other elements of society. The point is, we do look at and do play a major part in dealing with closing tax loopholes.  It is a big difference. It is a fundamental difference, but this is only the first round of the fight. This is a budget resolution that does not mean a darn thing other than as it guides us. It is not a law. It does not change anything. The President does not get to veto it or sign it. We now get into the hard stuff, the hard part.  I am confident that as the American people understand the commitment on both sides to move to a balanced budget, they are going to be able to begin to weigh what the real costs are, and they are going to make a judgment whether or not cutting Medicare and Medicaid by $400 billion is a better way to go than closing $176 billion worth of tax loopholes. They are going to make those basic judgments. I think we will be back at it again. I compliment the managers of the bill for their diligent effort.
