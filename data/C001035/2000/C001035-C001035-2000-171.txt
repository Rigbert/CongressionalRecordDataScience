President, by previous consent, at 5 p.m. the Senate will proceed to a vote on the confirmation of the Executive Calendar No. 423, the nomination of Julio Fuentes. Senators can therefore expect the first vote to occur at 5 p.m. today. I thank my colleagues for their cooperation.                          ____________________
