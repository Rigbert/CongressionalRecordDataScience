Obviously as the gentleman knows, Chairman Rangel and Chairman Levin of the subcommittee is working very closely with Ambassador Schwab and Secretary Paulson and the administration on these issues.  They have reached an understanding and that is moving forward, I believe, but I could not tell the gentleman at this time what will be scheduled or when it will be scheduled. As the gentleman well knows, there is discussion with reference to Peru and Panama and actions that may be taken in Peru or Panama, and that is being discussed, as a matter of fact, I think today between Ambassador Schwab and Mr. Rangel and others.  Clearly I think things are moving forward on that, but I cannot give the gentleman any time frames.
