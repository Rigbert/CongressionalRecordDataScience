Chairman, I am concerned about this amendment and perhaps others that will be offered only from the sense of safety.  I rise in opposition, reluctantly, to enter into a colloquy with the gentleman who is offering the amendment here on our side. That is to ask, if a senior citizen, for example, goes on a bus trip from Maine or Ohio up to Canada or down to Mexico, when they go to a pharmaceutical operation and they go to buy a drug, let us say it is Claritin, how do they know that that is manufactured in any of the countries the gentleman is talking about with his amendment? Is it labeled? How do they know that it was manufactured in an FDA-approved facility?  The gentleman says in his amendment that these drugs were approved for use within the United States and manufactured in an FDA-approved facility. Does it say that on the box? Can the gentleman assure me, unlike the FDA commissioner who appeared before our committee and did not have the confidence that the gentleman has that seniors could be assured of equal content and equal inspection of these drugs? How can the gentleman be so certain that they are getting a product of equal import? If the gentleman could answer that question.
