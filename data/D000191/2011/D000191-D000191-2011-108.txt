Speaker, I rise today to commend Elizabeth Bickford, director of financial aid and scholarships, at the University of Oregon for her years of service.  Ms. Bickford is retiring after 30 years at the university. Since 2000, she has led the university's student aid programs. During her time as director of financial aid and scholarships, Elizabeth Bickford has been a pioneer and leader, including helping to make the University of Oregon one of the Nation's first direct lenders in the early 1990s. I had the privilege of working with Ms. Bickford on many student aid issues including implementation of my contributions to the University of Oregon Presidential Scholarship Fund. I commend her for making a priority of promoting financial literacy for students and parents as well as meeting the financial needs of students and their families. Ms. Bickford has led UO's financial aid programs with an eye to compliance with federal rules. A member of the Cherokee Nation, Ms. Bickford has contributed to a host of efforts throughout our state to support and promote student access to institutions of higher education.                          ____________________
