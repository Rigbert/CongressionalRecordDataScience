 Unfortunately, the widespread outrage at this budget is not limited to its impact on veterans. I could speak for much time on this floor about my concern about the other priorities our country faces--health care, education, and nuclear waste cleanup.  As a member of the Budget Committee, I raised some of these concerns yesterday with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. I was pretty disappointed with OMB Director Bolten's responses to our questions on energy policy, on veterans, and on a number of other issues that came before the Budget Committee. This morning, Secretary Snow is addressing the committee. I will leave the floor now to attend that hearing. I hope we get better responses from him.  But for now, let me just say that it seems to me that President Bush believes that in his budget veterans are a nonessential priority. That is an insult. It is an insult to them, to their service, and their sacrifice. I know I, along with many of my colleagues, will not stand for this assault on our veterans. They deserve better.  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.
