Speaker, the House leadership recently removed from the budget reconciliation legislation a provision to auction the Southeastern Power Administration [SEPA]. I applaud this action as the measure would have increased SEPA customer power rates and established a poor precedent for other Federal power marketing administrations [PMA's].  SEPA ratepayers would be adversely affected by a sale as had been proposed in the original resources package. Simply put, that type of auction sale of SEPA would have almost certainly meant rate increases to consumers, and the larger the sale price, the larger the rate increase. If the facilities were sold to a private power company, the CBO estimates that consumer-owned electric utilities could pay as much as $75 million more for PMA power; costs that would have been passed on to electric consumers.  Though I am not from the SEPA region, I am concerned about the precedent at PMA sale would create for other regions of the country. Millions of customers throughout the Nation are served by PMA's. As a Representative from Riverside, I am worried that the electric customers in southern California who receive their power from the Western Area Power Administration [WAPA] would see their electric payments increase if Western were sold. Costs for water delivered by the metropolitan water district would almost certainly go up, since power from Hoover Dam and Parker Dam is used to pump that water.  The reconciliation package does include language that will institute a study of SEPA, WAPA, and Southwestern Power Administration [SWPA] to evaluate possible sale structures and the effects of such sales. I support this language, and suspect it will bear out that WAPA is not a good candidate for auction and that any sale of WAPA should take into account a number of factors which would not be addressed in an auction sale.  While I do support the defederalization of PMA's, I believe there is a better solution than the one proposed by the Resources Committee--a solution that is fair to those entities that made substantial investments in the projects and facilities that comprise WAPA and the other regions' PMA's while at the same time, protects the customers who receive PMA power. I am in the process of reviewing a number of proposals that achieve these goals. I look forward to seeing that these views are fairly represented in the study called for in the reconciliation package.                          ____________________
