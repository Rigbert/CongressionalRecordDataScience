 I know, for example, that there is this distinction which the Senator from Utah referred to in terms of what is commonly referred to as issue advocacy. Do things on the 61st day before the election, but if it is the 60th day or closer, you can't do other things.  I am sure my friend from Utah knows this, but an agency of the Federal Government would be put in charge of making these decisions, would it not?
