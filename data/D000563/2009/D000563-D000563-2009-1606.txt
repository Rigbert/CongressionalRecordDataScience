 There are several points I would like to make about the importance of President Obama's decision.  First, when we provide family planning funds to organizations overseas that may counsel abortion but not spend a single U.S. dollar on abortions, when we provide that money, we literally reduce the number of abortions worldwide. A report by Guttmacher Institute and the U.N. Population Fund estimated that providing family planning services to the 201 million women in developing countries whose needs are unmet would prevent 52 million unintended pregnancies by family planning and 22 million abortions. So when you reduce the family planning, there are more unintended pregnancies and more abortions.  Secondly, an estimated 536,000 women, mostly in developing countries, die from pregnancy-related causes. By giving a woman family planning counseling, the pill or something similar, they will have access to contraception and pregnancy-related deaths will drop by 25 to 35 percent of women who would give birth.  Finally, the repeal would save the lives of children in many developing countries. Many of these women have successive pregnancies that they cannot control, and the children, sadly, are weaker and weaker because the mothers cannot restore their bodily strength before they have another child. That is the reality of this situation.  I will say, as I have traveled around the world with people such as Senator Brownback, the most important single question one can ask in a developing country is, How do you treat your women? We should treat the women of the world with respect. We should give them access to sound family planning. Let them plan their lives and plan their families. There will be fewer abortions, fewer maternal deaths, and fewer children dying as a result.
