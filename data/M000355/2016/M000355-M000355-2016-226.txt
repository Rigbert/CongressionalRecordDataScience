 President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate vote on the nominations en bloc without intervening action or debate; that, if confirmed, the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate then resume legislative session without any intervening action or debate.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Daines). Without objection, it is so ordered.  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the Bitter, Kim, Young, Symington, Donovan, Coons, and Johnson nominations en bloc?  The nominations were confirmed en bloc.                          ____________________
