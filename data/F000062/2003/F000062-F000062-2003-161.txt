 President, I have joined with Senators Biden, Kerry and Corzine to introduce legislation that will provide us with the necessary financial footing to appropriately execute our obligations in Iraq and Afghanistan.  In 1998, following nearly 30 years of deficits and a 17-fold increase in Federal debt from $365.8 billion to $6.4 trillion, bipartisan cooperation brought the budget back into balance once again. For the first time in more than a generation, some of the funds which would have gone to pay interest on the debt were instead spent actually paying down the debt.  Now, deficits and interest costs are growing once again. Net interest payments on the Federal debt will increase sharply, from approximately $170 billion in 2003 to more than $300 billion by 2012.  We face a host of new challenges, particularly the war on terror, the war in Iraq, and the threat of North Korea. This has necessarily led to a shift in government spending toward improving our defense and homeland security capabilities. Yet many of the challenges predating September 11 are still with us: improving education, updating infrastructure, and preparing for the retirement of the baby-boom generation, which will severely strain the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.  The Congressional Budget Office predicts that the Federal deficit for fiscal year 2004 will top $500 billion. A portion of every dollar we spend from this day forward until the end of September 2004 will be borrowed money--money that our children and grandchildren will have to repay.  It is no secret that if citizens wish to receive services or undertake activities as a Nation, they have the right to levy a tax upon themselves to achieve those ends. We have somehow lost this sense of obligation and have concluded that providing for our national defense or for the education of children requires no more than charging the costs to a government credit card. This must stop.  We are spending our way into economic oblivion. The President has decided that the best way to reelection is to cut taxes and leave spending alone. He refuses to make the tough decisions. So, with my colleagues in the Senate, I will help him. If the President wishes to engage our troops in Iraq, a decision that I agreed with and continue to support, then he must agree to pay for it.  By seeking a modest increase in the tax rate that affects those making more than $310,000 in taxable income we can pay for the President's most recent supplemental request. This bill generates precisely $87 billion--enough to cover a portion of the cost of the war in Iraq and an even smaller part of our obligation in Afghanistan.  This bill is a first step toward putting our fiscal house in order. It would pay for the President's supplemental spending request and it does not revoke the 2001 reduction in the top income tax rate. Nor would it affect any other element of the 2001 tax package. It would merely temporarily raise the marginal income tax rate on the richest in our society. These individuals would continue to benefit from the other aspects of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, many of which predominantly accrued to them.  Nearly a decade ago, thanks to the commitment of Senators from both parties and all ideological persuasions, we were able to put in motion a successful plan to balance the Federal budget, and laid the groundwork for an unprecedented period of economic growth and prosperity.  I believe this bill moves us back to this path and represents our understanding that we have an obligation as a society to raise money from time to time to pay for those activities we deem important to our national well-being.                          ____________________
