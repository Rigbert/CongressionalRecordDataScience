Speaker, suddenly the Republican leadership has discovered a crisis in the funding of Medicare, and they want to fix it. Well, they are not sure they want to fix it. They want the President to make a proposal to cut Medicare spending over the next decade. They want the Democrats in Congress to make a proposal to cut Medicare spending over the next decade. Maybe they want a bipartisan commission to make proposals to cut Medicare spending over the next decade.  The bottom line is they want someone to come out and get ahead of them and propose cuts in Medicare spending over the next decade, under the guise of saving Medicare from bankruptcy, a new crisis that no one could have anticipated a year ago during the health care debate. A year ago during the health care debate, we heard from Republican leaders on both sides of the Hill that there is no crisis in health care in America, none at all. We need no congressional action regarding health care. That was only 12 months ago.  More recently, we had the much vaunted Contract on America, which laid out the 10 most important issues confronting the United States of America, the 10 must-do pieces of legislation to bring our country into the next century. And you know what? Medicare was not on the list. I guess there was not a crisis in Medicare, or at least they did not know about it, when they were writing the contract.  Then we brought the contract to the floor again. Still, no mention of Medicare. We brought a dire emergency supplemental spending bill to the floor of the House; $2.3 billion additional for the Pentagon, because you cannot ask the Pentagon to do anything without giving them more money. We add a few billions of dollars for the crisis in California, for the earthquakes and the floods and various and assorted sundry other things that Congress always throws in when we do a dire emergency supplemental spending bill, but not a penny for Medicare. I guess 2 months ago there was not a crisis in Medicare.  What has happened since is the Republican leadership in this House pushed through a bill cutting revenues, cutting taxes, by $340 billion over the next 5 years. And guess what? Now they think we need to cut Medicare somewhere in the vicinity of $300 billion. But there is no linkage. There is no linkage between the massive tax cuts which they shoved through this Chamber for the largest, most profitable corporations, for foreign and multinational corporations, for people earning $200,000 a year, under the guise of some scant relief for middle income families and people with children. No, there was no crisis in Medicare then. But now there is.  Suddenly there is a crisis in Medicare that just happens to come close to the amount of money that is proposed in the massive tax cuts. The crisis has come now because they have sat down and tried to write their budget, and they found out you cannot hold the Pentagon harmless and in fact increase their spending, you cannot hold all of that massive part of the Federal budget harmless. You cannot deal with the existing debt and the interest payments, and you cannot cut taxes and [[Page H4553]] balance the budget. It just simply is not there.  So suddenly we have a crisis in Medicare that cries out for immediate action, for immediate cuts totaling 80 percent of the money they need to fund their tax cuts. No, the crisis is not so much in Medicare, and it is not a new crisis. In fact, Medicare, according to the trustees, is in better condition today than it was a year ago. They have put off its potential insolvency for 12 months into the next century.  No, the crisis is in the corporate board rooms. The crisis is in the country club cocktail lounges. The crisis is that the Republicans in their contract promised the most powerful and the most wealthy and the most well off Americans a nice, big, fat, juicy tax cut, and they promised everybody else in America they would balance the budget. And now they want to balance the budget on the backs of the seniors by cutting Medicare to fund their tax cuts.  Congress is going to say no to this outrage, this new abomination worse than the worst aspects of the first 100 days of this Congress.                          ____________________
