 President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of two very important bills being offered by my colleague on the Senate Special Committee on Aging, Senator Harry Reid. The legislation we are introducing today will encourage more of our nation's physicians to specialize in geriatric medicine. As our population continues to age and with the impending retirement of the baby boomers, the need for trained geriatricians will be great. In my home State of Iowa, 15 percent of the population is over 65 with the third largest percentage of elderly in the Nation.  The incentives for residents to choose geriatrics as a specialty are limited. The financial rewards are fewer than most other specialties. In addition, patients require more time and attention because they typically have a multitude of health problems. With the cost of education so high, many residents face enormous debt when they complete medical school. Institutions have trouble attracting students to specialize in geriatric medicine due to the lack of financial incentives.  The Geriatricians Loan Forgiveness Act of 1997 will provide help to residents. This bill gives the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services [DHHS] the authority to forgive up to $20,000 of loans under the National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment Program on behalf of a resident who completes the required 1 year fellowship to become a geriatrician. The maximum amount of residents eligible is 400.  The other bill I am cosponsoring today is the Medicare Physician Workforce Improvement Act of 1997. We spent nearly $7 billion last year on graduate medical education under the Medicare Program. Yet, only 200 of the over 100,000 residency and fellowship positions funded by Medicare are in geriatric medicine. This does not make sense. Medicare is a program for seniors. Therefore, we should be supporting physicians who specialize in geriatrics.  The Medicare Physician Workforce Improvement Act has two provisions to encourage academic medical centers to train physicians in geriatrics under the Medicare graduate medical education [GME] program. The first provision provides for an adjustment in a hospital's count of primary care residents to allow each resident enrolled in an approved medical residency or fellowship program in geriatric medicine to be counted as two full-time equivalent primary care residents for the 1-year period necessary to be certified in geriatric medicine. A limit is placed on the number of residents enrolled each year to control the cost. No more than 400 fellows nationwide can be eligible in any given year. This provision will encourage institutions to train more geriatricians using Medicare funds.  The second provision is budget neutral. It directs the Secretary of DHHS to establish five geriatric medicine training consortium demonstration projects nationwide. The demonstration will allow current Medicare GME funds to be distributed to a consortium consisting of a teaching hospital, one or more skilled nursing facilities, and one or more ambulatory care or community-based facilities to train residents in geriatrics. This provision could be beneficial to rural areas and other areas not served by an academic medical center.  I applaud Senator Reid for his efforts to provide our Nation's elderly with qualified trained geriatricians. I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join Senator Reid and me in support of these legislative initiatives.                                 ______                                       By
