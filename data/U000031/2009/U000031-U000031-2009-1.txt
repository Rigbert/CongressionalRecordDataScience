They had not conducted one single inspection during the time they had this authority before them.  We know that chemical companies across the country have invested more than $18 billion to try to make sure that their places are secure. We heard the terrible news this morning about unemployment going up to 10.2 percent. We have lost one in five manufacturing jobs in the last year and a half. There is almost 12 percent unemployment in manufacturing. How is this going to help us keep more job? They are going to leave. Those companies are going to look at the added expenses that they are going to have, and they are going to move like you know to other countries and other places and those jobs are going to be lost.  So I would like to think that we will learn our lesson. We can have the inspections and go through what is right and what is wrong. I would urge my colleagues to accept this amendment offered by Mr. Dent so we can bring some reasonableness to the issue.
