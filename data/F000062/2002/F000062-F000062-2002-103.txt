 President, today I stand to honor three outstanding California students: Michael Crowe, Jennifer McWilliams, and Heather Scott.  These students are finalists in the National History Day Contest. They are also among 15 students who have been selected from a national pool of 700,000 to display their work at the White House Visitors Center this week.  National History Day is a year-long event in which students prepare exhibits, papers, documentaries, and performances to explain not only the ``who'' and the ``what'' of history but also the ``why.''  In his performance ``Castro, Cuba, and the Revolution the World Will Never Forget,'' Michael Crowe, a seventh grader at Fruitvale Junior High School in Bakersfield, explores the relations between the United States, Cuba, and Russia during the Cold War.  As part of his research, Michael spoke to former Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara and to CBS anchorman Walter Cronkite.  He also gained a unique perspective on the era by interviewing the children of Fidel Castro and Nikita Khrushchev.  Working together, eighth graders Jennifer McWilliams and Heather Scott, who also attend Fruitvale Junior High, created an exhibit entitled ``On the Trail to Revolution: Ho Chi Minh and the Vietnam War.''  In addition to speaking with Robert McNamara and Walter Cronkite, the girls interviewed veterans, refugees, and a Vietnamese expatriate who lived in Vietnam during the war to understand the conflict and its effects on our Nation.  Like other National History Day participants, Michael, Jennifer, and Heather chose their topics last fall. They spent a year conducting extensive research and analyzing past events.  Michael, Jennifer, and Heather then joined over half a million other students and entered their National History Day projects in local competitions.  From these local competitions, approximately 2,000 participants are chosen to proceed to the national finals. There, they compete for cash and scholarships.  Michael, Jennifer, and Heather are among this year's finalists, an accomplishment remarkable in itself. However, these students also demonstrated great enthusiasm and superior effort while completing their projects.  This earned them the privilege of exhibiting their work at the White House Visitors Center.  Michael, Jennifer, and Heather performed truly first-rate research and demonstrated initiative and dedication beyond their years. Their projects are of exceptional quality.  These young people have earned my sincere admiration, and I congratulate them on their achievements.                          ____________________
