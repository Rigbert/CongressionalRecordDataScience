I agree with the Senator from Nevada that it is extremely shortsighted. Perhaps we are striking a moralistic pose when we say we are not going to allow prescriptions for contraception. In other words, we will acknowledge all of the other needs a woman may have, but not provide for birth control pills. That seems to me to be out of step with what American families expect us to do. Let them make the decision with their doctor. Instead, we are imposing on them what may be viewed by many as a moralistic point of view that should not be in our province. This is the first I have heard of this conscience clause, where a pharmacist, for example, might refuse to fill a prescription for birth control pills. Under this amendment that is being put in the bill, he or she is not required to do so.
