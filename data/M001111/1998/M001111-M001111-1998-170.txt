 President, I rise today with my colleagues, Senator Gorton, Senator Smith of Oregon, and Senator Wyden to introduce the Dungeness Crab Conservation and Management Act. Having outlined the history and intent of this important piece of legislation on February 12, 1998, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1726       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Dungeness Crab Conservation      and Management Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--       (1) the ocean Dungeness crab (Cancer magister) fishery      adjacent to the States of Washington, Oregon, and California      has been successfully conserved and managed by those States      since the 19th century;       (2) in recognition of the need for coastwide conservation      of Dungeness crab, the States of Washington, Oregon, and      California have--       (A) enacted certain laws that promote conservation of the      resource;       (B) signed a memorandum of understanding declaring the      intent of those States to take mutually supportive actions to      further the management of Dungeness crab; and       (C) through the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission,      formed the Tri-State Dungeness Crab Committee to provide a      public forum for coordinating conservation and management      actions;       (3) tribal treaty rights to crab under the subproceeding      numbered 89-3 in United States v. Washington, D.C. No. CV-70-     09213, are being implemented by the State of Washington      through annual preseason negotiations with the affected      Indian tribes;       (4) the expiration of interim authority referred to in      paragraph (7) will jeopardize the ability of the State to      effectively provide for State-tribal harvest agreements that      include restrictions on nontreaty fishers in the exclusive      economic zone;       (5) the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and      Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.) requires that Federal      fishery management plans be established for fisheries that      require conservation and management;       (6) under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and      Management Act, several fisheries in the Atlantic and Pacific      Oceans, including king crab in the Gulf of Alaska, have      remained under the jurisdiction of individual States or      interstate organizations because conservation and management      can be better achieved without the implementation of a      Federal fishery management plan;       (7) section 112(d) of the Sustainable Fisheries Act (Public      Law 104-297; 110 Stat. 3596 though 3597) provided interim      authority for the States of Washington, Oregon, and      California to exercise limited jurisdiction over the ocean      Dungeness crab fishery in the exclusive economic zone and      required the Pacific Fishery Management Council to report to      Congress on progress in developing a fishery management plan      for ocean Dungeness crab and any impediments to that      progress;       (8) the Pacific Fishery Management Council diligently      carried out the responsibilities referred to in paragraph (7)      by holding public hearings, requesting recommendations from a      committee of that Council and the Tri-State Dungeness Crab      Committee;       (9) representatives from the Indian tribes involved, the      west coast Dungeness crab industry, and the fishery      management agencies of the States of Washington, Oregon, and      California were consulted by the Pacific Fishery Management      Council, and the Council voted in public session on its final      report; and       (10) by a unanimous vote, the Pacific Fishery Management      Council found that amending section 112 of the Sustainable      Fisheries Act and providing for permanent authority to the      States of Washington, Oregon, and California to manage, with      certain limitations, the ocean Dungeness crab fishery in that      portion of the exclusive economic zone adjacent to each of      the States, respectively, and continued participation by      fishermen and the Indian tribes subject to the tribal treaty      rights referred to in paragraph (3) would--       (A) best accomplish the conservation and management of the      ocean Dungeness crab fishery; and       (B) best serve the public interest.       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--       (1) to provide for the continued conservation and      management of ocean Dungeness crab in a manner that      recognizes the contributions of the States of Washington,      Oregon, and California and the needs of the Indian tribes      that are subject to the tribal treaty rights to crab      described in subsection (a)(3); and       (2) to carry out the recommendations that the Pacific      Fishery Management Council made in accordance with      requirements established by Congress.     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.       In this Act:       (1) Exclusive economic zone.--The term ``exclusive economic      zone'' has the meaning given that term in section 3(11) of      the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act      (16 U.S.C. 1802(11)).       (2) Fishery.--The term ``fishery'' has the meaning given      that term in section 3(13) of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery      Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1802(13)).       (3) Fishing.--The term ``fishing'' has the meaning given      that term in section 3(15) of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery      Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1802(15)).     SEC. 4. AUTHORITY FOR MANAGEMENT OF DUNGENESS CRAB.       (a) In General.--Subject to the provisions of this section,      and notwithstanding section 306(a) of the Magnuson-Stevens      Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1856(a)),      each of the States of Washington, Oregon, and California may      adopt and enforce State laws (including regulations)      governing fishing and processing in the exclusive economic      zone adjacent to that State in any Dungeness crab (Cancer      magister) fishery for which there is no fishery management      plan in effect under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery      Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.).       (b) Requirements for State Laws.--Any law adopted by a      State under this section for a Dungeness crab fishery--       (1) except as provided in paragraph (2), shall, without      regard to the State that issued the permit under which a      vessel is operating, apply equally to--       (A) vessels engaged in the fishery in the exclusive      economic zone; and       (B) vessels engaged in the fishery in the waters of the      State;       (2) shall not apply to any fishing by a vessel in the      exercise of tribal treaty rights; and       (3) shall include any provisions necessary to implement      tribal treaty rights in a manner consistent with the decision      of the United States District Court for the Western District      of Washington in United States v.

Washington, D.C. No. CV-70-09213.       (e) Statutory Construction.--Except as expressly provided      in this section, nothing in this section is intended to      reduce the authority of any State under the Magnuson-Stevens      Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 et      seq.) to regulate fishing, fish processing, or landing of      fish.     SEC. 5. ELIMINATION OF INTERIM AUTHORITY.       Section 112 of the Sustainable Fisheries Act (Public Law      104-297; 110 Stat. 3596) is amended by striking subsection      (d).                                  ____             [From the Congressional Record, Feb. 12, 1998]       Mrs. Murray. Mr. President, soon after the upcoming recess,      I will join my colleague, Senator Slade Gorton, to introduce      the Dungeness Crab Conservation and Management Act. The ocean      Dungeness crab fishery in WA, OR, and CA has been      successfully managed by the three states for many years. The      states cooperate on season openings, male-only harvest      requirements, and minimum sizes; and all three states have      enacted limited entry programs. Although the resource      demonstrates natural cycles in abundance, over time the      fishery has been sustained at a profitable level for      fishermen and harvesters with no biological programs.       The fishery is conducted both within state waters and in      the federal exclusive economic zone (EEZ). Although state      landing laws restrict fishermen to delivering crab only to      those states in which they are licensed, the actual harvest      takes place along most of the West Coast, roughly from San      Francisco to the Canadian border. Thus, it is not unusual for      an Oregon-licensed fisherman from Newport to fish in the EEA      northwest of Westport, WA, and deliver his catch to a      processor in Astoria, OR.       In recent yeas, federal court decisions under the umbrella      of U.S. v. Washington have held that Northwest Indian tribes      have treaty rights to harvest a share of the crab resource      off Washington. To accommodate these rights, the State of      Washington has restricted fishing by Washington-licensed      fishermen. This led Washington fishermen to request an      extension of state fisheries jurisdiction into the EEZ. The      Congress partially granted this request during the last      Congress by giving the West Coast states interim authority      over Dungeness crab, which expires in 1999 (16 U.S.C. 1856      note). The Congress also expressed its interest in seeing a      fishery management plan established for Dungeness crab and      asked the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) to report      to Congress on this issue by December, 1997.       The PFMC established an industry committee to examine the      issues, which developed several options. At its June meeting,      the PFMC selected two options for further development and      referred them for analysis to the Tri-State Dungeness Crab      Committee which operates under the Pacific States Marine      Fisheries Commission. After lengthy debate, the Tri-State      Committee recommended to the Council that the Congress be      requested to make the interim authority permanent with      certain changes, including a clarification of what license is      required for the fishery, broader authority for the states to      ensure equitable access to the resource, and clarification of      tribal rights. The Tri-State Committee agrees that each      state's limited entry laws should apply only to vessels      registered in that state. I ask unanimous consent to include      the report of the Tri-State Dungeness Crab Committee and the      membership list of the Committee in the Record.       On September 12, 1997, the PFMC unanimously agreed to      accept and support the Tri-State Committee recommendation.      The Council agreed that the existing management structure      effectively conserves the resource, that allocation issues      are resolved by the restriction on application of state      limited entry laws, that tribal rights are protected, and      that the public interest in conservation and fiscal      responsibility after better served by the legislative      proposal than by developing and implementing a fishery      management plan under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery      Conservation and Management Act. This legislation will fully      implement the Tri-State Committee recommendation and ensure      the conservation and sound management of this important West      Coast fishery.       I look forward to the Senate's timely consideration of this      bill.                                  ____Report of the Tri-State Dungeness Crab Committee to the Pacific Fishery  Management Council on Options for Dungeness Crab Fishery Management,                              August 7, 1997       The Tri State Dungeness Crab Committee met on August 6-7,      1997 to review the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC)      Analysis of Options for Dungeness Crab Management. A list of      the attending Committee members, advisors, and observers is      attached. After completing that review, the Committee      discussed the merits of each option and offered the following      comments for PFMC consideration.       There was general agreement within the Committee that      Option 1, No Action, would not satisfy the current needs of      the industry. There was unanimous opposition, however, among      Oregon and California representatives to Option 3,      Development of a Limited Federal Fishery Management Plan      (FMP). Washington representatives were not strongly in favor      of a FMP, but viewed it as the only realistic means to      address their concerns for the fishery. After an extended      discussion, it was the consensus of the Committee that a      modified version of Option 2, Extension of Interim Authority,      was preferred.       There were three common themes that appeared during the      discussion. No Committee members believed that there should      be fishing or processing of Dungeness crab in waters of the      EEZ under PFMC jurisdiction by any vessel not permitted or      licensed in either Washington, Oregon, or California. The      Committee generally accepted that additional tools beyond      area closures and pot limits could be needed to address      tribal allocation issues. Finally, the Committee also agreed      that as a matter of fairness, vessels fishing alongside each      other in an area should be subject to the same regulations.      On that basis, the Tri-State Dungeness Crab Committee      recommends that:       1. The PFMC immediately request that Congress make the      current Interim Authority a permanent part of the Magnuson-     Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, applying      only to Pacific coast Dungeness crab, with the following      adjustments.       (a) delete the limitations listed in the current Section 2      of the Interim Authority so that state regulations will apply      equally to all vessels in the EEZ and adjacent State waters;      and       (b) clarify the language in the current Section 3B of the      Interim Authority to prohibit participation in the fishery by      vessels that are not registered in either Washington, Oregon,      or California.       2. The PFMC defer action on a Dungeness crab FMP until      March 1998 to determine whether Congress will be receptive to      this extension of the Interim Authority.       Proposed draft bill language for an extension of the      Interim Authority is attached.       This recommendation is not made without reservations on      both sides. Washington representatives were reluctant to      totally withdraw consideration of a federal FMP option, in      the event that efforts to extend the Interim Authority fail.      They expressed little confidence that a request for      Congressional action would be successful. Representatives      from Oregon were concerned that discriminatory regulations      could be enacted in the future by other states that could      effectively exclude them from participation on traditional      fishing grounds. They preferred this risk over the      involvement of federal agencies under a federal fishery      management plan.
