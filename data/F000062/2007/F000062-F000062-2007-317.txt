 President, I rise today to introduce legislation to allow the Los Angeles World Airportsto provide the Lennox and Inglewood School Districts, which lie directly in the Los Angeles International Airport's flight path, with noise reduction funds.  This bill would authorize the Los Angeles World Airports to allow the use of passenger facility fees for noise reduction projects at these schools.  In 1980, the Lennox School District and the City of Los Angeles settled a lawsuit, allowing aircraft carrying up to 40 million people per year to fly overhead the schools. The City also agreed to provide approximately $2.5 million to the Lennox School District.  Currently, an airplane flies a few hundred feet above the Lennox and Inglewood schools about every three minutes. The noise is deafening. It rattles windows, disrupts lessons, and makes it very difficult for these students to learn.  In February 2005, the Lennox and Inglewood School Districts settled a lawsuit with the Los Angeles World Airports under which the Los Angeles International Airport agreed to provide the School Districts with more than $110 million in noise mitigation funds over 10 years. These funds are essential for the improvement of conditions at these schools.  Unfortunately, the Federal Aviation Administration interpreted the 1980 agreement and Federal law in a way that prevents the payment of the funds under the 2005 agreement.  Thus, Federal legislation is necessary to allow the use of passenger facility fees for noise reduction projects at the Lennox and Inglewood schools. I am introducing legislation to do just this.  This bill was drafted with the assistance of the Federal Aviation Administration, and it has the support of the Lennox and Inglewood School Districts, the Los Angeles World Airports, and the Los Angeles Mayor, Antonio Villaraigosa. My colleague in the House of Representatives, Congresswoman Jane Harman, will introduce this same bill today.  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this non-controversial legislation that will allow for the use of passenger facility fees for noise reduction projects in the Lennox and Inglewood School Districts. I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 996       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. EXPANDED PASSENGER FACILITY FEE ELIGIBILITY FOR                    NOISE COMPATIBILITY PROJECTS.       Section 40117(b) of title 49, United States Code, is      amended by adding at the end the following:       ``(7) Noise mitigation for certain schools.--       ``(A) In general.--In addition to the uses specified in      paragraphs (1), (4), and (6), the Secretary may authorize a      passenger facility fee imposed under paragraph (1) or (4) at      a large hub airport that is the subject of an amended      judgment and final order in condemnation filed on January 7,      1980, by the Superior Court of the State of California for      the county of Los Angeles, to be used for a project to carry      out noise mitigation for a building, or for the replacement      of a relocatable building with a permanent building, in the      noise impacted area surrounding the airport at which such      building is used primarily for educational purposes,      notwithstanding the air easement granted or any terms to the      contrary in such judgment and final order, if--       ``(i) the Secretary determines that the building is      adversely affected by airport noise;       ``(ii) the building is owned or chartered by the school      district that was the plaintiff in case number 986,442 or      986,446, which was resolved by such judgment and final order;       ``(iii) the project is for a school identified in 1 of the      settlement agreements effective February 16, 2005, between      the airport and each of the school districts;       ``(iv) in the case of a project to replace a relocatable      building with a permanent building, the eligible project      costs are limited to the actual structural construction costs      necessary to mitigate aircraft noise in instructional      classrooms to an interior noise level meeting current      standards of the Federal Aviation Administration; and       ``(v) the project otherwise meets the requirements of this      section for authorization of a passenger facility fee.       ``(B) Eligible project costs.--In subparagraph (A)(iv), the      term `eligible project costs' means the difference between      the cost of standard school construction and the cost of      construction necessary to mitigate classroom noise to the      standards of the Federal Aviation Administration.''.                                 ______                                       By
