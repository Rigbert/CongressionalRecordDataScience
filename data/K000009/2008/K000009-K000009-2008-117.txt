It is Thursday night, almost 7 p.m. here in Washington. We have been in session all week long. We knew that FISA would be coming up. Now at this moment a secret session is requested.  As a member of one of the key committees in the House, the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, whatever is so secret has never been discussed in our subcommittee. We have been having repeated meetings every day for the last several weeks.  I don't know if this has come up before our Intelligence Committee. I notice that most of the people who are asking are not ranking members on some of our key committees dealing with the oversight of intelligence in our country, and that makes me wonder why on Thursday night, when people have had to change their plane reservations, this is coming up now.  I ask myself, is there any imminent danger to our country that would require such a secret session now, and why is the gentleman asking and not the minority leader asking, if it is so imminent and it is so much a threat?
