 President, I am pleased to join the Democratic Leader in introducing S. 12, a bill to combat international terrorism.  We all know that the primary security threat facing America is from terrorists motivated by a radical Islamic fundamentalism. Since the 9/11 attacks, we have done much to confront this threat, but we must do much more. As the 9/11 Commission reported, we are safer, but we are not yet safe. I know that all Senators are committed to the objective of making our country safer.  We must understand that those who would spread radical Islamic fundamentalism and weapons of mass destruction are beyond the reach of reason. We must--and we will--defeat them. But hundreds of millions of hearts and minds around the world are open to American ideas and ideals. We must reach them.  This bill contains a range of proposals that are designed to strengthen our anti-terrorism efforts in a broad range of areas. It will strengthen our military by expanding our special forces. It will strengthen our intelligence operations by increasing the cadre of the trained linguists in the government. It will strengthen our public diplomacy by increasing funds for State Department programs, international exchanges, and international broadcasting. It will strengthen our effort to expand basic educational opportunities in the Muslim world and combat radical madrassas. It will strengthen our assistance to non-governmental organizations working to build democratic institutions. It will strengthen our programs to help Russia account for, secure and destroy dangerous nuclear materials. And it will strengthen our law enforcement by increasing support for cops on the beat--the peoplewho labor on the front lines of homeland security.  I cannot take credit for every proposal in this bill. Many of them are ideas contributed by my Democratic colleagues.
