Speaker, it was with some reluctance that I voted for the OSU resolution.  Much has been said today about the quality of the Ohio State players, coaches, and fans. However, nothing has been said about the refs.  After watching the game I too, wondered about the refs and their ability to be employed in the future. I was pleased to see that they seemed to be in action just a couple days later during the San Francisco-N.Y. Giants game on Sunday.  I yield back the balance of my time.
