We will not feel good about it until it is turned around and we are creating jobs again, which I hope is soon.  In the meantime, we have about six unemployed people for every job that is available. These people are in a market that is terrible, and they are trying their best. Some have gone back to school. Some are getting training courses. Some are trying to keep things together with their family and not lose their home because of unemployment.  I am sure the Senator from Michigan has met with the unemployed in Michigan, as I have in Illinois. Some are, little by little, exhausting the savings they have. Even with COBRA, many people find the COBRA provision, which gives people a chance to buy insurance at discounts, is still too expensive. They are without a job. They are running the risk of losing their home. They are without health insurance for their children and are desperately looking for a job. We certainly do not want to put them in a situation where there is a question mark as to whether after December 31 the unemployment check will be there next month. I think it is that peace of mind we owe these folks caught up in the bad circumstances of our economy.
