President, I rise to outline briefly an approach with respect to the stock option issue that I am hopeful could bring together Senators of varying philosophies in both political parties.  It seems as if every morning Americans wake up to yet another headline about the collapse of a major U.S. corporation. These failures have devastated the savings of millions of hard-working Americans, savings they were depending on for their retirement or to pay for their kids' college. When the smoke clears and the fallout settles, the issue of stock options invariably comes to the fore.  I serve as chair of the Science and Technology Subcommittee, and I have spent a considerable amount of time analyzing the stock option issue. There is no question in my mind that some companies have abused stock options, using them as a vehicle for funneling large amounts of wealth to top executives. What is more, options have been granted in ways that fail to serve their intended purpose of aligning the interests of management with the long-term interests of the company.  Instead, a number of these massive option grants have created perverse incentives, enabling top executives to get extraordinarily rich by pumping up a company's short-term share price. The tactics they use can jeopardize the company's long-term financial health, but by the time the long-term impact is felt, the executives invariably have cashed out and left the firm. When an executive develops a big personal stake in options, it can lead to a big conflict of interest. Too often the company's long-term interests take a backseat to that executive's desire for personal reasons to boost the short-term share price.  When the betting is between massaging the numbers to ``manage'' quarterly profit projections and improving the quality of the business through such initiatives as long-term research and development investments, short-term profits and the value of executive stock options can be the odds-on favorite.  The abuse of stock options in the executive suite should not be taken as an indictment of all stock options that are offered.  I remain convinced that stock option plans, as long as they are broad based and have significant shareholder investment protection, can play a very important role in our economy. They can enable corporations to attract and retain good workers and top talent. They can motivate and increase productivity by giving employees a strong personal interest in the long-term success of the corporation.  The program I would like to outline this afternoon is based on the premise that it is time for the Senate to act to stop abuses at the top, while not gutting options that are so vital to rank and file workers. This can best be done by restoring the link between the long-term interests of the company and those of senior management and giving shareholders knowledge about control over the stock options of corporate leaders.  So I hope we will be looking to discuss with Senators of both parties the differing philosophies on the stock option issue, and that we can come together as a Senate around reform based on three issues.  First, the rule should increase shareholder influence and oversight with respect to grants of stock options to corporate officers and directors by requiring shareholder approval. This would help prevent the all-too-common ``I'll scratch your back if you scratch mine'' culture of clubby directors and top executives voting each other huge option packages with little or no shareholder input.  Second, new rules should seek to ensure that stock options provide incentives for corporate officers and directors who act in the best long-term interests of their corporation, not incentives to stimulate short-term runups in stock prices. I believe the way to do this is to establish substantial vesting periods for options and holding periods for stock shares so that top executives do not have the ability to quickly cash out and jump ship.  Specifically, I believe there needs to be a multitiered holding period. Directors and officers should be allowed to sell a modest proportion of shares, for example, to permit a degree of diversification; but for the large majority, they should have to wait a substantial period of time and they should be required to hold on to a portion of their stock until at least 6 months after leaving the company.  Finally, a third requirement in the proposal I outline today would be new rules improving the transparency of stock option grants to directors and officers. It is critical that better and more frequent information be provided to shareholders and investors. They deserve more information than what is buried in the typical footnote. Stock option information ought to be reported quarterly, not just annually, and broken out into an easy-to-find section in each company's public SEC filings.  In concluding, there have been two paths presented in the Senate in recent months with respect to the issue of stock options. Some now think theproblem is so severe that options should be pared back across the board and that Congress should take that action. Others say that business as usual should continue, that this is a problem that has affected just a handful of companies.  The principles I have described today lay out a third path--a path that will ensure that broad-based stock options can continue to be a useful tool for deserving workers, shareholders, and the economy as a whole, while at the same time curbing abuses by those in the executive suites whose conduct is over the line.  On the Science and Technology Subcommittee, which I chair, we have heard again and again how important these stock options are. There is no question that is correct. But I think it is also correct to say that the job of cleaning up corporate corruption is not going to be complete until Congress acts to curb the abuse of stock options.  I look forward to working with my colleagues to put in place tough, new rules that will ensure that stock options remain broad based, but also address this issue of abuse that, unfortunately, has drawn options and their value into question.                          ____________________
