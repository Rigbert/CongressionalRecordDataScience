Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1833) to amend the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act to provide for further self-governance by Indian tribes, and for other purposes, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                               H.R. 1833       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Tribal Self-Governance      Amendments of 1998''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds that--       (1) the tribal right of self-government flows from the      inherent sovereignty of Indian tribes and nations;       (2) the United States recognizes a special government-to-     government relationship with Indian tribes, including the      right of the Indian tribes to self-governance, as reflected      in the Constitution, treaties, Federal statutes, and the      course of dealings of the United States with Indian tribes;       (3) although progress has been made, the Federal      bureaucracy, with its centralized rules and regulations, has      eroded tribal self-governance and dominates tribal affairs;       (4) the Tribal Self-Governance Demonstration Project,      established under title III of the Indian Self-Determination      and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450f note) was      designed to improve and perpetuate the government-to-     government relationship between Indian tribes and the United      States and to strengthen tribal control over Federal funding      and program management;       (5) although the Federal Government has made considerable      strides in improving Indian health care, it has failed to      fully meet its trust responsibilities and to satisfy its      obligations to the Indian tribes under treaties and other      laws; and       (6) Congress has reviewed the results of the Tribal Self-     Governance Demonstration Project and finds that transferring      full control and funding to tribal governments, upon tribal      request, over decision making for Federal programs, services,      functions, and activities (or portions thereof)--       (A) is an appropriate and effective means of implementing      the Federal policy of government-to-government relations with      Indian tribes; and       (B) strengthens the Federal policy of Indian self-     determination.     SEC. 3. DECLARATION OF POLICY.       It is the policy of Congress to--       (1) permanently establish and implement tribal self-     governance within the Department of Health and Human      Services;       (2) call for full cooperation from the Department of Health      and Human Services and its constituent agencies in the      implementation of tribal self-governance--       (A) to enable the United States to maintain and improve its      unique and continuing relationship with, and responsibility      to, Indian tribes;       (B) to permit each Indian tribe to choose the extent of its      participation in self-governance in accordance with the      provisions of the Indian Self-Determination and Education      Assistance Act relating to the provision of Federal services      to Indian tribes;       (C) to ensure the continuation of the trust responsibility      of the United States to Indian tribes and Indian individuals;       (D) to affirm and enable the United States to fulfill its      obligations to the Indian tribes under treaties and other      laws;       (E) to strengthen the government-to-government relationship      between the United States and Indian tribes through direct      and meaningful consultation with all tribes;       (F) to permit an orderly transition from Federal domination      of programs and services to provide Indian tribes with      meaningful authority, control, funding, and discretion to      plan, conduct, redesign, and administer programs, services,      functions, and activities (or portions thereof) that meet the      needs of the individual tribal communities;       (G) to provide for a measurable parallel reduction in the      Federal bureaucracy as programs, services, functions, and      activities (or portions thereof) are assumed by Indian      tribes;       (H) to encourage the Secretary to identify all programs,      services, functions, and activities (or portions thereof) of      the Department of Health and Human Services that may be      managed by an Indian tribe under this Act and to assist      Indian tribes in assuming responsibility for such programs,      services, functions, and activities (or portions thereof);      and       (I) to provide Indian tribes with the earliest opportunity      to administer programs, services, functions, and activities      (or portions thereof) from throughout the Department of      Health and Human Services.     SEC. 4. TRIBAL SELF-GOVERNANCE.
