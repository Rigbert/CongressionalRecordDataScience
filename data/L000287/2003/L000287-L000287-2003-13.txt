Mr. Speaker, I must say to my colleague that I think the Members on this side, and all Members, want to be supportive of our men and women in uniform in Iraq. At the same time, I think all of us need to know very soon whether we are going to have an opportunity to engage in a full, candid, and open discussion when we speak of $87 billion.
