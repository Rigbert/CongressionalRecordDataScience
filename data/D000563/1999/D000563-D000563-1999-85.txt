Several of my colleagues have come to the floor with requests for short periods of time. If there is no objection, I ask that the Senator from Washington be allowed to speak for 10 minutes, as in morning business, followed by the Senator from West Virginia for 10 minutes, and then that I be given the floor at that moment in time for 15 minutes to address the bill that is pending before us.
