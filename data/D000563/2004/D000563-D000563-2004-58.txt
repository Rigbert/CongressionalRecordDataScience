President, this summer and fall, a lot of us have been drawing comparisons between Sudan today and Rwanda a decade ago. The October 4, 2004 edition of the New York Times contains a piece furthering this argument by one who is uniquely qualified to do so: retired General Romeo Dallaire, who was the commander of the United Nations forces in Rwanda during the genocide.  Ten years ago, General Dallaire pleaded for more troops to stem the rising tide of murders that were sweeping across Rwanda. Instead of sending reinforcements, the United Nations cut his peacekeeping force from 3,000 to 500, leaving Dallaire and his troops to witness the mass killings that they did not have a prayer of stopping. In the aftermath of this decision, 800,000 people died in 100 days.  Ten years ago, the African Union promised battalions to stop the killing but lacked the equipment and logistical support to come to the assistance of Dallaire and the people of Rwanda. Those forces never arrived in any numbers.  Today, genocide is again taking place, this time in Sudan. Secretary General Kofi Annan has recognized it. President Bush has recognized it. Butagain the world is essentially standing by.  Last month, the Senate passed an amendment to the Foreign Operations appropriations bill which provided $75 million to support an expanded African Union mission in Darfur, Sudan. This bill is now in conference. It is vitally important that it pass with this measure and additional assistance for Sudan relief efforts intact.  President Clinton has said that failure to act in Rwanda constitutes his greatest regret as president. That is not a failure that we can bear to repeat. It is not enough for the international community to recognize genocide. This time, we actually have to stop it.  I ask unanimous consent that General Dallaire's op-ed from the New York Times be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, Oct. 4, 2004]                    Looking at Darfur, Seeing Rwanda                          (By Romeo Dallaire)       Montreal.--Each day the world is confronted by new reports      of atrocities in the Darfur region of Sudan. President Bush,      in his address to the United Nations General Assembly last      month, referred to the situation as ``genocide,'' and he and      Secretary General Kofi Annan pledged support for sanctions      against the Sudanese government and a Security Council      resolution to expand the African Union force on the ground      there. But I am afraid that moral condemnation, trade      penalties and military efforts by African countries are      simply not going to be enough to stop the killing--not nearly      enough.       I know, because I've seen it all happen before. A decade      ago, I was the Canadian general in command of the United      Nations forces in Rwanda when that civil war began and      quickly turned into genocide. The conflict was often      portrayed as nothing more than an age-old feud between      African tribes, a situation that the Western world could do      little to stop. All that was left to do was wait to pick up      the pieces when the killing stopped and to provide support to      rebuild the country.       Although the early stages of the Darfur situation received      more news coverage than the Rwanda genocide did, at some      level the Western governments are still approaching it with      the same lack of priority. In the end, it receives the same      intuitive reaction: ``What's in it for us? Is it in our      `national' interest?''       Sudan, an underdeveloped, orphan nation, with no links to      colonial masters of its past, is essentially being left to      its own devices. The Islamic Janjaweed militias of Darfur,      with the complicit approval of the government, are bent on      ridding the region of its residents, primarily black      Africans--killing, raping and driving refugees into camps      along the border with Chad.       The United Nations, emasculated by the self-interested      maneuverings of the five permanent members of the Security      Council, fails to intervene. Its only concrete step, the      Security Council resolution passed in July, all but      plagiarized the resolutions on Rwanda 10 years earlier. When      I read phrases like ``reaffirming its commitment to the      sovereignty, unity, territorial integrity and independence of      Sudan'' and ``expressing its determination to do everything      possible to halt a humanitarian catastrophe, including by      taking further action if required,'' I can't help but think      of the stifling directives that were imposed on the United      Nations' department of peacekeeping operations in 1994 and      then passed down to me in the field.       I recall all too well the West's indifference to the      horrors that unfolded in Rwanda beginning in April 1994.      Early warnings had gone unheeded, intervention was ruled out      and even as the bodies piled up on the streets of Kigali and      across the countryside, world leaders quibbled over the      definition of what was really happening. The only      international forces they sent during those first days and      weeks of the massacres were paratroopers to evacuate the      foreigners. Before long, we were burning the bodies with      diesel fuel to ward off disease, and the smell that would      cling to your skin like an oil.       Several African countries promised me battalions of troops      and hundreds of observers to help come to grips with the      relentless carnage. But they had neither the equipment nor      the logistical support to sustain themselves, and no way to      fly in the vehicles and ammunition needed to conduct      sustained operations.       Today, to be sure, the international community is caught in      the vicissitudes of complex political problems--particularly      the fragile cease-fire between the Islamic government and the      largely Christian population in southern Sudan. Powerful      nations like the United States and Britain have lost much of      their credibility because of the quagmire of Iraq. And      infighting at the United Nations has bogged down an American      proposed second resolution that probably wouldn't do much      more than the one passed in July.       So in the end we get nothing more than pledges to support      the international monitoring team of a few hundred observers      from the African Union (on Friday, Sudan agreed that this      force could expand to 3,500 soldiers). Nigeria and other      countries are willing to send a larger intervention force,      but they can't do so effectively without the kind of      logistical and transportation support Western countries could      provide.       Sudan is a huge country with a harsh terrain and a      population unlikely to welcome outside intervention. Still, I      believe that a mixture of mobile African Union troops      supported by NATO soldiers equipped with helicopters,      remotely piloted vehicles, night-vision devices and long-     range special forces could protect Darfur's displaced people      in their camps and remaining villages, and eliminate or      incarcerate the Janjaweed.       If NATO is unable to act adequately, manpower could perhaps      come individually from the so-called middle nations--     countries like Germany and Canada that have more political      leeway and often more credibility in the developing world      than the Security Council members.       In April, on the 10th anniversary of the start of his      country's genocide, President Paul Kagame told his people and      the world that if any country ever suffered genocide, Rwanda      would willingly come to its aid. He chastised the      international community for its callous response to the      killing spree of 1994, during which 800,000 people were      slaughtered and three million lost their homes and villages.      And sure enough, Rwanda sent a small contingent to Darfur.      President Kagame kept his word. Having called what is      happening in Darfur genocide and having vowed to stop it, it      is time for the West to keep its word as well.                          ____________________
