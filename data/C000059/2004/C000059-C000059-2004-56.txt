Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to the community of Riverside, California are exceptional. Riverside has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Mark Hawkins is one of these individuals. On Thursday, March 25, 2004, he will be honored at the Chamber's Inaugural Dinner.  Mark began his career in business in 1974 when he obtained his bachelors degree. After completing his Masters of Business Administration from Florida Southern College in 1987, he assumed to the post of Chief Executive Office of Riverside County's Credit Union. He also attended continuing education at Stanford in 2000.  Mark serves on the board of each of the four Riverside County Credit Union's subsidiary companies as well as the board of the credit union's scholarship foundation. In addition to his leadership within the business community, Mark is also very active in community organizations. He serves on the board of the Kiwanis Club of Riverside; the Raincross Club; the Riverside Orange Blossom Festival Association; the United Way of the Inland Valleys; and the Mayor's Youth Action Plan. Mark has also been involved with the Riverside Art Museum, the Parkview Community Hospital Foundation, the Kiwanis Club of Riverside's Endowment, the Riverside Educational Enrichment Foundation, and the City Manager's office for the City of Riverside.  In recognition of Mark's tremendous contributions to our community and the business climate in the Inland Empire, he has been a recipient of several awards including the California Award for Performance Excellence; being named ``Top Company to Work for in the Inland Empire'' in 2001, 2002, and 2003; Business of the Year in 2002; voted best financial institution by the Press Enterprise in 2003; and voted best employer by the Press Enterprise in 2003.  Mark's tireless passion for community service has contributed immensely to the betterment of the community and business environment of Riverside, California. He has been instrumental in many community organizations and events and I am proud to call him a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for his service as President of the Greater Riverside Chamber of Commerce and salute him.                          ____________________
