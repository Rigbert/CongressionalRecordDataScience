 I will just say this: we know that the chairman of the authorizing committee is opposed to Export-Import Bank. He was opposed to TRIA as well. He is opposed to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. As the gentleman knows, those, nevertheless, enjoy broad-based support in this House to a greater or lesser degree.  TRIA, we passed, notwithstanding the chairman's opposition to TRIA, on a bipartisan basis with overwhelming big numbers. I think that was the right thing to do.  I would urge the majority leader to urge the chairman, who I think does not enjoy the support of the majority of this House, on his position. I know you may share that position, but I really do believe the House has a position that we ought to pass the Export-Import Bank, and we need to do it sooner rather than later, to make sure that we continue the confidence that purchasers of U.S. goods, whether they be airplanes or widgets, will continue to keep doing so with the thought that we have in place what almost every country in the world has in place, a facilitating of that export ability of our country.  I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  I do want to correct one part of history here. You referred to our chairman. Our chairman did move a TRIA bill through his committee. We did move it off this floor. The chairman you speak of, Chairman Hensarling, managed the bill, got it through the House. We got it over to the Senate, and unfortunately, the Senate didn't take it up in the last hours, and then we got it done and signed into law this year.  I believe our chairman works very hard on these issues and did an excellent job in the TRIA.
