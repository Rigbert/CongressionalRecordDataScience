 Frankly, the Speaker can call this vote. I presume, I don't know, because I haven't asked, that the result I have in front of me is the same the Speaker has.  I have no problem with doing that vote, frankly. But I think it would raise in the minds of every Member here, is that the accurate count? I think in light of that, I would prefer not to do that. So I am trying to accommodate the confidence of the Members by vacating this vote.
