 Mr. President, the pending amendment raises several questions. It has very worthy goals. We have previously adopted a McCain-Lieberman amendment dealing with some of the same issues. We need to have a discussion with the sponsors of the amendment, Senators Reed and Sarbanes and others, to see how their amendment interacts with the legislation previously adopted, the McCain-Lieberman amendment.  I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside.
