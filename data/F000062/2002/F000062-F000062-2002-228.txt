 President, I thank the Senator from New York for his comments. I thought they were excellent. I appreciate him naming every State that will have an effective gas tax, and stating that this methanol mandate is a tax hike anyway one looks at it. I do not think there is any doubt there is going to be an increase in gas prices. I do not doubt them at all.  I also appreciate his concern for farmers. I come from a State that is the largest farming State in the Union. I have spent time in the central valley of California. I know what farmers go through, and I appreciate it.  I am also faced with the problem in my State of forcing a tax hike for something that we do not need to meet clean air standards, which has questions about its environmental value as well as its real questions about what it might do to the public health, that prevents anybody's right to sue if there is a real hazard that comes about. This, to me, is unbelievable.  I will take a couple of moments on the subject of what ethanol does in gasoline. I mentioned in my remarks that ethanol is also fundamentally different from MTBE because the two oxygenated additives react differently when mixed with gasoline. I think this is an important point because this is not going to help the energy shortage. It is going to exacerbate it.  The same amount of ethanol, as opposed to MTBE, actually contracts fuel so it takes more to produce the same amount of gasoline.  The report, sponsored by the California Energy Commission, predicts replacement of MTBE by ethanol will result in a supply shortfall of 5 to 10 percent for the California gasoline pool as a whole. Thus, California's gasoline supply is not going to go as far as it did.  That is critical because we are at 98 percent of refining capacity. So I do not know how we meet the need without a huge price spike that will result from a shortage of gasoline, and that is why I think for my State this mandate actually produces a very egregious gas spike. It also can impact refineries very critically.  So what I have tried to point out today is that essentially this mandate triples the amount of ethanol from 1.7 billion gallons used nationally today to 5 billion gallons nationally by 2012.  Secondly, because of the way the credit situation is set up, one pays whether they use it or not.  Thirdly, what it does to gas prices.  Fourthly, the market concentration of ethanol: 41 percent from one company, 71 percent from eight companies. That in itself creates a problem that if there is a shortfall the price can be manipulated.  I have mentioned the environmental problems, that we can anticipate the smell in the summer months will get worse, not better, because of the use of ethanol. I also indicated that essentially over the 9 years everybody should know that this is a $7 billion cut in the highway trust fund.  There is another point I would like to make. The ethanol mandate essentially helps the producer. Only 30 percent goes to the farmers, and about 70 percent goes to producers. This is a windfall for those companies, any way you look at it. The New York Times ran an editorial pointing this out, mentioning that an energy economist estimated 30 percent of the cost will end up in the pockets of farmers, while about 70 percent will go to the processors, such as ADM. This mandate is a ridiculously expensive way to subsidize farmers.  Additionally, it cuts imports by about only 9,000 barrels, of about 8 million barrels. So no one can say this saves a great deal of our energy requirements related to fuel.  I ask unanimous consent this be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, July 8, 1994]                       This Clean Air Looks Dirty       The Environmental Protection Agency has effectively ordered      refiners to add corn-based ethanol to make gasoline      environmentally friendly. But the added ethanol will not      clean the air beyond what the 1990 Clean Air Act would      already require; nor will it, as advocates claim, raise farm      income very much or significantly cut oil imports.       What the E.P.A.'s rule will do is take money from consumers      and taxpayers and hand it over to Archer Daniels Midland,      which produces about 60 percent of the nation's supply of      ethanol. It is certainly no coincidence that A.D.M.'s chief      executive, Dwayne Andreas, is a major political contributor;      he donated $100,000 to a recent Democratic fund-raising      dinner. The Clean Air Act requires high-smog areas to phase      in use of ``reformulated'' gasoline whose weight is at least      2 percent oxygen; the goal was to reduce pollution by      replacing gasoline with oxygenates. The E.P.A. order would      now add another requirement: 30 percent of the oxygenates      would have to come from ``renewable'' resources--which in      reality means corn-based ethanol.       Because the oxygen content of reformulated gasoline remains      unchanged, the order will not reduce smog-creating emissions.      But by forcing refiners to use ethanol rather than less      expensive oxygenates like methanol, the rule will drive up      the cost of gasoline. Indeed, ethanol remains a high-cost      additive even though it benefits from substantial tax breaks.      And some experts argue that ethanol may be environmentally      damaging because coal used in producing it contributes to      carbon dioxide emissions, adding to global warming.       David Montgomery, an energy economist for Charles River      Associates, estimates that only 30 percent of the cost of      ethanol will wind up in the pockets of farmers while about 70      percent will go to processors like A.D.M. So the rule is a      ridiculously expensive way to subsidize farmers. And the      addition of ethanol will cut imports by only 9,000 barrels      out of about eight million barrels a day.       Carol Browner, head of the E.P.A., asserts that the policy      will spur development of renewable energy sources. But the      impact looms small when stacked against the obvious defects.      President Clinton is twisting high-minded environmental      promises into low-minded favors for special interests. additional gasoline costs from proposed renewable fuels standard for               years 2003-2007 (average increase in $/gal)       Hart Downstream Energy Services (Hart) compiled the      following information based on the recent analysis from the      Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration      (EIA). According to EIA's analysis, the impact of the fuels      provisions contained in S517 will cause conventional gasoline      prices to rise by 4 cents per gallon, and Reformulated      Gasoline (RFG) prices to rise by approximately 9.75 cents per      gallon.       Assuming annual growth in U.S. gasoline demand of 2      percent, Hart measured the impact on each individual state by      calculating the total gasoline cost increase and the total      gallons of conventional gasoline and/or RFG sold in each      state.------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                               Gasoline                            State                                price                                                               increase------------------------------------------------------------------------Alabama.....................................................       0.04Alaska......................................................       0.04Arizona.....................................................       0.076Arkansas....................................................       0.04California..................................................       0.096Colorado....................................................       0.04Connecticut.................................................       0.097Delaware....................................................       0.097District of Columbia........................................       0.097Florida.....................................................       0.04Georgia.....................................................       0.04Hawaii......................................................       0.04Idaho.......................................................       0.04Illinois....................................................       0.073Indiana.....................................................       0.049Iowa........................................................       0.04Kansas......................................................       0.04Kentucky....................................................       0.054Louisiana...................................................       0.042Maine.......................................................       0.04Maryland....................................................       0.091Massachusetts...............................................       0.097Michigan....................................................       0.04Minnesota...................................................       0.04Missouri....................................................       0.056Mississippi.................................................       0.04Montana.....................................................       0.04Nebraska....................................................       0.04New Hampshire...............................................       0.084New Jersey..................................................       0.091New Mexico..................................................       0.04New York....................................................       0.071Nevada......................................................       0.04North Carolina..............................................       0.04North Dakota................................................       0.04Ohio........................................................       0.04Oklahoma....................................................       0.04Oregon......................................................       0.04Pennsylvania................................................       0.055Rhode Island................................................       0.097South Carolina..............................................       0.04South Dakota................................................       0.04Tennessee...................................................       0.04 Texas.......................................................       0.057Utah........................................................       0.04Vermont.....................................................       0.04Virginia....................................................       0.072Washington..................................................       0.04West Virginia...............................................       0.04Wisconsin...................................................       0.055Wyoming.....................................................       0.04     Aggregate Annual Cost Impact of All 50 States: $8,389                           Billion------------------------------------------------------------------------Source: Energy Information Administration (EIA), ``Impact of Renewable  Fuels Provisions of S1766,'' March 12, 2002.
