Speaker, it is with great honor and pleasure that I stand before you today to recognize the Union Benefica Mexicana (U.B.M.) on its many accomplishments throughout its 50 years of service to the people of Northwest Indiana and Mexico. This exceptional milestone will be highlighted at the annual Mexican Day Parade to be held on Sunday, September 10, 2006, in East Chicago, Indiana.  The U.B.M., officially founded in November 1956, was the result of a merger between three established organizations: the Cuatemoc Association, the Benito Juarez Association, and the Union of Latin Steel Workers. Since its inception, the U.B.M. has always taken pride in being a pillar of the Mexican Community. They have always made it a priority to remember and celebrate Mexico's independence, through the organization of parades and festivities. At the same time, they have focused on improving the lives of the youth, speaking out against discrimination, and assisting those in need, both here in Northwest Indiana and throughout Mexico.  Throughout its history, the U.B.M. has been instrumental in improving the quality of life in the Mexican community. The efforts of the U.B.M. have been felt by every generation, but nowhere has the selfless commitment of its members been demonstrated more than to the youth of Northwest Indiana and Mexico. Locally, the U.B.M. has a strong tradition of sponsoring youth activities, such as Little League baseball teams, soccer teams, boxing teams, and folkloric dance groups, as well as organizing special events, such as Christmas and Halloween parties and the annual Fiesta De Los Ninios celebration.  In addition, the U.B.M.'s commitment to improving educational opportunities for the youth of the community is evidenced by their sponsorship of storytelling sessions by renowned authors, their participation in public library reading programs, and training seminars focused on public speaking and artistic performance. The U.B.M.'s dedication to the youth, specifically towards young women in the community, is further demonstrated by an annual program which, with the support of local elected officials, awards scholarships to three deserving young women each year.  Outside of the United States, the U.B.M.'s commitment to the people of Mexico is a shining example of the dedication, generosity, andcompassion found in the people of Northwest Indiana. The U.B.M's efforts in Mexico, throughout the years, have included relief for victims of natural disasters in Mexico City, Acapulco, Oaxaca, and Jalisco, to name a few. The U.B.M. has also conducted fundraising efforts that have led to the building of churches in El Llano, Michoacan, and Aguas Caliente, as well as the purchase of an ambulance in Nuevo Leon. In addition, to assist Mexican families during the most difficult of times, the U.B.M. has demonstrated its benevolence by providing financial assistance to families in order to assist with the transporting of deceased relatives back to Mexico.  Mr. Speaker, at this time, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring and congratulating the Union Benefica Mexicana, its members, and its President, Mr. Tony Barreda, on the organization's 50th anniversary. Their many accomplishments, their tireless efforts to improve the community, and their service to the people of Northwest Indiana and Mexico will forever be remembered.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Pages E1649-E1650]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                   TRIBUTE TO UNION BENEFICA MEXICANA                                 ______                                                         HON.
