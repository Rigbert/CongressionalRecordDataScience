President, Vermonters have long believed that the preservation of our history, from buildings to manuscripts to celebratory traditions, inform the present and future as much as they honor the past. Last month, the people of Orleans County, in Vermont's rural Northeast Kingdom, came together to restore an historic school house to its original location. What makes this story all the more remarkable is that the physical journey to return the schoolhouse was undertaken by a team of 40 oxen assembled by residents and chapters of the 4-H.  It was Alexander Twilight's vision, as headmaster of the school, to have a central school in every Vermont county that would bring together and educate Vermont's students from neighboring towns.  Born and raised in Corinth, VT, Alexander Twilight studied at Middlebury College and became the first African American known to have graduated from a U.S college or university. An active community member, Twilight was not only an educator, but also served as a local minister and politician.  In Vermont, we take great pride in being a forward-thinking State. This progressive nature dates back to the mid-1800s, pre-American Civil War, when the town of Brownington in Orleans County was an intellectual hub in New England. Twilight, and his beloved Orleans County Grammar School, have become a symbol of these times.  The recent move of the schoolhouse by the pulling of a team of oxen, coaxed on by area children as they walked beside the team, would surely have delighted Mr. Twilight. I ask unanimous consent that an August 2, 2016, article from The Burlington Free Press, ``1823 school to move by oxen to original site,'' be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Burlington Free Press, Aug. 2, 2016]              1823 School To Move by Oxen to Original Site                           (By Sally Pollak)       An 1823 schoolhouse will be returned to its original site      Monday when 40 oxen pull the Orleans County Grammar School      one-third of a mile down Hinman Settler Road in Brownington.      The journey by oxen will take the school from Brownington      village to a neighborhood of historic and educational      significance.       The school will return to its place near the Old Stone      House Museum, a four-story building that was constructed in      1836 to be the school dormitory. The granite dormitory,      called Athenian Hall, was built by Alexander Twilight, who      served as the school's headmaster from 1829 until a stroke in      1855. Twilight died two years later.       Twilight, who was black, grew up in Corinth and graduated      from Middlebury College in 1823. He was the first African      American person to graduate from a college or university in      this country, according to Middlebury and other sources.       ``Alexander Twilight actually imagined that this was going      to become a big center of learning,'' said Peggy Day Gibson,      director of the Old Stone House Museum. ``When he built the      Old Stone House as a dorm in 1836, I think he envisioned that      this was the first big building. He felt that a central      school, a really good institution in every county, was the      way to go.''       The school fell into disuse after the Civil War, the      school's account book indicates. It appears the school did      not operate from 1865 until 1870, Gibson said. By then, it      had moved from its location at Prospect Hill into the village      center, Gibson said.       ``It was more convenient'' to have the school in the      village, Gibson said. The relocation was in keeping with a      trend to de-centralize education, a movement that was opposed      by Twilight when he served in the Vermont Statehouse,      according to Gibson.       Twilight's election to the Vermont Legislature in 1836,      representing Brownington, made him the nation's first black      elected official.       ``Alexander Twilight thought education is better served if      you have a very high quality central school,'' she said.       But local towns, including Barton, Craftsbury, Derby and      Glover, began to establish their own schools. ``One by one      these towns got their own schools,'' Gibson said. ``They took      back their kids and their tax money.''                  Students from Brownington and beyond       In Twilight's life, Orleans County Grammar School educated      students from     Brownington, surrounding farm towns, and Quebec. The      dormitory housed 50 students, boys and girls. Twilight and      his wife, Mercy Twilight, housed 11 female students on the      top floor of their house across the way.       Students moved to the grammar school after attending one      room schoolhouses in their villages through eighth grade.      Under Twilight's direction, Orleans County Grammar School      taught students from grades nine through the first two years      of college. The school offered classes in Greek, Latin,      trigonometry, physics, chemistry and other subjects, Gibson      said.       As its curriculum expanded, Twilight saw the need for a      dormitory--a building that bears a striking resemblance to      Painter Hall at Twilight's alma mater. The building, which      opened as a museum in 1925, has Twilight's signature on the      back of a fourth-floor door.       Twilight was a teaching principal who also served as      minister of the Brownington Congregational Church. Services      were held on the second floor of the school before a church      was built in 1841. The church and the school (in its original      site) were on either side of the town green.       Moving the school back to this place will enable the      historical society to tell the story of a region more fully      and accurately, Gibson said.       ``There has always been this desire of the Orleans County      Historical Society--which owns and manages the museum--to try      to get the neighborhood back to its (original)      configuration,'' Gibson said. ``To tell the story, the      history, it will be great to have the school back here.''       The enclave of historic buildings in Brownington includes      the former home of Samuel Read Hall, a colleague of      Twilight's at Orleans County Grammar School. Hall taught at      the school and was, according to Gibson, the country's first      teacher-educator.       Hall founded the first teacher training school, which was      in Concord. He was the author of the first training manual      for teachers published in this country, ``Lectures on School      Keeping,'' Gibson said. Hall succeeded Twilight as      headmaster.       (The museum purchased Hall's house in 2005, and restored it      in 2008. It is used for a variety of events, including on      Monday a barbecue for the oxen teamsters.)       ``This was a really happening, intellectual vibrant      neighborhood, all built during the 1820s and 1830s,'' Gibson      said. ``It was a center of progressive education in New      England. This was the main road, the stage route, between      Boston and Montreal, and this is what was happening.''                Town gives school to historical society       Last year at Town Meeting, the people of Brownington voted      to give the grammar school to the Orleans County Historical      Society, according to Gibson and the town clerk.       Terms of the gift include the building's continued function      as a community gathering place. The Brownington Grange, for      example, has met on the second floor of the building since      1874, and will continue to do so at the new site, Gibson      said.       With the addition of the school, Orleans County Society      Historical Society now owns seven historical buildings in      Prospect Hill, built from 1823 to 1841. The Brownington      neighborhood is on the National Register of Historic Places,      Gibson said.       The 40 animals that will move the school Monday come from      4-H groups in Randolph and North Haverhill, New Hampshire,      and from local residents, Gibson said.       Messier House Moving from East Montpelier will move the      building onto the road. The oxen will get hitched to the old      school, and start walking.       ``If the oxen can pull it up the road, it will be smooth as      silk,'' she said. ``This is performance art.''                          ____________________
