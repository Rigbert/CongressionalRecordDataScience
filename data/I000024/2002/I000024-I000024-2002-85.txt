Utilizing both private and public resources, the NYSP successfully partners with the National Collegiate Athletic Association, NCAA, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, HHS, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, HUD, and 200 institutions of higher learning across the country to provide an enriching summer experience for kids from disadvantaged backgrounds.  Each participant in the National Youth Sports Program engages with a caring, dedicated adult volunteer while being exposed to the skills, discipline, and self-esteem that organized sports provide. Each student also receives academic enrichment in the classroom, instruction on healthy living and drug and alcohol abuse prevention, leadership training, and a comprehensive medical exam. Collegiate athletes and others from the community volunteer for the five-week program to nurture kids and promote their development of body and mind. The improvement of physical fitness through a variety of daily activities from swimming to soccer is a key component of the program. Using the vehicle of high-energy sports, each student is able to learn valuable life lessons. The academic portion of the National Youth Sports Program has evolved since its beginnings to include special enrichment for math and science and useful computer training. To encourage life-long health and physical fitness, substance abuse prevention training is incorporated at several program sites, and every child receives a thorough medical exam by a local doctor. Quality medical attention is a luxury that many of these children do not otherwise have.  President Bush has encouraged our Nation to come together to build communities of character. The National Youth Sports Program is truly a nation-wide community effort. In forty-nine states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, volunteers give their time to help young people strive for their best, develop body and mind, and build strong character.  In support of the continued success and vision of the National Youth Sports Program, today I am introducing the K.I.D.S. Act: Keeping Inspiration and Development Strong. This bill amends the Community Services Block Grant Act to reauthorize appropriations for the National Youth Sports Program at $20 million for Fiscal Year 2003 and provides for its authorization through Fiscal Year 2008. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this legislation and to make the development of our Nation's greatest resource, children, a national priority.  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.  Their being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1911       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Keep Inspiration and      Development Strong Act'' or the ``KIDS Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds that--       (1) since 1968, when the National Youth Sports Program      (referred to in this Act as the `Program') began, the Program      has provided a character-building environment for low-income      children to develop athletic, educational, and leadership      skills;       (2)(A) the Program utilizes community resources, private      funding, and public funding to carry out the Program's goals;      and       (B) for every $1 in Federal funds appropriated for the      Program, the Program receives nearly $3 from private sources,      through cash contributions or services provided at Program      sites;       (3)(A) the continued investment of Federal resources in the      Program is in the Nation's best interest, especially given a      recent increase in child obesity in the United States; and       (B) the Surgeon General's report to the President,      published in the fall of 2000 and     entitled ``Promoting Better Health for Young People Through      Physical Activity and Sports'', indicated that child obesity      had doubled in the preceding 20 years;       (4)(A) the Program enhances the health of children by      providing quality medical care; and       (B) in 2001, 77,106 medical examinations were administered      at Program sites for children who might otherwise not have      visited a doctor;       (5) the Program encourages educational growth in children      by exposing the children to a collegiate atmosphere at an      early age and establishing higher education as a natural life      goal for the children;       (6) the Program is truly a national program, expanding in      2001 to college and university campuses in 49 States, the      District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico;      and       (7) the Nation can best prepare the children of the United      States to embrace their future by encouraging healthy bodies      and healthy minds.     SEC. 3. REAUTHORIZATION.       Section 682(g) of the Community Services Block Grant Act      (42 U.S.C. 9923(g)) is amended to read as follows:       ``(g) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are      authorized to be appropriated to carry out this section      $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2003 and such sums as may be      necessary for each of fiscal years 2004 through 2008.''.
