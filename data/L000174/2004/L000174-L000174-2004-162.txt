President, as we go out of session for the long recess at the end of this week, I am disappointed to report that Congress seems content to let the issue of foreign prisoner abuse linger without effective congressional oversight.  The House Armed Services Committee made it clear weeks ago that it believed the ongoing military investigations into the abuses were sufficient. Until today, the Senate Armed Services Committee had not held a hearing on the prisoner abuse issue in more than a month. Chairman Warner called a hearing this morning to hear a report on one of the investigations: an assessment of Army detention operation doctrine and training, completed by the Army Inspector General.  Waiting for the administration to investigate itself is not the answer. There are at least four completed and seven ongoing military reviews into the treatment of prisoners held in detention facilities in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Guantanamo Bay. While these reviews are necessary, they fail to address critical issues: What role did White House officials, the Justice Department and other agencies play in developing the policies that allowed these abuses to occur? The military investigations may uncover what went wrong at the bottom of the chain of command, but it will take aggressive congressional oversight to discover what went wrong at the top of the chain.  We need to get to the bottom of this scandal, but we also need to get to the top of it. Only by doing that can we responsibly put it behind us and repair the damage it threatens to our security, to our credibility and to the safety of our troops.  Numerous attempts in Congress to uncover the truth have failed because Republicans have circled the wagons and refused to support oversight efforts. In the past week, Democratic members of the House introduced resolutions requiring the Secretary of State and the Attorney General to turn over all documents related to the treatment of prisoners in Iraq, Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay. The resolutions failed on straight party-line votes, first on July 15 in the House International Relations Committee, and yesterday in the House Judiciary Committee.  Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee tried to make progress as long ago as June 17, 2004, but the Committee, on a party-line vote, rejected a subpoena resolution for documents relating to the interrogation and treatment of detainees. Since that date, no action has been taken by the Senate Judiciary Committee, despite the clear need to resolve these issues.  In the June 17 Committee meeting, and in subsequent days on the Senate Floor, several Senators said that weshould give the administration more time to respond to inquiries, even though some of us had been asking for information for more than a year. Questions were submitted to the Attorney General on June 15, following his appearance before the Committee a week earlier. In the June 8 hearing, the Attorney General refused to provide information and essentially demanded that the Committee issue a subpoena for the requested materials.  On June 17, Democratic Judiciary Committee members were urged to withhold a subpoena and to give the Attorney General until the end of the month to respond. At that time, Chairman Hatch said he believed the administration should comply; he said that it was ``the right thing to do.'' He said that if the administration did not respond by the end of June, then ``I may very well vote for a subpoena at that time.'' That same day, Senator DeWine said, ``I think the administration has to [clarify the policy] and has to release the information that will clarify that.'' Senator Specter said, ``I believe that this committee ought to know what the interrogation practices are and I am prepared to pursue them.'' But all in all, the Republicans asked us to give the Department more time, to wait for the Attorney General to answer our questions.  And then, the Attorney General--through an aide--on July 1, again thumbed his nose at his obligations to the Committee of jurisdiction over the Department of Justice. He refused to provide a comprehensive set of answers to questions submitted by the nine Democratic members of this Committee, he refused to provide almost all of the documents that were requested, and, again, he refused even to provide an index of the documents being withheld. Because of the continued stonewalling by the administration, Congress and its committees of jurisdiction over the Department of Justice remain largely in the dark about these pertinent matters.  Other Senate committees have faced similar obstacles, even when there have been bipartisan requests for information. The Pentagon played games with the Senate Armed Services Committee for seven weeks before showing members the reports on treatment of prisoners in Iraq produced by the International Committee of the Red Cross, ICRC. While such reports are generally not released, the ICRC agreed early on that members of Congress should have access to them on a confidential basis. Members of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees were first shown ICRC reports on Iraq last Wednesday, July 14, after having requested them in early June.  Access to these reports was extremely limited, causing some Members of the House Armed Services Committee to complain that the information was stale and that Pentagon briefers were unable to shed light on the abuses. It is puzzling that Members of Congress--and specifically Members of the committees of jurisdiction--should be treated so incidentally.  The ICRC reports did make an important contribution, however. They apparently confirm that U.S. officials should have been alerted to the prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib prison months before the Pentagon announced an investigation on January 16, 2004, and before General Taguba was assigned to lead this inquiry on January 31, 2004. According to House members, the ICRC reports alleged serious abuses at Abu Ghraib last fall, a time period that coincides with the point at which U.S. military intelligence reportedly took control of certain cellblocks of Abu Ghraib. In addition to the ICRC reports, the New York Times has reported that in November 2003, a small group of interrogators at Abu Ghraib began sharing allegations of prisoner abuse with senior officers. It is hard to comprehend the administration's apparent failure to respond to the ICRC and to internal military reports of abuse for weeks or months in late fall and early winter.  Some individuals who committed abusive acts are being punished, as they must be. But this issue runs much deeper. What of those who gave the orders, set the tone, or looked the other way? What of the White House and Pentagon lawyers who tried to justify the use of torture in their legal arguments? The White House has now disavowed the analysis contained in the August 1, 2002, Office of Legal Counsel memorandum. That memo, which was sent to the White House Counsel, argued that for acts to rise to the level of torture, they must go on for months or even years, or be so severe as to generate the type of pain that would result from organ failure or even death. The White House and the Department of Justice now call that memo ``irrelevant'' and ``unnecessary'' and say that DOJ will spend weeks rewriting its analysis.  A troubling editorial in the July 15 Washington Post charges that several detainees in secret CIA custody have probably been tortured, and that the August 1, 2002, memo was written after those acts occurred in order to justify the acts as legal.  Meanwhile, we continue to hear of more documents. The Department of Justice admitted in the July 1 letter to the Judiciary Committee that it had ``given specific advice concerning specific interrogation practices,'' but would not disclose such advice to members of the Committee, who are duly elected representatives of the people of the United States, as well as members of the committee of oversight for the Department of Justice. USA Today reported on June 28 that the Justice Department issued a memo in August 2002 that ``specifically authorized the CIA to use `waterboarding,' '' an interrogation technique that is designed to make a prisoner believe he is suffocating. This memo is reportedly classified and has not been released. According to USA Today: ``Initially, the Office of Legal Counsel was assigned the task of approving specific interrogation techniques, but high-ranking Justice Department officials intercepted the CIA request, and the matter was handled by top officials in the Deputy Attorney General's office and Justice's Criminal Division.''  While former administration officials grant press interviews and write opinion articles denying wrongdoing, and the White House and Justice Department hold closed briefings for the media to disavow the reasoning of this previously relied upon memoranda and to characterize what happened, Senators of the United States are denied basic information and access to the facts. I would hope that the significance of such unilateralism and arrogance shown to the Congress and to its oversight committees will register with each and every Member of this body.  These memos, which may have governed official action for nearly two years, are of particular concern because so much of what is happening in detention centers remains hidden. In addition to Abu Ghraib in Iraq, Bagram in Afghanistan, and Guantanamo Bay, several shadowy detention centers are operated by the intelligence agencies or possibly the military, some under total secrecy. A report on secret detentions was released on June 17, 2004, by Human Rights First, a non-profit research and advocacy organization formerly called the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights. This report raises many important questions on the issue of foreign prisons. I will ask unanimous consent that the introduction be printed in the Record. The report, Ending Secret Detentions, describes a number of officially undisclosed locations that sources--typically unnamed government sources quoted in the press--have described as detention centers for terrorism suspects. These sources have discussed facilities in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Jordan, Diego Garcia, and on U.S. war ships. The ICRC has not been allowed to visit these facilities. It issued a public statement in March expressing its growing concern over ``the fate of an unknown number of people captured . . . and held in undisclosed locations.'' To date, its requests for access to the prisons have been denied.  In Iraq, where the Bush administration claims to be following the Geneva Conventions, Human Rights First states that it is unclear if the ICRC has access to all detention facilities in the country. Even if it did, the Secretary of State admitted in June that he had approved requests to hide certain detainees from the International Red Cross.  And what of the secret detention centers? Have these facilities been managed by officials operating under the legal analysis contained in DOJ memos that argue for a very narrow reading ofthe prohibition on torture? Have they been managed by officials acting in accordance with the President's determination that al-Qaeda and Taliban suspects are not protected by the Geneva Conventions? What is the legal status of these individuals? Even in Iraq, where, as I just mentioned, the administration claims to be applying the Geneva Conventions, there is a great deal of ambiguity. The Human Rights First report describes new categories of prisoners in Iraq, including ``security detainees,'' ``high value detainees,'' and a group of prisoners whose status the Coalition Provisional Authority declined to discuss. These are not categories of prisoners defined in the Geneva Conventions, and without full access given the ICRC, no one can verify the circumstances under which they are being held and interrogated.  The administration can provide a significant amount of information about its practices in handling foreign detainees without jeopardizing national security and while still protecting sensitive information. This should include relevant facts about detention centers, and an accounting of the number of detainees, their nationality, and the legal authority under which each is held. I also restate my longstanding request for the documents produced by the White House, the Justice Department, the Pentagon and other agencies that form the legal basis for this Administration's treatment and interrogation of foreign prisoners.  With his words, President Bush says he wants the whole truth, but with his actions he and his administration instead have cynically blocked the doors that lead to the answers. The American people and the American troops who are put at risk by these policies and abuses need and deserve to understand how this happened, and they need to know it will not happen again. For the sake of our national security interests and our credibility, we need to show the world the right way that a democratic society corrects its mistakes. Thwarting adequate oversight and avoiding accountability will not make this problem go away, it will compound it.  I ask unanimous consent the report to which I referred be printed in the Record.  (There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:)                  [From Human Rights First, June 2004]                        Ending Secret Detentions               (By Michael Posner and Deborah Pearlstein)                            I. Introduction       More than 3,000 suspected terrorists have been arrested in      many countries. Many others have met a different fate. Put it      this way, they're no longer a problem to the United States      and our friends and allies. (President George W. Bush, State      of the Union Address, February 4, 2003)       In April, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments in      the cases of Jose Padilla and Yaser Hamdi--both U.S. citizens      who have been held in military detention facilities for more      than two years. One justice wondered aloud how the Court      could be sure that government interrogators were not abusing      these detainees. You just have to ``trust the executive to      make the kind of quintessential military judgments that are      involved in things like that,'' said Deputy Solicitor General      Paul Clement! Later that evening, CBS's 60 Minutes broadcast      the first shocking photographs of U.S. troops torturing Iraqi      prisoners at the Abu Ghraib detention center in Iraq.       The photos from Abu Ghraib have made a policy of ``trust      us'' obsolete. But they are only the most visible symptoms of      a much larger and more disturbing systemic illness. Since the      attacks of September 11, the United States has established a      network of detention facilities around the world used to      detain thousands of individuals captured in the ``war on      terrorism.'' Information about this system--particularly the      location of U.S. detention facilities, how many are held      within them, on what legal basis they are held, and who has      access to the prisoners--emerges in a piecemeal way, if at      all, and then largely as a result of the work of      investigative reporters and other non-governmental sources.      The official secrecy surrounding U.S. practices has made      conditions ripe for illegality and abuse.       Several of these facilities, including the U.S. military      bases at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and at Bagram Air Force Base      in Afghanistan, are well known. The existence of these      facilities--and the fact of unlawful conduct within them--     have been widely publicized and well documented. Nonetheless,      there is still no or only conflicting information about how      many individuals are held there, troubling information about      inadequate provision of notice to families about the fact of      detainees' capture and condition, and unclear or conflicting      statements about detainees' legal status and rights. While      the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has      visited these facilities, their visits have been undermined      in ways contrary to the letter and spirit of binding law.       In addition, there are detention facilities that multiple      sources have reported are maintained by the United States in      various officially undisclosed locations, including      facilities in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Jordan, on the      British possession of Diego Garcia, and on U.S. war ships at      sea. U.S. Government officials have alluded to detention      facilities in undisclosed locations, declining to deny their      existence or refusing to comment on reports of their      existence.\3\ A Department of Defense official told Human      Rights First in June 2004 that while Abu Ghraib and      Guantanamo's Camp Echo were open to discussion, ``as a matter      of policy, we don't comment on other facilities.\4\      Similarly, Captain Bruce Frame, a U.S. army spokesman from      CENTCOM, the unified military command that covers Africa, the      Middle East, and Central Asia, told Human Rights First only      that there ``may or may not'' be detention centers in      countries other than Iraq and Afghanistan in CENTCOM's area      of responsibility.\5\                           The Known Unknowns       What is unknown about this detention system still outweighs      what is known about it. But facilities within it share in      common key features that--while having unclear benefits in      the nation's struggle against terrorism--make inappropriate      detention and abuse not only likely, but virtually      inevitable.       First, each of these facilities is maintained in either      partial or total secrecy. For the past half-century, the      United States has considered itself bound by international      treaties and U.S. military regulations that prohibit such      blanket operating secrecy. Yet in this conflict, the ICRC--     which the United States has long respected as a positive      force in upholding international humanitarian law--has      repeatedly sought and been denied access to these      facilities.\6\ As the ICRC recently noted in a public      statement:       Beyond Bagram and Guantanamo Bay, the ICRC is increasingly      concerned about the fate of an unknown number of people      captured as part of the so-called global war on terror and      held in undisclosed locations. For the ICRC, obtaining      information on these detainees and access to them is an      important humanitarian priority and a logical continuation of      its current detention work in Bagram and Guantanamo Bay.\7\       Indeed, Human Rights First has been unable to identify any      official list of U.S. detention facilities abroad employed in      the course of the ``war on terrorism.'' There is likewise no      public accounting of how many are detained or for what reason      they are held. And there has been a disturbing absence of      serious congressional oversight of both known and undisclosed      detention facilities.\8\       Second, these facilities have thrived in an environment in      which the highest levels of U.S. civilian leadership have      sought legal opinions aimed at circumventing the application      of domestic and international rules governing arrest and      detention. Where it would have once seemed crystal clear to      military commanders and on-the-ground military custodians      alike that the Geneva Conventions governed the arrest and      detention of individuals caught up in the conflicts in Iraq      and Afghanistan, this Administration has challenged the      applicability of those rules. In several recently leaked      legal opinions from White House Counsel, and the Departments      of Defense and Justice, it has become clear that some in the      Administration have given a green light to the wholesale      violation of these rules.\9\       As a result, it remains unclear what legal status has been      assigned to those being detained at these U.S.-controlled      facilities. Are they prisoners of war, civilians who took a      direct part in hostilities (who the Administration calls      ``unlawful combatants''), or are they suspected of criminal      violations under civilian law? The Administration has applied      no clear system for defining their status. It also is unclear      under many circumstances which U.S. agency is ultimately      responsible for their arrest or the conditions of their      confinement. And it now seems that U.S. military and      intelligence agencies are involved in their interrogation, as      well as civilian or foreign government contractors to whom      aspects of detention and interrogation has been outsourced.      It is likewise unclear to whom a family member or legal      representative can appeal to challenge the basis for their      continued detention.       Finally, the U.S. government has failed to provide prompt      notice to families of those captured that their family member      is in custody, much less information about their health or      whereabouts. In such cases, the families of individuals      removed to such unknown locations have had no opportunity to      challenge detentions that may continue for extended      periods.\10\ For example, Saifullah Paracha, according to      information his family received from the ICRC, has been      detained at Bagram Air Force Base for more than 11 months.      His wife and children remain in the dark, not only of the      reason for his detention, but also when they can expect Mr.      Paracha to be released or tried.\11\ Other individuals      captured more than a year ago remain in detention at other      undisclosed locations.\12\ The lack of information to family      members about these detainees violates U.S. legal obligations      and sets a negative precedent for treatment that may be      directed at U.S. soldiers in the future. It also engenders     great anguish and suffering on the part of the families of      detainees--no less than did the practice of ``forcible      disappearance'' in past decades--while engendering enormous      hostility toward the United States.                  in the interest of national security       The Administration has argued that, faced with the      unprecedented security threat posed by terrorist groups ``of      global reach,'' \13\ it has had to resort to preventive      detention and interrogation of those suspected to have      information about possible terrorist attacks. According to      the Defense and Justice Departments, a key purpose of these      indefinite detentions is to promote national security by      developing detainees as sources of intelligence. And while      much of what goes on at these detention facilities is steeped      in secrecy, intelligence agents insist that ``[w]e're getting      great info almost every day.'' \14\       Whatever the value of intelligence information obtained in      these facilities--and there is reason to doubt the      reliability of intelligence information gained only in the      course of prolonged incommunicado detention\15\--there is no      legal or practical justification for refusing to report      comprehensively on the number and location of these      detainees--or to fail to provide the identities of detainees      to the ICRC, detainees' families, their counsel, or to others      having a legitimate interest in the information (unless a      wish to the contrary has been manifested by the persons      concerned).       The United States is of course within its power to ask      questions and to cultivate local sources of information. And      the United States certainly has the power to detain--in      keeping with its authority under the Constitution and      applicable international law--those who are actively engaged      in hostilities against the United States, or those suspected      of committing or conspiring to commit acts against the law.      But it does not have the power to establish a secret system      of off-shore prisons beyond the reach of supervision,      accountability, or law.       Finally, even if some valuable information is being      obtained, there are standards on the treatment of prisoners      that cannot be set aside. The United States was founded on a      core set of beliefs that have served the nation very well      over two centuries. Among the most basic of these beliefs is      that torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment      is wrong; arbitrary detention is an instrument of tyranny;      and no use of government power should go unchecked. The      refusal to disclose the identity of detainees, prolonged      incommunicado detention, the use of secret detention centers,      and the exclusion of judicial or ICRC oversight combine to      remove fundamental safeguards against torture and ill-     treatment and arbitrary detention. Current practices which      violate these principles must be stopped immediately.       The abuses at Abu Ghraib underscore the reason why, since      the United States' founding, Americans have rejected the idea      of a government left to its own devices and acting on good      faith in favor of a government based on checks and balances      and anchored to the rule of law. As James Madison noted,      ``[a] popular Government without popular information, or the      means of acquiring it, is but a Prologue to a Farce or      Tragedy.'' \16\ This nation's history has repeatedly taught      the value of public debate and discourse. To cite one      example, the United States learned this 30 years ago when a      series of congressional investigations uncovered widespread,      secret domestic spying by the CIA, NSA, FBI, and the Army--     revelations whose impact on the intelligence agencies was, in      former CIA Director Stansfield Turner's words,      ``devastating.'' \17\       We should be clear--the United States has important and      legitimate interests in gathering intelligence information      and in keeping some of this information secret. But we are      not demanding the public release of any information that      would compromise these interests. What we are calling for is      an official accounting--to Congress and to the ICRC--of the      number, nationality, legal status, and place of detention of      all those the United States currently holds. We ask that all      of these places of detention be acknowledged and open to      inspection by the ICRC, and that the names of all detainees      be made available promptly to the ICRC and to others with a      legitimate interest in this information. Neither logic nor      law supports the continued withholding of the most basic      information about the United States' global system of secret      detention. Trust is plainly no longer enough.                          ____________________
