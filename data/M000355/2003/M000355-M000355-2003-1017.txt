 President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the quorum call be rescinded.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent). Without objection, it is so ordered.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, earlier today Senator Hatch asked consent for a time certain for a vote on the pending Owen nomination. There was an objection from the other side of the aisle.  I make further inquiry of the assistant Democratic leader if there is still an objection to limiting debate on this nomination. I yield to him for a response.
