 President, I rise today to congratulate Heather Renee French of Maysville, Kentucky, on her recent crowning as Miss America 1999.  Ms. French is an outstanding young woman who made all Kentuckians proud of her impressive showing at this year's prestigious Miss America pageant. She made history with her win on September 18, 1999, as the first Miss Kentucky ever to be named as the reigning Miss America--and the goal to help homeless Veterans she's set for her year-long term will likely make history as well.  Though young, Ms. French has accomplished a great deal in her 24 years. A graduate of the University of Cincinnati (U of C) undergraduate program and a student in the U of C Masters of Design school, she currently teaches at the U of C design school, and is working on a textbook for college-level design students.  Her resume boasts extensive service and volunteer experience, including working with the Make-A-Wish Foundation, volunteering at VA hospitals and with the Statewide Vietnam Veterans Awareness Campaign. It is refreshing to see an intelligent, successful young woman who takes the time to spend unpaid hours working to help others.  According to post-pageant interviews, Ms. French has indicated that the top priority with her newly-won title is to lobby Congress on behalf of America's Veterans. The daughter of a disabled Vietnam Veteran, Ms. French has become acutely aware of the problems Veterans face and the obstacles they often have to overcome.  I also would like to congratulate the French family, as this is their victory as well. They are to be commended for the love and support they provided throughout Heather's life, and throughout what was surely a busy summer preparing for the September pageant. Her father, Ron, deserves recognition as the inspiration for Heather's strong desire to help America's Veterans and for the Purple Heart he earned during the Vietnam War. As a father, it would encourage me to know that my daughters had learned something from a parents' adversity that would drive them to help others with similar experiences.  My colleagues and I join in congratulating you, Ms. French, on your success and wish you all the best in what will surely be an exciting year.                          ____________________
