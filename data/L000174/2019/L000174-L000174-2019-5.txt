President, I would like to take a moment to recognize the success of another Vermont business, Hazelett Continuous Casting, which is celebrating its 100th anniversary of producing quality casting equipment and research. Hazelett is a true pioneer of continuous metal casting development and research, growing from one man's dream into one of Vermont's most successful companies. As a fourth-generation, family-run company, it is fitting to look back on Hazelett's 100 years of public service and learn more about their history.  Hazelett's founder, Clarence W. Hazelett, worked tirelessly to design and develop continuous metal casting technology in 1919. Clarence's commitment was undying, his persistence to be a leader in this field led to his groundbreaking work being recognized through worldwide patents and technical publications. In 1924, Clarence established the first commercial continuous metals casting and processing company in the world, Hazelett Storage Battery Company. Upon his death, his two sons, William ``Bill'' and Richard, followed in his footsteps and took Hazelett a step further.  Bill took the reins from his father, becoming president of the company in 1956. Building on his father's foundation, Bill relocated the company to Colchester, VT, and renamed it Hazelett Strip-Casting Corporation. It was here that the family business grew into one of the world's leading continuous casting machine manufacturers. Bill went on to win the United States Small Business Administration National Exporter of the Year award in 2001 for his exemplary innovation and vision in building a very successful business in Vermont, boasting an employment of 145 people while accounting 70 percent of its $23 million in sales to foreign business. Bill passed away in 2010, but his legacy lives on and continues in his son, David.  Today, with David at the helm, Hazelett has maintained their status as one of the world's leaders in continuous metal casting, expanding well beyond the Green Mountains. Hazelett's prominent presence around the globe is marked by the operation of their machines in 27 countries and the establishment of the only full-service Hazelett branch outside of the United States, Hazelett Trading in Shanghai, China. David's mission is clear: He hopes to offer the most cost-effective, environmentally friendly metals casting technology in the world. It pleases me to hear important Vermont values incorporated into Hazelett's work.  Hazelett has been an important contributor to not only the Vermont economy but the global economy. The Hazelett family and their employees have also helped build and support their home town of Colchester over this entire 100 years. A business of this magnitude in Vermont is a true gem and the years of dedication and hard work are exemplified through Hazelett's generations of leaders. I am incredibly proud of the continued dedication of each generation that has taken over the business. Congratulations to Hazelett Continuous Casting on 100 years of business, may your success continue for another 100 years.                            ____________________
