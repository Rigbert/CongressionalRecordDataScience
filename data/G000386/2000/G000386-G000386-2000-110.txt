 President, today I'm introducing a bill to implement recommendations by the General Accounting Office contained in a report--issued just today--which assesses the efforts of the Department of Agriculture's Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration (GIPSA) in implementing the Packers and Stockyards Act. Done correctly, GIPSA is supposed to use the Packers and Stockyards Act as a tool to prevent farmers from being subject to unfair and anti-competitive practices.  In August 1999, I asked the GAO to investigate whether GIPSA was taking full advantage of its authority to investigate competition concerns in the cattle and hog industries. In a nutshell, GIPSA has failed in its mission to protect family farmers. GIPSA has failed to ensure fairness and competitiveness in the livestock industry. The report recommends that significant changes need to be made to GIPSA's investigation and case management, operations, and development processes, as well as its staff resources and capabilities, in order for it to effectively perform its Packers and Stockyards duties.  The news of this administration's failure of duty couldn't come at a worse time. Family farmers and independent producers are experiencing some of the lowest prices for their commodities in years. In the meantime, agribusiness has become so concentrated that family farmers are concerned they can't get a fair price for their products. They are seeing fewer options for marketing their commodities and they are having to sustain increased input costs. The extent of concentration in agribusiness has raised serious concerns about the ability of companies to engage in unfair practices. Most of these complaints involve the livestock industry.  The Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission are responsible for protecting the marketplace from mergers, acquisitions and practices that adversely affect competition. But GIPSA, under the Packers and Stockyards Act, has substantial, explicit authority to halt anti-competitive activity in the livestock industry by taking investigative, enforcement and regulatory action. But GIPSA has done none of this. All we hear are calls for more legislation or more money. It's clear that this is just another example of this administration passing the buck to Congress by calling for new legislative authority, when they are the ones that have failed to exercise the broad authority they already have. If USDA won't use their existing powers, what makes us in Congress think they'd use new powers?  As I've stated, I asked for this GAO investigation because I suspected that USDA had not been doing enough to ensure that small and mid-sized producers were not being harmed by possible anti-competitive activity in the livestock industry. So, to tell you the truth, I wasn't surprised when GIPSA got a failing grade. But I can tell you that I am outraged by USDA and this administration's lack of priorities in doing their job and their failure to enforce the laws on the books. Let me make this clear, this USDA is not a friend to the family farmer. And the Clinton-Gore administration is one to talk about us here in Congress doing nothing about concerns in agriculture. Maybe I need to define what ``nothing'' means. I think that this GAO Report defines ``nothing'' quite well.  Let me summarize the findings of the GAO report. The report confirms that GIPSA's authority to halt anti-competitive practices and protect buyers and sellers of livestock is quite broad and, in fact, go further than the Sherman Act in addressing anti-competitive practices.  The report also found that two major factors have impacted GIPSA's capability to perform their competition duties. Investigation and case methods, practices and processes are inadequate or non-existent at GIPSA.  For example, the GAO found that GIPSA's investigations are planned and conducted primarily by economists and technical specialists without the formal involvement of USDA's Office of General Counsel attorneys from the beginning of an investigation. Attorneys only get involved when a case report is completed. On the other hand, DOJ and FTC have teams of attorneys and economists that perform investigations of anti-competitive practices, with the attorneys taking the lead from the outset to ensure that a legal theory is focused on the potential violation of law. The GAO also found that GIPSA does not have investigative methods designed for competition cases, nor does it have investigation guidance for anti-competitive practice methods and processes. In contrast, DOJ and FTC have detailed processes and practices specifically designed for these kinds of cases.  GIPSA is also inadequately staffed. The GAO indicated that although the agency has hired additional economists, they are relatively inexperienced. More importantly, even though I understand there are around 300 lawyers in the General Counsel's Office, the report found that the number of attorneys working on GIPSA matters has actually decreased from 8 to 5 since GIPSA reorganized in 1998. To add insult to injury, they are not all assigned full-time to GIPSA's financial, trade practice, and competition cases; some have other USDA responsibilities aswell. Consequently, very little attorney time is actually dedicated to competition cases, thanks to the low priority this administration has placed on the problem.  The GAO Report's recommendations are straightforward. It recommends that GIPSA come up with investigation and case methods, practices and processes for competition-related allegations, in consultation with the DOJ and FTC.  It recommends that GIPSA integrate the attorney and economist working relationship, with attorneys at the lead from the beginning of the investigation. It also suggests that USDA might want to report to Congress on the state of the cattle and hog market, as well as on potential violations of the Packers and Stockyards Act. In effect, the GAO provides a blueprint for how GIPSA should be run, and the policies and procedures it should have in place to protect family farmers.  So, the GAO is telling us that USDA and GIPSA just haven't gotten their act together to function like a competent agency. And they are recommending that USDA and GIPSA do something that makes common sense--develop a successful plan, train your people, get guidance from the experts, write effective processes and procedures designed for competition cases, hire antitrust lawyers.  Let me give you some more information. Way back in October 1991, the GAO issued another report which determined that, despite increased concentration in the livestock industry, GIPSA's monitoring and analysis were not up to speed to identify anti-competitive practices. Instead, GIPSA still placed its primary emphasis on ensuring prompt and accurate payment to livestock sellers. In 1997, USDA's own Office of Inspector General found that GIPSA needed to make extensive improvements to its Packers and Stockyards Program to live up to its competition responsibilities. The 1997 OIG report found that GIPSA did not have the capability to perform effective anti-competitive practice investigations because it was not properly organized, operated or staffed. It recommended that GIPSA make extensive organizational and resource improvements within the department, as well as employ an approach similar to that used by DOJ and FTC, by integrating attorneys and economists from the beginning of the investigative process. Sound familiar?  Because of the large number of complaints about competition in the livestock industry, one would have thought that USDA and the administration would have put addressing competition concerns in every way possible and ensuring the effective functioning of GIPSA at the top of their list. USDA and the administration had clear warnings in the 1991 GAO Report and the 1997 OIG Report that there were significant problems, yet they've been ineffective in addressing them. In fact, USDA agreed with the reports and acknowledged that they needed to reevaluate guidelines and regulations, as well as make appropriate organizational, procedure and resource changes. So why wasn't this done? Why weren't these concerns addressed in an effective manner? Why still all this mismanagement? Why still no guidance, policies or proceures?  And now this GAO report raises even more troubling questions. What are USDA's real priorities? Are ag concentration and anti-competitive activity of any concern to the Clinton/Gore administration? How many violations of the Packers and Stockyards Act have slipped through the cracks because of GIPSA's failure to execute its statutory responsibility? My hearing on September 25, next week in my Judiciary Subcommittee, will explore these and other questions.  I can already see the finger-pointing to come from USDA. They are going to say they need more time. Well, they've known since 1991 that they had problems, isn't that time enough to fix them? They are going to say that we haven't given them enough money. But the fact is that Congress has increased GIPSA and USDA OGC funding almost every year since 1991. If USDA saw that they needed more antitrust lawyers for their Packers and Stockyards competition cases, they should have dedicated more of their funds to hiring them. The problem is this administration's priorities. The problem is this administration's inability to take responsibility.  In any event, it's clear that we can't count on this administration's Agriculture Department to reorganize and fix the problems identified in this GAO report. USDA promised to respond to similar problems identified in the 1991 GAO Report and 1997 OIG report, yet did nothing of any real effect to change the situation. Promises made to farmers and promises broken. It's clear to me that recent movements on the part of USDA to address some of these issues are just another way to deflect criticisms of their failure to act. And my concerns continue to grow. Legislation is necessary to force USDA and GIPSA to do their job. It's obvious that if we leave it to this administration, it will be the same old, same old. And the family farmer will continue to wait for something to happen. USDA has broken too many promises already.  No more. My bill, the Packers and Stockyards Enforcement Improvements Act, will require USDA to implement GAO's commonsense recommendations, GAO's blueprint for success. Specifically, my bill will require that, within one year, USDA implement the recommendations of the GAO report, in consultation with DOJ and FTC. My bill will require that, during this one year implementation period, USDA will work with DOJ and FTC to identify anti-competitive violations and take enforcement action under the Packers and Stockyards Act. My bill will require USDA to set up a training program for competition investigations within one year. In addition, my bill will require USDA to provide Congress with a yearly report on the state of the cattle and hog industries and identify activities that represent potential violations under the Packers and Stockyards Act.  Finally, my bill will require USDA to report back to Congress within a year on what actions it has taken to comply with this act.  This is a good government bill. It doesn't change the authority of USDA to address anti-competitive activity in the livestock industry under the Packers and Stockyards Act. Obviously, there's no need to do that--USDA already has all the authority they need. Instead, my bill does something a lot more fundamental--it makes USDA and GIPSA reorganize, regroup and revamp their Packers and Stockyards program so they can do their job. Hopefully this will help change USDA's failure to take its current statutory responsibilities seriously. It seems to me that this is a recurring theme, the administration not enforcing the laws on the books and then blaming others for their inadequacies. But the report is clear. They are the problem. This GAO report is important because it has identified what the real problem is: USDA and the administration are asleep at the switch.  I ask unanimous consent to have my bill printed in the Record following my remarks.
