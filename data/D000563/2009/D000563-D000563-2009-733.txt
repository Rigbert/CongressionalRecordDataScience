I know the Senator has the best of intensions. The underlying bill takes care of the unemployment insurance account. It does it in a deficit-neutral fashion. In fact, it generates a surplus, extra funds beyond what is needed for this purpose.  What the Senator from Nevada wants to do, if you can imagine, is he wants to cut back on spending in the stimulus program, which is building highways and projects across America. He wants to reduce the President's effort to create jobs, thereby creating more unemployment in order to have more money for unemployment in America. It does not work.  We have a good program here. The underlying program takes care of the need of the UI fund, and the President's stimulus package, now 150 days into operation, is generating jobs and opportunities across America. We do not need to kill the stimulus package at this moment. We need to make sure it works to get America back to work.  Please defeat the Ensign amendment.
