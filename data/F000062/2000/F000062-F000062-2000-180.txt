 President, on May 6-8, 2000, more than 1,200 students from across the United States will be in Washington, D.C. to compete in the national finals of the We the People. . . The Citizen and the Constitution program. I am very proud to announce that the class from Amador Valley High School in Pleasanton will represent the State of California. These young scholars have worked diligently to reach the national finals. Through their experience, they have gained a deep knowledge and understanding of the fundamental principles and values of our constitutional democracy.  The We the People. . . The Citizen and the Constitution program is the most extensive educational program in the country developed specifically to educate young people about the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. The primary goal of the program is to promote civic competence and responsibility among our nation's elementary and secondary students. Administered by the Center for Civic Education, the We the People. . . program has provided curricular material for more than 26 million students nationwide.  The three-day national competition is modeled after hearings in the U.S. Congress. The students testify as constitutional experts before a panel of judges representing several regions of the country and a variety of appropriate professional fields. Their testimony is followed by a period of questioning by a simulated Congressional committee. The judges probe students for their depth of understanding and ability to apply their constitutional knowledge.  The class from Amador Valley High School is currently conducting research and preparing for the upcoming national competition in Washington. I wish these young ``constitutional experts'' the best of luck at the We the People. . . national finals and continued success in their future endeavors.                          ____________________
