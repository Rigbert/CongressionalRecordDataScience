President, I would like, through the Chair, to ask the Senator from North Dakota, why don't we go ahead and move the package then, and we can preserve the right of that Senator to offer his amendment when he returns. That is preserving his right as a Senator if he wants to offer an amendment. But to stop the entire amendment process and all the other possibilities--I hope we do not let that happen.  Through the Chair, I ask the Senator from North Dakota, is that being considered?
