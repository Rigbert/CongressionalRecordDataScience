Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Speaker, first of all, I thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Evans). Again, we have collaborated on a bill working with the subcommittee chairman, the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Simmons), and the ranking member, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Rodriguez), and we have produced an extraordinarily good piece of legislation.  We worked with the other body, and I want to thank Senator Arlen Specter, the chairman, and the ranking member, Senator Graham. There was give and take, obviously. We began working on this very comprehensive product last spring. Again, this is a combination of a number of bills rolled and packaged into one bill. Project Shad was mentioned earlier by my colleague from California, and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Rodriguez) mentioned it as well. This bill is not everything we would like. The next time I find a bill on this floor that is will be the first time.  We did pass over to the other body the full money for the Columbus project, and we got back advance planning funding from the other body. While it is not everything we wanted, it certainly will ensure that that project goes forward. The $9 million is not chump change and will be sufficient to get the job done. I want to assure my colleagues we have done our due diligence. This is a very good piece of veterans legislation.  I want to thank our staff, Pat Ryan; John Bradley, who is the staff director for the subcommittee; Kingston Smith, our deputy chief counsel; Jeannie McNally; Mary McDermott; Peter Dickinson; Steve Kirkland; Bernie Dotson; Summer Larson; Kathleen Greve; Delores Dunn; Paige McManus; Devon Seibert; and Veronica Crowe. As my colleague mentioned, we have had great cooperation with our friends on the other side of the aisle.  Again, this is a quintessential bipartisan piece of legislation, something that this entire body can be proud of, and it will advance the ball significantly when it comes to veterans health care as well as the construction project.  Let me also remind my colleagues that we have passed over to the other body H.R. 11 and another bill that I sponsored and a bill that the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Moran) sponsored in the last Congress, and they never came back. They listed a number of projects that should have but did not get funded and were not authorized. Now, finally in this Congress, under the great leadership of the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Simmons), we have gotten that product back from the Senate, and it will go to President Bush for his signature. This is a great day for veterans. Again, I thank all of my colleagues for their cooperation and leadership.  Mr. Speaker, I include for the Record a joint explanatory statement.  Explanatory Statement on S. 1156, as Amended, Veterans Health Care,           Capital Asset, and Business Improvement Act of 2003       S. 1156, as amended, the Veterans Health Care, Capital      Asset, and Business Improvement Act of 2003 (``Compromise      Agreement'') reflects a negotiated agreement reached by the      Senate and House of Representatives Committees on Veterans'      Affairs concerning provisions in a number of bills considered      by the House and Senate during the 1st session of the 108th      Congress. The measures considered in this compromise are: S.      1156, as amended, as reported by the Senate Committee on      Veterans' Affairs on November 10, 2003; S. 1815 introduced on      November 4, 2003 (``Senate Bill''); H.R. 2357, as amended,      passed the House on July 21, 2003; H.R. 2433,     as amended, passed the House on September 10, 2003; H.R.      1720, as amended, passed the House on October 29, 2003; H.R.      3260, as introduced in the House on October 8, 2003; and H.R.      3387, as introduced in the House on October 29, 2003 (``House      Bill'').       The House and Senate Committees on Veterans' Affairs have      prepared the following explanation of the Compromise      Agreement. Differences between the provisions contained in      the Compromise Agreement and the related provisions of the      Senate bill and the House bills are noted, except for      clerical corrections, conforming changes made necessary by      the Compromise Agreement, and minor drafting, technical, and      clarifying changes.          TITLE I--HEALTH CARE AUTHORITIES AND RELATED MATTERS             IMPROVED BENEFITS FOR FORMER PRISONERS OF WAR     Current Law       Section 1712 of title 38, United States Code, authorizes      outpatient dental services and related dental appliances to      veterans who are former prisoners of war (POWs) if they were      detained or interned for a period of at least 90 days.       Section 1722A of title 38, United States Code, requires      veterans who are not service-connected with a disability      rated at more than 50 percent or eligible for pensions under      section 1521 of title 38, United States Code, to make      copayments for medications.     Senate Bill       The Senate Bill contains no comparable provision.     House Bill       Section 3 of H.R. 3260 would authorize veterans who are      former POWs to receive outpatient dental care, irrespective      of the number of days held captive, and would exempt former      POWs from the requirement to make copayments on outpatient      prescription medications.     Compromise Agreement       Section 101 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House      language.   PROVISION OF HEALTH CARE TO VETERANS WHO PARTICIPATED IN CERTAIN      DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL WARFARE TESTING     Current Law       There is no comparable provision in current law.     Senate Bill       The Senate Bill contains no comparable provision.     House Bill       Section 2 of H.R. 2433, as amended, would authorize the      Department of Veterans Affairs (``VA'' or ``Department'') to      provide higher priority health care to veterans who      participated in Project Shipboard Hazard and Defense (SHAD),      Project 112 or related land-based tests conducted by the      Department of Defense Deseret Test Center, from 1962 through      1973, without those veterans needing an adjudicated service-     connected disability to establish their priority for care.     Compromise Agreement       Section 102 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House      language.ELIGIBILITY FOR DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS HEALTH CARE FOR CERTAIN       FILIPINO WORLD WAR II VETERANS RESIDING IN THE UNITED STATES     Current Law       Section 1734 of title 38, United States Code, establishes      that veterans of the Commonwealth Army and New Philippine      Scouts residing legally in the United States are eligible for      VA health care services for the treatment of service-     connected disabilities and, in the case of Commonwealth Army      veterans, for non-service-connected conditions if they are in      receipt of disability compensation.     Senate Bill       Section 421 of S. 1156 contains a similar provision.     House Bill       Section 3 of H.R. 2357, as amended, would authorize VA      health care for additional World War II Filipino veterans who      reside legally in the United States. These veterans of the      Commonwealth Army and new Philippine Scouts, would be subject      to the same eligibility and means test requirements as U.S.      veterans. The House bill would require the Secretary of      Veterans Affairs (``Secretary'') to certify each fiscal      year that sufficient resources are available at the VA      health care facilities where the majority of these      veterans would seek care.     Compromise Agreement       Section 103 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House      language, except the Compromise Agreement does not include      the resource availability certification requirement.                 ENHANCEMENT OF REHABILITATIVE SERVICES     Current Law       Chapter 31 of title 38, United States Code, authorizes VA      to provide vocational rehabilitation services. VA is      authorized under chapter 17 of title 38 to offer medical care      and compensated work therapy to certain veterans.     Senate Bill       The Senate Bill contains no comparable provision.     House Bill       Section 3 of H.R. 3387 would authorize the Secretary to      provide therapeutic employment support services (i.e., skills      training and development services, employment support      services, and job development and placement services) to      patients in need of rehabilitation for mental health      disorders, including serious mental illness and substance use      disorders.       Section 3 of H.R. 3387 would also authorize VA to use funds      in the Special Therapeutic and Rehabilitation Activities Fund      (STRAF) authorized under section 1718(c) of title 38, United      States Code, to furnish such therapeutic employment support      services.     Compromise Agreement       Section 104 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House      language.  ENHANCED AGREEMENT AUTHORITY FOR PROVISION OF NURSING HOME CARE AND               ADULT DAY HEALTH CARE IN CONTRACT FACILITIES     Current Law       Section 1720 of title 38, United States Code, authorizes VA      to contract for the provision of nursing home care and adult      day health care for certain veterans and members of the Armed      Forces.     Senate Bill       Section 102 of S. 1156 would expand VA's authority to enter      into relationships based upon ``provider agreements'' with      Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)-certified,      small, community-based nursing homes and non-institutional      extended care providers, by permitting VA to use provider      agreements similar to those used by CMS.     House Bill       The House Bill contains no comparable provision.     Compromise Agreement       Section 105 of the Compromise Agreement generally follows      the Senate language.    FIVE-YEAR EXTENSION OF PERIOD FOR PROVISION OF NONINSTITUTIONAL          EXTENDED-CARE SERVICES AND REQUIRED NURSING HOME CARE     Current Law       Section 1701(10)(A) of title 38, United States Code,      requires VA to provide noninstitutional extended care      services to enrolled veterans. In addition, section 1710A(c)      of title 38, United States Code, requires VA to provide      nursing home care to high-priority veterans in need of care.     Senate Bill       Section 101 of S. 1156 would extend the authorities for      noninstitutional extended care and required nursing home care      through December 31, 2008.     House Bill       Section 2 of H.R. 3260 would extend the authorities for the      noninstitutional extended care services and required nursing      home care to December 31, 2008. The report required under      section 101 of Public Law 106-117 would be extended until      January 1, 2008.     Compromise Agreement       Section 106 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House      language from subsection 2(a) and (b) of H.R. 3260. EXPANSION OF DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS PILOT PROGRAM ON ASSISTED                           LIVING FOR VETERANS     Current Law       Section 103(b) of Public Law 106-117 authorizes the      establishment of a pilot program in one VA geographic health      care region to provide assisted living services to veterans.     Senate Bill       Section 103 of S. 1156 would authorize the establishment of      one additional assisted living pilot program for three years      from the commencement of the provision of assisted living      services under the program.     House Bill       The House Bill contains no comparable provision.     Compromise Agreement       Section 107 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate      language.   IMPROVEMENT OF PROGRAM FOR PROVISION OF SPECIALIZED MENTAL HEALTH                           SERVICES TO VETERANS     Current Law       Section 116(c) of Public Law 106-117 provides funding in      the amount of $15,000,000 for specialized mental health      services in fiscal years 2004, 2005 and 2006.     Senate Bill       Section 104 of S. 1156 would increase the funding      authorization for these specialized mental health services      from $15,000,000 to $25,000,000, and would specify allocation      of these funds outside the Veterans Equitable Resource      Allocation system.     House Bill       The House Bill contains no comparable provision.     Compromise Agreement       Section 108 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate      language.             TITLE II--CONSTRUCTION AND FACILITIES MATTERS                    Subtitle A--Program Authorities INCREASE IN THRESHOLD FOR MAJOR MEDICAL FACILITY CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS     Current Law       Section 8104(a)(3) of title 38, United States Code, defines      a major medical facility project as a project for      construction, alteration, or acquisition of a medical      facility involving a total expenditure of more than      $4,000,000.     Senate Bill       Section 201 of S. 1156 would raise the threshold for major      medical facility projects from $4,000,000 to $9,000,000.     House Bill       Section 7 of H.R. 1720, as amended, would raise the      threshold for major medical facility projects from $4,000,000      to $6,000,000.     Compromise Agreement       Section 201 of the Compromise Agreement would raise the      threshold for major medical facility projects from $4,000,000      to $7,000,000.              ENHANCEMENTS TO ENHANCED-USE LEASE AUTHORITY     Current Law       Section 8162 of title 38, United States Code, authorizes      the Secretary to enter into enhanced-use leases of Veterans      Health Administration (VHA) real property under the      jurisdiction of the Secretary.     Senate Bill       The Senate Bill contains no comparable provision.     House Bill       Section 4 of H.R. 3260 would extend the jurisdiction of      this authority to the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA)      and National Cemetery Administration (NCA), for properties of      these Administrations under the control of the Secretary.      Further, the bill would streamline the process and      notification requirements and allow proceeds from an      enhanced-use lease to be credited to accounts for use by VHA,      VBA or NCA as appropriate. The bill would allow individual VA      facilities to be reimbursed for the expenses incurred by the      development and execution of enhanced-use leases.     Compromise Agreement       Section 202 of the Compromise Agreement adopts the      provisions of the House bill which streamline the approval      process for enhanced use leases in VHA. The provisions      concerning the expansion of this authority to properties of      NCA and VBA have been omitted due to mandatory spending      concerns.     SIMPLIFICATION OF ANNUAL REPORT ON LONG-RANGE HEALTH PLANNING     Current Law       Section 8107 of title 38, United States Code, requires VA      to submit annually a report regarding the long-range health      planning of the Department. Included in that report is a      five-year strategic plan for the provision of health care      services to veterans, a plan for the coordination of care      among the geographic health care regions of the      Department, a profile of each such region, any planned      changes to the mission of any medical facility of the      Department, and a listing of the 20 VA major medical      facility projects with the highest priority.     Senate Bill       The Senate Bill contains no comparable provision.     House Bill       Section 7(d) of H.R. 3260 would change the report date on      the Annual Report on Long-Range Health Planning to June 1 of      each year.     Compromise Agreement       Section 203 of the Compromise Agreement rescinds section      8107(b)(3) and (4) of title 38, United States Code, to      simplify the required report by removing the detailed      prescription of its content.                   Subtitle B--Project Authorizations            AUTHORIZATION OF MAJOR MEDICAL FACILITY PROJECTS     Current Law       Section 8104(2) of title 38, United States Code, requires      Congressional authorization of any VA major medical facility      construction project.     Senate Bill       Section 211 of S. 1156 would authorize the following major      construction projects:------------------------------------------------------------------------              Location                      Purpose             Cost------------------------------------------------------------------------Lebanon, PA........................

AUTHORIZATION OF MAJOR MEDICAL FACILITY LEASES     Current Law       Section 8104 of title 38, United States Code, requires      Congressional authorization of any VA medical facility lease      with an annual lease payment of more than $600,000.     Senate Bill       Section 212 of S. 1156 would authorize the following      leases:------------------------------------------------------------------------              Location                      Purpose             Cost------------------------------------------------------------------------Denver, CO.........................

Regional Federal         30,000,000                                      Medical Center.------------------------------------------------------------------------     Compromise Agreement       Section 212 of the Compromise Agreement authorizes the      leases for Charlotte, North Carolina; and Boston,      Massachusetts.       The Compromise Agreement contains the provision of Section      211 of H.R. 1720, as amended, to authorize a major      construction project for Pensacola, Florida. It was      determined that no lease authority for the Pensacola site was      necessary. Further, the Compromise Agreement would not      authorize a lease supporting relocation and expansion of the      Health Administration Center (HAC) in Denver, Colorado. The      Committees believe the Department has not justified the      continuing expansion of activities at the HAC. The Committees      are concerned that this administrative function, originally      authorized to process reimbursement claims for the Civilian      Health and Medical Program for the VA (CHAMPVA), has inflated      its activities well beyond its original responsibilities. The      Committees urge VA to reconsider whether the long-term      obligation of leased space and the significant growth of      staff at the HAC, as opposed to other methods of      accomplishing these various tasks, are warranted.       The Compromise Agreement generally follows the Senate      language on the Regional Federal Medical Center lease at the      former Fitzsimons Army Medical Center in Aurora, Colorado,      pending a decision by the Secretaries of Veterans Affairs      and Defense on the nature of any joint venture undertaking      at the site. However, advance planning is authorized for      this project under section 213 of the Compromise      Agreement.                    advance planning authorizations     Current Law       Section 8104(2) of title 38, United States Code, requires      Congressional authorization of all VA major medical facility      construction project.     Senate Bill       The Senate Bill contains no comparable provision.     House Bill       Section 3 of H.R. 1720, as amended, would authorize major      construction projects in Columbus, Ohio; Denver (Aurora),      Colorado; and the lease of a Multi-specialty Outpatient      Clinic in Clark County (Las Vegas), Nevada.     Compromise Agreement       Section 213 of the Compromise Agreement authorizes advance      planning funds for fiscal year 2004 for purposes of      developing new medical facilities at the following locations:------------------------------------------------------------------------              Location                      Purpose             Cost------------------------------------------------------------------------Columbus, OH.......................

Advance Planning.....    17,500,000------------------------------------------------------------------------       The Committees concluded these projects, while warranted,      require further development. The Committees believe these      projects should be considered high priorities from VA's      ongoing review of future health care infrastructure needs,      the Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services (CARES)      initiative.       Given VA's documented plan to pursue significant capital      investments and improvements in health care infrastructure      and the Committees' understanding that the Appropriations      Committees of the House and Senate are hesitant to provide      funds for new VA medical facility construction prior to the      completion of the CARES process, the Compromise agreement      authorizes $86,500,000 to allow for planning of projects at      these sites.                    authorization of appropriations     Current Law       Section 8104(2) of title 38, United States Code, requires      Congressional authorization of appropriations for VA major      medical facility projects.     Senate Bill       Section 213 of S. 1156 would authorize $34,500,000 for      fiscal year 2004 for projects authorized and $4,984,000 for      the leases authorized by this bill.     House Bill       Section 3 of H.R. 1720, as amended, would authorize      $332,100,000 to be appropriated in fiscal year 2004 for the      projects authorized by this bill.     Compromise Agreement       Section 214 of the Compromise Agreement would authorize      $276,600,000 for fiscal year 2004 for the major construction      projects authorized in section 211 of the Compromise      Agreement. In addition, section 214 of the Compromise      Agreement authorizes the appropriation of $86,500,000 for      advanced planning projects identified in section 213 of the      Compromise Agreement. Subtitle C--Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services Initiativeauthorization of major construction projects in connection with capital                       asset realignment initiative     Current Law       Section 8104(2) of title 38, United States Code, requires      Congressional authorization of all VA major medical facility      projects.     Senate Bill       Section 402 of S. 1156 would authorize the Secretary to      carry out major construction projects outlined in the final      report on the CARES initiative. This authority would be      subject to a 60-day advance notification to Congress. The      Secretary would be required to submit a list containing each      major project in order of priority, based on the criteria      specified in the bill.

SUPPLEMENTARY MATTERS                SAN JUAN, PUERTO RICO VA MEDICAL CENTER       In 1999, Congress provided $50,000,000 to the VA Medical      Center in San Juan, Puerto Rico, to assist that facility in      correcting numerous structural safety issues. Since then, VA      has spent $4,000,000 of those funds on the design and      planning of a bed tower that will alleviate the strain on the      older bed tower currently in use.
