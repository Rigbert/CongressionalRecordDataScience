Chairman, because I have not offered an additional amendment, I understand the Chairman's observation. The Federal Election Commission is an agency that has great interest in this body. Obviously, it deals with each and every one of us in terms of overseeing our accounts.  It has the responsibility of monitoring our campaign finance laws and our disclosure. Clearly the nub of campaign reform was allowing the public to know from whom we receive money, how much money we receive, and how we spend that money so the public can make an informed judgment as to whether or not there is a nexus between the positions we take and the financial support that we get.  That is, in my opinion, the nub of campaign reform. It is critical. But if the public does not get that information in a timely fashion, it is not useful to them.  Therefore, in my opinion, it is important to fully fund the FEC. The Chairman's mark is $2.5 million below the Commission's request. This is not an increase, as the committee suggests. It is only an increase if you assume the $1.4 million rescission that has not been signed into law. As a matter of fact, that rescission languishes in the other body. As a result, this is a cut in the FEC's appropriation.  The impact of the rescission would be to reduce the staff and, therefore, reduce its ability to oversee our accounts. Again, Mr. Chairman, I think this is an unwise move that we have taken. I am not going to offer an amendment to restore the money, but I want the chairman, as I have told him privately, to know and the House to know, that I intend to work to see if this money can be restored as we go to conference.
