The Congress finds that--       (1) the United States civil justice system is inefficient,      unpredictable, costly, and impedes competitiveness in the      world marketplace for business and employees;       (2) the defects in the civil justice system have a direct      and undesirable effect on interstate commerce by decreasing      the availability of goods and services in commerce;       (3) reform efforts should respect the role of the States in      the development of civil justice rules, but recognize the      national Government's role in removing barriers to interstate      commerce;       (4) the spiralling cost of litigation has continued      unabated for the past 30 years; and       (5) there is a need to restore rationality, certainty, and      fairness to the legal system, to promote honesty and      integrity within the legal profession, and to encourage      alternative means to the contentious litigation system in      resolving disputes.     SEC. 4. AUTHORITY.       This Act is enacted pursuant to Congress' powers under      Article I, section 8, clauses 3, 9, and 18, of the United      States Constitution.     SEC. 5.

(B) The demand for compensation under subparagraph (A)      shall contain the material facts relevant to the civil action      involved and a description of the evidence determined by the      contingent fee attorney to be discoverable by the alleged      liable party during the course of litigation, including--       (i) the name, address, age, marital status and occupation      of the claimant or of the injured or deceased party if the      claimant is operating in a representative capacity;       (ii) a brief description of how the damages arose;       (iii) the names and, if known, the addresses, telephone      numbers, and occupations of all known witnesses;       (iv) copies of photographs in the claimant's possession      which relate to the claim for damages;       (v) the basis for claiming that the party to whom the claim      is addressed is at least partially liable for causing the      injury;       (vi) if the claim for damages is based upon a physical or      mental injury--       (I) a description of the nature of the injury, the names      and addresses of all physicians, other health care providers,      and hospitals, clinics, or other medical service entities      that provided medical care to the claimant or injured party      including the date and nature of the service; and       (II) medical records relating to the injury and those      involving a prior injury or preexisting medical condition      which an allegedly liable party would be able to introduce      into evidence in a trial or, in lieu thereof, providing      executed releases allowing the allegedly responsible party to      obtain such      [[Page S1966]] records directly from the claimant's      physicians, health care providers and entities that provided      medical care; and       (vii) with respect to demand for a compensation that      includes an amount for medical expenses, wages lost or other      special damages suffered as a consequence of the injury,      relevant documentation thereof, including records of earnings      if a claimant is self-employed and employer records of      earnings if a claimant is employed.       (C) A claimant's attorney shall provide copies of each      demand for compensation under this paragraph to the claimant      and to each allegedly liable party at the time of the      dispatch of the demand for compensation. Where reproduction      costs would be significant relative to the size of the      settlement offer, the claimant's attorney, may, in the      alternative, offer other forms of access to the materials,      convenient and at reasonable cost to allegedly responsible      party's attorney.       (D) A contingent fee attorney who fails to file a demand      for compensation under this paragraph shall not be entitled      to any fee greater than 10 percent of any settlement or      judgment received by the claimant client after reasonable      expenses have been deducted.       (5) Time limit for response setting forth settlement      offer.--(A) An allegedly liable party shall have 60 days from      the date of the receipt of a demand for compensation under      paragraph (4) to issue a response stating a settlement offer.       (B) If within 30 days after the date of the receipt of a      demand for compensation under paragraph (4), an allegedly      liable party notifies the attorney of the claimant that such      party seeks to have a medical examination of the claimant,      and the claimant is not made available for such examination      within 10 days after the date of the receipt of such a      request, the 60-day period described under subparagraph (A)      shall be extended by one day for each day that such request      is not honored after the expiration of such 10-day period.      Any such extension shall also include a further period of 10      days from the date of the completion of the medical      examination.       (C) A response under this paragraph shall be open for      acceptance for a minimum of 30 days from the date of the      receipt of such response by the attorney of the claimant and      shall state whether such response expires in 30 days or      remains open for acceptance for a longer period or until      notice of withdrawal is given.       (D) A settlement offer in a response under this subsection      may be increased during the 60-day period described under      subparagraph (A) by issuing an additional response.       (E) If an additional response has been sent under this      paragraph, the time for acceptance shall be 10 days from the      date of the receipt of such additional response by the      attorney of the claimant or 30 days from the date of the      receipt of the initial response, whichever is later, unless      the additional response specifies a longer period of time for      acceptance as described under subparagraph (C).       (6) Material to accompany settlement offer.--An allegedly      responsible party and the attorney of such party shall      include in any response stating a settlement offer under      paragraph (5) copies of materials in their possession      concerning the claim upon which the allegedly liable party      relied in making a settlement offer, except for material      which such party believes in good faith would not be      discoverable by the claimant during the course of litigation.      Where reproduction costs would be significant relative to the      size of the settlement offer, the allegedly responsible      party, may, in the alternative, offer other forms of access      to the materials, convenient and at reasonable cost to      claimant's attorney.       (7) Effect of pre-demand settlement offer.--A settlement      offer under this subsection to a claimant represented by a      contingent fee attorney made prior to the receipt of a demand      for compensation, which is open for acceptance for 60 days or      more from the time of its receipt and which conforms to the      requirements of paragraph (6), shall be considered a post-     retention offer and shall have the same effect under this      subsection as if it were a response to a demand for      compensation.       (8) Pre-retention offer.--(A) An attorney retained after a      claimant has received a pre-retention offer under this      subsection may not enter into an agreement with the claimant      to receive a contingent fee based upon or payable from the      proceeds of the pre-retention offer which remains in effect.       (B) An attorney entering a fee agreement that would      effectively result in a claimant's paying a percentage of a      pre-retention offer to the attorney for prosecuting the claim      shall be considered to have charged an unreasonable and      excessive fee. With respect to an attorney where a pre-     retention offer has been provided--       (i) the attorney may contract with a claimant to receive an      hourly rate fee or fixed fee for advising the claimant      regarding the pre-retention offer; or       (ii) the attorney may contract with a claimant to receive a      contingent fee applicable to any amount received by a      claimant, by settlement or judgment, above the amount of the      pre-retention offer.       (9) Post-retention offer where a pre-retention offer has      been made.--A claimant in receipt of a pre-retention offer      under this subsection which such claimant has not accepted      and who later receives a post-retention offer which is      accepted, is not obligated to pay the retained attorney a fee      greater than the hourly rate fee calculated on the basis of      the number of hours the attorney has worked on behalf of      claimant in furtherance of the claimant's claim, but not      exceeding 20 percent of the excess of the post-retention      offer less the pre-retention offer.       (10) Post-Retention offer where no pre-retention offer has      been made.--A claimant not in receipt of a pre-retention      offer under this subsection who has received a post-retention      offer which is accepted, is not obligated to pay the retained      attorney a fee greater than the hourly rate fee calculated on      the basis of the number of hours the attorney has worked on      behalf of claimant in furtherance of claimant's claim, but      not exceeding 10 percent of the first $100,000, plus 5      percent of any amount above $100,000, of the accepted post-     retention offer after reasonable expenses have been deducted.       (11) Calculation of attorney fee when there is a subsequent      resolution of the claim.--If an allegedly liable party's      post-retention settlement offer under this subsection is      rejected, but a later settlement offer is accepted, or there      is a judgment in favor of claimant, the claimant,      irrespective of any pre-retention offer, is not obligated to      pay the retained attorney a fee greater the sum of--       (A) the amount of the fee that would have been calculated      under paragraph (10) had the post-retention offer been      accepted but only as applied to the subsequent settlement      offer or judgment up to the amount of the post-retention      offer; and       (B) the product of multiplying the contingent fee      percentage negotiated between the contingent fee attorney and      claimant and the amount by which the subsequent settlement or      judgment exceeds the post-retention offer, after reasonable      expenses have been deducted.       (12) Provision of closing statement.--Upon receipt of any      settlement or judgment under this subsection, and prior to      disbursement thereof, a contingent fee attorney shall provide      the claimant with a written statement detailing how the      proceeds are to be distributed, including the amount of the      expenses paid out or to be paid out of the proceeds, the      amount of the fee, how the fee amount is calculated, and the      amount due the claimant.       (13) Effect on contravening agreements.--(A) A contingent      fee attorney who enters into a fee agreement with a claimant      which violates the provisions of this subsection is deemed to      have charged an unreasonable and excessive fee.       (B) A claimant who has entered into an agreement with a      contingent fee attorney which violates the provisions of this      subsection is entitled to recover from the attorney any      reasonable fees and costs incurred to establish such      agreement violated the provisions of this subsection.       (C) The failure by the claimant's attorney, or the attorney      for an alleged responsible party, to comply with the      provisions of this subsection may be considered grounds for      disciplinary proceedings and sanctions as determined      appropriate by the licensing or regulatory agency or court of      the State in which the claim arose.       (c) Amendment to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.--     Rule 11(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is      amended--       (1) in the matter preceding paragraph (1) by striking out      ``may'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``shall'';       (2) in subdivision (1)(A) in the third sentence by striking      out ``may'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``shall''; and       (3) in paragraph (2)--       (A) by amending the first sentence to read as follows: ``A      sanction imposed for a violation of this rule shall be      sufficient to deter repetition of such conduct or comparable      conduct by others similarly situated and to compensate the      parties that were injured by such conduct.''; and       (B) in the second sentence by striking ``, if imposed on      motion and warranted for effective deterrence,''.       (d) Prevailing Party Costs and Attorneys' Fees.--       (1) In general.--Subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), in any      civil action filed against any person in any Federal or State      court, based on any cause of action (including, but not      limited to negligence, strict or product liability, breach of      implied warranty or professional malpractice) in which      damages are sought for tortious physical or mental injury,      property damage, or economic loss the court may award each      prevailing party costs and reasonable attorneys' fees.       (2) Amount of award.--An award of costs and reasonable      attorneys' fees under paragraph (1) may not exceed--       (A) the actual cost incurred by the nonprevailing party or      the attorneys' fee payable for services in connection with      such civil action; or       (B) if no such cost was incurred by the nonprevailing party      due to a contingency fee agreement, an amount equal to the      reasonable costs that would have been incurred by the      nonprevailing party for a noncontingent attorneys' fee      payable for services in connection with such civil action.       (3) Limitation.--       (A) Notwithstanding paragraph (1) or (2), the court shall      not award an attorney's fee in any case in which the      nonprevailing party--       (i) had a taxable income of less than $75,000 in the      calendar year preceding the calendar year in which the civil      action was filed, if the nonprevailing party is an      individual; or     [[Page S1967]]   (ii) had an average taxable income of less      than $50,000 for the 3 calendar years preceding the calendar      year in which the civil action was filed, if the      nonprevailing party is not an individual.       (B) The court shall retain discretion to refuse to award or      may reduce the amount awarded as an attorney's fee under      paragraph (1) to the extent the court finds would be in the      interests of justice.

A      claimant who agrees in writing to such offer shall be      foreclosed from bringing or continuing a civil action against      any allegedly liable defendant and any other individuals or      entities included under subsection (c). The claimant may      extend the time for receiving the offer.       ``(2) Nothing in this section shall preclude a State from      enacting a requirement that compensation benefits offered      under paragraph (1) shall include a minimum dollar amount in      response to a claim for serious injury.       ``(c) An offer under subsection (b) may include other      allegedly liable defendants, individuals, or entities that      were involved in the events which give rise to the civil      action, regardless of the theory of liability on which the      claim is based, with their consent.       ``(d) Future economic damages shall be payable to an      individual under this section as such damages occur.       ``(e) If, after an offer is made under subsection (b), the      participants in the offer dispute their relative      contributions to the payments to be made to the individual,      such disputes shall be resolved through binding arbitration      in accordance with applicable rules and procedures      established by the Attorney General of the United States.       ``(f)(1) In no event shall a civil action be foreclosed      under subsection (b) against any allegedly liable party if      the injured individual elects to prove, beyond a reasonable      doubt, that the allegedly liable party caused the injury by      intentional or wanton misconduct.       ``(2) This subsection shall not apply with respect to a      personal injury unless the injured individual provides the      allegedly liable party making an offer with a notice of such      an election not later than 90 days after the date the offer      of compensation benefits was made.       ``(g) Nothing in this section shall be construed to effect      any applicable statute of limitations of any State or of the      United States.''.       (b) Technical and Conforming Amendments.--The table of      sections for chapter 111 of title 28, United States Code, is      amended by adding at the end thereof the following new item:``1659. Early offer and recovery mechanisms.''.     SEC. 7. REFORM OF JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY.

(b) In General.--(1) Except as provided under subsection      (c), joint and several liability may not be applied to any      civil action or claim against any person, filed in any      Federal or State court, based on any cause of action to      recover damages or compensation for tortious physical or      mental injury, property damage, or economic loss.       (2) A person found liable for damages in any such action--       (A) may be found liable, if at all, only for damages      directly attributable to the person's pro rata share of fault      or responsibility; and       (B) may not be found liable for damages attributable to the      pro rata share of fault or responsibility of any other person      (without regard to whether that person is a party to the      action), including any person filing the action.       (c) Limitation.--This section shall not apply to persons      acting in concert where the concerted action proximately      caused the injury for which one or more persons are found      liable for damages.     SEC. 8. SINGLE RECOVERY.       (a) Inadmissible Evidence.--In any civil action or claim      against any person, filed in any Federal or State court,      based on any cause of action to recover damages or      compensation for tortious physical or mental injury, property      damage, or economic loss, the court shall not allow the      admission into evidence of proof of economic losses that have      been or will be paid by--       (1) Federal, State, or other governmental disability,      unemployment, or sickness programs;       (2) Federal, State, or other governmental or private health      insurance programs;       (3) private or public disability insurance programs;       (4) employer wage continuation programs;       (5) any other program or compensation system, if the      payment is intended to compensate the claimant for the same      injury or disability which is the subject of the claim; or       (6) persons other than family members of the claimant.       (b) Admissible Evidence.--Only evidence of economic loss      that has not or will not be paid by the sources described      under subsection (a) shall be admissible in an action or      claim covered by this section.       (c) Elimination of Subrogation.--An entity that is the      source of the payments for losses that are inadmissible under      subsection (a)--       (1) shall not recover any amount against the claimant;       (2) shall not be subrogated to the rights of the claimant      against the defendant; and       (3) shall not have a lien against the claimant's judgment,      on account of its payment to the claimant for economic loss.       (d) Pretrial Determination.--The determination of whether a      claimant seeking damages or compensation has received, will      receive, or is entitled to receive, payment from any one or      more sources described under subsection (a) (1) through (6)      shall be made by the court in pretrial proceedings.

(a) In General.--Except as provided under section 1977A of      the Revised Statutes (42 U.S.C. 1981a), the amount of      punitive damages that may be awarded in any civil action or      claim filed in any Federal or State court,      [[Page S1968]] based on any cause of action to recover      damages or compensation for tortious physical or mental      injury, property damage, or economic loss shall not exceed      the greater of--       (1) 3 times the amount awarded to the claimant for the      economic injury on which such claim is based; or       (2) $250,000.       (b) Application by Court.--This section shall be applied by      the court and shall not be disclosed to the jury.     SEC. 10. ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION.       (a) General Policy.--The policy of the United States is to      encourage the creation and use of alternative dispute      resolution techniques, and to promote the expeditious      resolution of such actions, because the traditional      litigation process is not always suited to the timely,      efficient, and inexpensive resolution of civil actions.       (b) Notice of Availability of Alternative Dispute      Resolution.--In any civil action or claim arising under any      Federal law or in any diversity action in Federal court, each      attorney who has made an appearance in the case and who      represents one or more of the parties to the action shall,      with respect to each party separately represented, advise the      party of the existence and availability of alternative      dispute resolution options, including extra judicial      proceedings such as minitrials, third-party mediation, court      supervised arbitration, and summary jury trial proceedings.       (c) Certification of Notice.--Each attorney described under      subsection (b) shall, simultaneous with the filing of a      complaint or a responsive pleading, file a certification to      the court that the attorney has provided the notice required      under subsection (b) to the client or clients of such      attorney. The attorney shall state in the certification      whether such client will agree to one or more of the      alternative dispute resolution techniques.       (d) Agreement To Proceed With Alternative Dispute      Resolution.--If all parties to an action agree to proceed      with one or more alternative dispute resolution proceedings,      the court shall issue an appropriate order governing the      conduct of such proceedings. The issuance of an order      governing the proceedings shall constitute a waiver, by each      party subject to the order, of the right to proceed further      in court.     SEC. 11. RELIABILITY OF EXPERT EVIDENCE.       Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence is amended--       (1) by striking out ``If'' and inserting in lieu thereof      ``(a) In General.--Subject to subsection (b), if''; and       (2) by adding at the end thereof the following:       ``(b) Adequate Basis for Opinion.--Testimony in the form of      an opinion by a witness that is based on scientific knowledge      shall be inadmissible in evidence unless the court determines      that such opinion is--       ``(1) based on scientifically valid reasoning; and       ``(2) sufficiently reliable so that the probative value of      such evidence outweighs the dangers specified under rule 403.       (c) Expert Opinions on Novel Scientific Principles or      Discoveries.--Where testimony in the form of an opinion by a      witness is sought to be used to establish a novel scientific      principle or discovery, it shall be admissible only if the      principle or discovery, or its scientific underpinning, is      sufficiently established to have gained general acceptance in      the field in which it belongs.       ``(d) Disqualification.--Testimony by a witness who is      qualified as an expert under subsection (a) is inadmissible      in evidence if such witness is entitled to receive any      compensation directly or indirectly contingent on the legal      disposition of any claim with respect to which such testimony      is offered.''.     SEC. 12. EXPRESS AUTHORIZATION FOR PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION.       (a) In General.--Chapter 85 of title 28, United States      Code, is amended by adding at the end thereof the following      new section:     ``Sec. 1368. Private right of action       ``No district court shall have jurisdiction over any civil      action filed by a party based on a private right of action,      unless such private right of action is expressly authorized      in the statute on which such action is based.''.       (b) Technical and Conforming Amendment.--The table of      sections for chapter 85 of title 28, United States Code, is      amended by adding at the end thereof the following new item:``1368. Private right of action.''.       (c) State Courts.--No Federal statute shall be construed to      give rise to a private right of action in a State court,      unless such private right of action is expressly authorized      in the statute on which such action is based.     SEC. 13. APPLICABILITY.       (a) Preemption.--This Act shall preempt and supersede other      Federal or State laws only to the extent any such law is      inconsistent with this Act. This Act shall not preempt any      Federal or State law that provides for defenses in addition      to those contained in this Act, places greater limitations on      the amount of attorney's fees that can be collected, or      additional disclosure requirements upon attorneys, or      otherwise imposes restrictions on economic, noneconomic, or      punitive damages. Any issue arising under this Act that is      not governed by the provisions of this Act shall be governed      by applicable Federal or State law.       (b) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this Act shall be      construed to--       (1) waive or affect any defense of sovereign immunity      asserted by any State under any provision of law;       (2) waive or affect any defense of sovereign immunity      asserted by the United States;       (3) affect the applicability of any provision of chapter 97      of title 28, United States Code;       (4) preempt State choice-of-law rules with respect to      claims brought by a foreign nation or citizen of a foreign      nation; or       (5) affect the right of any court to transfer venue or to      apply the law of a foreign nation or to dismiss a claim of a      foreign or of a citizen of a foreign nation on the ground of      inconvenient forum.       (c) State Election Regarding Applicability.--A provision of      this Act shall not apply to a State if such State enacts a      statute--       (1) citing the authority of this subsection; and       (2) declaring the election of such State that such      provision shall not apply to the State.     SEC. 14. SEVERABILITY.       If any provision of this Act or the application of any such      provision to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the      remainder of this Act and the application of any provision to      any other person or circumstance shall not be affected      thereby.     SEC. 15. EFFECTIVE DATE.       This Act shall take effect and apply to claims or actions      filed on and after the date occurring 30 days after the date      of enactment of this Act.                               ____________________
