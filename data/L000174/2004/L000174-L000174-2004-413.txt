President, I rise today to bring to the Senate's attention a speech given by Ambassador Thomas Pickering in which he addressed some important issues concerning the Foreign Service.  I had the privilege of hearing this speech during an event at the Smithsonian last year, and I know of no one better qualified to talk about the Foreign Service than Ambassador Pickering. In over 41 years in the Foreign Service, Thomas Pickering served as ambassador to a dizzying number of important countries and international organizations, including Russia, India, Israel, Nigeria, and the United Nations. He also happens to speak 5 foreign languages.  In his speech, Ambassador Pickering warns of the increasing politicization of the Foreign Service. He points out that after disastrous experiences in the Civil War and Spanish-American War, the United States military professionalized its officer corps. Today, with the rise of international terrorism and the proliferation of other complex international problems, we should be thinking along the same lines.  However, we seem to be going in the wrong direction. Increasingly, individuals who have done little more than donate to a political campaign are being placed into key positions within the State Department. Ambassador Pickering appropriately points out that certain political appointees have and will continue to play an important role in pursuing U.S. diplomatic efforts overseas. Bringing individuals like Howard Baker and Felix Rohatyn, who possess unique skills, to the State Department is essential.  But the world is becoming more interconnected and more dangerous. International crises no longer confine themselves to remote corners of the world. For example, the outbreak of a deadly disease in Africa is only a plane ride away from the United States. We need seasoned, talented individuals capable of effectively advancing U.S. interests in key positions in Washington and abroad--not individuals whose primary talent is digging into their pockets to donate to a political campaign.  I urge all Senators to heed Ambassador Pickering's address and ask unanimous consent that the entire speech be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: National Portrait Gallery's Paul Peck Presidential Award--Acceptance                 Speech by Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering       Thank you very much for the kind introduction. I am      grateful to Strobe Talbott for his very kind remarks. Thank      you too for this extremely generous and most unexpected      award. I want to extend my warmest congratulations to Diana      Walker, my co-recipient tonight, for her great contribution      to portraying the presidency. I look forward to doing more      television shows together.       I am even more grateful for this award, given my      distinguished predecessors in receiving it, one of whom,      General Brent Scowcroft, is here tonight, and the high      respect I have for the members of the selection committee.       Let me also thank Mr. Peck for his unstinting generosity to      the Portrait Gallery, the Presidency and to the pursuit of      educational opportunities for disadvantaged Americans,      including African Americans and Hispanics and many others.      Your willingness to support so generously such worthy and      deserving causes is more than admirable. Were I not a      recipient of the award tonight, I would say with equal vigor      ``thank you for doing this for your country and its future.''      I want too to thank all the cooperating foundations and      organizations that made the award and the evening possible.       I would be remiss in my own understanding of reality were I      not to say immediately that it has been my family who have      been my strongest supporters throughout my career in      government. I'm happy to have with me tonight my son Timothy      and members of his family, my daughter Margaret and members      of her family and most especially my wife Alice. To all of      them, but most especially to Alice, my firmest friend and      toughest critic through many fascinating assignments, I owe      the most, and they too should be receiving the award with me      in every sense of the word--they surely deserve it.       I have had the honor of serving every president since Harry      Truman, when I worked as a clerk in the U.S. Post Office and      for the U.S. Weather Bureau as a summer intern in the Arctic.      Since leaving the Foreign Service at the end of 2000, I have      also served on a number of official advisory committees to      U.S. departments and agencies.       My Foreign Service career was highly rewarding and in some      respects, very unusual. I've had the pleasure of serving on      all continents except Australia. But then too, I went to      university there under the Fulbright program. I also spent      three and one-half years in the U.S. Navy and over 41\1/2\ in      the Foreign Service.       I wallowed in diversity, both ethnic and religious. I had      the pleasure of being Ambassador to the world's only Jewish      state (Israel); to a Muslim country (Jordan); to the world's      largest Hindu state where Buddhism was born and where 150      million are Muslims, which makes it the world's second-     largest Muslim state (India); to the largest Orthodox      Christian country in the world (Russia); to a predominantly      Roman Catholic republic (El Salvador); and to two countries,      while still both Christian and Muslim, contain very large      populations which practice traditional African religions      (Nigeria and Tanzania). It's been a wonderful career, even      though my mother often wondered why I kept moving around and      couldn't keep a steady job.       Paul Peck is truly right. Public service, and we all serve      the President in that regard, is essential for our country's      survival and prosperity.       Last year, Mr. Peck encouraged us all to think about change      and improvements--about ways to make our service to the      Presidency and through the Presidency to all of the people      more effective and more valuable.       Tonight, I want to talk about two aspects of that service      and provide you some thoughts on improvement.       I do so in the certain knowledge that the Civil Service,      the military service and the Foreign Service of the United      States have made numerous sacrifices and provided enormous      opportunities for us all as citizens. We are lucky that for      the size of our population, we have one of the smallest      public services in numbers, both at the Federal and State      level, when we compare it with other countries around the      world.       Also, I see it as one which is generally dedicated,      intelligent and hard-working. Indeed, our public found out      how essential was our public service when just a few years      ago in a budget battle, there were selective shutdowns of      activities of the Federal Service and the public uproar was      immediate, vigorous and sustained.       However, I must tell you I am troubled by the fact that in      our presidential elections there has been an increasing      tendency for presidential candidates to run against our      public service. It's not just the talk of ``clean up the mess      in Washington'', but that plays a role in it. There have been      implications that the public service hasn't been faithful or      it has been lazy and self-indulgent, or that it has not met      the needs of the people. And the candidate of course will not      only throw out the rascals from the opposing party, but go      down to Washington and clean up ``that mess'' for once and      for all.       This has hurt the reputation of our career public servants      and I am concerned that in another oncoming electoral season,      we will see much of the same rhetoric repeated. I hope I am      wrong. I will keep my fingers crossed. But on the very off-     chance that any candidates are listening tonight, I ask them      to consider this issue carefully.       Secondly, I am concerned by the increasing, what I can only      call, politicization of our Civil and Foreign Service.       We all know that over the years, Congressional legislation      has sought to draw a clear bright line between public service      and the elected political leadership. Indeed, that is as it      should be.       As a public servant, I have understood the necessity for      loyalty to the President and his policies. That too is as it      should be. Our system has always provided a remedy if there      was conflict or confusion--resignation.       But let me mention that during recent administrations, in      the department that I know best, the Department of State,      there has been a general replacement in jobs, some well down      in the bureaucracy, of career appointments with political      appointments.       Let me also note that the plumb book which lists these jobs      has grown several fold over the last two decades, yet again      another indication of the pressure of politics on the public      service.       And then, let me mention something that I perhaps know even      more about--Ambassadors.       As an Ambassador who served coming from the Career Service,      I appreciate what my colleagues from outside the Career      Service have often brought to the job. There have been, and      continue to be, outstanding appointments to those jobs. Stu      Eizenstat and Howard Baker, and might I add Nancy Kassebaum      Baker in Japan, and Felix Rohatyn in France are but a few      fine examples, and there are many others--Max Kampelman and      Sol Linowitz among others.       What disturbs me is the large number of such appointments      for whom one cannot say they bring special knowledge,      background, experience or wisdom to the job. We must be frank      that they are there because they are being rewarded in the      main for their financial contributions to the winning      political party. At a time of war on terrorism that should      not be the standard for such service!       The spoils system went out in the 1880s, but this remnant      is not one that speaks well of our Presidency or indeed of      our needs at a time when we are the undoubted leader of the      world community in such a war.       One wag has remarked that the first job that was truly      professionalized by popular acclaim was brain surgery. And      after disastrous experiences in the Civil and Spanish-     American war, we professionalized our Military Officer Corps.       Right now, by tradition more than anything else, about 70%      of our Ambassadors are from the Career Service and 30% from      the outside. Not too long ago, a distinguished American      senator, who has gone on to serve at a high post in the      Executive Branch, led the fight for reducing that number to      10%. He was unsuccessful, but I don't believe the project      should be abandoned.       Where knowledge, experience and good training can make a      difference, America deserves the best. The Career Service is      organized to do that, and I would hope that this important      improvement, in what I believe is the spirit of Paul Peck's      Award, can be picked up and implemented in the future,      despite my full understanding of all the difficulties in      doing so. And I say that in full knowledge of the fact that      the Career Service needs to send its best men and women to      this assignment.       For me and for all of my colleagues in the Foreign Service      and with all of those with whom I worked in the Civil and      Military Service, it was and is always a privilege to serve      this country.       Every day was a day of new challenges and new      opportunities. I used to tell my staff that the day in which      you did not learn something new and important in the service      of our country as a day wasted.       You all, as Americans, gave us that opportunity. If I was      able to give something back to you in return, then it was for      me both a great pleasure and the highest honor.       Thank you most sincerely for your recognition tonight.      Because you recognize public service as well as individuals      at this occasion, I am pleased as well to tell you that my      acceptance of this honor must be on behalf of all of those      who have so loyally and faithfully served our country down      through the generations.       Thank you very much.                          ____________________
