Speaker, I would ask the leader, and we have had this discussion before, we are all hopeful, I think, that the discussions between the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Tauzin) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Dingell) and the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Capps), who is on the floor, who has been such a leader in this legislation, and others on the gentleman's side of the aisle could come and reach agreement.  However, if an agreement could not be reached, the problem is with the Suspension Calendar that it allows no amendments and therefore allows of no alternative possibilities to be considered by the whole House.  We would hope that if this matter cannot be resolved, and we are hopeful that it can, and I know I speak for the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Capps), she is hopeful that it can, and I think I speak for the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Dingell) and the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Tauzin) as well, that they would like to reach agreement; but if agreement cannot be reached, I would urge the majority leader to bring this bill to the floor with the procedure that allows for alternative proposals to be considered by the whole House.  Mr. DeLAY. If the gentleman will continue to yield, Mr. Speaker, I do understand his concerns. We are working very, very hard on this bill. I think we can bring this bill to the floor. It is needed.  Frankly, we have been working on it for way too long. It should have been passed weeks ago. I have every confidence that we can bring a bill to the floor that will get an overwhelming vote by this House.
