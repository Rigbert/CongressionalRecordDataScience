President, while the Senate is using scarce floor time to debate probably the most anti-environmental judicial nominee this body has seen, it has blocked any attempts to strengthen environmental and public health protections. Sitting on deck are critical bills to help cut harmful air pollutants, combat climate change, clean up toxic waste sites and protect our natural resources and improve our nuclear security.  In fact, the Republican leadership only begrudgingly conceded six hours of floor time for Senators McCain and Lieberman's Climate Stewardship Act after blocking its consideration during the energy debate. Although the scientific and economic evidence of the toll climate change is and will take on this country, the Senate leadership continues to bury its head in the sand.  That is 6 hours total this Congress for the environment.  No time to consider Senator Jeffords's Clean Power Act that would finally require power plants to reduce emissions of toxic air pollutants like mercury. No time to consider the Chemical Security Act that would help ensure chemical plants are prepared for terrorist attacks. No time for the Toxic Cleanup Polluter Pays Renewal Act to reinstate fees paid by oil and chemical companies to cleanup waste sites across the country. No time for the Nuclear Infrastructure Security Act to improve security at over 100 nuclear facilities around the country.  Despite bipartisan support, Republican leadership has also blocked consideration of several bills to improve coastal protections. Of course, they also have failed to bring up any of the appropriations bills to fund our national parks, wildlife refuges and national forests or environmental cleanup programs.  Hundreds of thousands of Americans suffer every year from illnesses linked to emissions from power plants. One-fourth of Americans live within four miles of a Superfund waste site. Shouldn't the Senate be spending time finding solutions to these issues instead of debating a judicial nominee who wants to dismantle many of environmental protections?  Senate Republicans dare to come to the Senate floor to complain that Democrats are obstructionists when we have already confirmed nearly 200 of President Bush's judicial nominees. The Republican leadership has scheduled hundreds of hours for debate on judicial nominations but has allowed only six hours for debate on the critical issues affecting the health of our environment.  Packing the bench is obviously a top priority for this administration. Protecting our natural resources, along with our health, is not. By picking the most extreme judicial nominees, on the environment and other issues, the Bush administration demonstrates that one of its real long-term goals is to roll back these important protections.                          ____________________
