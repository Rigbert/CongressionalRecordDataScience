 In other words, Senator Conrad has selected five of the nine principles agreed on by budgeteers. Most importantly, Senator Conrad didn't use the ``overall principle,'' which reads:       An economic stimulus package should be based on the      recognition that long-term fiscal discipline is essential to      economic growth. Measures to stimulate the economy should be      limited in time so that as the economy recovers, the budget      regains a surplus that is at least equal to the surplus in      Social Security. Any short-term economic stimulus should not      result in higher long-term interest rates.  There is nothing in that comment with which I disagree. The point is, this principle is very important, and it ought to be followed. Senator Conrad spent a lot of time dwelling on the rough 10-year revenue loss numbers of the Senate Republican and Senate Democratic plan. Senator Conrad, however, left out an important assumption. I will explore the assumption Senator Conrad left out.  As has been the case with all proposals from the Republican side, Chairman Conrad has attacked the stimulus plan as, among other things, ``fiscally irresponsible.'' Of course, I contest those unfounded and unfair criticisms. The plan is a straightforward proposal that will provide immediate economic stimulus. It will also give aid to dislocated workers, and it will help with their health insurance problems while being laid off, and it is fiscally reasonable. In fact, we have been in discussions with Senator Baucus's staff on these latter issues, such as dislocated workers and health insurance issues. So our plan follows on the President's four principles that were really the starting point of this debate first of all. That is what we ought to give President Bush credit for. He was presenting to the Congress the need for a stimulus package before many other people in Congress were even talking about the need for it.  Since his tenure as ranking member, and now chairman, of the Budget Committee, Senator Conrad has placed all Republican tax cut proposals under very strict scrutiny. Senator Conrad has assumed that any temporary tax cut, no matter the terms of the proposal, would be made permanent. The assumption was then incorporated into his budgetary analysis. Without fail, the conclusion is then used as a basis to argue that long-term budget implications of any temporary tax cut make it ``fiscally irresponsible.''  We have before us a Democratic caucus stimulus proposal that contains two elements. One element is a combination of tax cuts and new temporary entitlement spending. Another element of the proposal is Senator Byrd's $20 billion ``infrastructure package.'' The two elements have been frequently mentioned by Democrat leadership, including Senators Daschle and Reid, as the Senate Democratic position. When analyzed, these proposals are described as having a fiscal impact of $90 billion in fiscal year 2002 and $60 billion over 10 years.  Here is where you get into this double standard of scoring Republicans one way and Democrats another way. The scoring presented by the Democratic caucus, however, fails to employ Senator Conrad's convention regarding permanency. They don't take that into consideration. If we apply Chairman Conrad's convention to the new spending and assume permanency, the 10-year cost of the new spending package totals $526 billion.  Think about it, Mr. President. In these times, Senator Conrad has determined that it is fiscally responsible to spend an additional $526 billion over 10 years. As a point of reference, this figure compares with the tax cuts of roughly $175 billion in the Senate Republican caucus position.  I ask unanimous consent that an analysis of the 10-year cost of the new spending in the Democratic caucus stimulus plan be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:    ANALYSIS OF SURPLUS IMPACT OF PERMANENT SENATE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS                           STIMULUS PROPOSALS                        [In billions of dollars]------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                FY 2002-                                                       FY 2002     11------------------------------------------------------------------------1.
