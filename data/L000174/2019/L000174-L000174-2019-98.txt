 Justice Skoglund is what we all want to see in a jurist and public servant. She is dedicated, personable, and highly committed to the rule of law, but her path to the Vermont Supreme Court was anything but typical. As a single mother working hard to get by in the 1970s, law school was not an option. Instead, she took advantage of Vermont's ``Reading the Law'' approach that allowed her to study while serving as an apprentice of sorts with the Vermont Attorney General's office. After being admitted to the Vermont Bar, she would go on to serve as chief of the civil law and public protection divisions in the AG's office before being appointed to the bench in 1994 by then-Governor Howard Dean. She would be elevated to the supreme court just 3 years later. At the time, she was only the second woman to serve on Vermont's highest court. Today, women make up the majority of its five justices.  I have had the pleasure of knowing Justice Skoglund during her many years of living and working in my hometown of Montpelier. Her personal story was so compelling that she was my first choice in 2008 to keynote Vermont's Women's Economic Opportunity Conference, an annual event I have now hosted for 23 years.  But no tribute to Justice Skoglund would be complete if it did not mention her keen sense of humor. Perhaps it is this trait that has so deftly served her these many years, for as serious as the supreme court must be in delivering justice, Marilyn Skoglund has demonstrated time and again the benefit oflaughter in our lives. She finds the time to appreciate what some might only see as mundane; she cherishes her friendships, and she mentors those who will succeed us. By her own account, she has led a full life.  I ask unanimous consent that these excerpts of the May 1 Seven Days profile of Justice Skoglund be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                     [From Seven Days, May 1, 2019]  Justice Served: Marilyn Skoglund to Retire From the Vermont Supreme                                  Court                            (By Paul Heintz)       On her way out the door of her Montpelier home last Friday,      Vermont Supreme Court Justice Marilyn Skoglund rolled up her      right sleeve to show off her latest tattoo.       ``I waited until my youngest daughter's wedding,'' the      justice said with a sneaky smile. ``I knew she wouldn't want      me to get it.''       Written in a simple black cursive on the inside of her arm      were the words, ``Jag ar matt,'' a Swedish expression often      uttered in her childhood home at the conclusion of a family      meal. ``I am satisfied,'' she translated. ``I am full.''       The 72-year-old jurist reflected for a moment--perhaps on a      life rich in family, friends, dogs and the law--and declared,      ``I am satisfied! I mean, what else can you say? I'm very      lucky. I am satisfied.''       This week, Skoglund plans to inform Gov. Phil Scott that,      after 22 years on the state's highest court, she intends to      resign effective September 1.       Skoglund's retirement brings to a close one of the most      remarkable and least likely careers in the Vermont      judiciary--that of a struggling single mother who passed the      bar without a day of law school and worked her way up to      become the second female justice in state history.       Now, the famously irreverent attorney is looking for a new      challenge, be it the beginning Spanish class she plans to      take this fall or the online bartender course she's long      contemplated. ``I just need to take a chance and see what      else I can do before I drop dead,'' she said, letting loose      her trademark cackle.       Skoglund's sense of humor has long served as the      ``collegiality glue'' on the court of five, according to      retired justice John Dooley. In her decades on the bench, she      has made it her mission to draw colleagues and staff members      out of their casework and into the world--through court      poetry slams, end-of-term parties and art openings at the      Supreme Court gallery she founded and oversees.       ``I would describe her as a unifier,'' said Victoria      Westgate, a Burlington attorney who clerked with her from      2013 to 2014. The justice has also served as a role model to      a generation of young women in the law, Westgate said.       Though Skoglund may be best known for her larger-than-life      personality, colleagues describe her as a deeply serious      jurist with an unmatched work ethic.       ``Of all the justices I've worked with, I think she      probably put . . . more effort into preparing and      understanding a case than any,'' said Dooley, who served      alongside Skoglund for two of his three decades on the court      . . .       Born in Chicago and raised in St. Louis, Skoglund had what      she describes as an ``idyllic childhood,'' replete with a      picket fence and parents who were ``the Swedish equivalent of      Ozzie and Harriet.'' Her father managed a steel treatment      plant and her mother, a former hairdresser and math tutor,      raised the future justice and her sister.       Skoglund spent seven years meandering her way through      Southern Illinois University--a fine arts major and ``hippie      folk singer'' who worked, for a time, as a graphic designer      for the inventor and futurist Buckminster Fuller. She finally      earned her diploma after getting married and becoming      pregnant with her first daughter.       The young family moved to Vermont in 1973 so that      Skoglund's husband could take a job teaching painting and      printmaking at Goddard College. They rented a small,      uninsulated cottage on a 500-acre dairy farm in Plainfield.      Skoglund learned to milk cows, taught photography and worked      as an editor at Goddard. The marriage didn't last, though,      and soon she was raising her daughter on her own.       Skoglund found herself relying upon the generosity of      Walter Smith, the 68-year-old dairy farmer who served as her      landlord and her ``very own personal version of welfare.'' He      provided firewood when she needed it and let her dip raw milk      from the bulk tank. When she and her daughter were low on      food, they would join Smith for cans of chicken noodle soup      and mayonnaise sandwiches.       ``He saw me through it,'' she said.       Skoglund's experience with poverty later informed her work      on the bench and, she said, gave her ``a very good      understanding of desperation and frustration and what it      causes people to do.'' ``I think I'm the only justice that's      ever been poor,'' she said.       After completing a six-month paralegal class, Skoglund      landed a clerkship in the Vermont Attorney General's Office      and began reading for the law--an alternative route to the      bar that enables aspiring attorneys to bypass law school      through independent study. It was a solitary, self-motivated      education, but I am disciplined,'' she wrote in a recent      essay about her unconventional path. ``In the central office      of the attorney general, I was the only student with about 50      `teachers.' ''       Skoglund spent four years clerking for Louis Peck, then the      chief assistant attorney general and later a Supreme Court      justice. She would run lines for Peck, an amateur actor, and      he would school her in the law. Skoglund credits him with      informing her ``legally conservative'' approach. ``I don't      take liberties with the language, and I don't read myself      into it,'' she said. ``It's not about you, Marilyn.''       Skoglund spent 17 years in the Attorney General's Office,      eventually serving as chief of its civil law division and      then its public protection division. She was appointed to the      Superior Court in 1994 and to the Supreme Court in 1997.       ``It's like candy,'' Skoglund said of her current gig. ``I      have never been bored.''       The pace of the job wouldn't allow it. The supremes hear an      average of 120 full cases a year, plus many more appeals on      the so-called ``rocket docket.'' They're also consumed by the      myriad unseen administrative duties of the judicial branch,      such as divvying up its ``shoestring'' budget and managing      the lower courts.       ``This all takes hours when all I want to be doing is      reading cases,'' Skoglund said. . . .       According to Skoglund, her acid prose occasionally gives      her law clerks ``panic attacks.'' But members of her tight      fraternity of former clerks praise her ``dedication to      raising a new generation'' of lawyers, as Todd Daloz put it.       ``She has a real energy and a real humor and a real joy of      life,'' said Daloz, who clerked for Skoglund from 2009 to      2011 and now serves as associate general counsel for the      Vermont State Colleges System.       ``When I hire [clerks], I explain that I'm hiring my best      friend for the next year,'' Skoglund said. ``I have to be      able to come in and vent and bitch and moan and get solace      from them.''. . .       For the past 35 years, Skoglund has lived in a tall, brown-      and green-shingled house perched above the Statehouse on the      southern boundary of Hubbard Park. The place is crammed with      books and artwork and features a ``wall of dogs'' consisting      of canine paintings she's collected. ``It's kind of a magical      place for me,'' she said of her home, where she does much of      her off-the bench legal work. ``It's just a sanctuary.''       Skoglund's two grown daughters, an obstetrician and a      neuropsychologist, have long since moved out. Her current      roommates include a 4-year-old goldendoodle named Johnny and,      during Vermont's four-month legislative session, Senate      Majority Leader Becca Balint (D-Windham). ``I always say I      have the best roommate,'' Balint said. ``Sometimes it's seven      o'clock in the morning and we're both crying because we're      laughing so hard.'' . . .       Last Friday morning, after showing off her tattoo, Skoglund      wrapped an unused dog leash around her waist and commenced      her three-block commute down the hill and past the Statehouse      to the Supreme Court. Johnny pranced along in front of her,      relishing his freedom.       Skoglund gushed about her daughters and 9-year-old      granddaughter, with whom she had spent the previous weekend.       ``They're not thrilled with this tattoo--at least, the      younger one isn't,'' she conceded. ``But that's the way it      goes, ladies. Mom's gotta do what Mom's gotta do.''       Skoglund entered the court through a side door and showed      off one of her most concrete contributions to the      institution: an art gallery in the lobby of the building that      she's curated for the past 20 years.       ``When I first got here, it was the hall of dead      justices,'' she said, referring to the oil paintings of her      predecessors, now relegated to the stairways and upper      floors. In their place was a series of mixed-media pieces by      the artist Janet Van Fleet consisting of red buttons and      plastic animals. Johnny led Skoglund up to her third-floor      office, which features a smiling boar's head mounted to a      wall. ``Behind you is Emmet, my amanuensis,'' she said,      gesturing at the hairy creature. ``A lot of those wild boar      things look scary and vicious. He's just sweet.''       Skoglund took a seat behind her cluttered desk and said,      with a resigned tone of voice, ``I've been here for 22 years.      It's time to go.''       Asked how she hoped people would remember her, Skoglund      answered without hesitation. ``I worked hard,'' she said. ``I      took my position very seriously. I never cut corners. I      understood the responsibility. That's what I hope.''                          ____________________
