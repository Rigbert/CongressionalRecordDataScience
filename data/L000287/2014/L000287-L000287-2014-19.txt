Speaker, I rise today to honor a very special woman, Mrs. Mary Sallie Clark Hughes, of Atlanta, Georgia. She turned 100 years old on December 8, 2013, and I am so grateful to call her a constituent and a friend.  Mr. Speaker, for the last 75 years, Mrs. Hughes has been a missionary for those left out and left behind. She has worked tirelessly to provide clothes to local homeless men and women, as well as victims of fires and other disasters. Her heart is so big that everyone who knows her calls her ``Mother Hughes.'' She has dedicated her life to principle of service--service to God, service to others, and service to the Beloved Community.  At the beautiful age of 100, Mother Hughes is still going strong. She recently earned a certification in theology from the Interdenominational Theological Center. As their oldest graduate to date, Mrs. Hughes inspires others to never abandon their goals and dreams. Her compassion is remarkable, patriotic, and certainly worthy of recognition from this body.  As you can imagine, on her birthday this year, many people gathered in Atlanta to honor her tireless and caring spirit and dedication. I unfortunately was unable to attend this wonderful celebration because of the death of Nelson Mandela. I wish I could have joined so many others in my community in thanking Mother Hughes for her tireless work, lasting legacy of love, and compassion for those most in need.                          ____________________
