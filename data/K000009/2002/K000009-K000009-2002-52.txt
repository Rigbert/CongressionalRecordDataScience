We have already lost over 100,000 jobs to Mexico directly. That does not even count the supplier jobs and the service jobs that are associated with those corporate relocations.  The impact is staggering. Income growth in our region and our State has not gone up. In fact, it has been stagnant, and in many cases has been going down. People do not have the purchasing power. And the jobs that are replacing them are part-time jobs with no health and retirement benefits.  If we look at, and I will just give one example and then yield the gentleman back his time, but one of the major corporations, and I hate to pick on a West European company, but Daimler-Benz-Chrysler, for example, they are one of the many automotive manufacturers that have moved production to Mexico, and they manufacture the PT Cruiser in Toluca, Mexico. Now, that is a very popular vehicle in our country. All the PT Cruisers are sent back here. There is not a single PT Cruiser manufactured in the United States of America.  Now, in our district we make the Jeep Liberty. We are the home of the jeep in Toledo, Ohio, and there are so many orders backed up for the PT Cruiser, our workers contacted the company and said, look, why do you not bring some of the excess production from Toluca up to Toledo? We will put on an extra line, we will meet the backlog, and we will be able to share in this rising market. No deal. No deal, because they can pay workers in Mexico so little, they can literally make $10,000 more a car. They do not have to pay environmental costs. They do you not have to pay decent wages.  The people that work in Toluca cannot afford to buy the cars they make. Go to the places where they live and ask yourself, is this what we want for the world, people who have to use batteries to have any electricity in their home because they live at such a low wage?  So if we peel the veneer off, and I must say I am not just picking on Daimler-Chrysler, because it is the same with the Japanese auto manufacturers, the Koreans, it really does not matter with these multinational corporations which country they are from, but their behavior where they locate. And, unfortunately, those jobs, if all the PT Cruisers are sold in the United States, why should they not be made here? There is a real disjuncture between production and consumption, and, therefore, our plant in Toledo has not increased in employment.  Years ago we had 10,000 workers. We are down to 4,000. There are several hundred workers, several thousand workers actually, down in Mexico around that Toluca plant, but they are working at, I cannot say starvation wages, but close to it. They really do not have a living wage. That is what is going on with production. We are really hurting those people. We can say we are keeping them busy, but they are not really able to improve their lives. And our people, with the loss of over 1.2 million manufacturing jobs in just the last 2 years, they are being cashed out.  Mr. DeFAZIO. If the gentlewoman would yield back, in fact, she is making an excellent point. Henry Ford sort of figured out the formula for success in this country back early in the last century. He said, I want to produce aproduct on an assembly line with a large number of workers, and I want my workers to be able to buy it.  And we did phenomenally well as a country. The managers, the owners of capital, and the workers all kind of came up together. Sure, the managers always did better, and the owners even did better yet, but there was some proportionality. The workers could afford to buy the products, and it created tremendous wealth for our Nation. It created an industrial base that won World War II and was the envy of the world. We rebuilt the world after World War II, led the race to space, and everything else, all those things. That was American technology based on sort of this formula of equality.                              {time}  1845  But now greed has taken over as we have seen in so many ways in corporate America, and if they can get the labor, desperate labor somewhere else a little cheaper, and avoid environmental restrictions, that is where they want to manufacture. And their vehicle is these free trade agreements. They cannot do it without the imprint and the approval of the President of the United States secretly negotiating deals that favor the export of their capital and their manufacturing jobs to these other countries.  The problem is ultimately it is going to collapse; but they will not care, like the managers of Enron who had already looted the company and are living in their six, seven or eight mansions, and they may have to sell one of their mansions.
