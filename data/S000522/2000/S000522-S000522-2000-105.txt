Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, this amendment would, I am sure unintentionally, jeopardize our national security and endanger public safety. Often the Government obtains classified evidence which, if provided to terrorists and made public, would gravely endanger U.S. agents and weaken U.S. intelligence sources.  When the Government uses classified evidence to remove a terrorist, the terrorist often delays the deportation with lengthy court appeals. Usually the terrorist must be detained during his appeal, since Justice Department studies show that more than 90 percent of criminal or terrorist aliens are likely to abscond. This amendment would eliminate the funding used to detain terrorists if classified evidence is used against them. This would force the Justice Department to choose between either letting terrorists go free within the United States or revealing classified evidence that could expose U.S. agents abroad and compromise U.S. intelligence operations.  In sum, this amendment would make the Government release terrorists regardless of the consequences. It would effectively require the Government to release terrorists and suspected terrorists who are now in custody and who would then be free to commit other terrorist actions. The use of classified evidence against terrorists is a rare but vital law enforcement tool that must be managed carefully by U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies.  The Justice Department is now conducting a review of all pending cases to ensure that individuals are not held without justification. Meanwhile, it would be dangerous to abolish all use of classified evidence against terrorists.  This amendment is opposed by the Justice Department, the Anti-Defamation League, and other law enforcement and intelligence agencies and anti-terrorist organizations. I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, too.
