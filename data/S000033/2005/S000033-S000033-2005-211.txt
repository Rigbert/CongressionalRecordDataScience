 Speaker, I am pleased to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the city of Burlington Electric Department. What an incredible achievement!  One of the great experiences I had as Mayor was seeing, close up, how much it mattered to Burlington's citizens that we had public power, and not a for-profit corporation, delivering the electricity our city's households and businesses need. The results are clear. Burlington today has some of the lowest electric bills in the state. And that is no small matter when families are hard pressed by increasing gasoline and fuel oil prices, and the difficult economy that is faced by so many.  When the goal of a department is to provide the best quality service at the lowest possible cost, rather than huge profits and big CEO compensation packages, amazing things can happen. Through innovative and creative management and by utilizing aggressive energy efficiency measures, electricity use in Burlington is 1 percent below what it was in 1989--saving Burlington customers some $6.7 million a year. Burlington is using less power at a time of economic growth--a remarkable achievement. Since 1995 average rates have decreased by 17 percent. Clearly there is something very right about the Burlington Electric Department which the rest of Vermont and America can learn from.  Several years ago I brought a number of the most innovative electric departments in the country together for a meeting in Washington. I was very proud that the BED showed itself to be one of the very best in the nation. Given the major energy crisis that our country now faces, I am confident that BED will continue to come forward with bold and innovative ideas to protect our rate-payers and our environment.  Whether it is in the normal operation of business, or dealing with power outages from an ice storm or a blizzard, the employees of Burlington Electric serve the people of Burlington with real dedication. Whatever the job is, they get it done.  To Mayor Clavelle, Barbara Grimes, BED's General Manager; to the Electric Commission; and the City Council; and most especially to the men and women who not only work for the Electric Department but make it work for all of Burlington:  Congratulations on BED's hundredth anniversary.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Page E1777]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]     CONGRATULATIONS ON THE BURLINGTON ELECTRIC DEPARTMENT'S 100TH                               ANNIVERSARY                                 ______                                                           HON.
