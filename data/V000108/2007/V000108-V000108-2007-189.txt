Chairman, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's amendment.  I again would reference some of his words where he indicated that $18 million is no small sum of money. It is a very significant sum of money, and Iwould agree with him. It is a significant sum of money, and it is very important to the programs that comprise the Mississippi River and Tributaries Program. And my concern is, if you would, carving out a particular geographic region for this particular cut and would emphasize that while it is but one geographic region and water system within our country, there are consequences of the amendments because channel improvement programs in Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, and Tennessee would be affected. There are levees for the Mississippi River in States like Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, and Tennessee. There is a flood waste system in the State of Louisiana, and there are operation and maintenance costs.  These are all significant and important programs dealing, again, with the priority of people's health and safety, the movement of commerce, and the protection of property.  I strongly oppose the gentleman's amendment.
