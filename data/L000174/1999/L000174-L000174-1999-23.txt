President, I am pleased that the Senate today is passing the Abraham-Leahy substitute amendment to S.761, the Millennium Digital Commerce Act. This bill seeks to permit and encourage the continued expansion of electronic commerce, and to promote public confidence in its integrity and reliability. These are worthy goals--goals that I have long sought to advance. In the last Congress, many of us worked together to pass the Government Paperwork Elimination Act, which established a framework for the federal government's use of electronic forms and electronic signatures. Today's legislation is part of our continuing efforts to ease the burdens of conducting business electronically.  This is an important bill on an issue of paramount concern to American businesses that engage in electronic commerce. It has had a long journey since it was reported by the Commerce Committee in June. As reported, the bill took a sweeping approach, preempting untold numbers of federal, state and local laws that require contracts, records and signatures to be in traditional written form. I was concerned that such a sweeping approach would radically undermine legislation that is currently in place to protect consumers.  For example, the Committee-passed bill would have enabled businesses to use their superior bargaining power to compel or confuse consumers into waiving their rights to insist on paper disclosures and communications, even when they do not have the technological capacity to receive, retain, and print electronic records. Could a borrower be compelled to receive delinquency or foreclosure notices by electronic mail, even if she did not have a computer, or her computer could not read the notices in the electronic format in which they were sent? Would she be entitled to revert to paper communications if her computer broke or became obsolete? Could a company require customers to check its Web site for important safety information regarding its products, or for recall notices?  Under S.761 as reported, the company would not have been required to provide any information on paper, even if a state consumer protection law so required. Crucial information about the consumer's rights and obligations would not be received. It was federal preemption beyond need, to the detriment of American consumers.  The problem did not stop there. When information is provided electronically, for it to be useful at a later time to prove its contents, the electronic file must be tamperproof. Otherwise, a consumer could inadvertently change a single byte on the file and thus make it technically different from the original, and useless to prove its contents. The consumer would be left without any means of proving critical terms of the contract, including the terms of the warranty.  I have been working with Senator Abraham and others since August to address these and other concerns I had with the bill. We crafted a bipartisan compromise several weeks ago, but it fell apart after certain industry representatives complained that it did not go far enough to relieve them of federal and state regulatory authority. Fortunately, other industry representatives recognized that this was not the primary or even an intended purpose of this legislation, and worked to get the legislative process back on track. I am pleased that we were able to do this and that we were able to reach agreement, for the second time, on an Abraham-Leahy substitute that encourages the continued expansion of electronic commerce, while leaving in place essential safeguards protecting the nation's consumers.  In a letter dated November 5, 1999, the National Conference of State Legislatures identified what it believed were four essential criteria for any federal legislation related to electronic signatures:       (1) Any preemption of state law and authority must be      limited in duration. The idea should be to ensure the      validity of most electronic signatures for a period of time,      thus giving the states time to act. (2) States     must be allowed to adopt the Uniform Electronic Transactions      Act or some similar legislation. (3) Essential state consumer      protections must be preserved, along with the capacity of      states to enact consumer protection measures in the future.      (4) Any federal legislation must be limited to the topic of      electronic signatures. It must not embrace any preemption of      state regulatory and record keeping authority.  The Abraham-Leahy substitute meets these criteria.  Most importantly, the scope of the bill has been limited to address the principal concern of industry. When Senator Abraham introduced S.761 earlier this year, he said it was designed to eliminate uncertainty about the legality of electronic contracts signed with electronic signatures. Consistent with this design, the Abraham-Leahy substitute ensures that contracts will not be denied legal effect that they otherwise have under state law solely because they are in electronic form or because they were signed electronically. However, as section 4(4) of the bill makes clear, an electronic signature is valid only if executed by a person who intended to sign the contract.  The purpose of this legislation is to facilitate electronic commerce over the Internet. It is not intended that this legislation be the basis for unfair or deceptive attempts by some to avoid providing mandated information, disclosures, notices or content. For example, when the parties have conducted a transaction entirely in person, the fine print of a form contract cannot include an agreement that the contract can be provided electronically rather than on paper. The basic rules of good faith and fair dealing apply to electronic commerce, and this legislation is not intended to be a basis upon which consumers can be asked to agree to terms and conditions for using electronic signatures and electronic records which are unreasonable based on the circumstances surrounding the transaction.  Further, accurate copies of contracts must be delivered to consumers. The Abraham-Leahy substitute amendment therefore provides that if a law requires a contract to be in writing, an electronic record of the contract will not satisfy such law unless it is delivered to all parties in a form that can be retained for later reference and used to prove the terms of the agreement. This important provision is intended to protect consumers who execute contracts online, by ensuring that contracts are provided in a tamperproof, or ``read-only'' format. The delivery of any other type of electronic record would make it useless to prove its terms in court.  The new legislation also improves on the Committee-passed version by eliminating its ``intent'' section, which established interpretive rules regarding the intent of the parties to an electronic transaction. These rules inappropriately allowed businesses to put the risk of forgery, unauthorized use, and identity theft on consumers, by making it easier for the proponent of an electronic record or electronic signature to prove its authenticity. By eliminating these rules, we have ensured that current contract and evidence laws remain in place. A person is always entitled to assert that an electronic signature is a forgery, was used without authority, or otherwise is invalid for reasons that would invalidate the effect of a signature in written form.  Having just last year worked with Senator Kyl on passage of the Kyl-Leahy substitute to S.512, the Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act, to combat identity theft, we should be careful to avoid taking actions that could have the unintended consequence of making such crimes easier to commit.  In his introductory floor statement, Senator Abraham stressed that S.761 was an interim measure, which would provide a national baseline for the use of electronic signatures only until the states enacted their own e-signature legislation. To ensure the temporary nature of the federal preemption, the Abraham-Leahy substitute which passes the Senate today includes a significant change from earlier versions of S.761, including the version reported by the Commerce Committee. The Committee bill preempted a state's laws until the state enacted the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (``UETA'') as reported by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Law, or any variation that was ``authorized or provided for in such report.'' The full Senate votes today on language that gives states more leeway on the version of the UETA that they choose to pass--including more leeway to adopt strong consumer protections. The revised definition is meant to cover the electronic transactions legislation passed earlier this year by the State of California, and will preserve the capacity of states to perform their traditional role in protecting the health and safety of their citizens.  Nothing in this bill would allow any of the notices that may accompany an electronic contract to be provided electronically. This is especially important to ensure that consumers are apprised of all their rights under federal and state laws. It was the records language of S.761 that held the greatest potential to harm consumers, with its across-the-board invalidation of hard-won consumer protections embodied in such laws as the Truth in Lending Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, and others. I am pleased that the sponsors of this legislation agreed to remove the electronic records language so that we can allow the critical provisions regarding contracts and signatures to move forward. There will be time in the coming months to revisit the broader issue of electronic records, and to craft legislation that will not place consumers at risk.  In the meantime, contrary to some of the rhetoric that has been heard of late, nothing prevents companies from providing notices and disclosures to consumers electronically, so long as they also provide paper notices and disclosures in the limited set of circumstances in which a law so requires. Requirements that certain information be provided in a particular format, or by a particular method of delivery, are often adopted to serve consumers' interests by providing them with information critical to making informed choices in the marketplace, understanding their rights and obligations during commercial transactions, and enforcing their rights when transactions go sour. Such laws should not be swept away without adequate assurance that consumers will be able to receive and retain the information electronically.  The AARP made this point in a letter to all Senators dated November 15, 1999, with respect to the more sweepingly preemptive H.R. 1714: ``The time to investigate the implications of such a pivotal change in established consumer protections . . . is before, not after, legislation is enacted. Measures to take advantage of electronic market efficiencies must be tempered by a concern for legal and technological responsibilities that are being shifted to the consumer.''  The benefits of electronic commerce should not, and need not, come at the expense of increased risk to consumers. I commend the Department of Commerce for its help in crafting a substitute amendment that is more carefully tailored to protect the interests of America's consumers. I also thank Senators Sarbanes, who shared many of my concerns about the original bill's impact on consumers, and Senators Abraham and Wyden, for agreeing to address our concerns.  This bill shows what can be achieved by bipartisan cooperation and compromise. It enjoys broad support from the Administration, the states, consumer representatives, and responsible companies and trade associations that care about their customers. I urge its speedy enactment into law.  I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record a Statement of Administration Policy dated November 8, 1999, in support of the Abraham-Leahy substitute amendment; a letter dated November 8, 1999, from the National Automobile Dealers Association, and a letter dated November 5, 1999, from the National Conference of State Legislatures.     Statement of Administration Policy, November 8, 1999 (Senate)    (This statement has been coordinated by OMB with the concerned                                agencies.) S. 761--Millennium Digital Commerce Act (Abraham (R) Michigan and 11                               cosponsors)       Electronic commerce can provide consumers and businesses      with significant benefits in terms of costs, choice, and      convenience. The Administration strongly supports the      development of this marketplace and supports legislation that      will advance that development, while providing appropriate      consumer protection. Many businesses and     consumers are still wary of conducting extensive business      over the Internet because of the lack of a predictable legal      environment governing transactions. Both the Congress and the      Administration have been working to address this important      potential impediment to commerce.       S. 761 addresses important concerns associated with      electronic commerce and the rise of the Internet as a      worldwide commercial forum and marketplace. The      Administration supports Senate passage of the amendment in      the nature of a substitute to S. 761 expected to be offered      by Senator Abraham, based on an agreement with Senators Leahy      and Wyden. The Administration supports this version of S. 761      because the bill, as proposed to be amended, would: Ensure      the legal validity of contracts between private parties that      are made and signed electronically; preserve the ability of      States to establish safeguards, such as consumer protection      laws, to promote the public interest in electronic commerce      among private parties just as they can now establish      safeguards for paper-based commerce; cover only commercial      transactions between private parties that affect interstate      commerce; not affect Federal laws or regulations, but instead      would give Federal agencies six months to conduct a careful      study of barriers to electronic transactions under Federal      laws or regulations and to develop plans to remove such      barriers, where appropriate; and sunset completely as to the      law of any State that enacts the Uniform Electronic      Transactions Act.                                  ____         National Automobile Dealers Association, Office of            Legislative Affairs,                                 Washington, DC, November 8, 1999.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen Senate          Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: On behalf of the National Automobile      Dealers Association (NADA), I am writing to express our views      on S. 761, the Millennium Digital Commerce Act.       Like many entrepreneurs throughout the country, America's      new car and truck dealers are using today's technological      advances to better serve customers, and at NADA we understand      the desire to accelerate the role of electronic commerce.      Even so, we share your desire to preserve the state's role in      this process.       The automobile is one of the single biggest purchases that      a consumer makes. As a result, state legislatures throughout      the country have enacted various requirements and disclosures      governing the purchase and sale of motor vehicles. In light      of this extensive body of existing state law, an overly      preemptive federal statute would deny the states the ability      to protect their citizens in the manner they deem appropriate      in these types of transactions.       NADA does not oppose a temporary federal rule to ensure      that contracts can not be invalidated solely because they are      in electronic form or because they are signed electronically.      We believe, however, that any federal legislation should only      be an interim measure to provide stability while the states      consider the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA). Once      a state adopts the UETA, the temporary federal rule should      sunset.       We understand that some drafts of the legislation that have      been put forward would allow the federal rule to preempt the      UETA in effect in a state, thus denying the states the      opportunity to be more protective of consumers should they so      desire. If that provision is retained, we believe that motor      vehicle transactions should not be covered by the federal      rule. This exception would be necessary to ensure that the      states could still perform their traditional role of      establishing the legal framework for major purchases.       We appreciate the opportunity to bring our concerns to your      attention, and we appreciate all your efforts in addressing      these matters before the legislation moves forward in the      Senate.           Sincerely,                                                 H. Thomas Greene,     Chief Operating Officer, Legislative Affairs.                                  ____                                            national Conference of                                           State Legislatures,                                 Washington, DC, November 5, 1999.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy     Russell Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: The National Conference of State      Legislatures understands the need to revise federal and state      laws as a means of encouraging electronic commerce. In      particular, NCSL understands that legislation is needed to      allow the more widespread use of electronic signatures as a      means of encouraging such commerce.       Over 40 state legislatures have addressed various state law      issues related to the validity of electronic signatures.      Nevertheless, NCSL has in principle no objection to federal      legislation on this same topic, provided that it is tightly      focused on removing barriers to legitimate electronic      commerce and does not broadly preempt essential elements of      state consumer protection and contract law.       NCSL believes that federal legislation related to      electronic signatures must meet four criteria: (1) Any      preemption of state law and authority must be limited in      duration. The idea should be to ensure the validity of most      electronic signatures for a period of time, thus giving the      states time to act. (2) States must be allowed to adopt the      Uniform Electronic Transactions Act or some similar      legislation. (3) Essential state consumer protections must be      preserved, along with the capacity of states to enact      consumer protection measures in the future. (4) Any federal      legislation must be limited to the topic of electronic      signatures. It must not embrace any preemption of state      regulatory and record keeping authority.       The version of S. 761 that is now being presented comes      closer to meeting NCSL's criteria than earlier versions of      the bill. In general, this ``compromise'' version is taking      the right approach to the issue. NCSL looks forward to      working with the sponsors and others to resolve any remaining      issues of preemption and consumer protection. NCSL much      prefers the new compromise to other earlier versions of      electronic signatures legislation which we vigorously opposed      because of its unnecessary preemption of state consumer      protection and contract law.       For additional information about NCSL's position, please      call Neal Osten (202-624-8660) or Michael Bird (202-624-     8686).           Sincerely,         Joanne G. Emmons, Michigan State Senate, Chair, NCSL            Commerce and Communications Committee.
