 We will make that response within the next hour.  S. 1215, which is now the pending business in the Senate, has 56 cosponsors. I particularly want to thank Senator Feinstein, who will be speaking on this measure, and Senator McCain, who have had a particular interest in this subject for quite some time.  Until yesterday, Aung San Suu Kyi and other democracy activists have been held incommunicado by the repressive State Peace and Development Council, SPDC, following an ambush on her convoy several hundred kilometers north of Rangoon. Scores are feared murdered and injured in this blatant assault on democracy in Burma.  In the 11th hour of his trip to Rangoon, the SPDC finally allowed U.N. Special Envoy Razali Ismail a 15-minute meeting with Suu Kyi. We are all relieved that his initial statements indicate that she is alive and unharmed, but the fate of other activists arrested remains unknown.  But simply seeing is not freeing. Razali's meeting with Suu Kyi was not a private one and she remains under the total control of SPDC thugs. Her continued silence in the wake of this bloodshed could not be more deafening, nor--despite Razali's brief visit--her predicament more pressing.  Horrific details of the attack continue to emerge and heighten the need for a swift and decisive response to the SPDC's brutality.  According to Monday's front-page article in the Washington Post, in the ``pitch dark amid the rice paddies'' thugs posing as Buddhist monks stopped Suu Kyi's car. Soon after, a crowd ``set upon her convey, attacking the entourage with wooden clubs and bamboo spikes. . . . Several hundred more assailants ambushed the motorcade from the rear.''  This is no simple act of harassment or intimidation. It was an act of terrorism against innocent civilians who simply believe in democracy and the rule of law in Burma.  The free world and free press have been quick to condemn the SPDC. But strong words from foreign capitals must be matched by stronger actions.  Last week, I introduced the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003, along with Senators Feinstein and McCain. As I indicated earlier, we now have 56 cosponsors. I ask unanimous consent that the list be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                           S. 1215 cosponsors       Akaka, Alexander, Allard, Allen, Baucus, Bennett, Biden,      Bingaman, Boxer, Breaux, Brownback, Bunning, Burns,      Chambliss, Clinton, Coleman, Collins, Corzine, Daschle,      Dayton, Dole, Domenici, Dorgan, Durbin, Edwards, Feingold,      Feinstein, Frist, and Grassley.

Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, this bill, among other sanctions, imposes a ban on imports from Burma.  I am pleased that many of my colleagues--including the majority and minority leaders of the Senate and the chairmen and ranking members of the Senate Foreign Relations and Finance Committees--are cosponsors of this important legislation.  Let me share with my colleagues some of the feedback we have gotten from around the country on the act:  An editorial in today's Los Angeles Times stated:       [Burma's] trading partners, other countries in the region      and aid givers like Japan need to get tougher by imposing      sanctions and aid suspensions to push the country toward      democracy; that's the outcome Myanmar's citizens show they      favor every time they get the chance.  By the way, they haven't gotten a chance since 1990.  A Washington Post editorial yesterday advised that because Burmese dictators ``control the nation' economy, an import ban would affect those most responsible for Burma's repression, and senators supportive of democracy in Asia should vote for the bill without conditions or expiration dates.''  Deputy Secretary of State Rich Armitage recently wrote:     . . . we support the goal and intent of this legislation and      agree on the need for many similar measures. . . . We are      also considering an import ban, as proposed in your      legislation.  A June 6 editorial in the Washington Post suggested that:       While the [Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act] moves through      Congress, Mr. Bush could implement many of its provisions by      executive order. He could find no better way to demonstrate      his commitment to democracy and his revulsion at a brutal      dictatorship.  A New York Times editorial endorsed the import ban and recommended that:       Europe . . . should now block Myanmar's exports as well.      The junta has had a year to demonstrate that its opening was      genuine. Now all ambiguity is gone, and the world's response      must be equally decisive.  A Boston Globe editorial stated that President Bush:     . . . could and should issue an executive order that would      swiftly accomplish [an import ban]. This is not a partisan      matter. The great lesson that ought to have been learned in      the last century is that free democrats betray their unfree      brothers and sisters when they seek to appease dictatorships.  Dallas Morning News editor at large Rena Pederson, who also penned a superb article on this topic in the Weekly Standard, wrote in an op-ed:       The strongest possible pressure must be turned on the      Burmese generals, who apparently calculated their opposition      could be decapitated while the world was preoccupied with      events in the Middle East. They shouldn't be allowed to get      away with such a cowardly fast one. The Bush administration      should support tougher sanctions now. Senator Mitch      McConnell, R-KY., is pushing for increased sanctions.  That is the bill we have before us.  ``He will need help . . .''  And we obviously are going to have help with 56 cosponsors, and I hope a very overwhelming vote shortly.  ``He will need help, or the Bush administration could accomplish the same thing by executive order.''  A Baltimore Sun editorial rightly concluded: ``. . . this regime ought to be treated somewhat like North Korea, from which imports have long been barred.''  Finally, in endorsing the act, the American Apparel and Footwear Association called upon ``the rest of Congress for the swift and immediate passage of such import legislation.''  The idea of a ban on imports from Burma is not a new one to this body. In he 107th Congress, S. 926 sought to impose such restrictions and was cosponsored by 21 Senators. I would offer that the need for an important ban has only become more urgent in the wake of the May 30 attack on democracy in Burma.  Supporters of a free Burma want America to take the lead in defending democracy in that country.  Supporters of a free Burma believe that serving the cause of freedom is America's challenge and obligation. We should not abandon the people of Burma during the greatest moments of need. The people of Burma have made their aspirations known, and the regime has not silenced them into submission. They have not stilled their hearts for political change and they will not succeed in stemming our collective resolve.  Supporters of a free Burma agree with President Bush that:       Men and women in every culture need liberty like they need      food and water and air. Everywhere that freedom arrives,      humanity rejoices: and everywhere that freedom stirs, let      tyrants fear.  It's time for tyrants to fear in Burma.  I ask unanimous consent that the following items be printed in the Record: a Washington Post article dated June 9; a letter from Under Secretary of State Rich Armitage; editorials from the Los Angeles Times, and the Baltimore Sun, and a Rena Pederson article in the Weekly Standard.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Washington Post, June 9, 2003]          Attack on Burmese Activist Seen as Work of Military                 (By Alan Sipress and Ellen Nakashima)       Bangkok, June 8.--Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu      Kyi's motorcade was rattling along a pocked one-lane road      near Mandalay in Northern Burma after the sunset when a pair      of men, disguised in the burnt orange robes of Buddhist      monks, motioned for it to stop. They asked her to alight and      make an impromptu speech to at least 100 people gathered at a      narrow bridge over a creek and blocking her way, according to      Burmese exiles who spoke with witnesses. But she was running      late. It was already pitch dark amid the rice paddies.       When one of her bodyguards, a young unarmed man, got out of      the four-wheel-drive vehicle to convey Suu Kyi's regrets, the      crowd set upon her convoy, attacking the entourage with      wooden clubs and bamboo spikes, according to the exiles and      diplomats who also have spoken to witnesses. Several hundred      more assailants ambushed the motorcade from the rear.       By the time the battle was over late in the evening of May      30, at least four of Suu Kyi's bodyguards were dead. Burmese      exiles and diplomats said scores of her supporters were also      probably killed. And Suu Kyi, the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize      laureate, suffered head and shoulder injuries, they said,      when her car windows were shattered and she was detained by      Burmese soldiers along with at least 17 supporters.       U.S. and other diplomats have concluded that the attack was      an ambush orchestrated by Burma's military rulers and carried      out by a pro-government militia reinforced by specially      trained prison inmates.       Suu Kyi, 57, has remained in custody, incommunicado and out      of public sight ever since, prompting protests from the      United Nations, the United States other governments.       The attack was not only a stunning bid to intimidate Suu      Kyi and deflate a pro-democracy movement that over recent      months had been attracting larger and larger crowds despite      mounting governmental harassment, according to exiles and      diplomats in Rangoon and Bangkok. It was also an effort by      Burma's top leader, Gen. Than Shwe, who had been      consolidating control in recent months, to make clear he had      lost patience with those in the military advocating dialogue      with Suu Kyi.       ``This was a brutal power play to show them who is in      charge here,'' a European diplomat said. ``This was a message      from Than Shwe to the softies in the military that you [had]      better watch out. You are not to tolerate Aung San Suu Kyi.''       Although supporters of political reform have despaired of      progress for months, the attack outside Mandalay--the      bloodiest confrontation since Burma crushed a pro-democracy      uprising in 1988--could mark the end to the spring of hope      that began almost exactly one year ago.       Under intense international pressure, the Burmese      government had released Suu Kyi from house arrest in May      2002. Some high-ranking military officers had calculated that      Suu Kyi's popularity had faded during her detention and that      she no longer posed the same threat as she had in 1990 when      her party, the National League for Democracy, won a landslide      election victory, Burmese and other analysts said. Those      results were voided by the military, plunging Burma into its      current political crisis and a decade of international      isolation.       The Burmese government, however, discovered that Suu Kyi      still attracted jubilant crowds when she traveled the country      reopening nearly 200 local offices for her party. Tens of      thousands turned out to chant her name. Many supporters      walked miles to see her. Increasingly, her rallies drew      Buddhist monks, who command great respect in Burmese society,      further alarming the military.       ``They are worried that despite all the threats they can      employ against the pro-democracy movement, people are      continuing to go out and see Aung San Suu Kyi,'' said Win      Min, a Burmese researcher who studies civilian-military      relations.       Suu Kyi, who has always preached reconciliation, was also      becoming openly critical of the government's unwillingness to      engage in meaningful dialogue for a political settlement. The      optimism that accompanied her release from house arrest had      long dissipated.       These developments were an affront to Than Shwe, the      junta's leader, who so loathes Suu Kyi that, as one European      diplomat said, he ``hates even to hear her name mentioned.''       Than Shwe, 70, chairman of the ruling State Peace and      Development Council and armed forces commander, has moved      since last year to strengthen his grip on power. He has      beefed up the United Solidarity and Development Association,      the pro-government militia that witnesses said attacked Suu      Kyi's motorcade. He has manipulated the military, government      and courts to weaken his leading rivals while placing his      loyalists in influential post, said diplomats and Burmese      exiles.       ``Than Shwe has been taking his time,'' said Zin Linn of      the opposition National Coalition Government of the Union of      Burma. ``He has purged many of the senior military men who      are soft-liners and are in some way impressed with Aung San      Suu Kyi'' and Tin Oo, the vice chairman of her party.       Most notably, Than Shwe's ascent has come at the expense of      Gen. Khin Nyunt, 64, the head of military intelligence and a      leading advocate of dialogue with Suu Kyi. His patron, former      dictator Gen. Ne Win, died in December. While Khin Nyunt      remains the third-highest-ranking official in the junta, his      authority in running military intelligence has been limited      and he has told diplomats that he no longer has a mandate to      pursue the reconciliation talks, which had been medicated by      U.N. special envoy Razali Ismail.       The dispute pits so-called pragmatists, such as Khin Nyunt,      who believe Burma can string out the talks with Suu Kyi while      placating foreign governments, against officers urging that      the pro-democracy movement be crushed. But diplomats and      analysts stress that the military is united in its      determination to retain power.       Suu Kyi's recent month-long swing through northern Burma      offered an opportunity for Than Shwe to deliver a resounding      message to the pragmatists that their moment had passed,      diplomats and exiles said.       As expedition to the northernmost state of Kachin, which      began May 6, was her seventh road trip since her release. It      was meant in part to bolster the morale of loyalists in her      party, who were disappointed that the reconciliation talks      had ground to a halt, said Debbie Stothard, coordinator of      ALTSEAN-Burma, a human rights group in Southeast Asia.       The trips, especially this last, had provoked growing      harassment by the government, which has staged protests by      machete-wielding activists, blasted music to drown out Suu      Kyi's speeches and blocked her way with logs and barbed wire.      At least once, a firetruck turned its hoses on her      supporters.       If the military wanted to escalate the confrontation,      Sagaing Division northwest of Mandalay was a good place,      Burmese exiles and diplomats said. This impoverished region      is the stronghold of Lt. Gen. Soe Win, a Sagaing native and      former military commander in the area. He was promoted by      Than Shwe in February to the junta's fourth-highest position.      Soe Win is also a leading activist in the militia and had      toured several towns earlier this year demanding that      dialogue with Suu Kyi be halted.       Diplomats and exiles said they have received reports that      Soe Win was at a military headquarters in nearby Monywa      either during or shortly before the ambush against Suu Kyi's      motorcade. Exiles said they believe he ran the operation.       Military officials knew Suu Kyi was coming. She had been      required to give them her itinerary.       ``Clearly, orders were given for a violent attack,'' a U.S.      Embassy official in Rangoon said.       The following account of the May 30 attack was provided by      that official based on the findings of a two-person U.S.      Embassy team dispatched to Sagaing Division late last week to      investigate the incident. Much of the story has been      corroborated by information from witnesses provided to other      diplomats and exiles.       As Suu Kyi's motorcade traveled north toward the town of      Dipeyin about two miles from Monywa, it was met by 100 to 200      people at the bridge. Most of them were disguised as monks      but shed the costumes when the fighting erupted. About 400      other convicts and militia recruits disguised as monks with      shaved heads, and wearing white armbands, blocked the      motorcade from behind.       Though Suu Kyi's supporters tried to assuage the mob, the      assailants began beating them and smashing the vehicles'      windows. Trying to stave off the attack and shelter Suu Kyi,      members of her party stood on the road and locked arms.       At the site, the investigating team found bloodied clothes,      clubs and spears, broken glass and debris from damaged      vehicles.       ``It was pretty clear that a big fight had taken place,''      the embassy official said.       The team's findings contradict the brief version provided      by the government--that the confrontation lasted two hours      and was provoked by Suu Kyi's party. The government said four      people were killed and 50 others injured.       The U.S. team reported that gunfire was heard in the middle      of the night when the army arrived to clean up the site.      According to other accounts, gunshots rang out during or      shortly after the clash.       Reports reaching other diplomats and exile groups said Suu      Kyi's driver, trying to remove the democracy activist from      the melee, gunned the engine as the crowd pounded the car      with rocks and other objects. She was detained by security      forces farther down the road in Dipeyin.       Tin Oo, 75, the vice chairman of Suu Kyi's party, was      assaulted when he left his car, according to Burmese exiles,      who have expressed concern about his condition and      whereabouts.       Following the attack, the military closed most of the      party's offices across Burma, arrested other democracy      activists and criticized Suu Kyi's movement in the press.      Some suggest that these steps were part of a planned,      concerted crackdown, not just a hurried attempt to prevent      Suu Kyi's supporters from protesting the attack and arrests.      They noted that in the weeks before the incident, 10      activists from the opposition party were arrested and      sentenced to prison terms of two to 28 years.       Since the attack, more than 100 party activists have been      arrested and at least a dozen imprisoned, said Stothard,      coordinator of the human rights group.       Those killed trying to protect Suu Kyi, or ``The Lady,'' as      she is popularly known, reportedly included Toe Lwin, 32, a      rising star in the party's youth division who held a      philosophy degree and was studying English in Rangoon, a      Western diplomat said. He was in Suu Kyi's vehicle, wearing      his orange opposition party jacket with its red badge      emblazoned with a gold fighting peacock. Suu Kyi treated      these supporters as ``surrogate sons,'' and saw in them a      future generation of political leaders, Stothard said.       Suu Kyi is being held at Yemon military camp, about 25      miles outside Rangoon, without access to her doctor, party      members or Western envoys, concerned diplomats said.       ``If they lift her incommunicado status, she will speak,''      a European diplomat said. ``She will speak the truth and this      will be damaging for them.''                                  ____                                    Deputy Secretary of State,                                          Washington June 6, 2003.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Chairman, Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, Committee on          Appropriations, U.S. Senate.       Dear Mr. Chairman: We are outraged by the May 30 attack on      Aung San Suu Kyi and her convoy. The deteriorating conditions      in Burma are of grave concern to the Administration and we      appreciate your leadership in advancing legislation to      respond to these events.       The Department of State also appreciates the opportunity to      review and comment on the ``Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act      of 2003 (S. 1182),'' which you introduced on June 4, 2003. We      fully support the goal and intent of this legislation and      agree on the need for many similar measures. For example, we      are working on a unilateral expansion of the visa ban,      extending it to all officials of the Union Solidarity      Development Association (part of the SPDC) and their      immediate families, rather than just to senior officials, as      is current practice. We will also be adding managers of the      state-run enterprises and their families to the list.       We agree on the need to prevent IFI funds going to the      junta. We will continue to use our voice and vote in those      institutions to oppose loans that benefit the military      regime. We also agree on the need to express strong support      for the NLD, and are doing so in every international forum in      which the United States participates, including at the UN.      Also significant are the findings of the annual Country      Report on Human Rights Practices, Trafficking in Persons      Report and Report on International Religious Freedom, which      identify and strongly condemn known SPDC abuses. The      President's Annual Report on Major Drug Transit or Major      Illicit Drug Producing Countries has also identified Burma as      a country that demonstrably has failed to meet its      international obligations regarding narcotics.       In addition to the above efforts, which are already      underway, we are determined to pursue additional measures      against the regime, including an asset freeze, a possible ban      on remittances and, with appropriate legislation, a ban on      travel to Burma. We hope to move forward with these measures      expeditiously and with the support of the Congress. We are      also considering an import ban, as proposed in your      legislation. We support the intent behind the ban but are      reviewing the proposal in light of our international      obligations, including our WTO commitments.       Again, thank you for your leadership on this issue and your      commitment to the cause of freedom. We look forward to      working with you on the bill.           Sincerely,     Richard L. Armitage.                                  ____              [From the Los Angeles Times, June 11, 2003]                         Freeze Myanmar Assets       The military thugs running Myanmar finally may have opened      their eyes to the esteem in which Aung San Suu Kyi is held      outside their nation. They already knew how much their      oppressed citizens thought of the woman who should be leading      the nation formerly known as Burma: The huge numbers greeting      her on her journeys around her country provided graphic      evidence of her popularity.       Harboring despots' fears of ouster by a charismatic pro-     democracy leader, the army rulers arrested Suu Kyi, again,      after a deadly attack on her motorcade May 30. However, they      let United Nations representative Razali Ismail meet with the      democracy activist Tuesday after stalling for days.       Delay is not new for Razali, who has sought for two years      to push the nation's autocrats toward democracy. He deserves      credit for insisting on a meeting with Suu Kyi, so does his      boss, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who denounces the      generals.       In 1947 a political rival assassinated Suu Kyi's father, an      architect of the independence movement. Forty years later,      his daughter began campaigning against the military regimes      that ruled the country for much of its post-independence      history. In 1990, she and her party won a parliamentary      election but the military scrapped those results and kept her      under house arrest. It also refused to let her leave to      receive her 1991 Nobel Peace Prize or to be with her husband      as he lay dying in England.       But a year ago, the junta let Suu Kyi travel again. Seeing      her popularity undimmed, the government organized the May 30      ambush of her motorcade and cited the violence as cause for      her arrest. She was held incommunicado until Razali met her.      Nearby nations like Thailand and Malaysia feebly protested      the assault and arrest.       The U.S. Congress is considering tougher measures to freeze      the assets of the Myanmar government held in the United      States and to bar the country's leaders from traveling here.       Those steps are warranted unless Suu Kyi is released and      allowed to travel freely. The United States and other      countries earlier imposed economic sanctions on Myanmar that      devastated its economy. Trade with Thailand and China, plus      the export of narcotics, has kept it afloat.       The trading partners, other countries in the region and aid      givers like Japan need to get tougher by imposing sanctions      and aid suspensions to push the country toward democracy;      that's the outcome Myanmar's citizens show they favor every      time they get the chance.                                  ____                 [From the Baltimore Sun, June 6, 2003]                           Squeeze the Junta       A top United Nations envoy was to arrive today in Myanmar,      formerly known as     Burma, and not a moment too soon: Human rights and democracy      once again are under siege by the narco-state's ruling      military party.       The United Nations is demanding that Yangon's generals      release 1991 Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi,      arrested Saturday after a violent attack on her pro-democracy      party by security forces.       The violence, in which activists allege scores were killed,      and the subsequent closing of Myanmar's universities and all      of the offices of Ms. Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy      mark a sudden darkening of the new dawn proclaimed last May      when the military regime last released her from house arrest,      promising dialogue with the NLD aimed at national      reconciliation.       The renewed repression begs for stronger economic sanctions      by the United States to squeeze this illegal junta.       This is a regime that competes with North Korea on human-     rights abuses--including long quashing the NLD, a legally      elected opposition party. As U.N. Secretary General Kofi      Annan recently put it, the political aspirations of the      Burmese people ``are overwhelming in favor of change.''       In 1990, Ms. Suu Kyi's party crushed the military's      candidates in Myanmar's last legal parliamentary election;      since then, she has spent much of the time under house      arrest. In response, the United States barred new American      investments in Myanmar in 1997. But that didn't end the      involvement of Unocal Corp., the California energy giant, in      a 1995 deal with the junta to extract natural gas off the      Burmese coast and transport it via a 250-mile pipelines--a      project allegedly built with forced labor and accompanied by      military murders and rapes.       As a result, Unocal faces a groundbreaking federal lawsuit      brought by international activists for 15 unnamed Burmese      villagers under a 1789 U.S. statute allowing lawsuits against      U.S. multinational corporations, holding them abroad to the      same standards as at home. The outcome could be far-reaching;      the Bush administration has weighed in on Unocal's side,      arguing that such human-rights cases interfere with U.S.      foreign policy and the war on terrorism.       This is precisely the wrong stance. Instead, the U.S.      government ought to be moving quickly toward tightening the      screws on Myanmar's generals and anyone keeping them afloat      financially.       Trade sanctions against Myanmar were proposed last year but      dropped when Ms. Suu Kyi was last released. This week, House      and Senate bills were entered that call for an import ban and      other sanctions, all of which seem fully warranted. Already,      a leading U.S. apparel and footwear trade group and many      large retailers--from Wal-Mart to Saks--are boycotting      Burmese goods.       In other words, this regime ought to be treated somewhat      like North Korea, from which imports have long been barred.      Granted, Myanmar doesn't pose North Korea's nuclear threat,      but it plays such a major role in the world's heroin trade      that it's a destabilizing force internationally.       Ms. Suu Kyi is again detained and her party remains under      attack because Myanmar's generals figure they can get away      with it. The United States must send a stronger message that      that's no longer an option.                                  ____      Burma's Junta ``Disappears'' the Country's Leading Democract                           (By Rena Pederson)       In the Trademark manner of thugocracies, Burma's military      government, seeking to silence its critics, sent a mob to      attack the motorcade of longtime democracy activist Aung San      Suu Kyi on the night of Friday, May 30, as she traveled to a      speaking engagement in the north of the country. The Nobel      Peace Prize winner was assaulted and taken to an undisclosed      location.       The government would say only that she had been placed in      ``protective custody'' and that she had not been injured. But      reports persisted that Suu Kyi had suffered a severe blow to      the head and possibly a broken arm. Inside Burma, it was said      that hundreds of her supporters had been murdered;      international news agencies reported at least 70 killed and      50 injured. At least 18 people were believed detained.       ``The problem with getting an accurate story about what      happened is that everyone who could speak the truth in Burma      is under arrest,'' said one democracy advocate in Washington.      The government controls the only two newspapers and TV      stations, and the leading journalist is in prison. One in      four citizens reportedly spies for the government, so      everyone is guarded about what is said in public.       Nevertheless, clandestine sources inside Burma that have      proved reliable in the past report that hundreds of armed men      attacked the motorcade, some disguised as Buddhist monks.      Some were convicts released at the government's behest. They      beat Suu Kyi's supporters with bamboo clubs three feet long      and riddled her car with bullets. The window was shattered,      and either a rock or a brick was thrown at Suu Kyi's head      while she was seated in the car. Several students reportedly      tried to shield her with their bodies, but they were beaten      severely, and she was dragged away bleeding. According to      this account, she was taken to a military hospital for      stitches and then transferred to Yemon military camp about 25      miles from Rangoon.       Plainly, Suu Kyi, who is 57 and weighs about 100 pounds,      faces long odds--though not for the first time. Since 1988,      she has been standing up to one of the most brutal regimes in      the world. In the process, she has become the photogenic      symbol of democracy in Asia. In 1990, her party, the National      League for Democracy, won 80 percent of the vote in elections      the junta mistakenly had though they could control. Instead      of seating the winners in parliament, the generals threw many      NLD leaders in jail and placed Suu Kyi under house arrest,      where she remained for most of the ensuing 13 years.       In this country, few people know her name, much less how to      pronounce it (awn sawn soo chee). But her story has the sweep      and drama of ``Gone With The Wind.'' Her father, General Aung      San, was a leader of the democracy movement in Burma after      World War II and was expected to become the first president      after Great Britain relinquished control. He was assassinated      when his daughter was only 2. His wife, a wartime nurse, went      on to become ambassador to India.       Suu Kyi was educated at Oxford and married a fellow      student, who became a professor of Tibetan studies. She lived      quietly in England as a wife and mother of two boys until her      own mother suffered a stroke in 1988, and she returned to      Burma to care for her. In riots that year, soldiers shot and      killed more student demonstrators than would die in 1989 at      Tiananmen Square. Suu Kyi was entreated to stay and help lead      the democracy effort, which she did, at great personal      sacrifice. She has seen her sons only sporadically since. And      four years ago, as her husband was dying of cancer, the junta      refused to grant him a visa to visit her.       The international response to her rearrest has been near      unanimous condemnation. In the midst of peace negotiations in      the Middle East, President Bush expressed his deep concern      and called for the immediate release of Suu Kyi and her      supporters, as did United Nations Secretary General Kofi      Annan. The most tepid responses came from Burma's Southeast      Asian neighbors, who have their own concerns about      stability. They asked for an explanation of Suu Kyi's      detention, but would not demand her release. Japan, the      leading investor in Burma, said the situation was not      ``good'' and dialogue was needed for a democratic      solution.       It will be up to the United States to increase pressure on      the Burmese generals, who apparently thought they could      decapitate their opposition while the world was concentrating      on the Middle East. The Bush administration must back up its      words with actions. On Capitol Hill, Sen. Mitch McConnell, a      Kentucky Republican, and Rep. Tom Lantos, a Democrat from      California, moved to toughen existing sanctions on Thursday.      They will need help. As the Boston Globe pointed out,      President Bush could issue an executive order that would      accomplish the same thing.       The world hardly needs another crisis at this moment, but      the situation in Burma could be destabilizing. Burma has been      seeking aid from China, its neighbor to the north, which      wouldn't mind having Burma as a vassal state providing port      access to the Indian Ocean. That prospect has alarmed India,      its neighbor to the west. At the same time, Thailand, to the      east, is overwhelmed by the thousands of refugees pouring      across the border each day to escape the rapacious Burmese      military.       Further complicating the picture, Burma is one of the      world's largest producers of heroin and amphetamines. Drug      dealers are often seen playing golf with high-ranking      generals and hold high positions in major banks. And, oh yes,      Burma has one of the fastest-growing AIDS rates in the world-     and one of the worst health systems.       When I spoke with Aung San Suu Kyi in February, she      expressed frustration that the junta had not opened a      dialogue with her party after her release from house arrest      in May 2002. ``The government promised that it would begin      discussions about the transition to democracy,'' she said.      ``They have not. They promised they would release all      political prisoners. They have not.'' And they promised to      allow the publication of independent newspapers. She asked      with a wry smile, ``You haven't seen one, have you?''       This spring she began speaking out more forcefully. When      she ventured into the northern states two weeks ago,      thousands of supporters risked their lives to greet the woman      they call ``the Lady.'' Government harassment then increased.      On May 24, 10 NLD members were jailed. On May 29, the day      before the ambush, clashes broke out between government      supporters armed with machetes and NLD backers, leaving      several dead.       Even if Aung San Suu Kyi eventually emerges unharmed, the      movement for free elections has been set back by the violent      turn of events. The main office of the National League for      Democracy, in Rangoon, has been closed, padlocked, and placed      under guard, and other party offices have been shuttered.      Universities, too, have been shut to prevent student      protests.       ``The Lady'' is in greater jeopardy than ever before. It      remains to be seen what the long-repressed Burmese people and      the much-distracted international community will do about it.  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I note that Senator Feinstein is here. I yield the floor and retain the remainder of my time.
