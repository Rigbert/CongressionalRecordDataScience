 Chairman, I yield myself the balance of the time.  Mr. Chairman, let me just conclude by thanking the chairman for this interesting debate. This amendment is endorsed by progressitives, conservatives, and many people in between, by the United Steelworkers, by Unite, some of the great unions in this country, by the National Taxpayers Union, by the Competitive Enterprise Institute.  I would ask for the support of all Members for this amendment.
