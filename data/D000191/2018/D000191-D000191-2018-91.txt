Chair, look around the country. There are many Statesthat have not adopted a minimum wage that exceeds the Federal minimum wage of $7.50 an hour. That is pretty pathetic.  My State is one of many that has chosen to far exceed that minimum wage, but if we do away with--this says that federally funded contracts must receive the local prevailing wage for their work. In Oregon, we have recognized that with a higher minimum wage, so our prevailing wages are going to be higher than some State that only follows the Federal minimum wage of $7.50 an hour.                              {time}  1515  So what might some contractor do? Oh, I can go over here and hire people who are used to earning $7.50 an hour. I am going to import them into Oregon. Of course, you are going to still have a problem with our minimum wage law, but this is what this is about is to find less expensive labor and move it around the country, and that, I believe, is a disservice to the working people of the United States.  I would urge Congress, as it has done every other time this amendment has been offered, to reject it on a broad bipartisan basis.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
