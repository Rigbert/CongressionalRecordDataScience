Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding me this time.  In response to the previous gentleman's remark, I would suggest that the bottom line is jobs. This rule is about jobs; and as far as I am concerned, it represents bad policy for America, it represents bad policy for people in this country who still make a living wage, and it is very bad and horrific policy for all of the people who are going to lose their jobs because of the attempt to give any administration this type of trade authority.  One of the fatal flaws is not allowing us consideration of provisions that might undermine and weaken our trade remedy laws that are on the books today. That includes industries in the United States that used to make and may still make some pencils, may grow garlic, may make cement clinkers, may produce petroleum wax candles. There are 265 industries and growers who have sought relief for these important protections.  This is about jobs. It is about the 210 people who have no work at Calumet Steel in Chicago Heights, Illinois, because of illegal trade that takes place.
