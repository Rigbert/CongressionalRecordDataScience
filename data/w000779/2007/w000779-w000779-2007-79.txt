President, I don't want to turn this into a bouquet-tossing contest, but I do want to single out the bipartisan quartet: Chairman Baucus, Senator Rockefeller, who is here, Senator Grassley, and Senator Hatch. To carve out hours and hours, as the four of them have day after day, is evidence of their commitment. I just want them to know I am very much aware we would not be here today advocating for America's kids without their work and their effort to find common ground. I wish to start the day by praising the four of them.
