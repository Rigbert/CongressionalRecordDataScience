 REID. I will in just one second. So we have basically been withoutquorum calls. And we still have, as the Senator from South Dakota, the Democratic leader, mentioned, about 30 amendments we have to dispose of.  As the leader said, some of these will fall as a result of the vote on the Bayh-Ensign amendment. But that still leaves at least 15 or 20 amendments we have to dispose of, and that doesn't count those at the desk. Just basic numbers indicate we have a lot of work to do.  I would also say that for my friend, the distinguished majority whip, to indicate we haven't been doing anything during the day--we have.
