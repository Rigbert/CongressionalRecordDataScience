We did not offset it on the theory that this was an emergency that occurred that was unplanned for and that we would, in fact, obviously pay for it, but pay for it in subsequent years.  It's my understanding that the offset that is being considered is $1.5 billion from the Advanced Technology Vehicle fund. The problem with that, as I see it, is we are talking about creating jobs, and the President has presented a jobs bill. I'll talk about that in just a minute. But the fund that is in question to date has created 39,000 jobs, and the loan applications in progress are projected to create 50,000 or 60,000 additional jobs.  Therefore, if we use this as an offset, which would set a precedent, although I understand that precedent's not being followed for 2012, what we are doing, in my view, Mr. Leader, is undermining a specific item in the current scheme of things that is, in fact, creating jobs, as I said, 39,000 jobs, with the loan applications that are in progress now expected to create an additional 50,000 to 60,000 jobs, that we undermine that effort.  Frankly, on our side, we would hope that we could return to what is precedent, and that is, in an emergency, respond with emergency funding as we did throughout the Bush administration, not with the concept that we wouldn't pay for it. You and I both agree that paying for this is critically important, and in fact, I think you and I are both of the opinion that, hopefully, the committee of 12 is set up to look at how we get our finances back in line with our revenues and expenditures, that that needs to be done.  But certainly, this is a new precedent. And, unfortunately, it appears that you have targeted--I don't mean you, personally, but the CR would target a particular item that is exactly what we want to do, and that is creating jobs.  Would the gentleman like to comment on that?  I yield to my friend.
