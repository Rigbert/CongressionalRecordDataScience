In light of the reports earlier this week that President Obama's health reform plan is estimated to cost more than $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years, it is better not to overpromise and undermine cost containment. It is important that the Congress find an appropriate benefit standard that will ensure quality coverage for all Americans that will not undermine our efforts to contain costs. I want to thank Senator Gregg for his thoughtful contributions and his willingness to work with me, Senator Bennett and our bipartisan group. It's our plan to work closely with our leaders--Chairman Baucus, Ranking Member Grassley, Chairman Kennedy, and Ranking Member Enzi--to end 60 years of gridlock.
