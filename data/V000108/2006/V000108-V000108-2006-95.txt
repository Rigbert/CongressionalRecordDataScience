Speaker, it is my distinct pleasure to honor my good friend Mr. W.F. ``Bill'' Wellman for his illustrious career and innumerable contributions to his native Northwest Indiana community. With a life of such diverse experiences and a career that has taken countless turns, it is hard to sum up the life of Bill Wellman without the word ``entertainer.'' I am proud to call Bill a friend, and I am pleased to have the opportunity to congratulate him on his new autobiography, ``It's Made to Sell--Not to Drink!'' I am truly impressed by this self-published work that covers a fascinating life of eight decades.  Bill was born in LaPorte, Indiana, and his career has taken him around the world. He grew up learning the service industry from his father, Guy Wellman, Sr., who opened a barin Valparaiso, Indiana after earning a worthy reputation during Prohibition. Bill tended bar and learned many life lessons from his father and their patrons. In fact, his book's title, ``It's Made to Sell--Not to Drink!'' is in reference to the libations served at ``The Club.'' As a young man, Bill joined the United States Marine Corps, where he served during World War II. Both his Hoosier boyhood and military exploits are featured prominently in his autobiography as important formative influences on his life.  Fortunately, Bill's strong Hoosier roots brought him back, where his career has flourished in the hospitality industry. After World War II, Bill set his sights on the Valparaiso area, where he helped establish The Corral bar in 1948 and Wellman's Restaurant in 1958, to which he later added a bowling alley. Subsequently, his stewardship over the Holiday Inn in Valparaiso led to an expansion that included a restaurant and outdoor theater, which came to be known as the Bridge VU. Here, Bill hosted such stars as Dolly Parton, The Oak Ridge Boys, Victor Borge, Duke Ellington, and many others. It was this venture that inspired his signature project, the 3,400 seat Star Plaza Theater, which remains today as a prominent entertainment complex and tourist attraction in Merrillville, Indiana.  While Bill's numerous business ventures have provided quality entertainment, award-winning food, and many jobs for those in Northwest Indiana, he has gone further than most to make the region a more attractive destination. Bill is one of the original founders and a Past President of the Northwest Indiana Tourism Council, and is a Past President of the Lake County Convention and Visitors Bureau. In 1986, he was named the Indiana Ambassador of Tourism, and for many years he served as President of the Indiana Travel and Tourism Association. It is through Bill's service to these and other organizations that Northwest Indiana truly benefits from his wealth of knowledge.  At age 82, Bill maintains a busy schedule, giving back to his community through various local organizations and holding a demanding post as Senior Vice President of Communications for Whiteco Industries, where he has worked since 1976. In fact, his early years at Whiteco were devoted to design and development of the Star Plaza Theater, which his firm now owns and manages. A testament to his work ethic and passion, Bill has shrugged off retirement and relishes each day at work. However, Bill's most enjoyable time is spent with his wife, three children, and five grandchildren.  Mr. Speaker, Bill Wellman's eye for entertainment has added a spark to the lives of thousands of Hoosiers and visitors from around the United States. His commitment to improving the quality of life for the people of the First Congressional District of Indiana should be recognized and celebrated. At this time, I ask that you and all of my distinguished colleagues join me in commending my friend, Bill Wellman, for his lifetime of enthusiatstic service to Northwest Indiana.                          ____________________
