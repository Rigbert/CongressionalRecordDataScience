 Paul):  S. 1179. A bill to exempt the aging process of distilled spirits from the production period for purposes of capitalization of interest costs; to the Committee on Finance.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this past Saturday, May 2, saw the running of the 141st Kentucky Derby, the most exciting 2 minutes in sports. Derby day is a cause for celebration across the State and derby celebrations often feature Kentucky's native spirit of bourbon. Bourbon is a key ingredient in the legendary Mint Julep, the official drink of the derby. Fittingly, today marks the 51st anniversary of the original congressional bourbon resolution that designated bourbon as a distinctive product of America.  Kentucky is the birthplace of bourbon. The drink is named for Bourbon County, KY, where the product first emerged, and today Kentucky produces 95 percent of the world's supply. The bourbon industry generates 15,400 jobs with an annual payroll of $707 million statewide. It is a $3 billion industry in Kentucky and a vital part of the State's tourism and economy. Simply put, the bourbon industry is a signature industry for the Commonwealth of Kentucky.  That is why the legislation I introduce today is so important. I rise to introduce the Advancing Growth in the Economy through Distilled Spirits Act, or the AGED Spirits Act. Cosponsored by my friend Senator Rand Paul, it will correct a provision in the tax code to ensure that Kentucky's bourbon producers are no longer at a disadvantage with their global competitors.  Under current law, unlike most other spirits, bourbon, and whiskey producers in America must capitalize the interest expense incurred to finance inventories, and it is not deductible until the product is sold, which could be as long as 23 years after a lengthy aging process.  In the United Kingdom, however, all spirit producers are permitted to deduct interest expense the year it is capitalized. This discrepancy is harmful to American makers of distilled spirits as it contributes to increased costs that directly create a competitive disadvantage for American products in the global marketplace.  My bill would fix this discrepancy by permitting American bourbon and whiskey producers to deduct interestexpense associated with production in the year it is paid by exempting the natural aging process in the determination of the production period for distilled spirits. This legislation will not only put Kentucky's bourbon industry on a level playing field with its global competitors, it is also a pro-growth measure that will help provide a boost to our economy and help create jobs in Kentucky.  Making this change in law is a matter of common sense. The situation under current law, where American bourbon and whiskey producers are not allowed to deduct the expenses related to storing and aging their product until it is bottled and sold, is akin to a homeowner not being able to deduct the interest on a home mortgage until the sale of the house.  Over the last several years, high-end premium American bourbons and whiskeys have enjoyed significant growth in volume both here in the U.S. and in international markets. Bourbon production has increased more than 150 percent since 1999. Given equitable tax treatment, American bourbon and whiskey products, as well as related jobs, could grow even more. Finally, this problem reveals just one of the many flaws in our Nation's broken tax code, which ultimately needs to be comprehensively reformed to promote even greater job creation and economic growth in our country.  So I hope my colleagues will join me in advancing growth in Kentucky's and America's economy by leveling the tax playing field for America's distilled spirits. Fifty-one years after its official recognition, bourbon is responsibly enjoyed by adults all over the world, and not just on Derby Day. The industry has grown and thrived, and I am sure it will continue to do so. I want to thank and congratulate all the hard-working Kentuckians who have contributed to building our State's vibrant bourbon industry.  I urge my colleagues to support the AGED Spirits Act, and I look forward to its swift passage.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1179       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
